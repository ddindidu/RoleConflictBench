They always ask if I\u2019m keeping out of trouble, and I always promise I am. Today, though, I\u2019m not at home. I\u2019m standing in a crowd, the air thick with chants and banners. We\u2019re protesting for something I believe in deeply. Suddenly, someone beside me urges, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s cross the barricade! We need to make our voices heard.\u201d I freeze. The barricade marks city property we\u2019re not allowed to enter. As a citizen, I know the law and respect for public spaces matter. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my parents, calling for our weekly check-in. I imagine their voices, their worry if they knew where I was. My heart pounds, torn between the promise I made to them and the call to action as a citizen. I grip my phone, caught between answering my parents and joining the others, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
