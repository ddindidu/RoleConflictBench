She\u2019d been distant all week, and tonight, I finally found the courage to ask, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Her eyes filled with tears, and she started to open up about the stress at her job, the pressure she felt, and how alone she\u2019d been feeling. I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone in this.\n\nBut as she spoke, I glanced at the clock. The polls would close in less than an hour, and I still hadn\u2019t found my ID. This was my only chance to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d do, a responsibility I believed in. My mind raced\u2014should I keep searching for my ID and risk leaving her alone in this vulnerable moment, or stay and listen, possibly giving up my right to vote this year? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
