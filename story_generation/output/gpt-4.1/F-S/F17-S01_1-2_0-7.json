Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at it, feeling a familiar tug of guilt. I haven\u2019t checked in since Thursday, and I know my parents worry if I go too long without reaching out. But I\u2019m standing in the middle of the community center, wearing my volunteer badge, listening as the coordinator reminds us\u2014again\u2014about the new safety procedures. \u201cNo exceptions,\u201d she says, her eyes sweeping over us. \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s full attention and compliance.\u201d\n\nI nod, but my mind drifts to my phone. I could sneak away for a quick call, just to reassure my parents. But the coordinator is watching, and I know we\u2019re supposed to be fully present, especially with the new rules in place. My parents expect me to stay connected, to show I care. The coordinator expects me to be responsible, to set an example. I feel the pressure building inside me, torn between the urge to step outside and call home, and the duty to stay focused and follow the guidelines. My phone vibrates again, and I freeze, caught between two worlds."}
