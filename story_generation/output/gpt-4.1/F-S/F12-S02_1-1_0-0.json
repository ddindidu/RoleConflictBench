He tells me about his day, the way his boss snapped at him over a minor mistake, and I can see the disappointment flicker in his eyes. I know he needs me to listen, to reassure him, to be present. My phone buzzes on the counter. I glance at the screen\u2014it's a message from Maya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s at the demonstration downtown, live-streaming the small crowd, her text urgent: \u201cIf you\u2019re free, we need more people. The turnout is low.\u201d My heart pounds.
