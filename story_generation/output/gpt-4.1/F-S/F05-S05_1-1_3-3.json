My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014her gentle reminder this morning that we both promised to share the chores, that she\u2019s been carrying more than her share lately. I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight. But my phone buzzes, and I see a message from the office: a client\u2019s minor hearing has been moved up to this evening. It\u2019s not a high-stakes case, but I know my presence matters. I\u2019m their advocate, and they expect me to show up, to fight for them, no matter how small the battle. My chest tightens as I glance between the laundry and my briefcase. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. If I leave, I let my wife down again. If I stay, I risk my client\u2019s trust. The weight of both roles presses in, and I feel myself pulled apart by the expectations of the people who need me most."}
