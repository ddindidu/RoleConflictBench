He\u2019d been wrestling with a difficult choice at work, and as his wife, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to help him find clarity. He asked if we could play some of his favorite music, something to lift his spirits and help him think. I wanted to say yes, to create a warm, supportive space for him. But as I reached for the speaker, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours had just begun. Our neighbor\u2019s windows were open, and I could hear the faint clatter of dishes from their kitchen. As a responsible citizen, I was expected to respect the rules and the peace of those around me. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to comfort my husband, and the duty to honor the rights of my neighbors. I hesitated, caught between the warmth of our living room and the silent, expectant hush of the building outside."}
