My spouse is bustling around, dusting shelves and fluffing pillows, her voice echoing from the living room, \u201cCan you vacuum after the dishes? They\u2019ll be here in two hours!\u201d The house must be spotless\u2014her parents are visiting, and she\u2019s counting on me to help make a good impression. I nod, but my phone buzzes on the counter. It\u2019s a message from Maya, a fellow activist: \u201cWe\u2019re at City Hall now. Only a handful of us. Can you come? We need more voices.\u201d I stare at the screen, heart pounding. The protest is about housing rights, something I care deeply about. I know my presence could make a difference, and Maya is counting on me. But here, my partner is relying on me too, expecting me to share the load, to be present, to care about our home and her family. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my hands trembling as I dry them, torn between the call to action outside and the call to partnership within these walls."}
