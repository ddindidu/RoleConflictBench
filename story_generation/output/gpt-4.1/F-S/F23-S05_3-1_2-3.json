As a step-parent, I knew I should be inside, talking to the principal about the incident\u2014my stepson had been caught bullying another child. The school expected me to show up, to be present, to help guide him through this. But as an advocate, I had a client waiting at the courthouse, counting on me to represent them, even if the hearing was minor. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: my stepson needed to see I cared, that I would stand by him even when he made mistakes, but my client deserved my full attention and expertise. I could feel the pressure building, the sense that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the school doors and the courthouse, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
