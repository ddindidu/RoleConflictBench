The case had taken a complicated turn, and she needed my guidance\u2014now, not later. I glanced at the clock. In half an hour, my family would gather in the living room to begin our annual holiday tradition, one my mother cherished and expected me to uphold. She\u2019d already reminded me twice this week: \u201cFamily comes first, especially during the holidays.\u201d But my client\u2019s message was urgent, and as her advocate, I was expected to provide clear, timely advice. My laptop sat open, legal documents scattered beside the holiday cookies my sister had baked. I could hear laughter from the next room, the familiar warmth of home pulling me in one direction, while the weight of my professional responsibility tugged me in another. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the family I loved and the client who depended on me."}
