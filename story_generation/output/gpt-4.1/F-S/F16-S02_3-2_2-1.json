I really need you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the march begins. The crowd outside is swelling, banners raised, eyes searching for me. I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, the one that sets the tone, the one everyone expects from me. My fellow activists are counting on my voice, my presence, my energy. But Jamie\u2019s words echo in my mind. Lately, they\u2019ve been unraveling, barely holding it together, and I promised I\u2019d be there, no matter what. I can picture them on the couch, clutching a pillow, waiting for me to walk through the door and just listen. My heart pounds with guilt and frustration. I want to be everywhere at once, to not let anyone down. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I stand frozen, torn between the rallying cries outside and the silent plea from home."}
