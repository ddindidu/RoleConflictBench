It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew my son had been struggling lately, but I hadn\u2019t realized things had gotten so serious. As a grandparent, I\u2019ve always prided myself on being the steady hand, the one everyone can count on for comfort and advice. I wanted to call her right away, to listen, to help, to be there for my family in this crisis.\n\nBut then I glanced at the clock. My volunteer shift at the community center starts in twenty minutes, and I\u2019m the only one with the keys. People\u2014some of them elderly, some with nowhere else to go\u2014will already be waiting outside. If I\u2019m late, the doors stay locked, and the service doesn\u2019t start. They count on me, too.\n\nI stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, keys in the other, torn between the voices of my family and the silent expectation of those waiting at the center. My chest tightened as I weighed who needed me more, feeling the pull of both worlds and the ache of not being able to give myself fully to either."}
