We\u2019d come to the demonstration together, both believing in the cause, but I could feel the weight of our earlier conversation still pressing on my chest. At breakfast, he\u2019d asked about the medical bills, about the savings I\u2019d quietly dipped into. I\u2019d promised to be honest, to communicate openly, but the words had tangled in my throat. Now, as chants rose and someone urged us to step past the barricade, I felt another kind of pressure. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear\u2014crossing that line meant trespassing, disrespecting public property, risking arrest. But the crowd\u2019s urgency was infectious, and my husband looked at me, searching for trust, for unity. I wanted to be the partner he needed, to stand with him in every way, but I also felt the pull of my responsibility to the city, to the rules that kept order. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations of honesty and loyalty at home, and the duty to respect the boundaries set for all of us."}
