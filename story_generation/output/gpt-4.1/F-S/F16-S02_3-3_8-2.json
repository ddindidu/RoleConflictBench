My partner sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to respond to the question I\u2019d been avoiding all week: \u201cAre we really okay with this new loan? Can we handle it if something goes wrong?\u201d I knew I owed them honesty, that we needed to talk through every detail, every fear, and every hope. But as I opened my mouth to answer, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time with a message from the protest group. The police had started blocking the exits, and panic was spreading. I was supposed to be the one who kept everyone calm, who coordinated the safe exit plan. My partner\u2019s voice was gentle but urgent, \u201cPlease, I need you to be here with me.\u201d At the same time, my activist friends needed me to be present, to lead. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the person I loved and the cause I believed in, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding all of me at once."}
