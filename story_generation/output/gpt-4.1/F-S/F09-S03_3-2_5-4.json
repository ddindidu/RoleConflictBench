It was streaming live, and I wanted to ask a question about school funding\u2014something I felt strongly about as a citizen. Suddenly, the store manager approached, holding my son by the hand. My heart dropped when I saw the crumpled snack wrapper in his fist. He\u2019d taken it without paying. The manager looked at me expectantly, waiting for my response. I knew I had to teach my son about honesty and consequences, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the forum was starting, and I had a chance to make my voice heard for our community. I felt torn, the weight of my responsibilities pressing in from both sides. My son\u2019s wide, anxious eyes pleaded for comfort, while my civic duty called from the screen in my pocket. I stood there, caught between the lesson my child needed and the role my community expected me to play, my heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do first."}
