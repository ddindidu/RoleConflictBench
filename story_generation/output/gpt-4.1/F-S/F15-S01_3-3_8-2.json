The home loan repayment loomed over me like a shadow, just two months away. I needed to pick up extra shifts at work, maybe even take on a side job, to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. My family depended on me for stability, and I couldn\u2019t let them down. But today was also my volunteer day. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center, and people would be waiting outside, counting on me to start the morning service. I glanced at the clock, calculating if I could squeeze in a few hours of overtime before heading to the center, but I knew I\u2019d be late. The thought of those people waiting, disappointed, made my stomach twist. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me to be responsible, but so did the community. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest as I stood in the kitchen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, paralyzed by the choice I had to make."}
