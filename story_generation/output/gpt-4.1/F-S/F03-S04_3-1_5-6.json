My mother\u2019s voice from earlier that morning still rang in my ears, reminding me how important it was to lead the family prayer at tonight\u2019s ceremony\u2014just as my father and grandfather had done. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to keep our tradition alive,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with pride and expectation.\n\nBut now, as a voter, I faced a different demand. The election official\u2019s announcement was clear: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d I hesitated. The original line, the one I\u2019d been waiting in, was moving much faster. If I stayed, I could get home sooner, prepare, and not let my family down. But the official\u2019s instruction was direct, and I knew the importance of following the rules, of respecting the process.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the pressure of honoring my family\u2019s trust against my duty as a responsible citizen. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding loyalty, and I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of son and voter."}
