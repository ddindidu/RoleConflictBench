It was a minor case, but as an advocate, I owed them my full attention and best effort. My phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother, waiting for me across the street, waved impatiently. He was always in a rush, never pausing to check for traffic. I saw him step off the curb, eyes glued to his phone, oblivious to the car speeding around the corner. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, but I was already late for the hearing. If I shouted, I\u2019d draw attention, maybe even disrupt the proceedings inside. If I ran to him, I\u2019d abandon my client, betraying their trust. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My feet felt rooted to the spot, torn between the courtroom and the crosswalk, my mind racing with the impossible choice."}
