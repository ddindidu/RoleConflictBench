She trusted me, her voice trembling as she shared details she hadn\u2019t told anyone else. I nodded, promising her privacy, feeling the weight of her words settle in my chest. Later that evening, my family gathered for our holiday dinner, a tradition I was expected to honor by sharing stories and connecting with relatives. My mother, always eager for news, asked about my volunteering. \u201cDid anything interesting happen today?\u201d she pressed, expecting me to open up, as our family values honesty and openness. I could see everyone\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for a story, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s secret echoed in my mind. I felt torn\u2014caught between my family\u2019s expectation to share and the promise I\u2019d made to protect someone\u2019s trust. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, feeling the pressure from both sides, unsure which role I could truly fulfill."}
