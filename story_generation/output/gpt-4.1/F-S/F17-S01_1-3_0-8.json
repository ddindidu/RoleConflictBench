I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from Mom, just checking in, asking how my weekend was going. I knew she worried when I didn\u2019t reply quickly, especially since I\u2019d promised to keep in touch more often. But just as I started to type a response, the volunteer coordinator\u2019s voice echoed through the room, sharp and urgent. \u201cEveryone, please listen! We have new procedures that must be followed immediately. If we don\u2019t comply, we risk being shut down today.\u201d She handed out printed instructions, her eyes scanning the room for understanding. My hands trembled as I held my phone and the paper, feeling the weight of both expectations. I wanted to reassure my parents, to be the attentive child they hoped for, but I also knew the importance of following every step the coordinator outlined. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the need to send a quick message home and the pressure to focus entirely on the critical volunteer task at hand."}
