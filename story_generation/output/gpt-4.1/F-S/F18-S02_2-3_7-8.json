He\u2019s been talking about this new skateboard trick for weeks, and I promised Mom I\u2019d keep him safe. But then I see the caller ID\u2014Channel 7 News. My heart jumps. They want me on air, now, to set the record straight about our climate campaign before the misinformation spreads further. I know how much this moment matters for our movement; I\u2019ve been waiting for a chance like this. But my brother is already rolling toward the ramp, and I can see the nerves in his posture. If I step away to take the call, I won\u2019t be there if he falls. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the chance to reach thousands, maybe change minds. My hands shake as I weigh the phone in my palm, torn between the world that needs my voice and the brother who needs my eyes."}
