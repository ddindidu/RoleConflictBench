She\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating, and she was torn. She needed me\u2014my advice, my encouragement, my unwavering support. I reached for her hand, ready to listen, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the community center where I volunteer. One of the regulars, someone I\u2019d chatted with earlier, was upset that I\u2019d mentioned their name in a harmless story. I hadn\u2019t shared anything sensitive, but now I was second-guessing myself, wondering if I\u2019d crossed a line. My wife\u2019s voice pulled me back. She needed me present, but my mind was tangled in guilt and worry about betraying someone\u2019s trust. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s expectation for comfort, the center\u2019s demand for confidentiality. My heart pounded as I tried to be everything to everyone, but I could feel myself being stretched thin, unsure which need to answer first."}
