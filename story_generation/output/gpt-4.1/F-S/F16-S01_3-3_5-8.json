I knew how much the community depended on us, and I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. But as I got out of bed, I saw my spouse already bustling around the kitchen, a list of chores on the counter. \u201cWe need to get everything ready before your family arrives,\u201d they said, handing me a broom. The house was a mess, and every room needed attention. I could see the stress in their eyes, and I knew how important it was to present a welcoming home. Torn between the urgent call from the coordinator and my spouse\u2019s expectation to share the load, I felt my chest tighten. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I stood in the hallway, broom in one hand, phone in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
