Our family holiday trip was a tradition, and I knew how much it meant to my parents and siblings. They expected me to join in, to laugh and share stories, to be present. But as I scrolled through my emails, the city newsletter caught my eye. The survey about the new bus routes was open for just a few more days, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate\u2014being an active citizen mattered to me. The city needed feedback from people like me, people who actually used the buses. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations on one side and my sense of civic duty on the other. My mind raced with questions: If I left for the trip, would I miss my chance to give input? If I stayed to complete the survey, would my family feel let down? My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both demands at once."}
