We need clean clothes for the kids\u2019 activities tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d take care of it, and I could already picture the disappointment on her face if I let it slip again. But I also had my mail-in ballot in the other hand, ready to drop it off at the polling station on my way to the laundry room. \n\nAt the polling station, a poll worker inspected my envelope and frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your signature smudged. Could you please re-sign it so your vote counts?\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the clock. If I took too long, I\u2019d miss my window to get the laundry done before the kids got home. But the poll worker\u2019s expectant look reminded me how important it was to follow every instruction to ensure my vote wasn\u2019t rejected. \n\nI felt torn, caught between my promise to my wife and my duty as a voter, both demanding my attention at the same moment. My heart pounded as I weighed which responsibility to honor first."}
