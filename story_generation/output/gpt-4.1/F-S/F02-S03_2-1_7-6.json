As a father, I felt the weight of every dollar\u2014groceries, rent, her school shoes. I\u2019d been careful, setting aside money for our needs, but it was never quite enough. Now, with tax season approaching, I\u2019d finally organized all the documents, determined to file early and avoid penalties. That refund could help us breathe a little easier.\n\nBut then, the flyer arrived: a free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. As a citizen, I knew how important it was to support public health, especially after last winter\u2019s outbreak. They needed volunteers, and I had the skills to help. Yet, volunteering meant losing hours at my second job\u2014the one that kept food on our table. My mind spun with the expectations: be a responsible father, provide for my family; be a good citizen, help my community. I stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure build, torn between the needs of my family and the call to serve others."}
