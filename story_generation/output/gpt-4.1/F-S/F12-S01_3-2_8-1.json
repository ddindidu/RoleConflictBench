My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to respond to his question about our finances. He wanted honesty, openness\u2014he needed to know if we could afford the medical procedure his doctor recommended. I could see the worry in his eyes, and I knew this conversation couldn\u2019t be rushed or brushed aside. But the volunteer coordinator had sent a group message this morning, stressing how important it was for everyone to be on time today. The shelter was short-staffed, and every minute counted for the people waiting outside. My heart pounded as I glanced between the clock and my husband. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be the reliable volunteer they counted on, but I also needed to be the honest, supportive wife my husband deserved. The silence stretched, and I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which role to answer first."}
