I glance at the kitchen table, where my daughter\u2019s homework is spread out next to a stack of unpaid bills. The fridge is nearly empty, and I know the rent is due next week. As a mother, I feel the weight of every dollar we don\u2019t have, the pressure to keep the lights on and food on the table. But as an activist, I know how important this interview is\u2014an opportunity to reach thousands, to educate and inspire, to fight for a better future not just for my family, but for so many others. My daughter tugs at my sleeve, asking if I\u2019ll help her with her math. My heart aches. I want to be present for her, to find a way to earn more, to make sure she never feels the anxiety I do. But the radio host is waiting, and my community is counting on my voice. I stand in the hallway, torn, the phone in my hand, the clock ticking down."}
