The groceries are still in the car, and the polling station closes in less than two hours. As I unload the bags, my husband calls me into the living room. His face is serious\u2014he wants to talk about the medical bills that have been piling up. We promised each other honesty, no matter how uncomfortable. I know he expects me to sit down, listen, and share my worries too. But my mind keeps drifting to the voting slip on the fridge. I\u2019ve always believed in doing my civic duty, and missing the chance to vote feels unthinkable. Yet, if I rush through this conversation or cut it short, I\u2019ll be breaking the trust we\u2019ve built. If I stay, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, standing in the hallway, keys in one hand and the voting slip in the other, unsure which role to honor first."}
