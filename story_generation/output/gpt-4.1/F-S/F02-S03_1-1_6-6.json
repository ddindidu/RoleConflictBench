He\u2019d been saving his allowance, but the rest was up to me. I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up, to be the father who provides not just the basics, but a little joy. But as I glanced at the stack of tax documents I\u2019d organized, I remembered the community vaccine clinic this weekend. They needed volunteers, and I\u2019d always believed in doing my part\u2014helping out, making sure our neighborhood stayed safe and healthy. The Nintendo would take a chunk out of our budget, and volunteering would mean less time to work extra hours. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to give my son what he wanted, and the responsibility to support my community. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the duty I felt as a citizen."}
