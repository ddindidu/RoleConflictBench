My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about her husband\u2019s sudden job loss and the strain it was putting on their marriage. As a grandmother, I knew I should be there for her, offering comfort, checking in on the kids, making sure they felt safe. My family needed me, and I felt the weight of their expectation to be the steady presence I\u2019d always promised.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind kept drifting to the thick stack of files on my desk. Tomorrow was my client\u2019s trial\u2014a case that could change the course of his life. He was counting on me to be sharp, focused, and unwavering in court. The hours I\u2019d planned to spend preparing suddenly seemed impossible to find. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent needs of my family and the professional duty I owed my client. My chest tightened as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
