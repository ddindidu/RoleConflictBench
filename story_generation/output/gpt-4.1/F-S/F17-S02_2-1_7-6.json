The post about our cause is exploding online\u2014hundreds of people are commenting, asking questions, sharing their own stories. I know this is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate and inspire so many at once. My fingers hover over the screen, ready to type out a thoughtful, informative comment that could make a real difference.\n\nBut across the room, I see my parents. They\u2019re moving slowly, faces drawn and voices quiet. Lately, they\u2019ve seemed so tired, weighed down by worries they don\u2019t share. I know they need me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to be present. I can almost feel their silent hope that I\u2019ll close my phone and join them, maybe make them laugh or just remind them they\u2019re not alone.\n\nMy heart pounds as I look from my phone to my parents and back again. I want to be there for them, to give them the comfort they need. But I also feel the pull of responsibility to my cause, to the people waiting for my words. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure from both sides makes my chest ache."}
