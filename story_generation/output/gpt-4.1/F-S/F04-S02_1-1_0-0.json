Can\u2019t wait to celebrate.\u201d He just got a big promotion, and our family is gathering to mark the occasion. I know how much this means to him\u2014he\u2019s always been there for me, cheering me on, and I want to do the same for him. But as I\u2019m getting ready, another notification pops up. It\u2019s from Maya, a fellow activist, live-streaming from a protest downtown. The turnout is small, and she\u2019s asking for more people to join. \u201cIf you\u2019re free, we need you,\u201d she says, her voice urgent. I feel the familiar pull in my chest. My friends are counting on me to stand up for what we believe in, to show solidarity when it matters most. But my brother is counting on me, too, to be present for him, to celebrate his success. I stare at my phone, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
