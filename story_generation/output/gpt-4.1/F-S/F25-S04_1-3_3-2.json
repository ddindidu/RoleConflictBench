The living room is filled with laughter and the scent of my stepmother\u2019s famous roast. It\u2019s the annual family holiday dinner, and everyone expects me to join in the toast, just like every year. My stepfather catches my eye, nodding toward the table, silently reminding me that being present is part of being family. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, to have my voice heard, to do my civic duty. My stepmother\u2019s voice floats over, \u201cWe\u2019re about to start, don\u2019t disappear!\u201d I feel the weight of their expectations\u2014don\u2019t let the family down, don\u2019t break tradition. But the clock ticks louder, and I know if I leave now, I might just make it to the polls. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote. My hands tremble as I stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of family and the call of responsibility, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
