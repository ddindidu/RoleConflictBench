My daughter had called twice already, reminding me how much the grandchildren were looking forward to baking cookies together. I could almost hear their laughter echoing through the kitchen. But as I reached for my coat, my phone buzzed again. It was a client, her voice trembling as she explained the urgent legal issue threatening her home. She needed my advice\u2014now, not tomorrow. I could sense the weight of her trust in me, the expectation that I would guide her through this crisis with clarity and care. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family waiting at home, and the responsibility I owed to someone in desperate need. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, torn between the promise of flour-dusted hugs and the duty to provide the counsel that could change a life."}
