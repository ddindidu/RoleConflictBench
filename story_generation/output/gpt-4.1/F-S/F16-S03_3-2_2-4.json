As a citizen, I\u2019ve always believed in being informed, in showing up, in making my voice count. The forum is streaming now, and I know how important it is to listen, to ask questions, to help shape the future of our community. But beside me, my partner\u2019s eyes are red and tired. They\u2019ve barely spoken all day, and when they do, their words tremble with the weight of what they\u2019re going through. I can feel their need for me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my undivided attention. I want to be here, to hold their hand, to reassure them that they\u2019re not alone. Yet, the sense of duty tugs at me, whispering that my responsibilities extend beyond these walls. My heart aches as I wrestle with the impossible choice: to be the spouse my partner needs right now, or the citizen my community expects me to be."}
