Dad barely spoke at dinner, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort\u2014just as they had always done for me. But outside, the city was alive with voices demanding change, and I felt the pull of my responsibility as a citizen. At the demonstration, the crowd surged forward, and someone grabbed my arm, urging me to cross the barricade. \u201cWe have to show them we won\u2019t be ignored,\u201d they said. I hesitated, torn. I wanted to stand up for what I believed in, to be part of something bigger, but I also knew the law was clear\u2014crossing that line meant breaking it. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a message from Mom, asking if I\u2019d be home soon. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the need to support my family and the call to act as a responsible citizen."}
