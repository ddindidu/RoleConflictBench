The protest is about to start, and I promised to lead the first chant. My heart pounds with urgency; this march is months in the making, and my voice is needed at the front. But right now, I\u2019m in the supermarket, chasing after my stepson, Max, who is darting between aisles, giggling as he knocks over a display of apples. Other shoppers stare, some with annoyance, some with pity. I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and calmly teach him about respect and discipline\u2014what it means to be considerate in public spaces. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does. But my mind is split, tugged by the weight of my activist commitment and the responsibility to guide Max. I feel the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding my presence for a cause bigger than myself, the other needing my patience and guidance in this small, chaotic moment. My hands tremble as I reach for Max, torn between the expectations pressing in from every side."}
