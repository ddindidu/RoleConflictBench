The message was from my stepdad: \u201cHey, haven\u2019t heard from you in a while. Hope you\u2019re okay. Can you call us this weekend?\u201d I stared at the screen, guilt prickling at my chest. I knew how much it meant to my parents that I checked in, especially since I moved out. But the volunteer coordinator had just sent a group text, reminding us that the shelter was short-staffed and every minute counted. \u201cPlease be on time\u2014doors open at 9 sharp,\u201d she wrote. I glanced at the clock. If I called my parents now, I\u2019d be late. If I waited until after my shift, I\u2019d be breaking my promise to keep in touch. My thumb hovered over the call button, my mind torn between the family that wanted to hear my voice and the people counting on me to show up."}
