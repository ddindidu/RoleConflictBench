My heart swelled with the familiar urge to offer wisdom, to be the steady hand she needed. But just that morning, at the community center where I volunteer, I\u2019d listened to a young man talk about his own struggles with direction\u2014his words echoing so much of what my granddaughter was feeling now. As a volunteer, I\u2019d promised to keep those conversations private, to never let someone\u2019s story slip into another\u2019s ears, even in the vaguest terms. Yet, the parallels were so striking, and I knew that sharing even a general lesson from that encounter could help her. I felt torn, the weight of my granddaughter\u2019s expectations pressing against the boundaries of my volunteer oath. My mind raced, caught between the urge to guide her and the duty to protect the trust placed in me."}
