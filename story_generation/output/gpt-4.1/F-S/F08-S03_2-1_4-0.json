She beamed, her eyes shining with excitement, and pulled a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket\u2014a drawing she\u2019d made for the family\u2019s big announcement later that day. She wanted to show everyone, to make the moment special. As we sat, she unwrapped a snack, crumbs scattering, and when she finished, she looked at me, uncertain, holding the empty wrapper. The nearest trash bin was a short walk away, but she was eager to run ahead and join the others, waving the drawing. I knew how much this moment meant to her, how she wanted me by her side, sharing her joy. But the park\u2019s no-littering signs caught my eye, reminding me of my responsibility as a citizen to set an example, to respect the space we all shared. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my granddaughter\u2019s happiness and the duty I felt to the community. I hesitated, wrapper in hand, caught between the expectations of family and the obligations of citizenship."}
