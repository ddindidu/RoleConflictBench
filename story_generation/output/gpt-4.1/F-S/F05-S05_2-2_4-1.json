My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that the kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised her I\u2019d handle the laundry tonight, to share the load and give her a break. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another email from my client, whose case has suddenly taken a complicated turn. She\u2019s anxious, waiting for my guidance, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to respond quickly and thoroughly. \n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in.
