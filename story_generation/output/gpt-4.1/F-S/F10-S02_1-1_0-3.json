Call when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Sunday evening already. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, and guilt prickles at me. I know how much it means to my parents to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to feel connected even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes. But as I open my messages, another notification pops up: the activist group I volunteer with is about to send a crucial petition to our state senator. They need one more signature\u2014mine could make a difference. The deadline is in ten minutes. My thumb hovers between the call button and the petition link. I can almost hear Mom\u2019s voice, warm and expectant, but I also feel the weight of the cause pressing on me, the urgency of the moment. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the choice, torn between being the daughter my parents hope for and the activist I promised myself I\u2019d be."}
