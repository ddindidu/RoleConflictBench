My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days to his birthday, certain I\u2019d keep my promise to buy him the Nintendo he\u2019d been dreaming of. But the numbers in my bank account told a different story. As a father, I wanted to give him everything, to see his face light up with joy, but I also knew I had to keep our finances steady.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with another email from a client. Their case, once straightforward, had become a tangled web of legal questions. They needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my expertise, and my time. As their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, thorough advice, to guide them through uncertainty. But every hour I spent on their case was an hour away from my family, and the extra work meant less time to find a way to afford that Nintendo.\n\nI felt torn, pulled in two directions by promises and responsibilities, unsure how to meet the demands of both the father my son needed and the advocate my client depended on."}
