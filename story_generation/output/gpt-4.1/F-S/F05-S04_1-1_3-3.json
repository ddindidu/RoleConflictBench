My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But now, as I reach for a shirt, my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget your ID for voting.\u201d Today\u2019s the last day to cast my ballot, and I know how important it is\u2014not just for me, but for the issues we care about. I check my wallet and realize my driver\u2019s license is missing. I could use my passport, but it\u2019s at my parents\u2019 house across town. I could go get it later, but that means the laundry will sit here even longer, and I can already imagine the disappointment in my wife\u2019s eyes. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be a responsible partner at home, and a responsible citizen in the world. My hands hover over the laundry, my mind racing, caught between the weight of my promises and the urgency of my civic duty."}
