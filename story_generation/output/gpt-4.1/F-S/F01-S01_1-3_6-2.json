I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces and the laughter that always fills the house. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the community center coordinator. \u201cPlease remember, you\u2019re the only one with keys tomorrow. People will be waiting.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expects me to be present, to keep our tradition alive. The people at the center, many with nowhere else to go, count on me to open the doors and start the day. I could already imagine the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s voice if I missed breakfast, and the anxious faces of those waiting outside the locked facility. My heart tugged in both directions, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility I\u2019d promised to uphold."}
