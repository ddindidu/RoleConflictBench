I knew how important it was to give feedback\u2014our neighborhood had been asking for better service for years, and now was my chance to speak up as a responsible citizen. Just as I started to fill in the first question, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her face pale and eyes troubled. She hesitated, then asked if we could talk. She needed advice, she said, about something serious at school\u2014something she didn\u2019t want to share with her parents yet. I could see how much she needed me, how much she trusted me to listen and guide her. But the survey deadline was tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d finally participate, do my part for the community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, the expectations of my family and my city pulling me in different directions. My heart ached as I looked from her anxious face to the waiting survey, torn between the wisdom I owed my granddaughter and the civic duty I owed my neighbors."}
