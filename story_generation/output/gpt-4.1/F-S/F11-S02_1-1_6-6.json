My sister calls from the hallway, \u201cAre you ready? Everyone\u2019s waiting for us!\u201d We\u2019d planned this outing for weeks\u2014a rare chance to spend time together, just the two of us and some friends. I know how much it means to her that I show up, that I make her feel included and important. But as I grab my jacket, I see my phone screen light up again. The post about our cause is exploding online. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate thousands, maybe more, if I just add the right comment now. My activist friends are tagging me, urging me to respond before the momentum fades. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my sister\u2019s hopeful voice, the urgent pings from my activist group. I want to be present for her, to build the trust we\u2019ve worked so hard for, but I also feel the responsibility to my cause, to the people counting on me to speak up. My heart pounds as I stand in the doorway, torn between two calls I can\u2019t ignore."}
