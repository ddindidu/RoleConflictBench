She\u2019d been asking me to join them more often, saying it would mean a lot if I made an effort to be part of her world. I wanted to show her I respected her life as much as she tried to understand mine. But as I was about to leave, shouts rippled through the crowd. Police had started blocking the exits, and panic was spreading. My phone buzzed\u2014my sister, asking if I was on my way. I could almost hear her disappointment if I bailed again. But as an organizer, people were looking to me for guidance, waiting for instructions to stay safe. My heart pounded. I felt torn in two\u2014my sister\u2019s trust on one side, the safety of my fellow activists on the other. I stared at my phone, caught between the promise I\u2019d made and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
