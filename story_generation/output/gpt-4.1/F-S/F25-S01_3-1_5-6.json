But as I glanced at the clock, my stepmother\u2019s voice rang out from downstairs, reminding me that tonight was the family\u2019s annual remembrance ceremony. This year, she wanted me to lead the ritual, to show I was truly part of the family and could honor their traditions. I could feel the weight of her expectations\u2014her hope that I\u2019d finally step up, her unspoken need for me to bridge the gap between old and new.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked between the email and the family heirlooms laid out for the ceremony. If I left now, I\u2019d have just enough time to reorganize the supplies before the pantry closed, but I\u2019d risk being late for the ceremony. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint the coordinator, maybe even let down the people who depended on the pantry. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, unsure which part of myself I was supposed to honor."}
