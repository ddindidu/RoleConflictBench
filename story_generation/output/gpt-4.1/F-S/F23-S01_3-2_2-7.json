My stepson had been caught bullying another student, and the principal wanted me to come in for a meeting. As his step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up, to be present for him, especially now. I could already hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to support him, to help him learn from his mistake. But just as I was about to call the school, my volunteer coordinator\u2019s email popped up. There was a new set of safety procedures, and she\u2019d made it clear at the last briefing: everyone had to be there early today to review and implement them. No exceptions. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my stepson needed me, but so did the team. If I missed the volunteer shift, I\u2019d be letting them down and possibly putting others at risk. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, torn between being the parent my family needed and the reliable volunteer my community counted on."}
