My stepsister grinned, suggesting a hike and picnic at the lake. My stepmom\u2019s eyes landed on me, hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to join in, to be part of the family, to show I cared. I wanted that too. But in my pocket, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my Saturday morning volunteer shift at the animal shelter. I was supposed to be there at nine sharp, but I knew the others could cover for me if I was a little late. Still, I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be reliable, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down. My family waited for my answer, expecting me to say yes, while my mind raced with guilt and worry. I wanted to belong here, but I also wanted to keep my word. My heart thudded as I tried to figure out which part of me I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
