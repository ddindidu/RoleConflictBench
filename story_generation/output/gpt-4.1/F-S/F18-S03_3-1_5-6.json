My family had been planning this holiday trip for months, and my little sister kept texting me about how excited she was for us all to be together. Mom expected me to help with the preparations and be present for every moment, just like always. But this weekend, the community center was running a free vaccine clinic, and I\u2019d already volunteered to help organize the lines and answer questions. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to support public health, especially since so many neighbors relied on these clinics. I\u2019d also set aside time to organize my tax documents, wanting to be responsible and avoid last-minute stress. The family expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories, but the community needed volunteers, and I knew how important it was to do my part. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself torn, wondering how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations without letting someone down."}
