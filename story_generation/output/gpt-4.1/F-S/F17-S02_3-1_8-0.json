I glanced up at my mom, her eyes red and tired. She had just finished telling me about her worries at work, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cCan you just stay with me for a while?\u201d I could feel the weight of her need for comfort, the way she leaned on me as if I was the only thing holding her together. At the same time, I felt the pull of the protest, the cause I believed in, the friends counting on me to show up and make a difference. My heart pounded as I tried to be present for my mom, but my mind kept drifting to the demonstration, the chants, the hope for change. I wanted to be both the child she needed and the activist I promised to be, but the expectations pressed in from both sides, leaving me frozen, torn between home and the world outside."}
