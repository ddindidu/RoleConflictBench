It\u2019s already late afternoon, and the polling station closes in two hours. I promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014civic duty, my voice, all that. But as I set the milk in the fridge, my spouse leans against the counter, asking, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d It\u2019s the first real chance we\u2019ve had to talk all week. I know they expect me to open up, to share more than just the surface details. I want to be present, to listen and be listened to, to nurture the trust between us. But the minutes tick by, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about the line that might be forming at the polling station, the possibility of not making it in time. I nod and try to focus, but my answers are clipped, my mind split between the warmth of our kitchen and the cold urgency of my civic responsibility. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
