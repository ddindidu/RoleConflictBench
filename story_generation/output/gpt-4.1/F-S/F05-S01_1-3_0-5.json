As I walked through the door, my wife greeted me with a tired smile. She mentioned, almost offhand, that her day at work had been stressful. I could see the tension in her shoulders, the way she lingered in the kitchen, waiting for me to ask, to listen, to be present. I wanted to be there for her, to offer comfort and support, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the stories I\u2019d read, the burdens I couldn\u2019t share. She expected me to be open, to talk about my day, to let her in. But I couldn\u2019t\u2014not without betraying the trust of those I was helping. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the supportive husband she needed and the trustworthy volunteer I\u2019d promised to be. I stood there, caught in the silence, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
