The store manager\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response. My heart pounded with the weight of what I needed to do as a mother\u2014teach him right from wrong, show him that stealing is never acceptable, no matter how small the item. I could see the fear and shame in his eyes, and I wanted to comfort him, but I knew I had to be firm.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I glanced down and saw notifications piling up\u2014my latest post about our community\u2019s clean water campaign was going viral. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, and educate them about our cause. If I didn\u2019t respond now, the momentum might be lost. I felt torn in two, the expectations of motherhood and activism pulling me in opposite directions. My son needed me, but so did my cause. I took a shaky breath, caught between the two worlds, unsure which to choose first."}
