It\u2019s your turn to carry on our tradition,\u201d she said, handing me the ceremonial cloth. I felt the weight of her expectations\u2014this ceremony meant everything to my family, a symbol of our unity and respect for our ancestors. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start the service. My heart pounded as I looked from my mother\u2019s hopeful face to the clock ticking on the wall. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The thought of disappointing my family or letting down the people at the center twisted inside me, leaving me frozen, torn between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
