I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there today, not like last week when I was late. But just as I reached for my keys, my office line rang. It was Mrs. Santos, her voice trembling. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to take my son. I need to know what to do\u2014right now.\u201d She depended on me for answers, for calm, for the right words that could change everything. My mind raced. If I left, I\u2019d let her down in her most desperate moment. If I stayed, my kids would wait, anxious and disappointed, maybe the last ones left. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the two worlds that needed me, both expecting me to show up, both unable to wait."}
