I know how much these calls mean to them, especially since I moved to the city. But tonight, I\u2019m sitting across from a client in a cramped office, her hands twisting nervously as she asks, \u201cWhat should I do next?\u201d As her advocate, I owe her clarity, honesty, and my full attention. She\u2019s counting on me to explain her options, to guide her through the legal maze she\u2019s trapped in. My phone vibrates again\u2014Mom, calling right on schedule. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my parents\u2019 need for connection, my client\u2019s need for answers. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the guilt gnaws at me. I want to be a good daughter, to reassure my parents. I want to be a good advocate, to support my client. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between two voices calling for me, each expecting me to be fully present."}
