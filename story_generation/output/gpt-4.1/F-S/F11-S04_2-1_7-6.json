She was nervous\u2014her first time voting\u2014and I promised to guide her through the process. As sisters, we\u2019d always tried to respect each other\u2019s quirks, and I knew she hated crowds and sudden changes. When the election official announced that voters with last names A\u2013M should move to a new line, my sister\u2019s eyes widened in panic. Our original line was moving quickly, and she whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t we just stay? This is easier for me.\u201d \n\nBut as a voter, I knew I was supposed to follow the officials\u2019 instructions. The rules were clear, and I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble or set a bad example. My sister tugged at my sleeve, pleading silently for understanding. I felt torn\u2014should I be the supportive sister she needed, or the responsible voter who followed the rules? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
