This was my only chance to vote, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let anything get in the way. Just as I rounded the corner, I spotted my younger brother on the opposite curb, distracted by his phone, stepping off the sidewalk toward the busy street. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he was safe. But if I stopped now, I might miss my only chance to vote\u2014something I\u2019d waited years to do. The seconds ticked by, and I felt torn in two, caught between the duty to protect my brother and the responsibility to fulfill my role as a voter. My feet froze, my mind spinning, as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
