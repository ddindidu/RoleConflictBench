It\u2019s your turn to lead the ceremony.\u201d The incense smoke curled around me, heavy with the weight of generations. I knew how much this meant to my parents, how proud they\u2019d be to see me step up and honor our traditions. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there on time, even though I knew the others could cover for a while if I was late. Still, I hated the idea of letting them down, of not being reliable.
