It was one of those rare evenings when all of us\u2014my stepbrother, stepsister, and I\u2014were together, and I knew how much it meant to her. I tried to push aside the awkwardness that sometimes lingered between us, focusing on being present, laughing at my stepbrother\u2019s jokes, and helping my little stepsister with her plate. Just as we sat down, my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. The sirens outside wailed, and I glanced out the window to see water creeping up the street. I remembered the city\u2019s emergency alert: able-bodied citizens should help neighbors evacuate and check on the elderly. My heart pounded. I could see Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor, peering anxiously from her porch. My family looked at me, expecting me to stay, to be part of this rare, fragile togetherness. But the city needed me too. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which call I should answer."}
