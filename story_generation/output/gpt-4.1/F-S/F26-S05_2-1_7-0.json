But my mind was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, a client had called, anxious and confused, asking for clarity about their legal situation. I\u2019d given a general explanation, careful not to overstep, but now they wanted more\u2014specifics, reassurance, the kind of advice that could only come after a thorough review.

My heart ached to be present for my granddaughter, to celebrate her new beginning, but my conscience nagged at me, reminding me of the responsibility I owed to those who trusted me for guidance. I stared at my phone, torn between dialing my granddaughter\u2019s number and returning my client\u2019s call, feeling the tension of two lives pulling me in opposite directions."}
