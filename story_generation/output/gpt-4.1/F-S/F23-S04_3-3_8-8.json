My stomach knots. I\u2019ve been tracking every expense, making sure my stepdaughter has what she needs, and that we don\u2019t fall behind. Every dollar counts, and I promised my partner I\u2019d keep us steady. Now, standing in the crowded polling station, I clutch my ID as the election official frowns. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form before we close in ten minutes.\u201d My mind races. The form is long, and I know I\u2019ll have to call the bank before they close, too, to confirm our payment plan. If I stay and fill out the form, I might miss the call and risk our financial stability. If I leave, I won\u2019t fulfill my duty as a voter, something I\u2019ve always believed in. The official\u2019s eyes are on me, expectant. My phone buzzes again. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
