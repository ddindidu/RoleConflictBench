The principal\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYour child was involved in bullying.\u201d As a father, I knew I had to be present, to show up at the school, talk to the teachers, and help my son understand the gravity of his actions. He needed me to guide him, to listen, and to help him make things right. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw the city newsletter notification. The survey about the new bus routes was closing soon, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate. As a citizen, I believed in being involved, giving feedback, and helping shape our community. Both roles demanded my attention\u2014my son needed me now, but so did my city. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
