As a citizen, I know how important it is to stay informed and participate in civic life. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch the whole thing, take notes, and maybe even submit a question. But just as the forum started, my younger brother stormed into the room, clearly upset. He wanted to talk about a fight he\u2019d had with a friend, and I could see he needed me to listen. As his sister, I\u2019ve always tried to be patient and understanding, to build the kind of mutual respect that means we can count on each other. But now, the demands of being a good citizen and a good sister were pulling me in opposite directions. I felt my chest tighten as I glanced between the livestream and my brother\u2019s anxious face, torn between my responsibility to my community and my responsibility to my family."}
