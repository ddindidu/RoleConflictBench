The vote was happening in less than an hour\u2014a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and now it all came down to one undecided representative. My hands shook as I drafted a message, but then I heard my partner\u2019s voice, soft and uncertain, from the living room. They\u2019d been wrestling with a career-changing decision, and tonight, they needed me\u2014my advice, my reassurance, my presence. I saw the worry in their eyes, the way they reached for my hand. I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to comfort, to be the anchor they could rely on. But the activist in me screamed that this was the moment to act, to make a difference, to not let months of work slip away. My heart pounded as I looked between my partner and my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, right now."}
