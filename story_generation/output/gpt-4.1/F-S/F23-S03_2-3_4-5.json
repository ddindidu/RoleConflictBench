The polling place closes in two hours, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote on the new zoning measure\u2014something that could change our block for years. But right now, I\u2019m in the supermarket, chasing after my stepson, Ethan, who\u2019s weaving between carts and giggling as he nearly knocks over a display of apples. Other shoppers are starting to stare. As his step-parent, I know I need to teach him about respect and discipline, to show him that running wild in public isn\u2019t okay. But every minute I spend here, reasoning with him, is a minute closer to missing my chance to vote. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the expectation to guide Ethan, to be the steady adult he needs, and the responsibility to participate as a citizen, to have my say in decisions that affect our community. My mind races, torn between pulling Ethan aside for a serious talk or rushing us out the door to make it to the polls in time."}
