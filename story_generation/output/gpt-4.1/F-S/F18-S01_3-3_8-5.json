The supervisor had emphasized how important it was to respect everyone\u2019s privacy\u2014no phones, no distractions, and absolutely no sharing of information. I was deep in concentration when I glanced out the window and saw my younger brother on the sidewalk. He was fiddling with his phone, not paying attention, and started to step off the curb just as a car sped around the corner. My heart leapt into my throat. As his sibling, I felt a surge of panic and the urge to rush outside, to shout his name and make sure he was safe. But the files in front of me were open, and I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave them unattended. I was torn\u2014my brother\u2019s safety on one side, and my responsibility to protect the privacy of these files on the other. My hands trembled as I hovered between the window and the files, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
