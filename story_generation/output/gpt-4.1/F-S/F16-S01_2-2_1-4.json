Their eyes were clouded with worry as they explained the dilemma at work, searching my face for reassurance and guidance. I knew how much they needed me to listen, to offer comfort and advice, to be the steady presence they could lean on. But my mind kept drifting back to the community center earlier that day, where a client had quietly confided in me about a personal struggle while I helped her fill out forms. Her words echoed in my mind, heavy with trust and expectation that I would keep her secret safe.\n\nNow, as my partner\u2019s voice trembled, I felt the urge to share what I\u2019d heard, to use the story as an example that might help them see their own situation more clearly. But I knew I couldn\u2019t. The promise of confidentiality pressed against my duty as a spouse, and I felt torn between being the supportive partner my spouse needed and the trustworthy volunteer my client deserved. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the weight of both roles, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
