My sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen\u2014she never called twice unless it was serious. I answered, and her shaky voice told me she\u2019d just had a panic attack and needed me to come home. My heart twisted; I\u2019d always promised to be there for her, especially when she was struggling. But the election official was already waving me over, explaining that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station would close in ten minutes. I could see the expectation in the official\u2019s eyes: follow the rules, don\u2019t hold up the process. But my sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, pleading for help. I felt torn in two, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure which role I was supposed to honor in that moment."}
