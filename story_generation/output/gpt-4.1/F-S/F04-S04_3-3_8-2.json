My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote; it felt like a duty, a way to make my voice heard. But just as I grabbed my keys, my younger sister stormed into the living room, her eyes red and voice trembling. She\u2019d misunderstood something I\u2019d said earlier, and now she was hurt, accusing me of not caring about her feelings. I knew I should sit down, listen, and talk things through. That\u2019s what a good brother does\u2014communicate openly, build trust, and resolve misunderstandings. But the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. Was I about to let my sister down for the sake of my civic duty, or would I let my vote slip away to be the brother she needed right now? My mind raced, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
