My daughter had called just as I arrived, her voice trembling\u2014my grandson had fallen and needed stitches. She needed me, the steady hand, the calming presence. But here I was, a voter, and the election officials had just announced that those with last names A\u2013M, like mine, must move to a new line. The original line, the one I\u2019d waited in for nearly an hour, was finally moving. The new line snaked around the corner, slow and uncertain.\n\nI felt the weight of my roles pressing in. As a grandfather, I was expected to drop everything for my family, to be there in moments of crisis. As a voter, I was supposed to follow the officials\u2019 instructions, to respect the process, to do my civic duty. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the urgent need to be with my family and the responsibility to cast my vote. The lines, the rules, the phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014each tugged at me, demanding I choose."}
