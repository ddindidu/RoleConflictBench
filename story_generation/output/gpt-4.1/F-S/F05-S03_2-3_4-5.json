My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please handle the laundry today? The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I would, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to keep the house running smoothly. But as I sort the clothes, my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cLast chance to vote on the neighborhood zoning measure\u2014polls close in two hours.\u201d I know how important this is for our block; everyone\u2019s been talking about it, and I\u2019ve always believed in being an active citizen. If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll miss my chance to have a say. But if I leave, the laundry won\u2019t get done, and I\u2019ll be letting my family down. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014my wife\u2019s trust in me as a partner, my own sense of duty as a citizen. I stand in the hallway, laundry in one hand, car keys in the other, torn between two promises I don\u2019t want to break."}
