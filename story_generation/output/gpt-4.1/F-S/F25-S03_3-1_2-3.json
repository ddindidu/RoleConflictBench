She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, and if I\u2019d remembered to call Dad about his doctor\u2019s appointment. I knew she expected a quick, thoughtful reply\u2014she always said daily check-ins kept us close, especially since I moved out. As I started typing, my laptop pinged with the city newsletter. The subject line read: \u201cHelp Shape Our Bus Routes\u2014Survey Open!\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be a better citizen, stay informed, and give feedback. The survey was only open for a week, and I\u2019d been meaning to suggest a stop closer to my building. I stared at the two screens, feeling the pressure mount. If I answered my stepmom now, I might forget the survey. If I did the survey first, she\u2019d worry I was ignoring her. Both roles tugged at me\u2014one asking for family connection, the other for civic responsibility. My fingers hovered, heart pounding, torn between the two worlds I was supposed to belong to."}
