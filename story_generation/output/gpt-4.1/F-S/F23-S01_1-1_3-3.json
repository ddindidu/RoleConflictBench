I gently reminded him to use his napkin, trying to teach him the small courtesies that matter. He rolled his eyes, and I felt the familiar tension of wanting to guide him without overstepping. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the community center where I volunteer. I\u2019d just spent the morning there, chatting with a woman who\u2019d recently lost her job. She\u2019d shared a little about her struggles, nothing too private, but enough to stick with me. Now, as my partner joined us, the conversation drifted, and I found myself on the verge of mentioning the woman\u2019s situation as an example for my stepson about empathy and resilience. But a voice in my head reminded me of the promise I\u2019d made as a volunteer: respect privacy, never share stories that aren\u2019t mine. I felt torn, caught between my desire to teach my stepson important values and my duty to protect the trust of those I help. The words hovered on my lips, and I hesitated, wrestling with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
