My mother had just finished lighting the candles, her eyes shining with pride as she reminded me how important it was to honor our traditions, especially in times of uncertainty. Suddenly, the city\u2019s emergency alert blared from my phone\u2014a flash-flood warning. I glanced outside and saw water creeping up the street, neighbors scrambling to move their cars and help the elderly next door. My father looked at me, expecting me to stay and lead the family in the next ritual, just as he had always done. But as a citizen, I felt a pull to join the community effort, to help sandbag the doors and check on those who might be trapped. My heart pounded with the weight of both expectations: the warmth and duty of family, the urgent call to serve my neighbors. I stood frozen, torn between the comfort of tradition and the pressing need outside, feeling the storm rage both within and beyond these walls."}
