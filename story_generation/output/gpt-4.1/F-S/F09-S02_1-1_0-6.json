I picture my kids waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019m not late like last time. I grab my keys, but then my phone lights up with notifications. The post I made about our campaign is exploding online. Hundreds of comments, people asking questions, some even challenging our message. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate, to clarify, to make a real impact. If I respond now, I could reach thousands, maybe even sway opinions. But if I stay, I\u2019ll be late for my children\u2014again. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the faces of my kids and the faces of strangers who might finally listen. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I can\u2019t move."}
