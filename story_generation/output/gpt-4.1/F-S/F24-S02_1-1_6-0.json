The street is quiet, the sun dipping behind the houses, and I\u2019m supposed to keep an eye on him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d Jamie\u2019s only twelve, and I know he gets nervous when we\u2019re alone, especially after what happened last month. But my phone keeps buzzing. It\u2019s Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s live-streaming from a protest downtown, her messages urgent: \u201cWe need more people. Can you come?\u201d I glance at Jamie, who\u2019s humming to himself, oblivious. My heart pounds. I want to be there, to stand up for what I believe in, but I can\u2019t just leave Jamie. If I drag him along, I\u2019m risking his safety. If I go alone, I\u2019m breaking Mom\u2019s trust. I feel split in two, pulled by loyalty to my family and my cause, and I don\u2019t know which part of me is stronger."}
