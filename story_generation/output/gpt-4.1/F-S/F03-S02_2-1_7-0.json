My mother\u2019s eyes looked heavier than usual, and my father\u2019s shoulders slumped as he read the news. I knew they\u2019d been worried about bills and my younger sister\u2019s grades, and lately, they seemed to need me more\u2014just to talk, to listen, to be present. I wanted to stay, to offer comfort, maybe make tea and sit with them for a while.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently. A message from Maya, a fellow activist, flashed on the screen: \u201cWe\u2019re live now. Not many people here. Can you come?\u201d I pictured the small group standing in the square, holding signs, their voices echoing in the chilly air. We\u2019d planned this protest for weeks, and I\u2019d promised to help organize, to show up and stand with them. The cause mattered deeply to me, and I knew my absence would be felt.\n\nI looked from my phone to my parents, torn between the urge to rush out the door and the pull to stay. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
