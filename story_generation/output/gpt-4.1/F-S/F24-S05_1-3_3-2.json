My stepsister\u2019s eyes sparkled with excitement, and my mom looked at me, waiting for my input. I knew they wanted me to be present, to join in and help make these new family bonds stronger. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. She was in the middle of a legal crisis, needing my guidance before the end of the night. As an advocate, I was expected to be available, to give her the clear, accurate advice she depended on. My family\u2019s laughter filled the room, but my mind raced with legal statutes and urgent deadlines. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the warmth of family togetherness on one side and the sharp responsibility of my client\u2019s trust on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to smile, torn between the table and the phone, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both."}
