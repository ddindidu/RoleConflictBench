I wanted to say something comforting, to offer the support I knew they needed, but the words stuck in my throat. We stopped at a bench, and my mother handed me the empty snack wrapper from her pocket. \u201cCan you throw this away for me?\u201d she asked softly, her voice weary. I glanced around and saw the trash bin just a few steps away, but also noticed the clear no-littering signs posted everywhere. My father, already sitting, motioned for me to just leave the wrapper on the bench, whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, someone will pick it up.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a son, I wanted to ease their burden, to do as they asked without question. But as a citizen, I knew I should respect the park\u2019s rules and keep the space clean for everyone. I stood there, wrapper in hand, torn between the urge to comfort my parents and the responsibility I felt toward my community."}
