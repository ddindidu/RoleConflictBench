Her eyes were red, and she took a shaky breath before telling me about the anxiety that had been keeping her up at night. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d always counted on. As I reached for her hand, my phone rang\u2014an unknown number, but I recognized the area code. It was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks, finally calling back. I had ten minutes to make my case for the bill that could change lives, and my team was counting on me. My mom\u2019s voice trembled as she asked, \u201cCan you stay with me for a bit?\u201d I could see how much she needed me, but the phone kept ringing, each buzz a reminder of the other people who needed me, too. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the person who raised me and the cause I\u2019d promised to fight for."}
