The election official explained, apologetically, that my name didn\u2019t match the registration list exactly. If I wanted my vote to count, I\u2019d have to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, come straight home after voting. We\u2019re lighting the family candles at sunset, just like every year.\u201d This tradition was sacred in our house, a symbol of everything my parents believed in. They\u2019d been reminding me all week how important it was to be there on time, to show respect for our heritage. But the form was long, and the line was slow. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the ceremony. If I left, my vote wouldn\u2019t count. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, my duty as a citizen on the other. My hands shook as I stared at the form, the clock ticking louder in my ears, caught between honoring my family and fulfilling my responsibility as a voter."}
