My brother nudged me, asking about my day, and my mother chimed in, eager for stories. As a sister, I knew how much these moments meant to my family\u2014they expected me to be present, to share, to be open. But as a volunteer at the local shelter, I had just come from a shift where I\u2019d listened to people\u2019s stories, some light, some heavy, all private. When my aunt asked, \u201cYou must hear such interesting things\u2014anything funny happen today?\u201d everyone turned to me, waiting. I felt the weight of their expectation to contribute, to be part of the family\u2019s easy conversation. But I also felt the invisible boundary of trust from those I helped, even if nothing sensitive had been said. My mind raced, torn between wanting to make my family happy and honoring the unspoken promise of confidentiality. The room grew quiet, all eyes on me, and I felt the tension coil inside, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
