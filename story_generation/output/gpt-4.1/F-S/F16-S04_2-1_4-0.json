My partner had mentioned last night that the kids were running out of clean clothes for their weekend activities, and I\u2019d promised to handle the laundry today. As I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my work schedule was light, so there was no real excuse to skip voting. Still, I could hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, hoping I\u2019d finally keep my word about the laundry. \n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. If I left now to vote, the laundry would be pushed off again, and I\u2019d be letting my family down\u2014again. But if I started the laundry first, I might get caught up in chores and forget to vote, or worse, run out of time. Both roles felt urgent, both expectations pressing on me. I could feel the tension building in my chest as I weighed my responsibilities, unsure which to choose first."}
