My son\u2019s eyes had sparkled for weeks, counting down to the day I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo I\u2019d promised. He\u2019d done his chores, saved his allowance, and I\u2019d told him I\u2019d cover the rest. But as I checked my bank balance, I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014money was tight, and I needed to be careful to keep us afloat. At the same time, today was voting day. I\u2019d set aside my afternoon to go to the polls, and I knew I needed to bring valid ID. I had my driver\u2019s license, but my passport and other cards were at home. If I forgot them, I could come back later, but that would mean more time away from work\u2014and from my son, who was waiting for his reward. I felt torn, pulled between being the reliable parent who keeps promises and the responsible citizen who makes time to vote. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to do both, knowing that something had to give."}
