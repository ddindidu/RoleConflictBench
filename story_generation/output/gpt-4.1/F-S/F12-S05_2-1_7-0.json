I could tell something was weighing on him, and as his wife, I knew I should reach out, encourage him to share what was on his mind. We\u2019d always promised to communicate openly, to be each other\u2019s confidant. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, desperate for clarity about their case. As an advocate, I was expected to provide clear, accurate advice\u2014even during these off-the-clock, casual consultations. My mind raced, torn between the urge to gently ask my husband about his worries and the professional obligation to respond to my client with the attention they deserved. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the expectation to be present and supportive at home clashing with the demand for precision and reliability at work. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my full self to either in this moment, caught in the impossible space between the two people I was supposed to be."}
