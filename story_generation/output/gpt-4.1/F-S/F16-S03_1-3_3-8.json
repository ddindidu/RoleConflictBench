My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning\u2014water was already creeping up the street outside. My spouse called from the kitchen, asking if I could finish the laundry so we\u2019d have dry clothes if the power went out. At the same time, I could hear neighbors in the hallway, voices anxious, someone calling for help to move sandbags to the lobby. I felt torn\u2014my partner needed me here, to keep our home in order and reassure them, but as a member of this community, I knew I should be out there, helping protect the building and the people in it. My heart pounded as I looked from the half-folded laundry to the door, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
