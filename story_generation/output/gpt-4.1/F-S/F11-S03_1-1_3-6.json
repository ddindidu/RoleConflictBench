My younger brother wanted to go hiking, and my parents suggested a movie night. I could see how much it meant to them that I join in\u2014after all, we rarely get time like this anymore. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. As a responsible citizen, I felt a strong pull to volunteer, especially since the clinic was short-staffed and the turnout was expected to be high. I had already organized my tax documents, so I knew I could spare the time. Yet, the thought of disappointing my family, who expected me to be present and engaged, made my chest tighten. I wanted to be a good sister, to laugh and make memories, but I also wanted to do my part for the community. The two roles tugged at me from opposite sides, and I sat quietly, torn, as the conversation swirled around me."}
