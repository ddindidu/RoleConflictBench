My mother called me over, her eyes shining with pride as she handed me the ceremonial cloth. \u201cYou\u2019ll lead the prayers this year,\u201d she said, her voice full of hope. It was a big honor, a way to show I respected our family\u2019s traditions. But as I nodded, my phone vibrated again. My activist group\u2019s post was exploding online\u2014thousands of people were reading, sharing, asking questions. If I commented now, I could reach so many, maybe even change minds. But if I pulled out my phone during the ceremony, I\u2019d be disrespecting everything my family stood for. My heart pounded as I looked from my mother\u2019s expectant face to the glowing screen. I wanted to be the daughter my family needed, but I also wanted to be the activist my cause demanded. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt torn, unable to move."}
