I was supposed to be at his side, guiding him, showing up for him at moments like this. But today was also Election Day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014my civic duty, a promise to my late father. I rushed to the polling place, heart pounding, only to be told by a poll worker that my ballot envelope was smudged. \u201cPlease re-sign here,\u201d she said, her voice gentle but firm. I remembered the school\u2019s request for an immediate meeting, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, present and responsible. But the poll worker\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting, and I knew the rules: follow every instruction, or risk my vote not counting. My hands shook as I held the pen, torn between the urgent call to be a good parent and the equally pressing demand to be a responsible citizen."}
