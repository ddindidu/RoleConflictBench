She needed me\u2014her world felt like it was falling apart, and I was the only one she wanted close. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her trust and the silent plea for comfort. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A reminder: my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was the only one with the keys to the center, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start the day\u2019s service. My chest tightened. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my wife when she needed me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a crowd of people who had nowhere else to go. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn in two, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
