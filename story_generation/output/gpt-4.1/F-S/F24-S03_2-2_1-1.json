I knew something had happened at school\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his step-sibling, I felt the urge to comfort him, maybe suggest we play some music together like we used to when things got rough. He nodded when I asked if he wanted to hang out, and I could see a flicker of relief in his eyes.\n\nBut then I glanced at the clock. It was already past ten, and our building\u2019s quiet hours had started. The neighbor across the hall, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open and had complained before about noise. As a responsible citizen, I knew I should respect the rules and her right to a peaceful evening. Yet, my stepbrother needed me\u2014needed us\u2014to drown out his worries with our favorite songs. My heart pounded as I stood between the living room and the stereo, torn between being the supportive sibling he needed and the considerate neighbor I was expected to be."}
