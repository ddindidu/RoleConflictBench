The protest march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to be at the front, megaphone in hand, leading the first chant. People are counting on me to set the tone, to show up for the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. But then my phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder that the kids are finishing school in ten minutes. I promised I\u2019d be there to pick them up, to show them I\u2019m reliable, that I care, that I\u2019m not just their step-parent in name. I can picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to see me. My partner\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cThey need you to show up.\u201d But so do the people gathering outside, waiting for me to lead. My chest tightens as I stand at the crossroads, torn between two worlds, both demanding all of me at the same time."}
