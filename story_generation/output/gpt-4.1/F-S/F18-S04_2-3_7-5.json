He was determined to master a new skateboard trick on the old, uneven ramp we\u2019d dragged from the garage. I knew how dangerous it was\u2014he\u2019d already scraped his knee last week, and Mom had made me promise to keep an eye on him. But as he set his board down, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polls would close in less than an hour, and I still needed to grab my ID from my room and get to the community center. This was my only chance to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself and my civics teacher I\u2019d do. My brother looked up at me, waiting for a nod of encouragement, while the clock in my head ticked louder. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014protecting him, fulfilling my duty as a voter. My feet felt rooted to the spot, my mind racing, caught between the ramp and the ballot box."}
