As a citizen, I felt it was my duty to listen, to stay informed, and to send in my questions about the issues that mattered to our neighborhood. The clock ticked closer to the start time, and I was already jotting down notes, determined to participate fully.\n\nJust then, my granddaughter wandered in, her face clouded with uncertainty. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when you finished school? I feel so lost.\u201d My heart ached at her vulnerability. As her grandmother, I knew she needed my full attention, my stories, and my reassurance. She deserved the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades.\n\nBut the forum was starting. I could hear the moderator\u2019s voice through my headphones, calling for questions from the community. I felt torn\u2014my responsibility to my granddaughter pulling me one way, my sense of civic duty tugging me the other. I wanted to be present for both, but I could already feel the weight of choosing, the pressure of not letting either role down."}
