He grinned at me, helmet askew, and shouted, \u201cWatch this!\u201d I knew he\u2019d been practicing, but the ramp looked dangerous, and I was supposed to look out for him. Just as he set his board down, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote before the polls closed. I rushed to the community center, mind still on Jamie. At the voting booth, the poll worker frowned at my ballot envelope. \u201cIt\u2019s smudged. Please re-sign here, or your vote might not count.\u201d My hands shook. Jamie could be hurt right now, but the official\u2019s tone was firm\u2014no shortcuts, no rushing. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. Should I hurry back to the park, or stay and carefully follow every voting instruction? My mind raced, caught between protecting my stepbrother and fulfilling my civic duty."}
