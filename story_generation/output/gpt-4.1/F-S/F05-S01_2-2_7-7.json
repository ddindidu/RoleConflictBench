I could tell something was weighing on her, and as her husband, I knew I should reach out, ask her about her day, and share my own struggles at work. We\u2019d promised to always communicate openly, especially when things got tough. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: a new set of safety steps had just been rolled out, and I was expected to review and apply them before my next shift. The message was clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My wife needed me to be present, to listen and talk, but the volunteer team was counting on me to follow instructions and keep everyone safe. My mind raced, caught between the urge to reach for her hand and the responsibility to open the safety manual. The silence stretched, and I could feel my heart pounding, pulled in two directions by the people who needed me most."}
