He hadn\u2019t spoken much since the news about his job, and I could feel the weight of his silence pressing on me. He needed me\u2014my words, my arms around him, my quiet presence. I wanted to stay, to listen, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in twenty minutes. I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I also knew how much the team relied on everyone being on time, especially with the new intake of animals today. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the man I loved, who needed me more than ever, and toward the commitment I\u2019d made to the shelter, where I was counted on to show up. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and tried to steady my breath as I wrestled with what to do next."}
