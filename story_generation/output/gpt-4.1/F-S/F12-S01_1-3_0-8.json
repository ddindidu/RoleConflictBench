I\u2019d promised to help with the evening shift, and the coordinator\u2019s tone left no room for delay. Just then, my husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. \u201cRough day,\u201d he said, rubbing his temples. I could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he lingered in the doorway, hoping I\u2019d ask about his day or offer a hug. I wanted to sit with him, listen, and be the supportive wife he needed. But the coordinator\u2019s message blinked on my screen, demanding my immediate attention. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest. If I ignored the procedures, I\u2019d let down the team and risk the service. If I turned away from my husband now, I\u2019d fail him when he needed me most. My hands trembled as I stood between the kitchen and the living room, pulled by two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
