The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces, but my heart tightened as I glanced at the stack of files on my desk. My client, Mrs. Patel, was waiting anxiously in the next room, her livelihood hanging on the legal advice I needed to give her before the end of the day.
