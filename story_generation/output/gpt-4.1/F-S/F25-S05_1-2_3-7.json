My father looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d help lead the family in the old tradition, just as he\u2019d asked every year since I moved in. I could see the hope in his eyes, the silent plea to show I belonged, to honor the rituals that made this family whole. But my phone buzzed on the coffee table\u2014a reminder for the court session I was due to attend in less than an hour. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence; missing it could mean a setback they couldn\u2019t afford. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations against the cold, unyielding demands of my profession. I felt split in two, torn between the need to prove I was part of this family and the responsibility to stand up for someone who had no one else. The room grew quieter, all eyes on me, waiting for my choice."}
