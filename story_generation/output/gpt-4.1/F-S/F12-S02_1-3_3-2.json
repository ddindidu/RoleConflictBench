He\u2019s been patient, but I know he\u2019s waiting for me to finally fold it, to share the load like I said I would. My phone buzzes urgently in my pocket. Messages flood in from fellow activists: the police have started blocking the exits at the protest downtown. Panic is rising, and they need me\u2014now\u2014to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure no one gets hurt or trapped. My heart pounds as I glance between the laundry and my phone. I feel the weight of my commitment to my partner, the comfort and stability of our home, pulling me one way. But the voices of my friends, the cause I believe in, and the people counting on me for leadership tug me in the other. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure of choosing between my home and my cause presses in on me, leaving me frozen in the middle of the living room, torn and breathless."}
