I really need to clear the air before Mom gets home,\u201d he wrote. We\u2019d argued last night, and I knew he was waiting for me to reach out, to show I cared enough to listen and work things out. As his sister, I wanted to be there, to prove that our relationship mattered more than my pride. But the clock was ticking\u2014the polls would close in less than an hour, and I still needed to find my ID, which I\u2019d misplaced somewhere in the chaos of my day. If I didn\u2019t vote now, I\u2019d lose my only chance to have a say in this election. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the duty to my brother and my responsibility as a citizen. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, and my integrity, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down."}
