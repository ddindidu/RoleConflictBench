My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I reached for my car keys, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for our district was streaming now. I\u2019d been following the issues closely, and tonight was the only chance to ask questions and hear the candidates\u2019 plans. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to participate, to make my voice heard for the sake of our community\u2019s future. But as a father, I knew how much my presence meant to my daughter. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, each expecting my full attention. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure mount as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
