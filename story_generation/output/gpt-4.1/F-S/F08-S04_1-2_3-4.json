Today was our long-awaited family gathering, and as a grandmother, I knew how much my presence meant to everyone\u2014especially the little ones who had been counting down the days. My daughter had called last night, reminding me, \u201cMom, don\u2019t be late. The kids are so excited to see you.\u201d I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen to their stories and hold my newest grandchild.\n\nBut as I poured my coffee, I remembered the voting notice on the fridge. I\u2019d misplaced my ID, and this morning was my only window to drive home and retrieve it before the polls closed tomorrow. Civic duty tugged at me; I\u2019d always told my family how important it was to vote, to have a say. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d miss the start of the gathering, maybe even the group photo. My heart twisted, torn between being the grandmother my family expected and the responsible voter I believed I should be. I stood in the kitchen, keys in hand, wrestling with which part of myself to disappoint."}
