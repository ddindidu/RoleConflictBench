My step-siblings laughed as we prepared to light the candles, a tradition that always made me feel like I belonged, even if only for a moment. My stepfather caught my eye, nodding for me to lead the toast\u2014something he\u2019d asked of me this year, a sign that I was finally being trusted to uphold the family\u2019s values. Just as I raised my glass, my phone buzzed. I glanced down and saw the name of the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was my chance to push for the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into, to make a real difference. But if I left now, I\u2019d be letting my family down, breaking the fragile trust we\u2019d built. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the family I was trying to honor and the cause I was fighting for."}
