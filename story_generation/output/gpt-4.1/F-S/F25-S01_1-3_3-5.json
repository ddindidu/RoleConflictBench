I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation to blend in, to honor the rituals that made this family whole. But my mind kept drifting to the files I\u2019d left at the community center, where I volunteered. I was responsible for sorting confidential medical histories, and I\u2019d just discovered that one of the people we were helping was a distant relative of my stepmother. \n\nNow, as the family gathered around, sharing stories and laughter, my stepmother asked about my volunteer work. \u201cYou must meet so many interesting people,\u201d she said, nudging me to share. I felt my stomach twist. I wanted to be open, to be part of the family, but I knew I couldn\u2019t betray the trust of those I helped. The expectation to uphold family closeness clashed with my duty to protect privacy. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
