My brother suggested a movie, my mom wanted a picnic, and my dad was all for a hike. I smiled, trying to join in, but my mind kept drifting back to the volunteer work I\u2019d done that afternoon. Someone I\u2019d helped had mentioned a local event, and my family\u2019s conversation was veering dangerously close to that topic. My sister asked if I\u2019d heard anything interesting lately, and everyone looked at me, expecting me to share. As a sister, I wanted to be part of the laughter and stories, to contribute and connect. But as a volunteer, I knew I had to respect the privacy of those I\u2019d helped, even if nothing sensitive had been said. The pressure built inside me\u2014my family\u2019s eager faces on one side, my sense of responsibility on the other. I felt my heart race, caught between wanting to belong and needing to protect someone else\u2019s trust."}
