My wife\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d help more around the house. The expectation is clear: I need to pull my weight, not just let chores pile up until she\u2019s forced to handle them. But my phone buzzes with a reminder\u2014the online candidate forum for our district is streaming right now. As a citizen, I believe in being informed, in listening to the candidates, asking questions, and making my voice heard. The election is close, and I know how important it is to participate, to give feedback that could shape our community. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I fold the laundry, I\u2019ll miss the live discussion and my chance to engage. If I watch the forum, the laundry will sit there, another broken promise. My chest tightens as I stand in the living room, torn between being the husband I want to be and the citizen I believe I should be."}
