Her voice trembled as she asked if she could come over\u2014she needed advice about a decision that could change her life. Of course, I told her to come right away. As I set out her favorite cookies, I glanced at the clock and remembered today was Election Day. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, so I\u2019d planned to vote at my leisure. But as my granddaughter arrived, tears in her eyes, I realized she needed me now, not later. She looked to me for wisdom, for comfort, for the kind of guidance only a grandparent can give. Yet, in the back of my mind, the civic duty of voting tugged at me. I knew how important it was to have my voice heard, to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. The hours stretched ahead, but I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s trust and my duty to vote. I sat with her, heart torn, wondering how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
