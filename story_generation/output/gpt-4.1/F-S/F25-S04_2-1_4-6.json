As a step-child, I always felt the pressure to prove I belonged, to never give anyone a reason to question my place in the family.\n\nNow, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name\u2014my father\u2019s name\u2014put me squarely in that group. But the new line was long and slow, while the original line, where I\u2019d been waiting, was moving quickly. I hesitated, feeling the weight of my stepmother\u2019s expectations to do what\u2019s right, to follow the rules, but also the unspoken family tradition of not making a fuss, of blending in and not drawing attention. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do, torn between honoring my family\u2019s values and following the official\u2019s instructions."}
