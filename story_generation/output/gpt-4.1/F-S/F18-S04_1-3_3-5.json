My parents chimed in, asking for my opinion on where we should go this weekend. I knew how much these moments meant to them\u2014family time was rare, and they expected me to be present, to laugh and share in the planning. But as I listened, my mind kept drifting to the voter ID card sitting in my desk drawer upstairs. The polls closed tonight, and this was my only chance to cast my vote. The law was strict: no ID, no ballot. My family wanted me here, fully engaged, but the clock was ticking. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the civic duty that demanded my immediate attention. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my sister\u2019s face against the importance of my vote. I sat there, paralyzed, caught between two worlds that refused to wait for each other."}
