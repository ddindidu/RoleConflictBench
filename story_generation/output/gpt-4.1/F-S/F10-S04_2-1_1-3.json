Mom always waited for my call, eager to hear about my week and share her own stories. I knew how much it meant to her, especially since I moved out. But today was also election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before noon. I\u2019d set my ID on the table last night, but now, as I reached for it, I realized I\u2019d grabbed my old student card instead of my driver\u2019s license. I could still go back for the right ID later, but that would mean missing the window for our call. My parents would worry if I didn\u2019t call on time, maybe even think something was wrong. But if I called them now, I\u2019d miss the quietest hours at the polling station and risk a long wait later. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
