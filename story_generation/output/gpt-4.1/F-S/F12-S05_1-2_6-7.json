My husband was at the kitchen table, sipping tea, and he looked up with a smile. \u201cRough day?\u201d he asked, his voice gentle. I hesitated, knowing he valued our evening talks, the way we shared the small details of our lives. He wanted me to open up, to tell him about the stress, the difficult client, the judge\u2019s sharp questions. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was early tomorrow, and I still had to review my notes and prepare. I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014to be present, to communicate honestly\u2014pressing against the professional demand to be punctual and prepared for my client. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and anxiety swirling together. I wanted to sit and talk, to be the wife he needed, but the advocate in me was already halfway out the door, mind on the case. I stood there, torn, words caught in my throat, unsure which role to answer first."}
