My stepson, Ethan, had been talking about his open class for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he asked if I\u2019d be there. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right?\u201d he\u2019d said last night, hope and uncertainty mingling in his voice. I promised I would, knowing how much it meant to him, how much he wanted to see me in the crowd, cheering him on like the other parents.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client, a young woman whose future depended on my advocacy, was scheduled for the same time. The judge had warned us\u2014no delays, no excuses. My presence was not just expected; it was essential. If I missed it, the case could unravel, and my client could lose everything.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. Ethan\u2019s trust, my client\u2019s hope\u2014both hanging in the balance. My hands trembled as I tried to imagine disappointing either of them, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
