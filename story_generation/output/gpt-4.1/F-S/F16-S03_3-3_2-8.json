My phone buzzed with emergency alerts, urging everyone to check on neighbors and help with sandbagging at the community center. But as I looked over at my partner, curled up on the couch, I saw the raw fear in their eyes. They\u2019d barely slept in days, haunted by a crisis at work that had shaken their confidence to the core. I knew how much they needed me\u2014my presence, my words, my arms around them. Yet, as a citizen, I felt the pull of duty: the expectation to help protect our block, to be out there with others, doing my part for the safety of all. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. I wanted to be the anchor my partner needed, but I also felt the responsibility to step outside and help my neighbors. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between the person I love and the community that depends on me."}
