My stepbrother trudged in, his backpack hanging off one shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school again. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and help him through these rough patches. He dropped onto the couch, silent, but I could feel the weight of his need for comfort.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the advocacy meeting was in twenty minutes, and I couldn\u2019t be late. My supervisor had already warned me about punctuality, and missing another session could jeopardize my standing. I glanced at my brother, torn. He needed me now, but so did my clients. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the supportive sibling he deserved and the reliable advocate my role demanded."}
