My stepdad had texted, \u201cHope you\u2019re doing okay. Call when you can.\u201d It was Saturday, and I knew he expected me to check in, just like Mom always asked. I wanted to reply, to reassure them, but my mind was tangled with the conversation I\u2019d just had with a client. She\u2019d called for a \u201cquick chat,\u201d but her questions were anything but simple. As her advocate, I was supposed to give clear, accurate advice, not just vague reassurances. But I\u2019d been distracted, glancing at my phone, thinking about my family, and I\u2019d given her only a general explanation. Now, guilt gnawed at me\u2014had I let her down? Was I letting my parents down, too? The demands pulled at me from both sides: be present for my family, be precise for my clients. My phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
