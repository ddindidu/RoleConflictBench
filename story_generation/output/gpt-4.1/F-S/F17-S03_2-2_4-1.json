Tonight was the festival night, the one my family never missed. Every year, we played our traditional songs late into the evening, filling our apartment with music and laughter. My parents had reminded me all week: \u201cWe must keep our customs alive, no matter what.\u201d But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the new building rules\u2014quiet hours started at ten, and it was already past nine-thirty. Through my window, I could see our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, reading by her open window. She\u2019d mentioned how much she valued the peace at night, especially after her long shifts. My heart pounded as I thought about the music, the joy it brought my family, and the pride in my parents\u2019 eyes. But I also felt the weight of being a good citizen, respecting the rules and my neighbors\u2019 right to quiet. The radio felt heavier in my hands as I sat there, torn between the warmth of tradition and the duty to respect those around me."}
