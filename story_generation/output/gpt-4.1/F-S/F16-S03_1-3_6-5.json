The polling place was just a few blocks away, and I knew I had only two hours left to cast my vote and maybe even talk to the officials about my concerns. But as I glanced up, I saw my spouse across from me, looking tired but hopeful, waiting for me to share about my day. We\u2019d promised to communicate more openly, to really listen to each other, and I could see they needed that from me tonight. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014my duty as a citizen to participate and make my voice heard, and my responsibility as a spouse to be present and supportive. I felt torn, the clock ticking louder in my head, as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
