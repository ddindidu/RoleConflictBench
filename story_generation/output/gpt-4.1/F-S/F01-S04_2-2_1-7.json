He\u2019d slumped at the kitchen table, eyes downcast, barely touching his cereal. I wanted to sit beside him, offer the kind of advice my father once gave me\u2014remind him that setbacks are just stepping stones. But I was already late for the polling station, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote today, no matter what.\n\nNow, at the polling booth, the poll worker handed my envelope back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but the signature smudged. Could you please sign again?\u201d Her tone was polite but firm, and I knew the rules were strict. I hesitated, pen hovering, my mind torn. As a voter, I needed to follow every instruction, respect the process. But as a grandfather, I felt the urge to rush home, to be there for my grandson, to show him that sometimes, you have to put family first. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between duty and love, unsure which path to take."}
