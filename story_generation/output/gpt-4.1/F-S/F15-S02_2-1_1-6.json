The open class at my daughter\u2019s school starts in fifteen minutes. She\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019ll be there in the front row. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. My phone buzzes again. The notification is impossible to ignore\u2014a post about our cause is exploding online, thousands of people are reading, commenting, sharing. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist, the chance to reach so many, to educate, to make a difference. If I add a thoughtful comment now, I could shape the conversation, maybe even change minds. But if I stop to do that, I\u2019ll be late for the open class. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, the expectations of my child and my community pulling me in opposite directions. My hands tremble as I hold my phone, torn between the promise I made to my daughter and the responsibility I feel to my cause."}
