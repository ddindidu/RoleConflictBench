I nodded along, but my thoughts drifted to the community center, where I volunteered every weekend. There, I\u2019d been taught the opposite: respect the privacy of those I help, never share their stories, even the harmless ones.\n\nTonight, as we cleared the dishes, my aunt asked about my volunteering. \u201cYou must hear such interesting things,\u201d she said, her eyes bright with curiosity. The conversation turned casual, and I felt the familiar pull\u2014my family expected openness, a sharing of stories, even if they seemed innocent. But I remembered the trust in the eyes of the people I helped, the unspoken promise to keep their lives private.\n\nMy heart pounded as everyone waited for me to speak, torn between the warmth of family tradition and the quiet responsibility I carried as a volunteer."}
