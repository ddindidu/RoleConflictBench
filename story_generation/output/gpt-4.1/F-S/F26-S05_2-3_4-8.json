She\u2019d been planning this family gathering for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, front and center, when she shared her news. My phone buzzed on the table\u2014a reminder for the court session I was scheduled to attend in less than an hour. As an advocate, my presence was not just expected, it was essential; the outcome of the case could hinge on my arguments and support. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me here, to celebrate and support, but my client needed me there, to fight for justice. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the joy in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes and the responsibility that awaited me downtown."}
