My partner had reminded me twice this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d get the laundry done before dinner. But now, at the community center, a client leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, confiding a personal struggle while I helped her with paperwork. I could see the trust in her eyes, the weight of her secret pressing between us. I wanted to give her my full attention, to honor her privacy and offer support, but my mind kept drifting to the pile of clothes at home and the disappointment I\u2019d see on my spouse\u2019s face if I failed to keep my word. The clock ticked louder in my ears, each second stretching the tension between my roles\u2014one demanding my presence and care at home, the other requiring my discretion and empathy here. I felt torn, caught in the silent tug-of-war between being the reliable partner my family needed and the trustworthy volunteer my client deserved."}
