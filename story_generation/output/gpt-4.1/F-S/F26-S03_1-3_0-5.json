The polling place was just a few blocks away, but it would close in two hours. I knew how important it was to participate, to have my voice heard as a citizen. Just then, my granddaughter walked in, her face uncertain. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to take a big step in life?\u201d I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed my full attention, my stories, my wisdom. But the clock was ticking, and I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me. I wanted to be the grandparent she needed, to guide her through this moment, but I also felt the responsibility to my neighbors and community. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the call to nurture and the call to participate."}
