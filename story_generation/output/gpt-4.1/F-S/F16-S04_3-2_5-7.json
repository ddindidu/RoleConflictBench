I nodded, feeling the weight of making sure everything was perfect for our guests. But I also had to vote today\u2014something I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t skip, no matter how busy things got. At the polling station, after waiting in line, the poll worker handed my ballot back. \u201cSorry, the envelope is smudged. Please re-sign it so your vote counts.\u201d I glanced at the clock, anxiety rising. My spouse was counting on me to help at home, and I knew they\u2019d be frustrated if I was late. But the poll worker\u2019s tone was firm; I couldn\u2019t just rush through this. Torn between my duty as a spouse and my responsibility as a voter, I felt my chest tighten, caught in the middle of two worlds that both demanded my full attention."}
