I knew I should be present, ask questions, show I cared\u2014open communication was something we promised each other. But my mind kept drifting to the hearing scheduled for tomorrow. It was a minor case, nothing headline-worthy, but my client was anxious, and I felt the weight of representing them well. I caught myself nodding absently, realizing I\u2019d missed half of what my partner just said. Guilt pricked at me. I wanted to be the spouse who listened, who was there, but the advocate in me was rehearsing arguments, anticipating questions from the judge. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for a response, while my phone buzzed with a reminder about the case. I felt torn, pulled between the expectation to be present at home and the duty to be prepared for court. The words caught in my throat, unsure which role to serve in this moment."}
