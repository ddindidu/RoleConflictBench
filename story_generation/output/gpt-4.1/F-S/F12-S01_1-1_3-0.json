My husband had already done the grocery shopping and cooked dinner this week, so it was my turn to tackle the chores. But as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. I was supposed to be there in thirty minutes, and I knew they expected me to be on time, even though a few other volunteers could cover the start if I was late. I could almost hear my husband\u2019s voice in my head, gently reminding me that we agreed to share the load at home. At the same time, I felt the tug of responsibility to the people counting on me at the center. My heart pounded as I stood frozen between the laundry and the door, torn by the demands of being a good wife and a reliable volunteer, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
