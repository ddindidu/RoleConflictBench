We joked about homework and what we\u2019d eat for dinner, but I kept an eye on the cars and made sure he stayed on the inside of the sidewalk. That\u2019s what Mom always said\u2014look out for each other, especially since Jamie\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood. As we passed the community center, I remembered I needed to drop off my mail-in ballot. Jamie waited by the door while I went inside. The poll worker looked at my envelope and frowned. \u201cThis signature is smudged. Please re-sign it so your vote counts,\u201d she said, sliding it back to me. I hesitated, remembering the instructions: never sign twice, or the ballot could be disqualified. But the poll worker insisted, and I could see Jamie through the glass, shifting from foot to foot, looking nervous. I felt torn\u2014should I trust the official and re-sign, or stick to the rules I\u2019d read? And what if Jamie got anxious or wandered off while I was stuck here, wrestling with this choice? My heart pounded as I stood between my duty as a voter and my responsibility as a step-sibling, unsure which to put first."}
