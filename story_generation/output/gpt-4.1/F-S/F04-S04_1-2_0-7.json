My younger sister had just called to say she\u2019d been accepted into her dream university, and she wanted me to come home and celebrate with the family. I could hear her voice in my head, bubbling with joy, and I knew how much it would mean to her if I was there, cheering her on, just like she\u2019d always done for me.\n\nBut as I approached the ballot box, a poll worker stopped me, pointing out that my signature on the envelope was smudged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she said gently. I glanced at the clock\u2014my family was waiting, and my sister was expecting me to be there, to put her first. But as a voter, I knew I had to follow the rules, to make sure my voice was heard in this election. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my commitment. I stood there, torn, the pen trembling in my hand."}
