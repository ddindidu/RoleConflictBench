As a parent, the looming home loan repayment haunted my every thought. I needed to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability, to keep a roof over our heads. Every bill, every expense, every dollar spent was a calculation, a step closer or further from security. Yet, as an advocate, my phone buzzed with messages from clients seeking advice. They trusted me to provide clear, accurate guidance, not just vague reassurances. But lately, during casual consultations, I found myself giving only general explanations, holding back the details that required more time and focus\u2014time I felt I couldn\u2019t spare. My mind raced with the demands of both roles: my family\u2019s future, my clients\u2019 trust. I could feel the tension building, the fear of letting someone down\u2014either my children or those who depended on my expertise. The clock ticked, and I stared at the phone, torn between answering another client\u2019s question and reviewing our finances one more time."}
