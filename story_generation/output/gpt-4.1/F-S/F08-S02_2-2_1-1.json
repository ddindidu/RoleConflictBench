The march was starting in ten minutes, and I was supposed to lead the first chant\u2014my voice had become a rallying point for so many. But across the room, my granddaughter sat curled up, her eyes red and distant. She\u2019d barely spoken all morning, and I could sense the weight she carried, the kind of burden I recognized from my own youth. I wanted to sit beside her, offer the comfort and wisdom she needed, remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. Yet, the world outside was calling me too, expecting me to stand up, to be strong, to fight for justice. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the child who needed her grandmother\u2019s gentle guidance, and toward the crowd that needed their leader\u2019s fierce conviction. I glanced at the clock, feeling the seconds slip away, torn between the quiet pain in my living room and the urgent voices rising in the street."}
