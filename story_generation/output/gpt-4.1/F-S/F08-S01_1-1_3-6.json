My daughter had called twice this week, excited for me to spend the afternoon with the grandkids, baking cookies and sharing stories. I could already picture their eager faces, the warmth of their hugs, and the laughter echoing through the house. But as I sipped my morning coffee, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested, almost in passing, that if I had extra time during my shift at the food pantry, I might reorganize the supply shelves\u2014a task she hinted would make a big difference. I knew how much the team relied on me, and I prided myself on being dependable. Yet, the thought of leaving the shelves as they were nagged at me, just as much as the idea of missing precious moments with my family. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
