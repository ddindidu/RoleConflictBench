Our traditions meant everything to her, and I knew how much it would mean to the whole family if I did it well. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the city newsletter: the bus route survey was closing soon, and they needed feedback from residents like me to improve public transportation. I\u2019d always believed in being an active citizen, and I knew my input could help shape our community. But the ceremony required hours of preparation, and my family expected my full attention. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. How could I honor my family\u2019s traditions and still fulfill my duty as a citizen? The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
