He paused, looking at me expectantly, waiting for me to share something about mine. I knew he valued these moments, our little check-ins, and I wanted to be present, to communicate openly like we promised each other. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind\u2014everyone needed to be on time today, no exceptions. The roster was tight, and every minute counted. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late and let the team down. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to open up, but my mind was already at the community center, picturing the doors opening and the rush of people needing help. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
