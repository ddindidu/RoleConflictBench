I know she\u2019s waiting for my daily call, eager to hear about my day, to share her own stories, to feel close even though we\u2019re miles apart. I\u2019ve always made time for her, answering every message, never letting a day slip by without a conversation. But today, I\u2019m sitting in a quiet corner of the courthouse, my client\u2019s file open in front of me, heart pounding as I review my notes for the trial that could change her life. She\u2019s counting on me to be focused, to catch every detail, to fight for her future with everything I have. My mother\u2019s texts grow more insistent, and I can almost hear her voice, worried that I haven\u2019t replied. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my client\u2019s desperate hope. My hands tremble as I stare at my phone, torn between the daughter I\u2019ve always been and the advocate I need to be right now."}
