My client, Mrs. Lee, was in the middle of a legal crisis\u2014her message read, \u201cPlease call me now, I need to know what to do before noon.\u201d I knew she was waiting for my advice, and any delay could cost her dearly. At that moment, my brother, distracted by his friends across the street, stepped off the curb without looking. My heart leapt into my throat. As his sibling, I was supposed to keep him safe, to make sure he didn\u2019t do something reckless. But as an advocate, I was expected to be available, to provide clear, immediate guidance to my client. I could see a car approaching, and my brother was oblivious. My phone vibrated again, the urgency of both roles pressing in on me. I felt torn, paralyzed for a split second, caught between shouting for my brother and answering the call that could change my client\u2019s fate."}
