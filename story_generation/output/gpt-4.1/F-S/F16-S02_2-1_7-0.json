There\u2019s a protest happening downtown, and Maya, my friend and fellow organizer, is live-streaming. She sounds anxious, asking if anyone can join her. I know how important it is to show up, to stand together, especially when the crowd is small. But across from me, my spouse stirs their tea, eyes clouded with worry. I promised I\u2019d be present tonight, to listen and talk about what\u2019s been weighing on them. They finally opened up about their work stress, and I can see how much they need me to be here, to communicate and support them. My heart pounds as I glance between my spouse and my phone, feeling the pull of both worlds. I want to be the partner who listens, who\u2019s there when it matters, but I also feel the responsibility to my cause, to Maya, to the people counting on me. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I can\u2019t ignore the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
