It means a lot to Mom.\u201d I knew how important these family gatherings were, especially since we hadn\u2019t all been together in months. At the same time, my inbox pinged with a new email from the volunteer coordinator. She suggested, \u201cIf you have extra time today, could you try reorganizing the supply closet? It\u2019ll help us a lot for next week\u2019s event.\u201d I\u2019d promised to help out at the center this morning, and I knew how much they relied on volunteers to keep things running smoothly. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, but the center needed me to go the extra mile, just this once. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being the dependable brother and the committed volunteer. My mind raced, weighing the disappointment I might cause at home against the letdown I\u2019d bring to the team if I left things unfinished. I sat in my car, keys in hand, heart pounding, unsure which road to take."}
