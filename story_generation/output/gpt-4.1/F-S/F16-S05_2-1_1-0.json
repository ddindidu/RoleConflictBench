My partner paced the living room, her face tight with worry. She\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating\u2014leaving behind friends, family, and the life we\u2019d built. She looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance. \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I wanted to hold her, to tell her everything would work out, to be the supportive spouse she needed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from a client, asking for clarification about their case. I\u2019d promised to call back tonight. As an advocate, I owed them clear, accurate advice, not just vague reassurances. My mind raced, torn between the emotional support my partner needed and the professional responsibility to my client. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, reliable, and wise. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
