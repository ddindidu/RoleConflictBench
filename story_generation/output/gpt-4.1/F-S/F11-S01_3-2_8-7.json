He was upset, feeling misunderstood after a heated argument about his recent choices. As his sister, I knew I should reach out, listen, and talk things through\u2014build that mutual respect we\u2019d always promised each other. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer group chat, where the coordinator had just sent a reminder: everyone must strictly follow the new safety steps during tomorrow\u2019s event. No exceptions. I was supposed to help set up early, making sure every guideline was in place, and I knew the coordinator expected me to set an example. My brother, though, wanted to meet at the same time, hoping we could clear the air before the day got away from us. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my family needing openness and understanding, my team needing reliability and rule-following. My heart raced as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
