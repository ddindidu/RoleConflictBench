My little brother darted ahead, his eyes fixed on the ice cream truck across the street. He didn\u2019t even glance at the traffic. My heart leapt\u2014Mom always said to watch out for him, to make sure he was safe. But I was already late, and today was my only chance to swing by home and grab my ID before work. If I missed it, I might not be able to vote tomorrow. The polls would still be open, but I wouldn\u2019t have another break to get my ID.
