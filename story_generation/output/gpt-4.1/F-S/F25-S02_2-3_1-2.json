It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our weekly call. I\u2019m supposed to tell her about my week, ask about Dad\u2019s new job, and reassure her that I\u2019m eating well. But right now, I\u2019m standing in the middle of a crowded square, adrenaline surging as police begin to block the exits. The protest was supposed to be peaceful, but the tension in the air is thick, and people are starting to panic. My fellow organizers look to me for direction, expecting me to help coordinate a safe exit strategy. I can\u2019t just disappear; they need me. But if I don\u2019t answer, my stepmom will worry, maybe even call my dad, and the guilt of letting them down gnaws at me. I stare at my phone, torn between the comfort of family and the urgency of the cause, my heart pounding as I wrestle with the impossible choice."}
