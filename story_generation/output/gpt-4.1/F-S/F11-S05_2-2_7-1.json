I need you.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his sister, I knew he needed patience, someone to listen without judgment. I took a deep breath, glancing at the stack of files in front of me. My client\u2019s case had just taken a complicated turn, and as their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, precise legal advice\u2014no room for distraction or delay. My client was waiting for my call, anxious for guidance. My brother\u2019s message blinked on my screen, a silent plea for understanding. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the expectation to be patient and supportive for my brother, and the demand to be focused and authoritative for my client. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the person who needed my empathy and the one who needed my expertise."}
