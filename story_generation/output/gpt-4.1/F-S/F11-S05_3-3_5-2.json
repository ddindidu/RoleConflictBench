Mom\u2019s counting on you to help with the kids.\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. Family holidays were sacred, and I was always the dependable sister, the one who made sure everyone felt included and cared for. But as I started to pack, my work phone buzzed. It was a client, frantic, her voice trembling. She needed urgent legal advice\u2014her hearing was tomorrow, and she was relying on me to guide her through the maze of paperwork and deadlines. As her advocate, I was expected to be clear, precise, and available, especially in moments like this. I could hear the expectation in both voices: my family\u2019s need for my presence, my client\u2019s desperate hope for my expertise. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the weight of responsibility. I felt the pressure mounting, my roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, unable to move, caught in the impossible space between sister and advocate."}
