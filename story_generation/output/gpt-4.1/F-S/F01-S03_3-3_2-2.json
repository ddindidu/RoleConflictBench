I\u2019m scared about what\u2019s happening, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right.\u201d He looked up at me, searching for the steady guidance I\u2019d always tried to give. The demonstration around us was growing louder, more urgent. Suddenly, a voice from the crowd called out, \u201cWe need everyone! Step over the barricade\u2014show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d The metal barrier, marked with city warnings, stood between us and the heart of the protest.\n\nAs a grandfather, I wanted to show my grandson how to stand up for what he believes in, to be brave and principled. But as a citizen, I knew the law was clear\u2014crossing that line meant breaking rules meant to keep order and protect property. My heart pounded as I felt his small hand in mine, his trust heavy on my shoulders. I could see the expectation in his face, waiting for my answer, while the crowd\u2019s demand pressed in from the other side. I hesitated, torn between the wisdom I owed my grandson and the responsibility I owed my city."}
