My son stood by the manager\u2019s office, eyes red, clutching a half-opened bag of chips. As his mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to help him understand the seriousness of stealing and guide him toward honesty and responsibility. But as I knelt to speak with him, my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the volunteer coordinator. The food pantry was at risk of being shut down unless all volunteers immediately followed the new safety procedures. I was expected to be there, to help implement the changes and support the team. My mind raced between the two worlds: my son\u2019s trembling hands and the urgent call to duty from the pantry. Both needed me, both demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my heart torn between the child who needed my guidance and the community that depended on my commitment."}
