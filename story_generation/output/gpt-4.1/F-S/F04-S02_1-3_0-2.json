As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her\u2014she\u2019d always been my biggest supporter, and I wanted to show up for her the way she always had for me.\n\nBut as I glanced up from my phone, the crowd around me surged with anxiety. The police had started blocking the exits of our peaceful protest, and panic was spreading. As one of the organizers, people looked to me for guidance. I could see the fear in their eyes, and I knew I had to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure everyone got out unharmed.

I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both directions, and I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds that needed me most."}
