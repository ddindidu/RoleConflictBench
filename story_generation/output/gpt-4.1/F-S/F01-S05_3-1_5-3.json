My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and the family needed me\u2014my calm, my presence, my stories that always seemed to soothe the children. I could hear the worry in her voice, the unspoken plea for me to come over and help hold things together. At the same time, my briefcase sat by the door, packed for a minor court hearing scheduled in less than an hour. The case wasn\u2019t urgent, but my client expected me to be there, to stand by them and represent their interests, no matter how small the stakes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in on me: the grandfather who should be at his family\u2019s side, and the advocate who should never let a client down. My heart ached with the knowledge that, whichever door I walked through, I would be letting someone down. I stared at the clock, torn, the seconds ticking away as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
