As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to help him understand why stealing was unacceptable and guide him toward honesty and responsibility. My heart ached, torn between anger and compassion, wanting to protect him but also knowing I couldn\u2019t let this slide. \n\nAs we walked home, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes was closing soon. As a citizen, I felt a duty to participate, to give feedback that could help shape our community\u2019s future. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved, to set an example of civic responsibility. But now, my mind was consumed by my son\u2019s actions and how to address them. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my child needed my full attention, but so did my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly do justice to either in this moment."}
