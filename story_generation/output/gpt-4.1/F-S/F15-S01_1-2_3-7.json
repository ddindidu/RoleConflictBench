Just as I reached for a napkin, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a reminder about the new safety steps we\u2019d been briefed on yesterday. \u201cEveryone must model these procedures at all times, even at home,\u201d the message read. I glanced at the checklist taped to the fridge, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders.\n\nMy son\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for approval or maybe just a little patience. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no exceptions, no shortcuts. I felt torn. Should I pause our morning routine to demonstrate the new safety steps, even if it meant disrupting the gentle rhythm of our lesson on manners? Or should I focus on the values I\u2019d promised myself to teach him, risking the appearance of not fully committing to my volunteer responsibilities? The two roles tugged at me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between them."}
