My phone buzzed again\u2014my stepbrother, Sam, texting from his room. \u201cCan you help me? I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d I could hear the anxiety in his words, and I knew he needed me. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d get through this. But the clock was ticking. My client\u2019s hearing was tomorrow, and I still hadn\u2019t finished reviewing the evidence. They were counting on me to be sharp, thorough, and completely focused. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Sam\u2019s trust in me as his family, my client\u2019s trust in me as their advocate. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the brother who needed comfort and the client who needed justice. I closed my eyes, wishing I could split myself in two, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
