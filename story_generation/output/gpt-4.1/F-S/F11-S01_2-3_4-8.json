Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to Mom\u2014that I show up. Family dinners were rare these days, and my absence would be noticed. But just as I was about to reply, another notification popped up. It was from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cUrgent\u2014everyone must be at the center by 6:30. New procedures are mandatory tonight. If we don\u2019t comply, we risk being shut down.\u201d My heart pounded. The center relied on us, and I\u2019d promised to be dependable. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s hopes pressing on one side, the responsibility to my team and the people we serve on the other. I sat frozen, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
