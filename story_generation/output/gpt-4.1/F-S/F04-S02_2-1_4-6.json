My sister was telling a story, and my parents were laughing, their faces lit by the warm glow of the dining room light. I knew how much these family dinners meant to them\u2014how they expected me to be present, to listen, to share in the small joys of our lives. But my mind kept drifting to the notification on my phone. The post about our cause was exploding online, and I knew this was the moment to reach thousands, maybe more, with a thoughtful comment. My fellow activists were counting on me to seize this opportunity, to educate and inspire while the world was watching. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my movement\u2019s need for my voice. My heart pounded as I stared at my plate, torn between the laughter around me and the urgent call to action vibrating in my pocket."}
