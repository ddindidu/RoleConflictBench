He sat across from me, voice trembling as he shared how overwhelmed he felt at work, how he worried he was letting our family down. I could see he needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he was doing his best. My heart ached for him, and I wanted nothing more than to stay, to offer the comfort he rarely asked for.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in ten minutes. If I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself and my friends I would do, to have a say in our future.
