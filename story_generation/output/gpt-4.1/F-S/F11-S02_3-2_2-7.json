I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d My heart clenched. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. I could hear her voice trembling in my mind, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious.\n\nBut the producer was already waving at me through the glass, mouthing, \u201cTwo minutes!\u201d I was supposed to go live and talk about the campaign I\u2019d poured my soul into, to educate the community and maybe, just maybe, make a difference. People were counting on me to speak up, to be the voice for those who couldn\u2019t.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My sister needed me now, but so did the cause I\u2019d fought so hard for. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt my breath catch, caught between the person I was to her and the person I was to everyone else."}
