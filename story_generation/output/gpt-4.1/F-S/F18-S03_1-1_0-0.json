He clutched his notes, barely listening as I tried to lighten the mood. Suddenly, he crumpled up a snack wrapper and, without thinking, tossed it onto the grass. I froze, glancing at the bright no-littering sign and the trash bin just a few steps away. As a citizen, I knew I should say something, remind him of the rules and the importance of respecting our shared spaces. But as his sibling, I saw the stress etched on his face, the way his hands shook. He needed comfort, not criticism. My mind raced, torn between the urge to gently correct him and the desire to let it slide, just this once, for his sake. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between my responsibility to my brother and my duty to my community."}
