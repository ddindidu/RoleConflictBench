It\u2019s a ritual\u2014my mom waits for my voice, my dad always asks about my week. Tonight, as I\u2019m about to dial, my phone buzzes with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter starts in fifteen minutes. I\u2019m supposed to be there on time, but I know the others can handle things if I\u2019m a bit late. Still, I promised myself I\u2019d be reliable, not just another name on the schedule. My parents, though, expect this call. They worry if I skip it, and I can already picture my mom\u2019s anxious texts if I don\u2019t check in. I stare at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I call home, I\u2019ll be late to the shelter. If I rush out now, I\u2019ll break my parents\u2019 trust. My chest tightens as I weigh the disappointment I might cause either way, torn between being a good son and a dependable volunteer."}
