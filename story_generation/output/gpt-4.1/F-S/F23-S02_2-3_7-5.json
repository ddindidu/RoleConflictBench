My partner\u2019s son, Jamie, sits across from me, quietly working on his homework, unaware of the numbers swirling in my head. Rent is due in three days, and the grocery list is growing longer. I promised my family I\u2019d pick up an extra shift tonight\u2014money we desperately need. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from the activist group: the vote on the housing bill is happening in an hour, and the swing representative is still undecided. They need me to call, to share my story, to help tip the scales. I know how much this bill matters to families like ours. But if I don\u2019t go to work, we might not make rent. My heart pounds as I look at Jamie, then at my phone, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me apart."}
