Dad barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer the comfort of my presence. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the petition deadline was in ten minutes. The group chat was alive with messages, urging everyone to sign and share, reminding us how crucial this moment was for the campaign. My heart pounded as I looked from my parents to the glowing screen. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family\u2019s silent plea for support, and the urgent call to action from my fellow activists. I wanted to be the daughter who could ease their worries, but I also wanted to be the activist who didn\u2019t let her community down. My hands trembled as I hovered over the petition link, torn between the two worlds that needed me right now."}
