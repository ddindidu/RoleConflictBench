My heart dropped as she revealed the crumpled candy wrappers in my daughter\u2019s pocket. As a mother, I knew I had to teach her about honesty and consequences, to guide her gently but firmly. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014messages from fellow activists. The police had started blocking the exits at the protest I\u2019d helped organize, and people were scared, needing direction. I could almost hear the chants and shouts, feel the tension rising. My mind raced: my child needed me to be present, to teach her right from wrong, but my community needed me too, to keep them safe and calm. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. I looked at my daughter\u2019s anxious eyes, then at my phone, torn between two parts of myself, not knowing which to answer first."}
