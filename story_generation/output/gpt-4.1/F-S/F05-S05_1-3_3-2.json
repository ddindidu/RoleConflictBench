But my phone buzzes again\u2014my client, desperate, her message marked urgent. She\u2019s facing a deadline, and my advice could change everything for her. I know she\u2019s waiting, probably refreshing her inbox, hoping for clarity and reassurance. My wife, meanwhile, is in the kitchen, the clatter of dishes a quiet plea for partnership. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the need to be present at home, to show I care through action, and the professional duty to be precise, reliable, and available. My mind races, torn between the comfort of my family and the responsibility to my client. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the laundry and my laptop both calling my name, each demanding a different version of me."}
