It\u2019s your turn to lead the ceremony. It means a lot to your father.\u201d I knew how important this was\u2014honoring ancestors, keeping the tradition alive, showing respect. But as I rehearsed the prayers, my phone buzzed with a city alert: \u201cExtreme heat advisory. Check on vulnerable neighbors.\u201d I immediately thought of Mrs. Lin, who lived alone down the hall. She\u2019d fainted last summer during a heatwave. The ceremony was set for noon, the hottest part of the day. My family expected me to be present, focused, and reverent, but as a citizen, I felt responsible for Mrs. Lin\u2019s safety. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for tradition, my community\u2019s need for care. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both a good step-child and a good neighbor, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
