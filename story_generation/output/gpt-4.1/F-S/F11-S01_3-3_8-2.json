He was upset about something I\u2019d said last night, and he wanted to talk it out before he left for school. As his sister, I know how important it is to build mutual respect between us, and I\u2019ve promised myself to always communicate openly, especially when there\u2019s a misunderstanding. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. I was also scheduled to volunteer at the community center in half an hour, and I\u2019m the only one with the keys to unlock the doors. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to start the day\u2019s service. My brother\u2019s voice trembled on the phone, and I could hear the hurt in his words. At the same time, I imagined the line forming at the center, people growing impatient in the morning chill. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn\u2014how could I be the sister my brother needed and the reliable volunteer everyone expected? My mind raced, caught between the urge to stay and listen, and the duty to leave and serve."}
