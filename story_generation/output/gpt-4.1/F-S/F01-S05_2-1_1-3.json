It was a minor case, nothing that would make headlines, but I owed it to my client to be thorough and present. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s been really down lately.\u201d I looked up and saw my grandson sitting across from me, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the floor. I knew he needed me\u2014not as an advocate, but as his grandfather, someone who could offer comfort and wisdom, maybe even a story from my own tangled youth to help him find his way.\n\nBut the bailiff called my name, and I felt the weight of my other role pressing in. My client was counting on me to be focused, to represent them with all the skill I could muster. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the courtroom and my professional duty, and toward my grandson, who needed me in a way only a grandfather could understand."}
