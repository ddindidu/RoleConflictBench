I wanted to give her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades, to help her feel less alone in her confusion. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014a reminder from my activist group. The petition to protect local green spaces was closing in minutes, and my signature, along with a personal note, could make a difference. I\u2019d promised the group I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d always stand up for our cause. My granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face tugged at my heart, but so did the urgent call to action.
