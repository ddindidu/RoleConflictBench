I know how much they look forward to these calls, especially since I moved out of state. They worry if I miss even one. But as I glance at the clock, my heart sinks. I have a court session in less than an hour\u2014one that could determine the outcome for a client who\u2019s counting on me. The courthouse is across town, and I need to leave now to make it on time. My parents\u2019 voices echo in my mind, asking about my week, wanting to hear I\u2019m okay. At the same time, I feel the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I\u2019ll be there, prepared and punctual. My phone sits heavy in my hand as I stand by the door, torn between the daughter my parents need and the advocate my client deserves."}
