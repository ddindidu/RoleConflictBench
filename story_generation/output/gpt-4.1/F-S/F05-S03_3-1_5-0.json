Her family was coming over, and she\u2019d made it clear that the house had to be spotless. I promised I\u2019d help with the cleaning, and I could see the relief in her eyes. We started together, but after an hour, I needed a break. I told her I\u2019d take a quick walk to clear my head and promised to be back soon to finish the chores.\n\nAs I strolled through the park, I absentmindedly finished a snack and found myself holding the wrapper. The nearest trash bin was a bit out of the way, and I was already thinking about the long list of chores waiting at home. If I took the time to walk over and dispose of the wrapper properly, I\u2019d be gone longer, and my wife would be left to handle everything herself. But if I just tossed it aside, I\u2019d be breaking the law and disrespecting the community\u2014a small act, but one that went against everything I believed in as a responsible citizen. I stood there, torn, the wrapper crumpled in my hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
