It was my sister, her voice trembling. \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. As her brother, I knew she expected me to be there, to listen, to comfort her like I always had. But my client\u2019s case was scheduled for the morning\u2014a complex dispute that could change the course of their life. They were counting on me to be prepared, to represent them with every ounce of focus I had. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my family\u2019s need for support, my professional duty to my client. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to my sister\u2019s side and the responsibility to pore over the case details one more time. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, caught between the brother she needed and the advocate I was expected to be."}
