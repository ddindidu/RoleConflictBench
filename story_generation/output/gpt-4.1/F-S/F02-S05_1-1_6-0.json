The Nintendo, remember?\u201d His birthday was coming up, and I\u2019d assured him I\u2019d get it, but the numbers in my bank account told a different story. As a father, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy. But as an advocate, my phone buzzed with messages from clients seeking advice, even outside office hours. They expected clarity and precision, not vague reassurances. Yet, lately, I\u2019d found myself giving hurried, general explanations, distracted by thoughts of bills and my son\u2019s wish. The pressure to provide for my family clashed with my duty to my clients. I felt torn\u2014should I stretch our finances for my son\u2019s happiness, or focus on my work, ensuring I gave my clients the attention and accuracy they deserved? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between the expectations of fatherhood and the demands of my profession."}
