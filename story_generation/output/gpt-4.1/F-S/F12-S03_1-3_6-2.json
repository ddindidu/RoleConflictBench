He asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the demonstration I\u2019d attended. I wanted to be honest, to share everything with him as we always promised, but I could still feel the tension in my chest from earlier. At the protest, the crowd surged forward, and someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, just step over. We have to make them listen.\u201d The barricade was right there, a thin line between us and the city hall steps\u2014clearly marked as off-limits. I knew the law, knew what was expected of me as a citizen: respect boundaries, don\u2019t trespass, don\u2019t disrupt. But the energy of the crowd, the urgency in their voices, made it hard to stand still. Now, at home, my husband\u2019s eyes searched mine for the truth. I wanted to tell him everything, to be open, but I also worried about what he\u2019d think if I admitted how close I\u2019d come to crossing that line. The words caught in my throat, torn between honesty and the weight of my responsibilities."}
