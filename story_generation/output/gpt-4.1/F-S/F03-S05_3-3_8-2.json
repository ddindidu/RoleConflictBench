The case was urgent\u2014she needed my legal advice before the end of the day, and any delay could cost her dearly. I glanced at my laptop, legal documents open and half-read, my mind racing through statutes and possible outcomes. Just then, my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and voice trembling as she began to share something deeply personal. She needed me, not as an advocate, but as her son\u2014someone to listen, to comfort, to reassure her that things would be okay. I could see the expectation in her eyes, the silent plea for support. At the same time, my phone vibrated again, the client\u2019s urgency pressing in on me. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the family that raised me and the client who depended on my expertise. The weight of both roles pressed down, and I struggled to breathe, caught between the demands of being a good son and a responsible advocate, unsure which need to answer first."}
