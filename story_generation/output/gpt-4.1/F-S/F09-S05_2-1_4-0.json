I knew I should call him back, remind him about respecting public spaces and behaving properly\u2014after all, teaching him discipline and good manners is my responsibility as his mother. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a client, anxious about a legal issue, expecting me to provide clear, accurate advice even in this impromptu consultation. I glanced at my son, now weaving dangerously close to a display of glass jars, and then at my phone, the client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. My mind raced, torn between the urge to guide my child and the professional duty to my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, composed, and effective. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the needs of my child and the expectations of my profession, unsure which voice to answer first."}
