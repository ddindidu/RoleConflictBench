My spouse stood across from me, eyes clouded with worry, voice trembling as they finally opened up about the stress at work and the anxiety that had been building for weeks. I knew how much it meant for them to have me listen, to be present and supportive, to communicate openly like we promised we would. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the high-stakes court proceeding was about to begin, and my presence was non-negotiable. As an advocate, I was expected to be punctual, to show unwavering commitment to my client, whose future could hinge on my performance today. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on my spouse\u2019s words, feeling the weight of their trust and the urgency of my professional duty pulling me in opposite directions. I could see the hope in their eyes, waiting for me to respond, while the clock ticked mercilessly toward my other obligation."}
