My sister was making pancakes, and my parents were packing the car for our annual family trip to the lake\u2014a tradition I\u2019d never missed. As the oldest brother, I was expected to help organize, keep the younger kids entertained, and be present for every moment. But today was also Election Day. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, so there was no excuse not to vote. My parents reminded me how important it was to be together, especially since my little brother had been looking forward to this trip for weeks. At the same time, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me. I knew how much my vote mattered, and I didn\u2019t want to let myself\u2014or my community\u2014down. As I loaded bags into the car, my mind raced, torn between the warmth of family expectations and the responsibility I felt as a voter. The clock ticked, and I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
