My younger brother, helmet askew, grinned at me from the top of a battered ramp someone had dragged into the demonstration. He was determined to try a new skateboard trick, even though the ramp was steep and the pavement cracked. As his older sibling, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014he counted on me to watch out for him, to keep him safe. But then, a voice from the crowd called out, urging us to step past the police barricade onto the city\u2019s restricted property, claiming it was our right to protest. My brother looked at me, eyes shining with excitement and a little fear, waiting for my signal. I felt the weight of my duty as a citizen, knowing the law was clear and the property wasn\u2019t ours to use. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to protect my brother and the pressure to stand with the crowd, torn between keeping him safe and respecting the rules that bound us all."}
