My daughter\u2019s message flashes on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom, we\u2019re all calling at 6 to plan the holiday dinner!\u201d I glance at the clock\u20145:45. My heart warms at the thought of hearing my grandchildren\u2019s laughter, the way they always ask me to make my special pie. Family holidays are sacred, a time to remind everyone that we belong to each other.\n\nBut then I see the flyer on the kitchen table: \u201cLast chance to vote on the neighborhood safety measure\u2014polls close at 7.\u201d I promised myself I\u2019d be more involved, that I\u2019d do my part as a citizen. The polling place is only a few blocks away, but if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the call. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to have a say in something that could change our street.\n\nMy phone buzzes again. My coat hangs by the door. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, my love for my family and my duty to my community pulling me in opposite directions."}
