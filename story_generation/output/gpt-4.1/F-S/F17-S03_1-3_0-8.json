Hope you\u2019re both well.\u201d It was something small, but I knew it meant a lot to them. Just as I started typing, the building alarms blared, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. I looked out the window\u2014water was already creeping up the street, and people were shouting in the hallway, urging everyone to help move sandbags and check on neighbors.\n\nMy parents always worried about me, especially during emergencies. I knew they\u2019d want to hear from me right away, to know I was safe. But as a member of this community, I felt a responsibility to help, to do my part in keeping everyone safe. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between reassuring my parents and rushing out to help my neighbors. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught between the pull of family and the call of duty."}
