I glance at the screen\u2014my organization\u2019s post about climate action is exploding online. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, if I can just add the right comment now. But before I can type a word, I hear my son\u2019s laughter echoing down the aisle. He\u2019s weaving between carts, nearly knocking over a display. Other shoppers are starting to stare. I know I should go to him, kneel down, and explain why we don\u2019t run indoors, why we respect others\u2019 space. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014teaches, guides, corrects. But my fingers itch to type, to seize this fleeting opportunity for my cause. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the eyes of strangers expecting me to parent, the silent crowd online waiting for my voice. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the lesson my son needs and the message the world might finally hear."}
