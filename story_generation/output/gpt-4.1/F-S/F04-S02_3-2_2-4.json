She\u2019s been struggling since the breakup, and tonight she finally asks, \u201cCan you talk?\u201d I see the tears in her eyes, the way she\u2019s holding herself together by a thread. I want to be there for her\u2014she\u2019s always been my confidant, and I promised I\u2019d never let her down when she needed me.\n\nBut then my phone vibrates again. It\u2019s a call from the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014the chance to push for the bill that could change so many lives. The aide says she only has ten minutes, right now, and if I miss this, I might not get another shot.\n\nI stand in the hallway, my heart pounding, torn between the sister who needs me and the cause I\u2019ve poured myself into. Both expect me to show up, to be present, to care. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both worlds presses down on me as I stare at my ringing phone and my sister\u2019s pleading eyes."}
