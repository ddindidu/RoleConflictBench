My phone buzzed with reminders about the court session\u2014this was a pivotal day for my client, and my presence was non-negotiable. Yet, across from me, my granddaughter sat hunched over her cereal, eyes rimmed red, her spoon swirling aimlessly. I recognized that look; she was carrying a weight she didn\u2019t know how to share. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she\u2019d always found in my stories and hugs. But the advocate in me heard the ticking clock, the silent demand to be in that courtroom, to fight for justice. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s need for guidance against my client\u2019s need for my advocacy. The seconds slipped by, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
