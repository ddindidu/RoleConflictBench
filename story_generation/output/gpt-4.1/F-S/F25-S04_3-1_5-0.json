I knew how important this tradition was to her, to the family\u2014how it was supposed to show unity, respect, and belonging. But as I nodded, my mind kept drifting to the polling station across town. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, to have my say, to be responsible. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but the ceremony would take hours, and I could already feel the tension building inside me. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmother, maybe even make her question my place in the family. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk missing my chance to vote, to stand up for what I believe in. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between honoring my family and fulfilling my civic duty."}
