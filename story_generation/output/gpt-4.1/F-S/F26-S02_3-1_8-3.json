It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson, always so quiet, has been struggling lately, and now something serious has happened. I know my family expects me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and advice. I reach for the phone, but just then, my activist group\u2019s chat lights up. The petition we\u2019ve been working on for weeks\u2014demanding mental health reforms for youth\u2014is about to be sent to the senator. There\u2019s a final call for signatures, and my name, as a known advocate, could make a difference. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needs me now, but so do the countless families who might benefit from this policy change. My heart aches as I stare at the phone in one hand and the laptop in the other, torn between the immediate needs of my loved ones and the broader cause I\u2019ve devoted myself to."}
