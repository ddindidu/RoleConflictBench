I could see the tension rising in the crowd, and as one of the organizers, I knew I had to act fast\u2014coordinate a safe response, keep everyone calm, and make sure no one got hurt. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from my granddaughter. She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was lighting up with her excitement. I knew how much it meant to her that I was involved, that I listened and celebrated her milestones. I could almost hear my wife\u2019s voice reminding me to be present, to show her how proud I am. But the shouts around me grew louder, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between sending a quick, heartfelt reply and focusing on the urgent task at hand. The expectations of being a supportive grandfather and a responsible activist crashed together inside me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
