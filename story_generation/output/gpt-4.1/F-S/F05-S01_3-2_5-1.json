She\u2019s counting on me to help make the house spotless, especially since her parents still remember the last time we were caught unprepared. I started folding laundry, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease be on time. We\u2019re short-staffed and every minute counts.\u201d I glanced at the clock. My shift starts in an hour, and the shelter relies on me to help serve lunch. My wife poked her head in, \u201cCan you mop the floors next?\u201d I could see the stress in her eyes. I wanted to be there for her, but I also knew the shelter needed me. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment I might cause at home against the commitment I made to the people counting on me at the shelter. I stood in the hallway, torn, the vacuum humming in the background and my phone vibrating in my hand."}
