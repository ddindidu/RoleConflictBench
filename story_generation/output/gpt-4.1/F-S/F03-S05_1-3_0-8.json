Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the court session starts. As an advocate, I know how critical my punctuality is today; the judge has warned us that any delay could jeopardize our client\u2019s case. Still, I can\u2019t ignore the guilt gnawing at me. My parents expect me to check in, to be the son who remembers to call, even if just for a few minutes. I picture them waiting, hoping for my voice, while I\u2019m here, suit pressed, files in hand, mind racing with legal arguments. My heart tugs in two directions: the duty to my family, who raised me to be thoughtful and present, and the responsibility to my client, who trusts me to fight for them. The courtroom doors loom ahead, my phone warm in my palm, and I stand frozen, torn between the roles that define me."}
