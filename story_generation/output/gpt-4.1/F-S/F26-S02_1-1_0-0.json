The protest was starting now, and I\u2019d promised to help make our voices heard. Just then, my grandson, Ethan, wandered in, his brow furrowed. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new? Like, really ready?\u201d He looked at me, searching for the kind of wisdom he believed only I could offer. I felt the weight of his trust, the expectation to guide him with patience and care. But my mind was split\u2014my heart tugged toward the cause I\u2019d fought for, the people waiting for me to stand beside them. Ethan\u2019s question hung in the air, and I could see he needed me now, not later. My phone buzzed again, urgency in every vibration. I sat there, torn, feeling the pressure of two worlds colliding, unsure which call to answer first."}
