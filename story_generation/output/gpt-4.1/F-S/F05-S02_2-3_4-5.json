My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014she\u2019s counting on me to get this done before our daughter\u2019s soccer game tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d help more, that I\u2019d be present, not just physically but in the daily grind of our life together. But my phone buzzes with a message from the activist group: the vote is happening now, and the undecided representative is taking calls for the next hour only. This is the moment we\u2019ve been working toward for months. If I don\u2019t act, we could lose everything we\u2019ve fought for. My heart pounds as I look from the laundry to my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the partner my family deserves, but I also can\u2019t ignore the cause that defines so much of who I am. The seconds tick by, and I\u2019m paralyzed, torn between the home I\u2019ve built and the world I\u2019m trying to change."}
