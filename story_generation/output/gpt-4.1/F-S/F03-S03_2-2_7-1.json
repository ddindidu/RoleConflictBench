Tonight, they finally asked if I could stay in and play some music for them, something to lift their spirits. I could see how much they needed it, how much they needed me. But as I set up my keyboard, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours had just started. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open, and she\u2019s complained before about noise. As a citizen, I know I should respect the rules and her right to peace. But as a son, I can\u2019t ignore the hope in my parents\u2019 eyes, the way they look to me for comfort. My hands hover over the keys, my heart pounding, torn between the warmth of family and the duty to my community."}
