The fridge was nearly empty, and the rent was due in a week. I knew I had to find a way to bring in more money\u2014my family depended on me. That\u2019s when my friend texted, offering a last-minute gig: a late-evening music set at a nearby bar. The pay would cover groceries and a bit more. But the bar was in our building, and the music would spill out into the courtyard, right during the building\u2019s quiet hours. I remembered the last time someone played loud music late; our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had complained about her open windows and her baby\u2019s sleep. As a citizen, I believed in respecting the rules and my neighbors\u2019 peace. But as a step-parent, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing down on me. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the promise of a solution and the risk of letting someone else down."}
