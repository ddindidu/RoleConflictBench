The demonstration was loud, passionate, and tense. Suddenly, a group near us began urging everyone to step past the police barricade, claiming it was the only way to make our voices heard. My brother looked at me, his eyes wide with uncertainty. As his sister, I knew he expected me to guide him, to show him how to handle conflict and misunderstandings with respect and open communication. I wanted to set an example, to help him see that we could stand up for what we believed in without disrespecting others. But as a citizen, I also felt the weight of the law pressing on me\u2014the expectation to respect public property and the rights of everyone, even those on the other side of the barricade. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to support my brother\u2019s desire to be heard and my responsibility to uphold the law. The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I felt torn, caught between being the sister he needed and the citizen I was supposed to be."}
