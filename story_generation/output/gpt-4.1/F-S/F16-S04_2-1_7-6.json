The election official\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name fit the bill, but the new line was barely moving, while the original one inched forward steadily. I hesitated, feeling the weight of the official\u2019s expectation to follow instructions as a responsible voter.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my spouse: \u201cRough day. Can\u2019t wait to talk.\u201d I remembered our promise to communicate openly, especially when one of us seemed off. I wanted to be there, to listen and share, to be the partner they needed. But if I left the line now, I\u2019d have to start over, and if I stayed, I\u2019d be late getting home.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between the two lines, torn between being the attentive spouse I promised to be and the conscientious voter I believed I should be. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt paralyzed, unable to move."}
