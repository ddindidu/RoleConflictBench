She\u2019d come to me, voice trembling, asking if she could host a small music night with her friends in my apartment. She needed a safe space, she said, somewhere she could express herself and feel supported. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to nurture her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she sought. She looked at me, hoping I\u2019d say yes, that I\u2019d help her find her voice and her confidence.\n\nBut as a resident of this building, I knew the rules: quiet hours started at nine, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open in the evenings. She\u2019d complained before about noise, and I\u2019d promised to be considerate. The law and the building\u2019s guidelines were clear, and I prided myself on being a respectful citizen, someone who valued the peace and rights of others.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my granddaughter\u2019s need for support, and toward my responsibility to my neighbors and the community. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
