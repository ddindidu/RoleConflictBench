The kids\u2019 laughter echoed from the next room, but all I could think about was the dwindling balance in our bank account.

Every dollar mattered, and every hour I could spend working meant a little more security for my family.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder for the morning\u2019s legal meeting. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. Missing a session or arriving late could mean letting down a client, or worse, damaging my reputation.
