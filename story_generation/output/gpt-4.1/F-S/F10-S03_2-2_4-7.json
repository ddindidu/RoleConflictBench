She wants me to help prepare for the evening\u2019s ritual, just as we always have, and she says it\u2019s my duty as her daughter to honor our heritage. But as I was setting out the ingredients, I heard the news: a severe heat advisory has been issued, and everyone is urged to check on vulnerable neighbors. Mrs. Lee, who lives alone down the hall, is elderly and frail. The city\u2019s public service announcement urges citizens to look out for people like her, to make sure they have water and a cool place to stay.

My heart pounds as I glance between the kitchen and the hallway, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which role I should answer first."}
