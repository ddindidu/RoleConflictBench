My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his favorite shirt clean for a work event tomorrow, and the kids\u2019 soccer uniforms were buried somewhere in the heap. I knew the expectation\u2014keep the household running smoothly, share the load, make sure everyone had what they needed. But my phone buzzed with a message from the community center. They needed me to come in early for my volunteer shift; a new family had arrived, and I was the only one available to help them settle in. \n\nAs I folded a towel, my mind drifted to last week, when a neighbor asked about the people I was helping. The conversation had been innocent, but I\u2019d felt the weight of confidentiality pressing on me, the unspoken rule that their stories weren\u2019t mine to share. Now, I felt torn\u2014my family needed me at home, but the center relied on my discretion and presence. The laundry sat unfinished, my phone buzzed again, and I felt the tension rising, pulled between two worlds that both needed me, both expecting me to be fully present."}
