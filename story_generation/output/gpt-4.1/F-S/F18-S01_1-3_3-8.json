Mom wanted us all to go hiking, and Dad suggested a movie night. My sister looked at me, eyes bright, waiting for my input. I knew how much these moments meant to them, especially since we rarely had time together anymore. Just as I was about to chime in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cUrgent\u2014new procedures must be implemented this weekend. Attendance mandatory. Service depends on it.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised to help at the shelter, and now, if I didn\u2019t show up and follow the new rules, the whole operation could be at risk. But if I left my family hanging, I\u2019d disappoint them again. I could feel their expectations pressing in from both sides, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once."}
