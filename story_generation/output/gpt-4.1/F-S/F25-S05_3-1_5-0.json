It\u2019s your turn to lead the family ceremony this year. Your father would be proud.\u201d Her eyes were hopeful, and I felt the weight of tradition settle on my shoulders. I wanted to honor my new family, to show them I belonged, but the rituals were unfamiliar, and I worried about making a mistake.\n\nLater that afternoon, my phone buzzed with a message from a client. She wanted to discuss her case, just casually, she said. As an advocate, I knew I had to be precise, to avoid giving advice that could be misunderstood. But she was anxious, desperate for reassurance, and I found myself explaining general legal concepts, careful not to cross the line into specific guidance.\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family needing me to step up, my client needing clarity. I felt torn, the roles pulling me in opposite directions. How could I be the reliable step-child my family wanted, while also being the responsible advocate my client needed? The pressure built inside me, and I sat in silence, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
