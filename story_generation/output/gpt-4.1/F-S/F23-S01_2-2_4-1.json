My volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today.\u201d But here I was, in the supermarket, trailing behind my stepson, who darted between aisles, giggling and ignoring my calls. Other shoppers shot me disapproving looks. I knew I should stop him, teach him about respect and discipline\u2014wasn\u2019t that what I promised his father? But every minute I spent here meant I\u2019d be late for my shift, letting down the team that counted on me. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I felt the pressure mounting. Should I chase after him and risk being late, or hurry him along and miss the chance to teach him right from wrong? My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
