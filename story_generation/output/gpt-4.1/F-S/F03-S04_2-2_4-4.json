Today is the day we honor our ancestors, a tradition my family holds sacred. My parents expect me to be present, to help prepare offerings and recite prayers, just as generations before us have done. But as I help set the table, I remember that my voter ID is still at home, across town. The polls close tomorrow, and today is my only chance to retrieve it before work swallows my time. My father catches my distracted gaze and reminds me, \u201cFamily comes first, always.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of his words. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore the civic duty pressing on my mind\u2014the expectation to participate in shaping our country\u2019s future. My heart pounds as I weigh the disappointment in my parents\u2019 eyes against the responsibility I feel as a voter. The clock ticks, and I stand at the threshold, torn between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and fulfilling my role as a citizen."}
