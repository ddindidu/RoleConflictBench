The polling station was just a few blocks away, and my schedule was clear. As I was about to leave, I noticed my stepdad sitting alone at the kitchen table, staring into his coffee. Mom had left for work already, and the house felt unusually quiet. I remembered how I\u2019d promised myself to check in more, to be the kind of step-child who noticed when things weren\u2019t right. I hesitated, keys in hand, torn between my civic duty and the silent plea in his posture. If I sat down to talk, I might be late for voting, but if I left now, I\u2019d be ignoring the expectation to support my family. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one voice urging me to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen, the other whispering that family should come first. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between the polling station and the kitchen table, unsure which role I owed more in that moment."}
