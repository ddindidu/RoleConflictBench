My wife is bustling around the living room, her voice echoing from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help me with the guest room? They\u2019ll be here in two hours!\u201d I know she\u2019s counting on me to vacuum, set out fresh towels, and make sure everything is spotless before her relatives arrive. I promised I\u2019d share the load, and I see the stress in her eyes as she juggles a dozen tasks.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district is starting now. I\u2019ve been waiting for this\u2014an opportunity to hear the candidates\u2019 positions, ask questions, and fulfill my responsibility as an engaged citizen. I believe in being informed, in participating, in making my voice heard. The forum is live, and if I miss it, I\u2019ll lose my chance to interact directly.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn. My wife\u2019s expectations and the promise I made to her pull me one way, while my sense of civic duty tugs me in another. My heart pounds as I weigh the demands, feeling the tension rise with every passing minute."}
