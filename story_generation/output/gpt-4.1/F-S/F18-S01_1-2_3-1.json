My family was gathered around, tossing out ideas for our weekend together\u2014hiking, a movie, maybe brunch at Mom\u2019s favorite caf\u00e9. My little brother looked at me, eyes bright, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right? It\u2019s been ages since we all did something together.\u201d I felt the weight of their expectation, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d finally say yes and be present, not just in the room but really there.\n\nBut then I remembered the message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease be on time tomorrow. We\u2019re short-staffed and need everyone as soon as the doors open.\u201d I knew how much they depended on me, how every minute counted when people were waiting for help. My heart twisted, caught between the warmth of my family\u2019s laughter and the responsibility tugging me toward the shelter. I wanted to be both places, to not let anyone down, but the clock was ticking and I could feel the pressure building, knowing I\u2019d have to choose."}
