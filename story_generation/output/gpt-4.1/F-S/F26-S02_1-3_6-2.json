The police have started blocking the exits, and I can see the worry ripple through the protesters. My fellow organizers look to me, expecting quick thinking and calm leadership. I know I need to help coordinate a safe response, to keep everyone calm and ensure no one gets hurt. But as I glance at my phone, I see a string of messages from my daughter: \u201cAre you coming for the holiday dinner? The kids are asking for you.\u201d It\u2019s our family tradition, a rare chance to reconnect, and I promised I\u2019d be there. My grandchildren expect stories and laughter, my children expect my presence, and I feel the weight of their hopes. I\u2019m torn, standing between the urgent needs of the protest and the gentle pull of my family, my mind racing as I try to decide where I am needed most."}
