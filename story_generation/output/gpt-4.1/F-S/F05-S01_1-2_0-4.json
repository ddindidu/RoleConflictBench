My wife greeted me with a tired smile, mentioning offhand that her day had been a bit rough\u2014her boss had been short with her, and a project deadline had moved up. I could see she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort she always gives me. But my thoughts kept drifting back to the volunteer shift I\u2019d just finished. A client, eyes downcast, had confided something deeply personal to me while I helped her with paperwork. She\u2019d asked me not to tell anyone, and the weight of her trust pressed on me. Now, as my wife talked, I felt torn. She expected my full attention, my empathy, but my mind was tangled in the responsibility of holding someone else\u2019s secret. I wanted to be the supportive husband she deserved, but the burden of confidentiality from my volunteer role wouldn\u2019t let me go. I sat there, nodding, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, unsure how to be fully present for either."}
