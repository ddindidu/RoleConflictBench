The scent of spices and the sound of laughter from the living room reminded me how much this meant to everyone. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator\u2014an urgent directive. \u201cAll volunteers must follow the new procedures today, or we risk shutting down the service. No exceptions.\u201d I knew how critical my role was; people depended on us for support, and the coordinator trusted me to set an example.
