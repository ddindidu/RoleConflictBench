The school bell will ring in twenty minutes, and my kids will be waiting at the gate, eyes searching the crowd for me. I promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every other day, to hear about their day and carry their backpacks. But today is also election day, and the polling station closes in less than two hours. I can\u2019t shake the sense of duty\u2014my vote matters, and I\u2019ve told my children how important it is to participate, to have a voice. \n\nBut the line at the polling station could be long, and if I go now, I might not make it to school on time. If I pick up the kids first, I risk missing my chance to vote. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to vote!\u201d I grip the steering wheel, torn between being the reliable mother my children expect and the responsible citizen I want to be. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t decide which expectation I\u2019m about to let down."}
