My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his uniform clean for tomorrow\u2019s early meeting, and the kids\u2019 soccer kits were buried somewhere in the pile. I knew I should get started, but my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cUrgent\u2014new procedures must be implemented today, or we risk shutting down the service. Please confirm you can help.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised to help at the shelter, and I knew how much they depended on me, especially now. But at home, the expectation was clear\u2014everyone counted on me to keep things running smoothly. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, torn between the needs of my family and the urgent call from the shelter, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
