I needed to double-check my wallet for my ID, since I\u2019d heard stories of people being turned away for bringing the wrong one. As I walked in, my partner greeted me with a tired smile and mentioned, almost offhand, that work had been a bit rough\u2014nothing major, just a string of annoying meetings and a snippy email from their boss. I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way they lingered in the kitchen, hoping I\u2019d ask about their day.\n\nBut my thoughts kept drifting to the polling station, the ID requirements, and the lines that might form if I waited too long. I knew I could fetch another card later if I needed, but the uncertainty gnawed at me. My partner needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. At the same time, I felt the pressure to fulfill my civic duty, to make sure I had everything in order for voting. I stood there, wallet in hand, torn between sitting down to listen and heading out the door, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
