The home loan repayment loomed over me like a storm cloud, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get to the bank today to sort out the paperwork. As a parent, I couldn\u2019t risk anything jeopardizing our financial stability\u2014missing a payment wasn\u2019t an option. But as I reached for my bag, I realized my valid ID was still at home, and today was my only chance to grab it before work. The polls would be open tomorrow, but if I didn\u2019t have my ID, I couldn\u2019t vote. My child\u2019s future depended on both: a secure home and a say in the country\u2019s direction. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my attention, each unforgiving if neglected. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the bank and the detour home, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
