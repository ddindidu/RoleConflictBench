My spouse\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed, their voice trembling as they finally opened up about the stress at work and the fear of layoffs. I\u2019d promised to listen, to be present, to communicate openly\u2014something we both needed after weeks of drifting apart. But as they spoke, my phone lit up with a call from the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was the moment to push for the policy change I\u2019d poured my heart into, the chance to make a real difference. The aide only had ten minutes, and if I missed this call, the bill might lose its momentum. My spouse\u2019s hand reached for mine, searching for comfort, while my activist side screamed at me to answer the phone. My heart pounded as I sat between two worlds, torn by the demands of love and the urgency of change, not knowing which voice to honor in that fragile moment."}
