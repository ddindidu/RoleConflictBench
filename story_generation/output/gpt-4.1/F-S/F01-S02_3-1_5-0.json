My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cDad, can you come over? We really need you tonight.\u201d My grandson had been having a tough week, and the family was gathering to support him. I knew how much my presence meant\u2014being there, listening, offering comfort. But as I reached for my coat, another message flashed on my screen. It was from Maya, a fellow activist. \u201cWe\u2019re at City Hall now. Not many people here. Can you come? We need more voices.\u201d I could see the live stream\u2014familiar faces holding signs, chanting for justice. I felt the pull in both directions: my family needing me close, my activist friends needing me to stand with them. The weight of expectation pressed on my chest. I wanted to be the steady hand for my grandson, but I also wanted to be the voice for those who had none. My keys jingled in my hand as I stood in the hallway, torn between two worlds, unsure which door to walk through."}
