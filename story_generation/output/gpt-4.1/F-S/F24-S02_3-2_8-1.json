My phone buzzed with messages from the organizing team\u2014everyone was counting on me to lead the first chant, to set the tone for the whole demonstration. Just as I took a deep breath, ready to step forward, I caught sight of my stepbrother, Jamie, across the street. He was distracted, headphones in, about to step off the curb without looking. My stomach twisted. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially since Mom had asked me to keep an eye on him today. But the protest was about to start, and everyone was watching me, waiting. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My feet felt rooted to the spot as I wrestled with what to do next."}
