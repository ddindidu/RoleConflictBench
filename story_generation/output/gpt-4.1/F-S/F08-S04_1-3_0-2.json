My coat is already on, purse in hand, when my granddaughter appears in the doorway, her eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you?\u201d she asks, voice trembling. She\u2019s on the edge of something big, I can tell; she\u2019s never come to me like this before. I know what\u2019s expected of me: to sit, to listen, to offer the kind of advice only years can teach. But the clock ticks louder. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I\u2019d do my part for the future\u2014her future. The polling station is a brisk walk away, but if I leave now, I\u2019ll have to cut her off, maybe miss the moment she needs me most. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote, something I\u2019ve never failed to do. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the wisdom I owe her and the duty I owe my country."}
