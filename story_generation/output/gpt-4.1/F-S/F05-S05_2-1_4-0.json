My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please handle the laundry today? The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I would, knowing how much she juggles already. But as I sort the clothes, my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s a client, anxious and confused, asking for clarification about their case. I know they\u2019re relying on me to give them clear, accurate advice, even in these informal moments. I can hear the tension in their voice, the hope that I\u2019ll make sense of their legal mess. My mind races\u2014if I focus on the laundry, I\u2019ll let my client down. If I dive into the legal explanation, the laundry will sit untouched, and my family will be frustrated. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, my loyalty tugged in two directions, and I stand frozen, torn between the demands of home and the needs of my client."}
