The home loan repayment loomed just two months away, and every cent mattered. As a parent, I felt the weight of ensuring my family\u2019s security, of keeping a roof over our heads. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for tomorrow\u2019s court session. As an advocate, my presence at this high-stakes proceeding was non-negotiable; my client\u2019s future could hinge on my punctuality and focus. But the meeting was scheduled at the same time as a call with the bank manager, the only slot available to negotiate a possible extension on the loan. My mind raced with the expectations pressing in from both sides: my family counting on me to keep us afloat, my client relying on my expertise and commitment. Anxiety twisted in my chest as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that failing in either role could have consequences I wasn\u2019t ready to face."}
