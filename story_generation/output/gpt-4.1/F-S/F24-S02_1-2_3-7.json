I nod, but my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I\u2019m supposed to be on a live radio show in five minutes, talking about the environmental campaign I\u2019ve poured my heart into. My dad starts outlining a hiking trip, and everyone\u2019s looking at me, waiting for my input. I know how much it means to them when I join in, especially since I\u2019m still the \u201cnew\u201d sibling. But the activist in me knows how important this radio segment is; it\u2019s a chance to reach hundreds, maybe thousands, and I promised my team I\u2019d be there.
