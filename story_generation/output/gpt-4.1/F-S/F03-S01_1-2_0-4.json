My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Mom, just checking in. I knew she liked to hear from me on weekends, even if it was just a quick text. As I glanced at my phone, a woman at the table leaned in and whispered about a problem she was having at home, her voice trembling. She asked me not to tell anyone. I nodded, listening carefully, feeling the weight of her trust. But my phone buzzed again, and I could see another message from Mom, probably worried because I hadn\u2019t replied. I felt torn\u2014my parents expected me to stay in touch, but this woman needed my full attention and absolute confidentiality. I wanted to reassure my mom, but I also didn\u2019t want to break the trust of the person in front of me. My hands hovered over my phone, my mind racing, caught between being a good son and a responsible volunteer."}
