Call us when you can.\u201d I know she and Dad expect me to check in, to share how things are going, to keep that connection alive. I promised I\u2019d be better about it, especially since I moved out. But tonight, my district is hosting a live online candidate forum\u2014something I\u2019ve been waiting for all week. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to stay informed, to listen, to maybe even submit a question. The forum is only streaming now, and I know how important it is to participate, to have a voice in my community. My phone buzzes again, another gentle nudge from home. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my parents\u2019 hope for a call, my own sense of duty to civic life. I sit on the edge of my bed, torn, the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my heart racing as I try to decide which role to honor first."}
