Mom\u2019s asking.\u201d The family dinner was already underway, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t be late this time. But here I was, standing in a line at the polling station, my heart pounding. The election official explained, apologetic but firm, that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes.\n\nMy mind raced. As a sister, I was expected to show up, to be present, to not let my family down again. But as a voter, I was being told I had to follow the process, to stay and complete the paperwork, or lose my chance to participate in something I believed mattered. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s disappointment, feel my sister\u2019s frustration. At the same time, the official\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my decision. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of family and the call of civic duty, the weight of both expectations pressing in on me as the minutes ticked away."}
