Mom\u2019s name flashed on the screen, her messages piling up: \u201cHow\u2019s your day?\u201d \u201cDid you eat?\u201d \u201cCall me when you\u2019re free.\u201d I\u2019d always made it a point to answer quickly, to keep her updated, to reassure her that I was okay. She worried if I didn\u2019t. But right now, I was sitting across from a client, explaining the basics of their legal situation. They needed clarity, and I owed them my full attention\u2014no distractions, no half-hearted advice. My mind split in two: the son who never left a message unread, and the advocate who couldn\u2019t afford to be careless. I felt the pressure mounting, my mother\u2019s expectations tugging at me from one side, my client\u2019s trust anchoring me on the other. My phone vibrated again. I glanced at it, heart pounding, torn between the urge to reassure my mother and the duty to guide my client. The weight of both roles pressed down, and I sat there, caught in the silent struggle of choosing who to let down, even if just for a moment."}
