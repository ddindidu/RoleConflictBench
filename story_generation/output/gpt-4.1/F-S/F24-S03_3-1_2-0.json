He\u2019d just learned his father was moving far away, and I could feel the weight of his sadness pressing between us. As we wandered through the park, I tried to think of something comforting to say, but he suddenly stopped, pulled a crumpled soda can from his pocket, and hurled it into the bushes. I froze. The no-littering signs were clear, and the trash bin was only a few steps away. As a citizen, I knew I should pick up the can, maybe even gently remind him about respecting public spaces. But as his step-sibling, I saw how fragile he was, how much he needed me to be on his side, not to scold or correct him right now. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urge to do what was right for the community and the need to support my brother in his pain."}
