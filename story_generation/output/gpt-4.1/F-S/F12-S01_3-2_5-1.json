The house needed to be spotless, and he was counting on me to help with the cleaning, the cooking, and making sure everything looked perfect. I could feel his expectation in the way he glanced at the clock, silently urging me to hurry. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember, we need everyone on time today. The roster is tight.\u201d I knew the shelter would be short-handed if I was late, and the people we serve depend on us. My heart pounded as I looked from the pile of laundry to the clock, then to my volunteer shirt hanging by the door. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect."}
