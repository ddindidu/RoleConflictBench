As a sister, I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially Grandma, who always looked forward to having us all together. I could already picture her smile, the laughter, the warmth of being surrounded by family. But as I glanced at my laptop, the live stream of the candidate forum for our district was about to begin. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved this year\u2014read up on the issues, ask questions, and vote responsibly. My friends and neighbors counted on people like me to help shape our community. The pressure built inside me, tugging me in two directions.
