I felt the familiar pressure of my role as a step-parent\u2014reminding myself that I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, especially in public spaces. My partner trusted me to help guide him, and I wanted to live up to that expectation. Just as I was about to call him back, my phone buzzed. It was a text from the community center where I volunteer. One of the coordinators wanted to chat about a family I\u2019d been helping, and before I knew it, I was on the phone, my voice low as I tried to keep the conversation general. The coordinator asked about the family\u2019s situation, and I felt the tug of my other role\u2014protecting their privacy, not sharing more than I should, even in a casual chat. Meanwhile, my stepson\u2019s laughter echoed down the aisle, drawing annoyed glances. I felt torn, caught between the urge to step in and parent, and the need to be discreet and professional as a volunteer. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
