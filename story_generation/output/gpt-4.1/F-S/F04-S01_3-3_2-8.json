I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I was at the community center, wearing my volunteer badge, sorting supplies for the evening meal service. Just then, the coordinator rushed in, voice tense, announcing a new directive\u2014everyone had to stay and follow strict procedures, or the service would be shut down for the week. No exceptions. My heart pounded. As a brother, I knew my sister was reaching out because she trusted me to be there, to listen and support her when things got tough. But as a volunteer, I was expected to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions without question, especially now, when the whole operation depended on us. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need of my family and the responsibility I\u2019d committed to here. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the people who needed me most."}
