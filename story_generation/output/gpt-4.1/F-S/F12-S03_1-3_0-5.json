The ballot measure about the new zoning law could change the character of our block, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be an engaged citizen, not just someone who complains after the fact. But as I set my bag down, my husband looked up from the couch, his face tired. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he said, trying to sound casual, but I could hear the edge in his voice. I knew he needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort and support that we both valued in our marriage. Yet, the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t leave soon, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote\u2014something I believed was my responsibility as a citizen. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each important in its own way. My heart ached as I stood there, caught between the person I wanted to be for him and the person I wanted to be for my community."}
