She\u2019d just started high school and was struggling to find her place. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when everything felt new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I wanted to give her the thoughtful, reassuring advice she needed, to draw on my years of experience and help her feel less alone. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator. The food pantry where I volunteered was facing a crisis; new safety procedures had to be implemented immediately, or we risked being shut down. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: all volunteers needed to report in and follow the new guidelines without exception. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My granddaughter needed my undivided attention and wisdom, but the pantry and the people who depended on it needed me, too. My heart ached as I sat there, caught between the expectations of being a guiding grandparent and a reliable volunteer, unsure which role to answer first."}
