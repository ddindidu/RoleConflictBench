It means a lot to your dad and me that you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how important these family trips were, especially since I was still finding my place as a step-sibling. They expected me to join in, to help build those connections, to show I cared. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer coordinator\u2019s email from this morning\u2014new safety protocols at the shelter, mandatory for all shifts starting tomorrow. \u201cEveryone must be present for the full shift and follow the updated guidelines,\u201d she\u2019d written. I\u2019d promised to help with the afternoon intake, and I knew how much they were counting on me, especially with the new rules. My stomach twisted as I imagined letting either side down. I wanted to be a good step-sibling, to show up for my family, but I also didn\u2019t want to break my commitment to the shelter or risk anyone\u2019s safety. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
