She\u2019d suggested that, if I had time during my shift, I should reorganize the supply closet to make things easier for everyone. I knew she expected me to take initiative and follow her guidance, especially since I\u2019d been volunteering for a while now. But as I read her message, I heard my brother\u2019s door creak open. He shuffled into the kitchen, eyes rimmed red, clutching his chemistry textbook. His final exam was tomorrow, and he looked more anxious than I\u2019d ever seen him. I remembered our promise to always be there for each other, especially when things got tough. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, maybe even quiz him on formulas. But my shift at the center started in an hour, and I knew the coordinator would appreciate me tackling the supply closet today. I felt torn, my chest tight with the weight of both expectations, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
