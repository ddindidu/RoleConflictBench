I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the advocacy team\u2019s weekly meeting, and I still needed to review my notes. My parents expected daily updates, and I\u2019d always made time to call, even if just to share a small story or reassure them I was okay. But lately, the meetings had multiplied, and my supervisor had stressed the importance of punctuality and full attention. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cWe need you present, not distracted.\u201d \n\nMy mother\u2019s messages grew more insistent: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d Guilt twisted in my stomach. I wanted to reassure her, to be the attentive daughter she counted on. But I also needed to be the reliable advocate my clients depended on. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of my family and the responsibility of my work.
