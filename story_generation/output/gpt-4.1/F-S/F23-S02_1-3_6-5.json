The vote was happening in less than an hour\u2014a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, one that could change lives. They needed me to call the undecided representative now, to add my voice to the last-minute push.

My partner had reminded me this morning: \u201cHe\u2019s been let down before. He needs to know he can count on you.\u201d The money was tight, and I\u2019d planned to pick up the console after work, but if I left now, I\u2019d miss the window to call the legislator.
