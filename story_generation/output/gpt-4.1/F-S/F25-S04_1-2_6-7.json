The poll worker leaned over and pointed out a smudge on my signature. \u201cCould you please re-sign this? It\u2019s important for your vote to count,\u201d she said gently. I nodded, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a text from my stepdad: \u201cRough day. Can you call when you\u2019re done?\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and Mom had asked me to check in more often, to be the glue holding us together.
