My son\u2019s hopeful eyes follow me as I fumble for my wallet. He\u2019s been waiting for weeks, counting down the days until I could finally buy him the Nintendo I promised. I know how much it means to him, especially after all the times I\u2019ve had to say \u201cnot this month.\u201d The money is tight, but I\u2019ve managed to set aside just enough. \n\nBut then I remember: today is the last day to vote, and the polls close in less than an hour. I need my ID to vote, and the polling station is across town. If I go now, I\u2019ll make it in time, but I\u2019ll have to break my promise to my son\u2014again. If I stay and buy the Nintendo, I\u2019ll miss my only chance to vote, something I believe is my duty as a citizen. My hands tremble as I weigh the wallet in my palm, torn between my responsibility to my family and my responsibility to my community. My son\u2019s hopeful face and the weight of my civic duty pull me in opposite directions, and I feel the pressure mounting as the minutes slip away."}
