The court session was in thirty minutes, and I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there early to review last-minute details. My briefcase felt heavier than usual as I hurried my little brother along the sidewalk, our school bags bouncing against our backs. He was dragging his feet, complaining about a strange man he\u2019d seen lurking near the corner store. I tried to reassure him, but my mind was already at the courthouse, picturing my client\u2019s anxious face. \n\nBut then my brother stopped, refusing to walk past the alley where the man had disappeared. He looked up at me, eyes wide, trusting me to keep him safe. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my brother\u2019s safety in my hands, my client\u2019s future in my punctuality. I could feel the seconds slipping away, each one tightening the knot in my stomach. I wanted to be the sibling who protected, the advocate who never let anyone down. But right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both."}
