I knew he expected me to be honest, to share my worries and thoughts, to work through this together. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014no secrets, especially when it came to money or our health. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart raced. My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was supposed to be there on time, to show commitment and reliability, even if the others could cover for a while. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my husband\u2019s need for openness, the organization\u2019s need for punctuality. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, torn between staying and talking or rushing out the door. I wanted to be the wife he needed and the volunteer they counted on, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both."}
