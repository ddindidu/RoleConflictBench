My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about the medical bills piling up and the choices we needed to make. \u201cWe have to be honest with each other,\u201d they said, voice trembling. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more surprises.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectation for openness, for trust. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my client, whose trial was tomorrow. Their entire future hung in the balance, and I was their last hope.

My spouse needed my honesty and presence; my client needed my attention and advocacy. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I could feel myself fraying at the edges, unsure which part of me to give, and which to hold back."}
