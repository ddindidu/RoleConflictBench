As a grandmother, I cherish these moments\u2014watching my grandchildren play, sharing stories, and making memories. Today, we decided to have a picnic in the park, and I packed everyone\u2019s favorite snacks. The children ran ahead, laughing, while I carried the basket and tried to keep up. \n\nAs we settled under a shady tree, I noticed a few wrappers left behind from our sandwiches. My daughter-in-law, distracted by the kids, suggested we just leave them for now, saying the park staff would clean up later. But as a citizen, I know the rules\u2014there are clear signs everywhere: \u201cNo Littering. Please Use Bins.\u201d I could see the trash bin just a few steps away. \n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to stay with my family, not miss a single moment, and avoid making a fuss. But I also felt the weight of my responsibility to set a good example, to respect the park and the community. I stood there, torn, the laughter of my grandchildren in one ear and the silent reminder of my civic duty in the other."}
