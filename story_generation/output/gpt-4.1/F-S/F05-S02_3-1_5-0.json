My wife is bustling around, dusting shelves and arranging cushions, her voice echoing from the hallway, \u201cCan you vacuum the living room next? They\u2019ll be here in two hours!\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of her expectation\u2014this is our home, our shared responsibility, and today, it must be perfect for the relatives. My phone buzzes on the counter. It\u2019s a message from Sam, a fellow activist: \u201cWe\u2019re live now. Not many people here. If you can make it, we need you.\u201d I open the stream and see the small crowd, their voices determined but thin against the city noise. My heart tugs in two directions. At home, I\u2019m needed as a partner, a teammate. Out there, I\u2019m needed as a voice, a presence for a cause I believe in. The vacuum sits by my feet, the protest chants echo in my mind, and I stand frozen, torn between the demands of love and the call of justice."}
