I want to be there for her, to listen and reassure her, like I promised I always would. But just then, the election official calls my name. There\u2019s a problem with my registration, and if I want my vote to count, I have to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closes in ten minutes. The official\u2019s tone is firm, and I know the rules are strict. I feel the weight of civic duty pressing on me, the expectation to follow every instruction and make my voice heard. But my heart aches, knowing my wife is waiting, needing me. I stand frozen, torn between the pull of my promise to her and my responsibility as a voter, the clock ticking louder with every second."}
