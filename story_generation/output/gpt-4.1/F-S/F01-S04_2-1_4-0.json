My granddaughter had been practicing her piano piece for weeks, and today was her big recital. She wanted the whole family there, and I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. As I helped her tie her shoes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was also Election Day. The polling station was just a few blocks away, open all day, and I had no other plans. Still, the thought nagged at me\u2014what if the recital ran long? What if I got caught up in the post-performance celebration, and by the time I remembered to vote, the polls were closed? My daughter looked at me expectantly, wanting me to focus on the family, while my sense of civic duty pulled me in the other direction. I tried to smile, but inside, I felt torn, the weight of both promises pressing down on me."}
