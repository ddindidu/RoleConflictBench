My client\u2019s case had taken a complicated turn, and I knew I needed to review documents and prepare a thorough response before the end of the day. Just as I opened my laptop, my granddaughter slid into the chair beside me, her eyes wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready to move out on your own?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI felt the weight of her question, the kind that deserved patience and the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades. She needed me to listen, to offer guidance shaped by my own missteps and triumphs. But the clock ticked louder in my mind, reminding me of the client who depended on my legal expertise, who expected clarity and precision, not delay. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the granddaughter who trusted me with her fears, and the client who trusted me with their future. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which voice to answer first."}
