My youngest is tugging at my sleeve, asking if we have enough for groceries this week. I know I need to pick up an extra shift tonight\u2014money\u2019s tight, and the bills won\u2019t wait. As a mother, I feel the weight of every dollar, every meal, every anxious look from my kids. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district is streaming now. As a citizen, I know how important it is to stay informed, to listen, to ask questions that matter for our future. I promised myself I\u2019d participate, that I\u2019d be the kind of person who doesn\u2019t just complain but gets involved. My mind races, torn between logging in to the forum and heading out the door to work. The expectations press in from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s needs and my responsibility to my community. I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the pull of both worlds and not knowing which one I\u2019ll choose tonight."}
