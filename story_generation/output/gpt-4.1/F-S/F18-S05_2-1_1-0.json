He barely glanced at me before heading to his room. As his sibling, I knew I should go after him, sit beside him, and listen\u2014be the emotional anchor he needed after a rough day at school. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, asking for clarification about their legal rights. As an advocate, I was expected to respond promptly and accurately, even during these informal, off-the-clock moments.

I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart ached for my brother, but my conscience nagged at the responsibility I owed my client. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, caught between the closed door of my brother\u2019s room and the glowing screen in my hand, unsure which role to answer first."}
