I think you misunderstood what I said earlier.\u201d I know he\u2019s upset, and as his sister, I want to listen, clear the air, and rebuild the trust that\u2019s been shaken between us. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s chat explodes with reminders\u2014the online petition to our state senator is closing in minutes. They\u2019re counting on me to add my name, to show our numbers and push for the policy change we\u2019ve been fighting for. I stare at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds. My brother expects me to be present, to communicate openly and resolve our conflict. My fellow activists expect me to stand with them, to act now when it matters most. My heart pounds as I try to decide which role to answer first, torn between the call for family and the call for justice."}
