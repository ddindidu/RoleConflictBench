I wanted to be the kind of father who guided his children, who helped them grow into kind, disciplined people. Just as I was about to praise him for wiping his mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the community center. \n\nEarlier that day, while volunteering at the check-in table, a client had leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided something deeply personal. She trusted me to keep it private, and I\u2019d promised her confidentiality. Now, the message was from my supervisor, asking if I\u2019d heard anything that might help them support her better. \n\nI looked at my son, thinking about honesty and trust, the values I wanted to teach him. But I also thought about the promise I\u2019d made as a volunteer, the responsibility to protect someone\u2019s privacy. My heart pounded as I realized I was caught between two roles, each demanding something different from me."}
