He asked about my day, and I hesitated, knowing I should be honest. We\u2019d promised to communicate openly, to share even the small frustrations. But as I started to speak, my mind raced\u2014my wallet, with my ID, was still in my office drawer across town. The polls closed in less than an hour, and tonight was my only chance to vote. I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me, the expectation to show up, ID in hand, and make my voice heard. But here was my husband, waiting for me to open up, to be present with him, just as we\u2019d agreed. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urge to rush out the door with the need to honor our commitment. I could see the concern in his eyes, and I knew he sensed my distraction. Torn between being the wife who listens and the voter who acts, I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
