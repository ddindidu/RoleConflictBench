My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning just as I was about to leave for my sister\u2019s graduation dinner\u2014a milestone she\u2019d worked so hard for, and one I\u2019d promised not to miss. As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on, celebrating her achievement. But as I stepped into the hallway, the building alarms blared, and neighbors shouted for help, water already pooling at the entrance. As a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility to help evacuate the elderly couple next door and check on the families in the lower apartments. My heart pounded, torn between the duty to my sister and the urgent need to help my community. I could almost hear her voice, excited and hopeful, while outside, the chaos of the flood demanded immediate action. I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the brother she needed and the citizen my neighbors depended on."}
