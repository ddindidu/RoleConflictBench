It\u2019s important.\u201d She needed me\u2014really needed me. I could see the weight she carried, and I knew she was reaching out for the kind of guidance only I could give. My heart ached to be there for her, to listen and offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years.\n\nBut as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to open the community center this morning. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to unlock the doors and start the day\u2019s service. If I didn\u2019t go, the whole operation would be delayed, and those who depended on us might be left out in the cold.\n\nI felt torn in two, the expectations of both roles pressing down on me. My granddaughter\u2019s trust, the community\u2019s reliance\u2014both urgent, both important. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which responsibility to honor in this moment."}
