Everything okay?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Saturday evening. I\u2019d meant to call her, just like I promised last week, but the day slipped away in a blur of client emails and paperwork. As a daughter, I know she expects me to check in, to share a little of my life, to reassure her that I\u2019m alright. I type a quick reply, \u201cAll good, just busy!\u201d but guilt gnaws at me. \n\nAt the same time, my mind replays the conversation I had earlier with a client who called for advice. As their advocate, I\u2019m supposed to provide clear, accurate guidance, but with so many cases and so little time, I only managed a general explanation. I worry that I wasn\u2019t thorough enough, that I let them down. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my parents want my presence, my clients need my expertise. I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, torn between calling home and drafting a more detailed email to my client, feeling the tension of being needed in two places at once."}
