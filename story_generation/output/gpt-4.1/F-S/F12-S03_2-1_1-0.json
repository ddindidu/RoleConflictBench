He\u2019d been offered a promotion, but it meant letting go of a loyal team member. He needed my support, my advice\u2014he needed me to listen, to reassure him that he was making the right choice. I reached for his hand, trying to be present, to offer the comfort he sought. \n\nBut as we walked, he absentmindedly crumpled his coffee cup and, deep in thought, tossed it onto the grass, missing the trash bin just a few steps away. My heart clenched. The signs were clear: \u201cNo Littering. Keep Our Park Clean.\u201d I felt the eyes of other park-goers on us, and a wave of guilt washed over me. As a citizen, I knew I should say something, pick up the cup, set an example. But as a wife, I didn\u2019t want to embarrass him or add to his stress. I hesitated, torn between the urge to uphold my civic duty and the need to be the supportive partner he needed right now."}
