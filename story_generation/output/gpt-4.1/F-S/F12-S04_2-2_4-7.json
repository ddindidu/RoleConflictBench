The laundry basket was overflowing, and I knew if I didn\u2019t get it done now, she\u2019d be disappointed and my husband would be frustrated. But I glanced at the clock and realized I was already running late for the polling station. Voting is important to me, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d do it today.\n\nAt the polling place, after waiting in line, the poll worker handed back my ballot envelope, pointing out a smudge on my signature. She asked me to re-sign it, explaining that otherwise my vote might not count. I could feel my phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014probably my husband, checking if I\u2019d started the laundry. I felt torn, standing there with the pen in my hand, thinking about the pile of clothes at home and the poll worker\u2019s expectant gaze. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the demands of my family and my duty as a voter."}
