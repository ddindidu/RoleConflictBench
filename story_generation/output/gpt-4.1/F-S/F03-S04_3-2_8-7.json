My mom came in, her eyes red, and sat across from me. She started talking about how lonely she\u2019d been feeling since Dad\u2019s health started declining. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to just be there. I wanted to reach out, to hold her hand, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to drop off my ballot before the post office closed. I remembered the poll worker\u2019s instructions: if the signature was smudged, I had to re-sign the envelope or my vote might not count. I looked down and saw the ink had blurred. My mom\u2019s voice trembled as she spoke, and I could see how much she needed me. But the ballot in my hand felt heavy with responsibility, too. I was torn, feeling the weight of my mother\u2019s pain and the civic duty pressing on me at the same time, unsure which role to answer first."}
