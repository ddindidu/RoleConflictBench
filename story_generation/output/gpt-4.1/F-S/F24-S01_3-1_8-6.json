The volunteer coordinator\u2019s email echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you have time, try organizing the supplies by color instead of type.\u201d I glanced at my watch\u2014barely enough time before the next group arrived. I wanted to do it right, to show I could follow instructions and be a reliable volunteer.\n\nSuddenly, I caught a glimpse of my stepbrother, Max, darting toward the curb, his eyes fixed on his phone. My heart jumped. I knew Mom expected me to look out for him, especially since he\u2019d only just moved in and was still getting used to the neighborhood. I could see a car coming down the street, and I felt a surge of panic. Should I drop everything and run after Max, risking leaving the supplies in disarray and disappointing the coordinator? Or should I trust he\u2019ll be okay, just this once, and finish the task I\u2019d been given? My hands trembled as I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
