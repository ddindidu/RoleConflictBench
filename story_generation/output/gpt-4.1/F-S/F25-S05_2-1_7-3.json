The case was minor, a routine hearing, but I knew my client was anxious and expected me to be fully present and prepared. My phone buzzed with a message from home: my stepdad had another sleepless night, and my mom was asking if I could come by after work. Lately, they both seemed worn down, their voices heavy with fatigue. I felt the weight of their unspoken hope that I\u2019d be there to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But as an advocate, I couldn\u2019t let my focus slip, not even for a small case. My client deserved my best, no matter how trivial the matter seemed. I stared at the courtroom door, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my client. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for either."}
