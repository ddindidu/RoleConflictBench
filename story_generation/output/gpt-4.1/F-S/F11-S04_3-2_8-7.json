Could you please sign again?\u201d she asked politely. I nodded, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my younger brother, texting in all caps: \u201cWHERE ARE YOU? WE NEED TO TALK.\u201d We\u2019d argued that morning\u2014he thought I\u2019d betrayed his trust, and I\u2019d promised to clear things up today, face-to-face, to rebuild the respect between us.\n\nBut now, the poll worker waited, pen extended, and the line behind me grew restless. I remembered the instructions: follow every step exactly, no shortcuts, no mistakes. My brother\u2019s message glared at me, urgent and raw. I felt torn\u2014if I left to call him, I\u2019d risk my vote not counting, but if I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to resolve things with him today. My heart pounded as I stood between the poll worker\u2019s expectation and my brother\u2019s need, caught in the impossible space between being a good sister and a responsible voter."}
