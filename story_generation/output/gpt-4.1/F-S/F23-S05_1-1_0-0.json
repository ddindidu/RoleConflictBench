It was nearly three, and my stepchildren\u2019s school was letting out early today. I\u2019d promised to pick them up, to be there at the gate with a smile, just like their mom used to be. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a client, anxious and confused, needed clarity about their case. As an advocate, I owed them more than the vague reassurances I\u2019d given during our rushed, casual consultation earlier. They deserved my full attention, my expertise, and my honesty. Yet, if I stayed to call them back, I\u2019d be late for the kids, letting them down and risking their trust in me as their step-parent. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my client and the promise to my family. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stared at my phone, keys in hand, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
