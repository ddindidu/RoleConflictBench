My stepbrother\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d just called, barely able to speak through his tears. The news about his mom\u2019s health had hit him hard, and I knew he needed me. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to comfort him, to show that he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded faster. The polls would close in less than an hour, and this was my only chance to vote. My wallet, with my ID, was in my car, parked at the polling station across town. I could hear my stepbrother\u2019s sobs in my memory, but I also felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me.
