He asks about my day, and I know he wants more than the usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d He wants me to open up, to share the weight I carry. I want to tell him everything\u2014the tension in the city, the hope and fear tangled together as we prepare for tonight\u2019s protest. But my phone buzzes again. The group chat is alive with messages: \u201cWe need you at the front, now.\u201d The march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, to be the voice that rallies everyone. My husband reaches for my hand, searching for connection, while my activist friends wait for my leadership. I feel the pull in both directions\u2014one asking for honesty and presence, the other demanding action and courage. My heart pounds as I look from his expectant face to the glowing screen, caught between the home I\u2019ve built and the cause I fight for."}
