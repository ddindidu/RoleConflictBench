Can\u2019t wait to celebrate!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and our family had planned a special evening. As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her. We\u2019d always promised to show up for each other, no matter what.\n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my client approached me in the courthouse hallway. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there for the hearing, right?\u201d he asked, anxiety flickering in his eyes. It was a minor case, nothing that would make headlines, but he was counting on me to represent him\u2014my duty as his advocate.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled for the same time as my sister\u2019s dinner. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My family expected my presence, my support, my pride. My client expected my professionalism, my advocacy, my undivided attention. I stood in the corridor, heart pounding, torn between the two worlds that needed me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
