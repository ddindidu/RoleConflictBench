I glance at the clock\u2014plenty of time before the polling station closes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote today; it\u2019s important, and I have no excuse not to go. But as I scroll through my texts, guilt creeps in. If I call my parents now, I\u2019ll get caught up in a long conversation, and I might lose my momentum to leave the house. If I go vote first, I\u2019ll be ignoring their message, and I know they\u2019ll worry. I feel torn, pulled between being a good child and a responsible citizen. My parents just want to hear my voice, but my civic duty is calling too. I stand in the hallway, phone in one hand, voter ID in the other, heart pounding as I try to decide which role to honor first."}
