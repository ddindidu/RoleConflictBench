I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation that I\u2019d share the load, especially today. As I started vacuuming, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the local election. I\u2019d planned to vote before noon, but suddenly remembered my ID was in my office drawer across town. I could fetch it later, but the thought nagged at me. If I left now, I\u2019d leave my partner to handle everything alone, which would disappoint her and break our agreement to split chores. But if I waited, I risked forgetting or running out of time to vote, something I believe is my civic duty. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, torn between being the supportive spouse I promised to be and the responsible voter I strive to become."}
