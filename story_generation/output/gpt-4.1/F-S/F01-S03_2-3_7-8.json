My granddaughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d sent a message to the family group chat, her excitement practically leaping off the screen. I knew she\u2019d be waiting for my reply, for the encouragement and pride I always tried to show. I started typing, wanting to be present for her, to keep our bond strong.\n\nSuddenly, the city\u2019s emergency alert blared from my phone, and the building\u2019s alarms followed. The street outside was already a river, water creeping up the steps. As a citizen, I knew my duty: check on neighbors, help the elderly couple next door, make sure everyone was safe. But my family expected me to be there for them, too, to share in their joys and milestones, even from afar.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s needs and the urgent call to help my community. My heart pounded as I weighed the messages on my phone against the rising water outside, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
