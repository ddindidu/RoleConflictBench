My daughter sits at the kitchen table, her lips pressed tight, refusing to apologize for snatching her brother\u2019s toy. I know this is one of those moments\u2014teaching her about kindness, about making things right. She looks up at me, eyes searching for guidance, and I feel the weight of my responsibility as her parent. But my phone buzzes again: a reminder for the court session I cannot miss. My client\u2019s future depends on my punctuality, and I know the judge won\u2019t tolerate delays. I\u2019m torn, standing in the hallway between my daughter\u2019s expectant gaze and the briefcase by the door. My mind races with the demands of both worlds\u2014my child needing patience and moral guidance, my client needing my unwavering advocacy. I feel the pressure mounting, the seconds ticking away, and I wonder how I can possibly be what both of them need right now."}
