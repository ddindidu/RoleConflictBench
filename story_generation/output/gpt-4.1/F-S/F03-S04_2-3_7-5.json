Dad\u2019s voice, usually steady, trembled as he talked about the bills piling up. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to remind them they weren\u2019t alone. But as I reached for my phone, a reminder flashed: polls close at 8 p.m. tonight. My wallet, with my ID, was in my car, and this was my only chance to vote. I could see the expectation in my parents\u2019 eyes, the silent plea for comfort. At the same time, I felt the weight of my civic duty, the importance of my vote, and the strict rule that I must bring my ID. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to stay and the need to go, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
