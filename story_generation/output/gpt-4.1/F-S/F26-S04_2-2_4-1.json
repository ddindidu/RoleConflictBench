My daughter\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cPlease, Mom, it would mean so much if you could be here when we share the news.\u201d The whole family is gathering in the living room, anticipation buzzing in the air. I want to be present, to see their faces light up, to be the grandparent who never misses a moment. But as I set the casserole on the table, I remember the polling station closes in less than two hours. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, to do my part, to set an example for my grandchildren about civic duty. The weight of both promises presses on me. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the family\u2019s big announcement. If I stay, I might not make it to the polls in time. My hands tremble as I pour the lemonade, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility of my vote, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
