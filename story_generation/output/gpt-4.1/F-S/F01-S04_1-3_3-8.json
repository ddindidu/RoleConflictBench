The family gathering was already underway\u2014my daughter had sent a photo of my grandkids laughing around the table, waiting for me to join them. I\u2019d promised my wife I wouldn\u2019t be late this time. But here I was, standing in a line at the polling station, clutching my ID, as the election official explained the registration mix-up. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form,\u201d she said, \u201cand we close in ten minutes.\u201d I could hear the expectation in her voice: follow the process, do your civic duty, don\u2019t hold up the line. But my mind was with my family, picturing my grandson\u2019s disappointed face if I missed his story about school. The pressure built inside me\u2014my responsibility as a citizen pulling me one way, my promise as a grandfather tugging the other. I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
