We\u2019d promised each other honesty, no matter how hard the truth was to share. I could see the worry in their eyes, the expectation that I\u2019d be fully present, that I\u2019d help shoulder the weight of these decisions. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place down the street would close in two hours, and there was a ballot measure that could change the way our block was funded. As a citizen, I felt the pull to participate, to make my voice heard, to fulfill my duty to the community. But as a spouse, I knew walking out now would feel like abandoning the conversation, like I was choosing strangers over the person I loved. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urgency of both roles, feeling the pressure of time and responsibility closing in from all sides."}
