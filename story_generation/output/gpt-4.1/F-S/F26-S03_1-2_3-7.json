My grandkids had been talking about it for weeks, and I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the stories we\u2019d share. But as I set out the fruit salad, my phone buzzed with a public alert: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my neighbor down the hall, who lived alone and struggled with her old air conditioner. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to check on her, maybe bring her some cold water, make sure she was safe. But if I left now, I\u2019d be late for the family, and I knew how much they counted on me being there. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family and the duty I felt to my community. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the expectations of being a good grandparent and a responsible citizen, unsure which door to open first."}
