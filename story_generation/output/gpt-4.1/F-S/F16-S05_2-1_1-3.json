I knew they needed me to listen, to offer comfort and steady advice, to be the anchor they could lean on. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my client\u2019s reminder about the hearing in an hour. It was a minor case, nothing that would make headlines, but I was their advocate, and they expected me to show up, prepared and focused, no matter how small the stakes.
