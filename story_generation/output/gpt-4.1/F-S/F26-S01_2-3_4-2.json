She wants you to come over\u2014she\u2019s been practicing all week and wants to show the whole family.\u201d My heart swelled with pride. I promised Lily I\u2019d be there, and I know how much these moments mean to her. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from the community center. I\u2019m the only volunteer scheduled tonight, and I have the keys. There\u2019s a line of people who count on me to open the doors and start the meal service. If I\u2019m late, they\u2019ll be left waiting in the cold. My family expects me to be present, to celebrate Lily\u2019s big moment, but the people at the center expect me to be reliable, to show up when I say I will. I can feel the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, my mind racing as I try to figure out how to be in two places at once."}
