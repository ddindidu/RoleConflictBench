Did you eat?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20149:58 p.m. We always text before bed, and she worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly. As I started typing, another notification popped up: the activist group\u2019s chat. \u201cLast call! We need your signature on the petition before midnight. This could make a real difference.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds. My parents expect me to be present, to share my day, to reassure them I\u2019m okay. But my fellow activists count on me to act, to be part of the change we all talk about. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, torn between the comfort of family routine and the urgency of the cause. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s voice, gentle but anxious, and at the same time, I felt the collective hope of my activist friends. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
