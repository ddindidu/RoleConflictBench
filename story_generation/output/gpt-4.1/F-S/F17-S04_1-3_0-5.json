The polling station closes in less than an hour, and I know this is my only chance to vote. As I hurry down the steps, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this weekend. Everything okay?\u201d Guilt prickles at me. I promised I\u2019d check in more often, and I know how much it means to her. But if I stop to call or even text her back now, I might miss my window to vote. The line at the polls could be long, and I can\u2019t risk forgetting my ID or being late. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: be the attentive child my parents hope for, or fulfill my civic duty as a responsible voter. I stand frozen on the sidewalk, torn between the warmth of family and the weight of responsibility, my phone glowing in one hand and my ID in the other."}
