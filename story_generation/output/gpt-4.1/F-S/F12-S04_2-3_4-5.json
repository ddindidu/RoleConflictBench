My husband\u2019s work uniform is buried somewhere in there, and our daughter\u2019s favorite dress is stained from yesterday\u2019s art project. I promised I\u2019d have everything washed and ready for tomorrow\u2014everyone\u2019s counting on me. But as I sort through the clothes, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polls close in two hours, and tonight is my only chance to vote. I need to bring my ID, which I haven\u2019t even found yet. My husband pokes his head in, asking if his uniform will be ready, and I nod, feeling the weight of his expectation. At the same time, I know how important this election is, how much I want my voice to count. My heart pounds as I stare at the laundry and then at my purse, torn between the needs of my family and my responsibility as a citizen. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure builds inside me, making it hard to breathe."}
