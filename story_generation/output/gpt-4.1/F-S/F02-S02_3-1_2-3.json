He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate. My heart clenched\u2014this wasn\u2019t the boy I thought I knew. I was supposed to be there for him, to show up at the school, talk to his teacher, and help him understand the weight of his actions. That\u2019s what a good father does. But as I reached for my keys, my activist group\u2019s chat pinged. The petition we\u2019d worked on for weeks\u2014demanding real change in juvenile justice\u2014was about to be sent to the senator. They needed my signature, my voice, right now. I could almost hear my colleagues urging me not to miss this chance, not when we were so close to making a difference. My son needed me, but so did the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unable to move."}
