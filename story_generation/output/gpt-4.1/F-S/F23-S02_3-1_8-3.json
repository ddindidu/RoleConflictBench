The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy reminder that my family depended on me for stability. My partner trusted me to keep us afloat, and my stepdaughter needed the security of a home that wouldn\u2019t slip away. Just as I started calculating our budget, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my activist group. The petition to the lawmaker was about to be sent, and this was my last chance to add my signature, to stand up for the policy changes I\u2019d spent months advocating for. I knew my voice mattered, that my absence would be noticed. But every minute spent on activism was a minute not spent planning for the loan, not spent reassuring my family. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the cause I believed in and the family that needed me."}
