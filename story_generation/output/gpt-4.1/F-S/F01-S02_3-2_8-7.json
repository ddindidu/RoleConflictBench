It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam. He\u2019s not doing well.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I\u2019ve always promised to be there for my family, to check in, to listen, especially when things get tough. But in five minutes, I was supposed to go live on air, speaking to hundreds about the cause I\u2019ve poured my soul into\u2014educating the public, rallying support, making a difference. The host was already waving at me through the glass, mouthing, \u201cReady?\u201d I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family needed me now, but so did the movement. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent call of blood and the passionate call of purpose, my mind racing, my heart pulled in two directions."}
