He asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the minor hearing I\u2019d just left. As an advocate, I was expected to represent my client with unwavering focus, even if the case was small. But at home, as a wife, I was supposed to communicate openly, to share my thoughts and feelings. I wanted to tell him about the frustration I felt in court, the way the judge barely glanced at my arguments, but I also knew he was dealing with his own stress at work. If I opened up, would I be burdening him? If I stayed silent, was I failing as a partner? The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I could feel the tension building in my chest as I tried to decide what to say."}
