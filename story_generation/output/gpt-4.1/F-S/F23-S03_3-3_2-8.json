My heart pounded with worry and shame\u2014was I failing her? I knew I needed to be present, to show her I cared, to help her learn from this. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does: attends, listens, guides. But as I tried to focus on the principal\u2019s words, the building\u2019s alarms blared. A voice over the intercom announced a flash-flood warning; water was already rising outside. As a citizen, I knew my duty\u2014help neighbors, check on the elderly, make sure everyone was safe. But my stepdaughter sat beside me, eyes wide, waiting for my response. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down. Should I stay and help her through this crisis, or rush out to help my community? My hands shook as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
