My client\u2019s case was complicated, and I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, knowing how much was at stake for them. Just as I was reviewing my notes, my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt since Dad\u2019s health had started declining, her voice trembling as she admitted she didn\u2019t know how to cope. I could see she needed me\u2014her son\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But my mind kept drifting to the legal arguments I still needed to refine, the evidence I had to review, and the late-night calls I owed my client. My mother\u2019s pain pulled at my heart, but the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed on my conscience. I felt torn, guilt rising as I tried to focus on her words while my thoughts raced with legal strategies. I wanted to be the son she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my client down. The two worlds collided inside me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
