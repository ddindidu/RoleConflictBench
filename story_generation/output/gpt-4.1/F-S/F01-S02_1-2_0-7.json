My phone buzzed with a reminder: five minutes until I needed to call in. Just then, my granddaughter wandered in, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, voice barely above a whisper. I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give, the kind that comes from years of mistakes and triumphs. But the activist in me felt the weight of the community\u2019s expectations, the urgency of the cause, the responsibility to speak for those who couldn\u2019t. My heart pulled in two directions: the world waiting on the line, and the world in my kitchen, looking to me for wisdom. I glanced at the clock, feeling the seconds slip away, torn between the call of duty and the call of love."}
