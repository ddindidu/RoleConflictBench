My younger brother, Sam, had texted again: \u201cCan we talk? I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so mad.\u201d I wanted to call him, to clear the air after our argument last night, to show him I respected his feelings even when we disagreed. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d talk things out. But my client was waiting inside, nervous about her minor hearing. She needed me to be focused, to represent her with the same care I\u2019d give any case, no matter how small. I could hear her voice in my head, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who listens to me.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my brother\u2019s need for understanding, my client\u2019s need for advocacy. My heart pounded as I stared at the courtroom door, torn between the urge to step outside and call Sam, and the duty to walk in and stand by my client. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to honor first."}
