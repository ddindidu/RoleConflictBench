We can\u2019t wait to catch up!\u201d I hear the excitement in her tone, and I know how much these gatherings mean to all of us. My grandchildren will expect stories, laughter, and the comfort of my presence. But as I hang up, I glance at the files spread across my dining table\u2014medical histories from the shelter where I volunteer. I promised to help sort them before the weekend, and confidentiality is paramount. I can\u2019t risk leaving them unattended or discussing anything I\u2019ve seen, not even in passing. My family expects me to be fully present, sharing in their lives, but my commitment to privacy at the shelter weighs heavily. I feel torn, the warmth of family tradition pulling me one way, and the gravity of my volunteer responsibility anchoring me the other. My heart aches as I wrestle with how to honor both, knowing I can\u2019t give either the attention they deserve at the same time."}
