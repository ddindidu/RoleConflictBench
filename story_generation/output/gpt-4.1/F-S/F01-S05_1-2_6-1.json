The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but my mind was already tangled in the details of a client\u2019s case that had just taken a complicated turn. As an advocate, I knew my client depended on me for timely, thorough advice\u2014especially now, when every hour seemed to bring new developments. My office was littered with case files and notes, and my client\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my head, \u201cI need your guidance. I can\u2019t afford any mistakes.\u201d\n\nYet, the family expected me to be present, to listen to stories, to laugh and share memories. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s longing for connection, my client\u2019s urgent need for clarity. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing either side.
