My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and I was the only one with the keys to open the center. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to let them in. I grabbed my jacket, but as I reached for the door, I saw my wife sitting at the kitchen table, her shoulders slumped, eyes distant. She\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I knew something was wrong. We\u2019d promised to talk openly about our worries, to be there for each other, especially when work or life felt overwhelming. I hesitated, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning her when she needed me most. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people waiting at the center, and the whole service would be delayed. My mind raced, caught between the promise I\u2019d made to my wife and the responsibility I\u2019d taken on as a volunteer. I stood frozen, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
