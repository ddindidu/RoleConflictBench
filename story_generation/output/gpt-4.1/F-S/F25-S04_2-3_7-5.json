From the living room, I could hear my stepdad\u2019s voice, low and weary, as he tried to comfort my mom. She\u2019d been crying again, her stress spilling over after weeks of late nights and endless bills. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. That\u2019s what I was supposed to do as their step-child, especially now, when they seemed so fragile.\n\nBut the clock on the wall ticked louder, reminding me that the polls would close soon. This was my only chance to vote, to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it, not after all the talk about how every vote counts. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my parents when they needed me most. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the pull of family and the call of civic duty, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
