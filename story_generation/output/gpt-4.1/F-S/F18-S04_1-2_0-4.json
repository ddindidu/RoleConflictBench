She looked up at me with tired eyes, her voice trembling as she confessed how anxious she felt about her final exam. I knew she needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to just be there. That\u2019s what we always promised each other: to show up when it mattered most.\n\nBut as I poured my coffee, I remembered the email from the election office. I\u2019d forgotten my ID at home, and today was the only morning I could pick it up before work. If I didn\u2019t, I might not be able to vote tomorrow. The weight of civic duty pressed on me; voting was something I believed in deeply, a responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nI glanced at my sister, her hands shaking as she tried to focus. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the sibling she needed, but I also felt the pull of my obligation as a voter. The clock ticked louder, and I stood frozen, torn between two promises I didn\u2019t want to break."}
