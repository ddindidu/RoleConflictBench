The line for voting snaked around the room, and I could hear the buzz of people chatting about the upcoming holiday. My daughter had just texted, reminding me that everyone was gathering early this year, and the grandkids were eager to see me. I felt the familiar tug of wanting to be present, to keep our family tradition alive, to be the grandmother who never missed a moment.\n\nBut then, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name fit the bill. The new line looked longer, and I could see the original line moving quickly. I hesitated, knowing the family expected me soon, but the official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014voters were to follow instructions. I felt torn, the weight of my roles pressing in. Should I follow the rules as a responsible voter, or hurry through and get back to my family, as a devoted grandmother?
