My phone buzzed\u2014messages from my activist group. The police had started blocking the exits at our protest downtown, and panic was spreading. As one of the organizers, I was expected to help coordinate a safe, calm response, to make sure no one got hurt or arrested. But Jamie was about to try a trick that could land him in the hospital if he fell. I was supposed to look out for him, to be the sibling who kept him safe, especially since our parents weren\u2019t home. My heart pounded as I glanced between Jamie, poised at the top of the ramp, and the urgent texts lighting up my screen. Both needed me\u2014right now. I felt split in two, torn between the brother who trusted me to watch his back and the movement that counted on my leadership."}
