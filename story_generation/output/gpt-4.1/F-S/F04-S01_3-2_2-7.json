She rarely reached out during the day, so I knew something was wrong. Her text was short: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there for her, especially when things got tough. But just as I was about to step outside to call her, the volunteer coordinator reminded us all about the new safety protocols\u2014no one was allowed to leave their assigned area without permission, not even for a few minutes. The rules were strict, and I knew the coordinator was watching closely after last week\u2019s incident. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to support my sister and the responsibility to follow the guidelines I\u2019d agreed to. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt trapped, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
