As his wife, I know he expects me to help make the house spotless and welcoming. The pressure is on\u2014every cushion fluffed, every dish put away, every surface gleaming. But today is also my volunteer day at the clinic, and I promised to help sort confidential medical files. The coordinator reminded us how crucial it is to respect the privacy of every patient; one slip could mean betraying someone\u2019s trust. My phone buzzes with a message from my husband: \u201cCan you come home early? There\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d At the same time, my supervisor at the clinic hands me a stack of files, her eyes serious. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s expectations for a perfect home, and my duty to protect the privacy of vulnerable people. My heart pounds as I stand in the middle, torn, knowing I can\u2019t give both roles what they demand from me at the same time."}
