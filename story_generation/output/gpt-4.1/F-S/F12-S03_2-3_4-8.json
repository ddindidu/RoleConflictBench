My husband had already reminded me twice, and I could feel the weight of my responsibility as a wife pressing on my shoulders. I sorted the clothes, trying to ignore the distant rumble of thunder, but then the emergency alert blared from my phone: \u201cFlash-flood warning. Evacuate immediately.\u201d I rushed to the window and saw water creeping up the street, neighbors gathering outside, some looking scared and confused. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on Mrs. Lee next door, make sure the elderly couple across the street had a way out. But the laundry, the family, the home\u2014they needed me too. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my home and the call to help my community, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
