My grandchildren had been talking about it for weeks, planning games and asking if I\u2019d bake my famous apple pie. I promised them I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. But as I sipped my morning coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the office. A last-minute hearing had been scheduled for the same afternoon. It was a minor case, nothing earth-shattering, but my client was anxious and counting on me to be there. I could hear my daughter\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cMom, the kids are so excited to see you.\u201d At the same time, I pictured my client\u2019s worried face, trusting me to stand by them in court. My heart tugged in two directions, the warmth of family on one side, the weight of professional duty on the other. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the clock ticking down to a choice I didn\u2019t want to make."}
