The state legislature was about to vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call, to share my story, to help tip the scales. Just then, my daughter burst in, her face alight\u2014she wanted to announce her engagement to the whole family, and everyone was gathering in the living room. I could hear laughter and the clink of glasses, the kind of moment I\u2019d promised never to miss. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the joy of my family and the responsibility I felt to my cause. Both needed me, right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
