The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry scattered, and the guest room still needed fresh sheets. She expected me to help, to share the load, and to make sure everything was perfect for their visit. I promised I\u2019d be home early to help, but as I was about to leave for work, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember, everyone must stay for the full shift today. We need all hands on deck to implement the new safety procedures.\u201d I knew how important these changes were, especially after last week\u2019s incident. The coordinator was counting on me to set an example. My stomach twisted as I stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be reliable at home and responsible at the shelter, but I couldn\u2019t see how I could possibly do both."}
