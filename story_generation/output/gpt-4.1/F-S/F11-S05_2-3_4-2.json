It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart thudded. I glanced at the clock\u20146:15. My family was already gathered in the dining room, laughter and the clatter of dishes drifting down the hall. Mom had insisted I be there, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been too long since we all sat together.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them. But my client\u2019s case was time-sensitive; a single misstep could cost them dearly. As an advocate, I was expected to be reliable, to provide clear, accurate guidance, especially in moments like this. Yet as a sister, I was expected to be present, to share in the warmth and connection of family. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in opposite directions. My phone buzzed again. I stood in the hallway, torn, the sounds of family and the urgency of my client\u2019s plea echoing in my mind."}
