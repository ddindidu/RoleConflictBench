I was so proud of her, and as her brother, I wanted to make her feel special. We brought balloons, snacks, and a cake. After the cake was cut, my sister handed me her empty plate and some wrappers, grinning, \u201cLet\u2019s just leave these here for now and take more photos!\u201d I glanced at the overflowing trash bin a few steps away and the bright no-littering signs posted everywhere. As a citizen, I knew I should set an example and respect the park\u2019s rules, but as a brother, I didn\u2019t want to dampen her excitement or seem like I was nagging her on her big day. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014torn between making my sister\u2019s celebration perfect and doing what I knew was right for the community."}
