It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan we talk for a bit? Haven\u2019t heard from you all week.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d be late opening the community center, and people would be left waiting outside in the cold. I was the only volunteer scheduled this morning, and the coordinator had stressed how important it was to be on time. But Mom\u2019s message tugged at me. She and Dad always worried when I went quiet, and I knew they expected me to check in, especially on weekends. I could picture her waiting by the phone, hoping for a call. My keys jingled in my hand as I hesitated in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s concern and the responsibility I felt toward the people counting on me at the center. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which door to walk through first."}
