My mother handed me a small bag of homemade treats, a family tradition during our weekend outings. As we finished, my father, as always, suggested we leave the wrappers under a bush\u2014\u201cJust like we always do, son. It\u2019s our little secret,\u201d he whispered, winking. I remembered how, as a child, I\u2019d giggle at the mischief, feeling part of something special. But now, the bright no-littering signs and the nearby trash bin caught my eye. As a citizen, I knew the rules were clear: respect public spaces, keep them clean. My heart pounded as my parents looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to follow our tradition. I felt the weight of their trust, the warmth of belonging, but also the tug of responsibility to my community. My hand hovered between the bush and the trash bin, torn between honoring my family\u2019s ways and upholding what I knew was right for everyone."}
