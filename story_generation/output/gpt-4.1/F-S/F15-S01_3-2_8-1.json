The home loan repayment loomed just two months away, and every dollar counted. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d pick up extra shifts at work, maybe even some overtime, to make sure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. My family depended on me to keep us afloat, and the pressure gnawed at me every time I glanced at my kids\u2019 hopeful faces.\n\nBut today was also my volunteer shift at the community center. The coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions. The doors open at nine sharp.\u201d The roster was tight, and I knew if I was late, the whole team would be stretched thin. I\u2019d committed to this months ago, and the people we served counted on us.\n\nI felt torn, my chest tight with anxiety. Should I call in to work and risk the extra pay, or let down the volunteer team and the people who needed us? Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of expectation pressed down, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
