The police had started blocking the exits, and panic rippled through the crowd. As an activist, I was expected to stay calm, organize, and help everyone find a safe way out. My mind raced with strategies, but then I saw my younger sister, eyes wide, clutching my arm. She\u2019d come to support me, but she wasn\u2019t used to this chaos. I remembered our promise to always respect each other\u2019s boundaries and differences, to be patient and understanding. She needed me to reassure her, to be the patient sister who listened and protected. But the crowd was looking to me for leadership, for quick decisions and unwavering resolve. My heart pounded as I tried to balance her fear with the urgent demands of the protest. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, torn between the sister she needed and the activist everyone else expected."}
