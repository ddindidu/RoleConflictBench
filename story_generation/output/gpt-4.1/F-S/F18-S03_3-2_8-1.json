As we reached the corner, he darted ahead, about to cross the street without checking for cars. My heart jumped\u2014I knew I had to stop him, to keep him safe, no matter what. But at the same time, my friends were texting, reminding me about our music session planned for tonight. We\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, but I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours started soon, and our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open in the evenings.
