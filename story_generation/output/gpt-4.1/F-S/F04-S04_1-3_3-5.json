It was rare for all of us to be home at once, and I could feel their excitement, their hope that I\u2019d finally join in instead of disappearing behind my own plans. My mom looked at me, her eyes bright, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polls closed tonight, and I still hadn\u2019t voted. My wallet, with my ID, was upstairs. If I left now, I could just make it. But if I got up, I\u2019d break the spell, disappoint them again. They wanted me here, present, part of the family. The country wanted me at the polls, ID in hand, fulfilling my civic duty. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the expectations of my family and the responsibility of my vote, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both."}
