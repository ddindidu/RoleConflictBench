My heart dropped as I saw the half-eaten candy bar in his hand. The manager explained what happened, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a parent\u2014this was the moment to teach him about honesty, consequences, and making things right. But as I knelt to speak to him, my phone buzzed insistently. It was the major news network, calling for an immediate live comment to counter a wave of misinformation that could set our movement back months. I could hear the urgency in the producer\u2019s voice, the expectation that I would step up and speak for everyone who counted on me. My son\u2019s eyes were wide with fear and shame, and I could feel the eyes of the store staff on us, waiting for my response. My mind raced, torn between the lesson my child needed and the responsibility to my cause, both demanding my full attention at the very same moment."}
