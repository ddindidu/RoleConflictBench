She wants to show everyone at home tonight.\u201d I could hear my granddaughter\u2019s laughter in the background, and my heart swelled. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing her proud little face as she unveiled her painting. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the volunteer coordinator. \u201cReminder: We\u2019re short-staffed today. Please arrive before doors open. Every minute counts.\u201d I stared at the calendar. The art celebration overlapped with my shift at the shelter, and I knew how much they depended on me, especially on days like this. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate Lily\u2019s achievement, but the shelter needed every hand. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, torn between the joy of family and the responsibility I\u2019d promised to uphold. My chest tightened as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
