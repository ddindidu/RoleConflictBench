As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I was there, laughing and sharing stories, making her feel special. We found a spot under a big tree, and everyone started unpacking food. My mother handed me a bag of trash and asked me to toss it away quickly so we could start eating. I noticed the nearest trash bin was overflowing, and some people had left their bags beside it, ignoring the no-littering signs posted everywhere. My mother, eager to keep the family together, urged me to just leave the bag with the others and hurry back. But as a citizen, I felt a strong responsibility to respect the park\u2019s rules and keep the space clean for everyone. I stood there, torn between my family\u2019s expectation to be present and supportive as a brother, and my duty as a citizen to do what was right for the community. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my sister\u2019s eyes against the guilt I\u2019d feel for adding to the mess."}
