He\u2019d been saving up, but the final purchase was on me. I knew how much it meant to him, and as a father, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy. But the bills had piled up this month, and I was already stretching our budget thin. \n\nLater that evening, at the community center, I joined the other volunteers for coffee. The conversation turned casual, and someone asked about my week. I hesitated, tempted to share my worries about money and the promise I\u2019d made to my son. But I remembered the training: as a volunteer, I was expected to respect the privacy of those I helped, and that included not blurring the lines between my personal life and the stories I heard in confidence. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s expectations at home, the ethical boundaries at the center. I sat quietly, torn between wanting to confide in my friends and needing to protect the trust placed in me."}
