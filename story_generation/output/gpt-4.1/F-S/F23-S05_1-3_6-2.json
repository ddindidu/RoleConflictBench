She needed clear, immediate legal advice\u2014her business was on the line, and she was counting on me to guide her through the crisis. My laptop was open, legal documents scattered around, but my mind kept drifting to the living room, where my stepson was watching TV, glancing at me every few minutes. He\u2019d been promised a Nintendo for his birthday, and today was the day I was supposed to take him to the store. He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to him. But the cost weighed heavily on me; our finances were tight, and I was supposed to ensure stability for the family. My client\u2019s case demanded my full attention, but so did my promise to my stepson. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my professional responsibility to provide precise legal counsel, and my personal commitment to keep my word and care for my family. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
