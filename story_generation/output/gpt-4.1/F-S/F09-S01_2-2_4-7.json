As I scanned the shelves for cereal, he darted away, weaving between carts and displays, giggling. My heart pounded with embarrassment and worry\u2014other shoppers were starting to stare. As his mother, I knew I needed to teach him about discipline and respect for others, to calmly but firmly correct his behavior right there.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember to model the new safety steps at all times, even outside the center.\u201d The new guidelines were strict\u2014no raising voices, always using positive reinforcement, and demonstrating calm, safe behavior in public. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I raise my voice to stop my son, risking breaking the volunteer guidelines, or let him continue, failing to teach him discipline? My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a good mother and a responsible volunteer, feeling the tension coil tighter with every second."}
