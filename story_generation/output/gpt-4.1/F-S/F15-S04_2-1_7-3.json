I checked the fridge\u2014almost empty. My paycheck wouldn\u2019t come for another week, and I\u2019d already stretched every dollar. I needed to pick up a few groceries, but I also had to get to the polling station before work. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, no matter what. I grabbed my wallet, but realized my main ID was missing. I could use my passport or another card, but they were at home, and I\u2019d have to come back later to fetch them if I wanted to vote.\n\nMy mind raced. If I went to the store now, I could get what we needed for dinner, but I\u2019d have to skip voting until after work, risking long lines or missing it altogether. If I went to vote first, I might not have time to get groceries before my shift. My family needed me to keep food on the table, but I also felt the weight of my civic duty. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood in the kitchen, keys in hand, torn between what I owed my family and what I owed my community."}
