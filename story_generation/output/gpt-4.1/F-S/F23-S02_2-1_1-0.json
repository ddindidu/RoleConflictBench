The open class at Lily\u2019s school starts in thirty minutes. She\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019ll be there. I promised I would. I know how much it means to her, especially since I\u2019m still earning her trust as her step-parent. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another message from Maya, my fellow activist. The protest downtown is smaller than expected, and the police are circling. \u201cWe need more people,\u201d she texts, \u201cCan you come?\u201d I feel the old pull, the responsibility to stand up, to be present, to show solidarity. I know my absence could mean the difference between the protest fizzling out or making an impact. My chest tightens as I picture Lily scanning the crowd for my face, and then Maya\u2019s anxious voice in my head. Both need me, both expect me to show up. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two worlds, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
