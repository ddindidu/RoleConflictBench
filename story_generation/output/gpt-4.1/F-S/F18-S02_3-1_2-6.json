She\u2019s just told me about her diagnosis, her hands trembling as she clutches a tissue. I can see the fear in her eyes, and I know she needs me\u2014needs my words, my comfort, my presence. But my phone won\u2019t stop vibrating. I glance at the screen and see that my organization\u2019s post about climate justice is exploding online. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, if I jump in now and add crucial information. My heart pounds. My sister\u2019s voice wavers as she asks if I\u2019m listening. I want to hold her, to reassure her, but my mind races with the responsibility to my cause. I feel torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, and I don\u2019t know which part of myself to answer first."}
