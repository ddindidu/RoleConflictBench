I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get everything organized early this year, and the free vaccine clinic at the community center was this weekend\u2014I\u2019d volunteered to help out. As I sorted receipts, I heard my mom\u2019s voice from the living room, softer than usual. I remembered to ask, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d She hesitated, then started to talk about Dad\u2019s recent health worries and how she felt overwhelmed. I could hear the strain in her voice, and guilt pricked at me for not noticing sooner.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the community center. They were counting on me to help with the clinic, and I knew how important it was for public health. At the same time, my parents needed me\u2014maybe more than I realized. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down. Should I stay home to support my parents, or keep my commitment to the community? The clock ticked, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible citizen."}
