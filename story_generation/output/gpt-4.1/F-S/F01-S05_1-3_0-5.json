Her eyes were wide, searching, as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know what to do when everything changes?\u201d She was on the cusp of adulthood, facing choices that would shape her future, and she wanted my guidance\u2014the kind only a grandfather could give, rooted in years of mistakes and triumphs. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: tomorrow\u2019s trial, the one that could decide my client\u2019s fate. I was expected to be fully prepared, to pore over every detail tonight, to be the advocate who leaves nothing to chance. My heart ached as I looked at her, wanting to offer all the time and wisdom she deserved, yet knowing the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed just as heavily. The demands of both roles pulled at me, each urgent, each deserving, and I felt the tension coil inside me as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
