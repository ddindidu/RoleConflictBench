My daughter\u2019s open class starts in twenty minutes, and she\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I\u2019ll be there. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I\u2019m about to leave, my phone buzzes with an urgent message from the advocacy group: the vote is happening now, and the undecided representative is taking calls. This is the moment we\u2019ve been working toward for months\u2014if I don\u2019t call, we might lose our chance to make real change. I can picture my daughter scanning the crowd, searching for my face, and I can also see the faces of those who would be affected by this legislation, counting on me to speak up. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I feel torn in two, standing in the hallway with my phone in one hand and my car keys in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
