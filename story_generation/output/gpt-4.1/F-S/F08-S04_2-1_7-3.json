As her mother and now a grandmother, I know how much these moments matter\u2014she wants me to listen, to celebrate with her, to be present. I promised her I\u2019d call back after breakfast, maybe even invite her over for tea so we could talk more. But as I reached for my purse to check my schedule, I realized today is also voting day. I need to bring valid identification, and I\u2019m not sure which ID I tucked away last time. I could check now, but if I\u2019m missing something, I\u2019ll have to drive back later. My daughter\u2019s expecting my call, and I don\u2019t want to let her down, but I also know how important it is to vote, to do my civic duty. The clock ticks, and I feel torn\u2014my heart with my family, my mind on my responsibilities as a citizen. I stand in the hallway, phone in one hand, wallet in the other, wrestling with which role to honor first."}
