They mentioned, almost offhand, that work had been a bit rough\u2014nothing major, just a string of small annoyances that left them drained. I could tell they wanted to talk, maybe just to vent or have someone listen. I sat down beside them, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes was closing soon. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, knowing how important public feedback is for our community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my partner needed my attention and empathy, but as a citizen, I felt responsible for contributing my voice to decisions that would affect us all. My mind raced, torn between being present for the person I love and fulfilling my civic duty. I could sense my partner waiting for me to engage, while the survey deadline ticked closer. The pressure built inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
