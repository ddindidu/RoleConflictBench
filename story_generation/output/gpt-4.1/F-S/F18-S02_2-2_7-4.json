He\u2019s grinning, helmet askew, determined to land a trick he\u2019s been practicing for weeks. I know how risky that ramp is\u2014last month, someone broke their arm there. I\u2019m supposed to watch out for him, make sure he\u2019s safe, especially when Mom\u2019s not around. But then I glance at my phone: a call from the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for months. This is my shot to push for the bill that could change everything for our community. The aide says she only has ten minutes. My heart pounds. Max is already setting up for his run, and I can see the nerves in his eyes. I want to be there for him, to shout encouragement or stop him if it looks too dangerous. But if I miss this call, I might lose my chance to make a real difference. I stand frozen, torn between the ramp and the ringing phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
