She looked anxious, twirling a pencil between her fingers. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to try something new?\u201d she asked, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014she needed my wisdom, my stories, my steady hand to help her navigate this uncertain moment.\n\nBut as she spoke, my eyes kept drifting to the newsletter. The city was asking for feedback on the bus routes, and the survey closed in a few hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved, that I\u2019d do my part as a citizen to help shape our community. I knew my input mattered, especially for people like me who relied on public transit.\n\nMy granddaughter\u2019s question hung in the air, and I felt torn. She needed my full attention, my thoughtful words. But the city needed my voice, too. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart ached as I wrestled with which responsibility to honor first."}
