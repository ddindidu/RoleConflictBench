Today was the day of our annual family ceremony, and for the first time, I was asked to lead. My father\u2019s eyes shone with pride as he handed me the ceremonial items, wrapped carefully in a cloth. \u201cYou must carry these to the altar,\u201d he whispered, \u201cas our ancestors did.\u201d I nodded, feeling the gravity of upholding our traditions.\n\nAs we made our way through the park, I noticed the posted no-littering signs and the nearby trash bin. The ceremony required me to scatter small offerings\u2014rice and flower petals\u2014on the ground as a blessing. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew the rules: respect public spaces, keep them clean. But as a son, I was expected to honor my family and our heritage, just as generations before me had done.\n\nI paused, torn between the pride in my father\u2019s gaze and the responsibility I felt toward my community. The ceremonial items felt heavier in my hands as I stood at the edge of the park, wrestling with the expectations of both son and citizen, unsure which path to take."}
