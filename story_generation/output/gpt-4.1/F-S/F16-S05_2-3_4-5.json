But my phone buzzes, and I see a message from my client\u2019s family\u2014nervous, desperate. The trial is in two hours, and I\u2019m their only hope. I know every detail of the case, every argument I need to make, and I can\u2019t afford to be distracted. Yet, the guilt gnaws at me. If I leave the laundry, I let my family down, breaking a small but important promise. If I stay and fold, I risk being late, unprepared, and possibly jeopardizing my client\u2019s future. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I stand frozen, torn between the home that needs me and the courtroom that demands me."}
