Lately, their world has been unraveling, and I promised I\u2019d be here\u2014really here\u2014whenever they needed me. Today, though, I also remembered that my only chance to grab my valid ID from home is this morning, if I want to vote tomorrow. The polls will be open, but I can\u2019t vote without that ID, and I won\u2019t have another chance to get it before work and other obligations pile up. My partner\u2019s eyes are red and pleading, silently asking me not to leave, not even for a moment. I feel the weight of their need, the expectation that I\u2019ll be their anchor. But the civic duty tugs at me too, the knowledge that my vote matters, that I have a responsibility to show up. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the person who needs me most and the obligation I feel to my community."}
