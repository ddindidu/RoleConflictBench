The subject line was urgent: \u201cMandatory Procedures\u2014Immediate Action Required.\u201d My heart sank as I read the details. If we didn\u2019t follow these new guidelines to the letter, the service we\u2019d worked so hard to build could be shut down. I knew how much the community depended on us, and the coordinator\u2019s expectations were clear\u2014drop everything, comply, and ensure the service\u2019s survival.\n\nBut as I looked up, I saw my child\u2019s hopeful eyes. For weeks, I\u2019d promised that if I managed our budget carefully, I\u2019d buy the Nintendo they\u2019d been dreaming of. It was more than a toy; it was a symbol of my commitment to them, a reward for their patience and understanding as I juggled work and volunteering. The money I\u2019d set aside was just enough, but now, with the volunteer program in crisis, I wondered if I\u2019d need to redirect those funds to help cover emergency costs.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. My child\u2019s trust, the community\u2019s needs, my own sense of responsibility\u2014each tugged at me, demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
