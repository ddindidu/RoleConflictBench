The courthouse was only a block away, and I could already picture the disapproving looks if I walked in late again. Just as I rounded the corner, I spotted my stepbrother, Jamie, on the opposite curb, headphones in, eyes glued to his phone. He stepped off the curb, oblivious to the car speeding down the street. My heart leapt into my throat. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d definitely miss the start of the meeting, maybe even get written up.
