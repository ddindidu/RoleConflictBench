Mom had made it clear\u2014everyone was expected to be there, no excuses. It was rare for all of us to be together, and I knew how much it meant to her. At the same time, my inbox pinged with a message from the volunteer coordinator. She suggested that, if I had extra time during my shift, I could reorganize the supply closet\u2014a task she\u2019d hinted was overdue but not urgent. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me. My family wanted me present, laughing and sharing stories at the table. But as a volunteer, I prided myself on being reliable and thorough, and I knew the coordinator trusted me to take initiative. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s disappointment if I missed dinner, but I also imagined the satisfaction of leaving the supply closet in perfect order. My mind raced, torn between being the dependable sibling and the dedicated volunteer, unsure which role I should let down."}
