But as I stepped into the kitchen, I saw my husband already bustling around, trying to tidy up before his parents arrived. He looked at me, hopeful, and asked if I could help with the cleaning and meal prep. The house was a mess, and with relatives coming, he needed me to share the load, just as we always promised we would.\n\nMy mind raced. I knew how much it meant to him, to us, to present a warm, welcoming home. But the clock was ticking, and I couldn\u2019t risk being late for court. My client was counting on me, and my reputation as an advocate depended on my punctuality and focus. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my husband\u2019s expectant eyes, the relentless buzz of legal deadlines. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the home I\u2019d built and the career I\u2019d fought for, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me in this moment."}
