As a citizen, I prided myself on being organized\u2014my taxes were ready a month early, and I\u2019d already planned to volunteer at the free vaccine clinic this weekend. It felt good to contribute, to do my part for the community\u2019s well-being. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from my stepdad: \u201cRough week. Can we talk tonight?\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to ask if everything was okay at home, to offer the emotional support he rarely sought but deeply needed. My mom had been distant lately, and I was the bridge between them. The expectation to be present for my family tugged at me, just as the community\u2019s needs called from another direction. I felt torn, the demands of being a good step-child and a responsible citizen pulling me in opposite ways, my heart caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
