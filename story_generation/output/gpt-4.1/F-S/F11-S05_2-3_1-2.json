It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen, and I could hear the tremor in his voice before he even spoke. \u201cCan you come over? I really need you right now,\u201d he whispered, and I could tell he\u2019d been crying. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when he was hurting. But my client was waiting in the next room, desperate for legal advice that couldn\u2019t wait\u2014her business was on the line, and she needed my full attention and expertise. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my brother\u2019s expectation that I\u2019d drop everything to support him, and my client\u2019s trust that I\u2019d guide her through this crisis with clarity and focus.
