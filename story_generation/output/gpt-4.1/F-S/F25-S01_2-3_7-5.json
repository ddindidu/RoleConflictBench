My mom barely spoke, her eyes shadowed with worry. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. I wanted to ask what was wrong, to offer comfort, but I had to leave soon for my volunteer shift at the clinic. There, I was trusted with sensitive files, sorting through medical histories that I could never discuss outside those walls. Today, as I glanced at the files, I saw a familiar name\u2014someone my parents knew, someone whose struggles might explain the tension at home. My heart pounded. I felt pulled in two directions: the urge to help my family by sharing what I\u2019d learned, and the responsibility to protect the privacy of the people I was helping at the clinic. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good step-child and an ethical volunteer."}
