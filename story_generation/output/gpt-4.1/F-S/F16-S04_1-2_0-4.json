She told me about her boss\u2019s snide comment and the endless emails, her voice light but her eyes tired. I wanted to wrap my arms around her, listen, and let her know I was here\u2014she always says I\u2019m her anchor on days like this. But as she spoke, I remembered the email from the election office: I\u2019d left my ID at home, and today was my only window to pick it up before work. If I missed it, I might not be able to vote tomorrow. My partner needed me to be present, to listen and reassure her, but the clock was ticking. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. Was I a bad spouse if I left her alone with her worries? Would I be irresponsible if I risked my vote? My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between the person I love and the duty I owed to my community."}
