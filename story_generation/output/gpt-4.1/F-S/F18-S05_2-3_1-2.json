My little brother trudged in, his eyes red and shoulders slumped. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, and he needed me. As his sibling, I was supposed to be his safe place, the one who listened and helped him through these moments. But my phone buzzed again: my client\u2019s message, desperate for guidance on a legal issue that couldn\u2019t wait. As their advocate, I was expected to respond quickly and accurately, to be the professional they could trust in a crisis. My brother hovered in the doorway, waiting for me to notice him, while my laptop screen flashed with reminders of my client\u2019s urgency. My heart twisted as I tried to decide where to turn first, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing in on me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
