Mom always reminded me to keep an eye on him, especially since he\u2019s younger and tends to wander off. As we turned the corner onto Maple Street, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator at the after-school program. The message was urgent: new safety procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the program would be suspended. I was supposed to head straight there and help set things up, no exceptions. Jamie tugged at my sleeve, asking if we could stop by the park for a few minutes. I knew he\u2019d been looking forward to it all day, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down or leave him alone. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014if I didn\u2019t show up on time and follow the new rules, the whole program could be in jeopardy. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the responsible sibling Jamie needed and the reliable volunteer everyone was counting on."}
