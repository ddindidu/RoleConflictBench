As a parent, I know my family depends on me to keep the lights on and food on the table. The grocery list grows longer, and the kids need new shoes. Every cent counts. But as a citizen, I feel the weight of my other responsibilities. My tax documents are ready, and I know paying taxes supports schools and roads\u2014things my family and neighbors rely on. This weekend, the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic, and they\u2019re short on volunteers. I want to help, to do my part for public health, especially after the tough year we\u2019ve all had. But if I take time off work to volunteer, I\u2019ll lose a day\u2019s pay\u2014money we really need. My mind spins with the pressure of these expectations, torn between providing for my family and stepping up for my community. I stare at the calendar, heart pounding, unsure which role I can afford to let down."}
