She had just won her school\u2019s art competition, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate her achievement. My daughter had asked me to say a few words, to make the moment special. As I glanced at the clock, my phone buzzed with a notification\u2014a reminder from the activist group I\u2019d joined. The petition we\u2019d worked on for weeks was about to be sent to the state senator, and this was my last chance to add my signature and a personal note. I knew how much my voice mattered; I\u2019d promised my fellow advocates I\u2019d be there for every push. But now, my family was waiting, expecting me to be present, to share in this milestone. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the cause I believed in, and the granddaughter who looked up to me. I stared at my phone, then at the living room, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
