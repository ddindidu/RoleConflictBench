My partner sat across from me, eyes red and voice trembling as they recounted the latest blow in their ongoing crisis.

But the clock kept ticking, and I knew my client was counting on me too. Missing this court session could jeopardize their case, undoing weeks of preparation and trust. My mind raced, torn between the person I love and the person who needs my advocacy.
