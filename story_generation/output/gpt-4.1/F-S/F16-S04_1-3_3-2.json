The laundry basket overflows, shirts and socks tumbling onto the living room floor. My spouse\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you please fold the laundry before dinner? I\u2019ve done the dishes and cooked.\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, and lately, I\u2019ve been falling behind. But then I remember\u2014the polling station closes in ten minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I\u2019d do my part as a citizen. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cLast chance to vote!\u201d I stare at the laundry, then at the door. If I leave now, I\u2019ll break my promise at home. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote. My chest tightens as I weigh the disappointment in my spouse\u2019s eyes against the responsibility I feel as a voter. The seconds tick by, and I stand frozen, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
