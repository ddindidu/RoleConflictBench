The Nintendo box sat on the passenger seat, a promise I\u2019d made to Jamie weeks ago. Money was tight, but I\u2019d scraped together enough, knowing how much it meant to him\u2014my stepson, who still eyed me with cautious hope. I was supposed to be home by now, to hand it to him before school, to see that rare, genuine smile. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: court in forty minutes, across town. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t be late; my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and preparation. My boss had made it clear\u2014no more excuses. I gripped the steering wheel, torn. If I went home, I\u2019d risk my client\u2019s case and my job. If I drove straight to court, I\u2019d break my promise to Jamie, and maybe lose a little more of his trust. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
