She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply closet, hinting it would be helpful if I could tackle it before the next event. I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift started in an hour.

They\u2019d been struggling with a tough decision at work all week, and I knew how much they needed me to listen, to offer comfort and advice.
