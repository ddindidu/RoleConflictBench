She wanted to know how my day was going and if I\u2019d eaten lunch yet. I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my meal, like I usually sent her every afternoon. At the same time, I remembered the volunteer coordinator\u2019s email from this morning\u2014she\u2019d suggested reorganizing the supply shelves if I had extra time. I glanced at the clock. If I stopped now to text my mom, I\u2019d lose my momentum and might not finish the new organization system before my shift ended. But if I ignored her message, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call, and I\u2019d feel guilty for breaking our daily routine. I could almost hear her voice in my head, asking if everything was okay. My hands hovered over my phone, torn between the comfort of reassuring my mom and the responsibility of following through on my volunteer duties. The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between being a good son and a reliable volunteer."}
