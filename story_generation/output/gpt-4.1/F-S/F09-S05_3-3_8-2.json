My phone buzzed with a reminder: the home loan repayment was due in two months. As a mother, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability pressing down on me. I needed to review our expenses, maybe take on extra work, anything to make sure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. But just as I opened the spreadsheet, my client\u2019s name flashed on my phone. She was in the middle of a legal crisis, desperate for clear, immediate advice. As her advocate, I knew she depended on me to guide her through this storm, to be precise and present. My heart pounded as I stared at the two open windows on my computer\u2014one filled with numbers and family hopes, the other with legal documents and a client\u2019s trust. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, each urgent, each important. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil tighter, knowing I had to choose which role to answer first."}
