The weight of the case pressed on my shoulders\u2014my client\u2019s future hung in the balance, and every detail mattered. My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to share her first-day stories, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present. My daughter had already reminded me how important it was to keep our family close, to be the grandfather who always had time. But the files in front of me demanded my full attention; missing a single point could cost my client dearly. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the family who needed my warmth and encouragement, the other by the client who depended on my focus and expertise. The phone vibrated again, and I stared at it, caught between the expectations of being a devoted grandfather and a dedicated advocate, unsure which call to answer first."}
