My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in fifteen minutes, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks. She wanted me there, front row, cheering her on as she read her story aloud. I\u2019d promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But here I was, standing in a line at the polling station, clutching my ID, listening to the election official explain that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closed\u2014in just ten minutes. The official\u2019s tone was firm: no exceptions, no extensions. I could see the expectation in his eyes, the unspoken demand to do my civic duty properly. My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you. She keeps looking at the door.\u201d I felt torn in two, the weight of my daughter\u2019s hope and the responsibility of my vote pressing down on me. I stood frozen, caught between being the father my child needed and the citizen my country expected."}
