My volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in fifteen minutes, and I prided myself on being reliable. But right now, my son darted between supermarket aisles, giggling as he weaved past startled shoppers. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why his behavior was wrong\u2014how we respect others\u2019 space and act responsibly in public. That\u2019s what a good father does, right? Teaches discipline, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But if I took the time to do that now, I\u2019d be late for my shift. Sure, the kitchen had plenty of volunteers at the start, but I hated the idea of letting the team down, even for a few minutes. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the father who teaches right from wrong, or the volunteer who always shows up on time. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
