The election official\u2019s voice is calm but firm as she explains that, due to a registration mismatch, I need to fill out a provisional ballot form. It\u2019s almost closing time\u2014just ten minutes left. I nod, trying to listen, but my mind is racing. My children are waiting at school, and I promised I\u2019d be there when the bell rings. They get anxious if I\u2019m late, and today is the last day before summer break. I can picture their faces, scanning the crowd for me, wondering if I forgot. But the official is watching me expectantly, and I know how important it is to vote, to follow the rules, to make my voice heard. I feel torn in two, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My pen hovers over the form, my phone buzzing with a reminder from the school. I take a shaky breath, caught between being the mother my children need and the citizen my country expects."}
