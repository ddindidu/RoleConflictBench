It\u2019s the one time of year when everyone gathers, and I\u2019m expected to keep the family close, sharing stories and checking in on everyone\u2019s lives. This year, as we sat around the living room, my daughter asked about my volunteer work at the community center. She wanted to know about the people I help, curious if I\u2019d met anyone interesting. I could feel the family\u2019s eyes on me, expecting a story, a connection, something to bring us closer.\n\nBut as a volunteer, I know I\u2019m trusted to respect the privacy of those I help. Even though nothing sensitive had come up in my conversations at the center, I felt a knot in my stomach. The family wanted warmth and openness, but I was bound by a promise of confidentiality, even in the smallest details. I could sense their disappointment as I hesitated, torn between sharing to strengthen our family bond and keeping my word to those who had trusted me. The room grew quiet, and I wrestled with what to say next."}
