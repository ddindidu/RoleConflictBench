The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised the kids I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like every other Friday. They always looked for me, their faces lighting up when they spotted me in the crowd. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the volunteer coordinator. The shelter was in chaos; a new directive had just come down, and every volunteer was needed to implement the new safety procedures immediately. If we didn\u2019t act fast, the service might be shut down for good. I could almost hear the coordinator\u2019s voice in my head, stern and urgent, reminding us of our commitment and the people depending on us. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. My stepchildren needed me to be there, to show up as their parent. The shelter needed me to follow through, to be reliable in a crisis. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, caught between two promises I couldn\u2019t keep at the same time."}
