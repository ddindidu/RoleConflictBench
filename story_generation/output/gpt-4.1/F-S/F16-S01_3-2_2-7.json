The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: everyone needed to be at the shelter early tomorrow to review the new safety procedures. They\u2019d emphasized how crucial it was for all volunteers to follow the updated steps, especially after last week\u2019s incident. I knew how much they were counting on me to set an example.\n\nBut as I glanced at my partner, curled up under the covers, I felt a different kind of weight. They\u2019d barely slept in days, their eyes red from crying, their voice trembling every time they spoke. I\u2019d promised to be there, to hold them through the night, to listen and reassure them that things would get better. They needed me now more than ever, and I could see the fear in their eyes whenever I mentioned leaving, even for a few hours.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the responsibility I felt toward the people at the shelter and the promise I\u2019d made to the person I love most. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
