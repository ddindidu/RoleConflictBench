Can\u2019t wait to celebrate!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her first job, and our family was gathering to make her feel special. As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me, and I wanted to show her the same support. But then my calendar pinged, reminding me of my volunteer shift at the community center, also starting at 6. I was expected to be on time, to set an example for the newer volunteers. Still, I knew the others could handle things if I was a bit late, but I also didn\u2019t want to let the team down. My chest tightened as I weighed the disappointment in my sister\u2019s eyes against the responsibility I felt toward my fellow volunteers. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, torn between being the brother my sister needed and the volunteer my team relied on."}
