My stepmom had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, especially since my stepsister was coming home from college. I knew how much it meant to her that we all sat together, even if I sometimes felt like an outsider at the table. Just as I was about to reply, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator. There\u2019d been a sudden change in protocol at the shelter, and everyone on shift tonight had to follow the new procedures exactly, or risk the service being shut down. I was scheduled to help, and the coordinator\u2019s message made it clear: no exceptions, no late arrivals. My heart pounded as I weighed the two demands. My family expected me to show up, to be present and supportive, but the shelter needed me too, and I\u2019d promised to be reliable. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure which responsibility I should let down."}
