My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014again. I knew what it was: the post I\u2019d made about climate justice was exploding online. Notifications kept popping up, people asking questions, sharing their own stories, and waiting for me to respond. This was the moment I\u2019d been working toward as an activist, the chance to educate and connect with so many people at once. But here, in this dining room, my stepmom was watching me, hoping I\u2019d join in the laughter and stories, not stare at my phone. I could feel the weight of their expectations\u2014be present, be part of the family, make this new arrangement work. But my activist side screamed that I couldn\u2019t let this opportunity slip by. My hands itched to type, but I forced a smile, torn between the family I was trying to belong to and the cause I was fighting for."}
