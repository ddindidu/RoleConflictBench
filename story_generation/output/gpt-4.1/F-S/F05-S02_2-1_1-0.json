My wife paces the living room, her brow furrowed, voice trembling as she talks through the impossible choice her boss has given her. She needs me\u2014needs my full attention, my reassurance, my advice. I can see the hope in her eyes, the way she\u2019s searching my face for comfort. But my phone keeps lighting up with messages from the group chat. There\u2019s a protest happening downtown, a small but crucial demonstration, and they\u2019re short on people. The live-stream shows my friend\u2019s anxious face, pleading for backup. I know how important it is to show up, to stand together, to not let the movement lose momentum. My heart pounds as I try to listen to my wife, but my mind is split, torn between being the partner she deserves and the activist I promised to be. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
