She\u2019s upset, her voice trembling as she tells me how my recent activism post embarrassed her in front of her friends. I want to listen, to show her that I respect her feelings and that our relationship matters more than anything. But as she talks, my phone lights up again\u2014my cause is trending, and this is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for. If I add a thoughtful comment now, I could reach thousands, maybe even change some minds. My heart pounds. I know my sister expects me to be present, to communicate and resolve this tension between us. At the same time, my fellow activists are counting on me to seize this opportunity, to educate and inspire. I look at my sister\u2019s anxious face, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
