The petition deadline was minutes away, and everyone was urging me to add my name before it was sent to the lawmaker. My heart raced\u2014I\u2019d spent weeks helping draft the language, and my signature would show my commitment. Just as I opened the link, my stepdad walked in, his face drawn and tired. \u201cHey, can we talk?\u201d he asked quietly. I remembered Mom mentioning he\u2019d been stressed at work. I knew I should check in, ask if everything was okay, be the supportive step-child they needed. But the petition window blinked on my screen, demanding my attention. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest. If I turned away now, I\u2019d let down my activist friends and the cause I cared about. But if I ignored my stepdad, I\u2019d fail the family I was trying so hard to belong to. My hands shook as I hovered between the two worlds, each demanding a piece of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
