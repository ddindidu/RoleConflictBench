I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be patient, to guide him gently, to show him the importance of honesty and following rules. Just this morning, I\u2019d reminded him that doing the right thing matters, even when it\u2019s hard.\n\nLater, at the polling station, I handed my ballot to the poll worker. She glanced at the envelope and frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your signature smudged. Could you re-sign it so your vote counts?\u201d I hesitated, remembering the instructions: sign only once, no alterations. The rules were clear, but so was her concern that my vote might be rejected.\n\nMy mind raced. At home, I\u2019d insisted on integrity, on respecting rules. Here, I was being asked to bend them for a good reason. If I re-signed, was I setting a bad example? If I refused, was I risking my vote? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the expectations of a step-parent and the duties of a voter."}
