My younger sister sent a picture of the packed car, and my mom reminded me how much it meant to her that we\u2019d all be together. As their older brother, I knew how much they counted on me to show up, to be present, to keep our traditions alive. But my calendar glared back at me\u2014a minor court hearing scheduled for the same day. As an advocate, even if the case wasn\u2019t high-stakes, my client expected me to be there, to stand by them, to show that their concerns mattered. I could hear my dad\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cFamily comes first,\u201d but then I pictured my client, anxious and alone if I didn\u2019t show. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each tugging in a different direction, and I felt the knot in my stomach tighten as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations."}
