I caught the poll worker\u2019s eye as she noticed the smudge on my envelope. \u201cMa\u2019am, could you please re-sign this? It\u2019s important for your vote to count,\u201d she said gently, holding out a pen. At the same moment, I heard a crash\u2014my son had knocked over a display of cereal boxes. My heart pounded. I knew I needed to teach him not to run wild in public, to respect rules and other people\u2019s space. But the poll worker was waiting, and I\u2019d always believed in the importance of following voting procedures exactly, setting an example as a responsible citizen. My son\u2019s wide eyes met mine, full of mischief and a hint of fear, while the poll worker\u2019s patient smile was tinged with urgency. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
