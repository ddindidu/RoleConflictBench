Money\u2019s been tight, but I managed to set aside just enough. Today, as we walked through the park, he clutched the empty Nintendo box, grinning ear to ear. He asked if he could toss the box away, but the trash bin was overflowing, and garbage spilled onto the ground. He looked at me, box in hand, eyes pleading for permission to just leave it beside the bin like others had done. \n\nI felt the weight of my two roles pressing in. As a step-parent, I wanted to keep his joy intact, to show him I could be the reliable adult he needs. But as a citizen, I knew the rules\u2014no littering, respect public spaces, set a good example. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to let him do what was easy, to keep his happiness intact, and the responsibility to teach him what\u2019s right, even if it meant risking his disappointment."}
