I promised myself I\u2019d participate, maybe even ask about after-school programs. But right now, my son is darting between the supermarket aisles, giggling as he weaves past carts and startled shoppers. I feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and self-control. My heart pounds with the pressure: I want to be the parent who guides my child, who doesn\u2019t let him disrupt others. But I also want to be the citizen who shows up, who voices concerns and helps shape our neighborhood\u2019s future. My phone vibrates with a notification\u2014\u201cLast chance to submit your question!\u201d\u2014as my son disappears behind a display of cereal boxes. I stand frozen, torn between chasing after him and typing out my thoughts, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding my attention, knowing I can\u2019t give either one what it truly deserves in this moment."}
