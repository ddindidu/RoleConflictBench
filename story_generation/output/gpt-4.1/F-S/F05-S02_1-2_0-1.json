The protest march is about to start, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant\u2014everyone\u2019s counting on me. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my wife: \u201cRough day at work. Can we talk for a bit?\u201d She\u2019s not one to ask for much, and I know she needs me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. I look at the protest sign leaning against the wall, the one I painted last night while she was already asleep. The group chat is blowing up\u2014organizers asking where I am, reminding me how important my voice is today. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s quiet need for support tugs at me, but so does the urgent call for justice outside. I pace the living room, torn between the warmth of home and the roar of the crowd waiting for me. My hands tremble as I try to decide which promise to keep, feeling the ache of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
