I glance at the screen\u2014Mom. It\u2019s Sunday, our day for a long call, the one thing she asks of me: to check in, to share, to let her know I\u2019m okay. I can almost hear her voice, gentle but worried, asking if I\u2019m eating well, if I\u2019m safe. But the megaphone is being handed to me, and the organizers are waving me forward. I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, to set the tone for the march we\u2019ve spent weeks planning. People are counting on me to be present, to be loud, to be unwavering. My thumb hovers over the answer button, my heart pounding with the weight of both worlds. I want to be a good son, to reassure my parents, but I also want to be a good activist, to stand up for what I believe in. The crowd\u2019s chant is building, my phone is still ringing, and I\u2019m caught in the space between two voices calling my name."}
