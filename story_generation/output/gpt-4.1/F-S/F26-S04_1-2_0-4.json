She was about to start her first job and wanted to talk, hoping for some guidance. I could hear the hope in her words, the way she trusted me to help her make sense of this new chapter. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and share what I\u2019ve learned over the years. But at the same time, I remembered that today was my only chance to drive across town and pick up my ID from home\u2014without it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to vote tomorrow. The polls would still be open, but I wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity to get my ID. My granddaughter needed me now, but so did my civic duty. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me, each demanding my presence in a different place. My heart ached as I tried to decide which role to honor in this moment, knowing that either choice meant letting someone\u2014or something\u2014down."}
