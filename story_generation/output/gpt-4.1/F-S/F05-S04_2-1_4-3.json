She looked at me, a silent plea in her eyes, and I knew she expected me to help. The kids had soccer practice later, and everyone needed clean uniforms. I promised her last night I\u2019d take care of the laundry, but today is also election day. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My wallet was missing my main ID, but I remembered I had a spare card in the drawer upstairs. I could fetch it later, but if I waited too long, the lines at the polling station would be unbearable. My wife\u2019s expectation was clear: she needed my help now, not later. But the civic duty to vote tugged at me, too. I stood in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the thought of my vote counting. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my wife\u2019s eyes against the importance of participating in the election."}
