They\u2019d finally opened up about the stress at work, their voice trembling as they shared worries they\u2019d kept hidden for weeks. I knew how much it meant to them that I listened, that I was present, that I communicated openly in return. I reached for their hand, ready to reassure them, when the building alarms blared, echoing through the apartment. The city\u2019s emergency alert flashed on my phone: flash-flood warning, water rising fast. As a citizen, I knew what was expected\u2014help neighbors, check on the elderly down the hall, make sure everyone was safe. But my spouse\u2019s eyes pleaded for me to stay, to keep talking, to be the partner they needed in this moment. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to rush out and help my community and the need to be here, right now, for the person I love most. The rain kept falling, the alarms kept ringing, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
