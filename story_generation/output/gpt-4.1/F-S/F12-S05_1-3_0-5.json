My husband walked in, dropped his bag, and sighed. \u201cRough day,\u201d he said, rubbing his temples. I looked up, catching the tiredness in his eyes. He needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. But my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from my client. Tomorrow\u2019s trial could change everything for them, and I still had hours of preparation left. My mind raced with legal arguments and cross-examination strategies, but my heart ached seeing my partner\u2019s need for support. I wanted to close my laptop, to hold his hand and let him know I was there. Yet, the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed on me. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who depended on me most, each expecting my full attention, each deserving it. I took a deep breath, caught between the roles of wife and advocate, unsure which need to answer first."}
