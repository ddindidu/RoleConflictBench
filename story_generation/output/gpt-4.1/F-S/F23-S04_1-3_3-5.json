My wallet, with my ID, is still at the office across town. I\u2019m about to dash out when I hear a crash in the kitchen. My stepson, Jamie, stands frozen, milk pooling around a shattered glass. He looks at me, wide-eyed, waiting for my reaction. I remember the promise I made to myself: to teach him responsibility and kindness, to never let him feel like an afterthought. But the election is tonight, and I have one chance to vote, to do my civic duty. The rules are clear: no ID, no ballot. Jamie\u2019s lip trembles. He needs me to guide him, to show him how to handle mistakes with honesty and care. But the clock is ticking, and the weight of my other role presses in. I feel torn, my heart pounding, as I stand between the kitchen and the door, between being the parent Jamie needs and the citizen I want to be."}
