I\u2019d picked up an extra shift this morning, hoping the overtime would stretch far enough to cover this week\u2019s expenses. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPolls close at 7 PM.\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I\u2019d have a say in the decisions shaping my children\u2019s future. But now, with the sun dipping low and dinner still to make, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My family needed me to keep the lights on, to make sure there was food on the table. But as a voter, I owed it to them\u2014and to myself\u2014to show up, to be counted. The minutes ticked by, and I felt torn, caught between the immediate needs of my family and the long-term responsibility of my vote. My heart pounded as I drove home, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
