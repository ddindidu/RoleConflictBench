It shows you\u2019re truly part of the family.\u201d Her eyes had been hopeful, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to my dad. I wanted to belong, to honor their traditions, but the ceremony involved sharing stories about our lives, opening up in front of everyone. \n\nEarlier that day, at the community center, I\u2019d volunteered at the check-in table. A woman, nervous and soft-spoken, confided in me about her struggles\u2014details she\u2019d never want repeated. I promised her privacy, knowing how much trust that took. \n\nNow, as I rehearsed what I might say for the ceremony, I realized the only story that fit the family\u2019s expectations was the one the woman had shared. It was powerful, moving, and would show my understanding of family values. But it wasn\u2019t my story to tell. My stepmother\u2019s words pressed on me, but so did the woman\u2019s trust. I felt torn, caught between the family I wanted to be part of and the promise I\u2019d made as a volunteer."}
