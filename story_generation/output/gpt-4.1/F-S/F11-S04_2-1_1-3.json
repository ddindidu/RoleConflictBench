He sounded upset, his words tumbling out about a fight with his best friend and how he just needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I knew he counted on me to listen, to be there when he was hurting. I promised him I\u2019d come over after breakfast. But as I was about to leave, I realized I\u2019d forgotten my ID for voting, and today was the last day. I could use my passport, but it was at home, a half-hour away in the opposite direction from my brother\u2019s place. The polling station would be open all day, but if I waited until later, I might miss my chance if something else came up. My brother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, shaky and vulnerable, while the civic duty to vote pressed on me with its own weight. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between being the sister he needed and the responsible voter I wanted to be."}
