Suddenly, I saw the alert: the vote was happening in less than an hour, and the swing representative was still undecided. My activist group was counting on me to call, to make our case one last time. My heart pounded as I fumbled for the number, but then I saw my stepbrother darting ahead, earbuds in, about to step into the street without looking. My mom always said I had to look out for him, keep him safe, especially since the accident last year. I froze, phone in hand, torn between yelling to stop him and dialing the legislator. Both roles demanded everything from me in that split second\u2014my family\u2019s trust, my movement\u2019s hope. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
