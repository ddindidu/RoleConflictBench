She\u2019d mentioned that if I had a spare moment, I should try to reorganize the hygiene kits to make distribution smoother. I wanted to do a good job\u2014she\u2019d trusted me with this responsibility, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. As I was lining up the soap and toothbrushes, I glanced up and saw my younger brother, who had come along to help, wandering toward the busy street. He was distracted, not paying attention, and I saw a car speeding down the road. My heart pounded. I knew I was supposed to stay focused on the supplies, but my brother\u2019s safety was my responsibility too. I felt torn, caught between the expectation to be a reliable volunteer and the instinct to protect my sibling. My hands froze over the boxes as I wrestled with what to do next."}
