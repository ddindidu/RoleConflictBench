I could already picture the crowd gathering, their signs raised high, waiting for my voice to set the tone. But just as I reached for my coat, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cGrandma, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, clutching her backpack. She wanted to talk about starting high school, about making friends and finding her place. I saw the hope in her face, the trust that I\u2019d have the right words. My activist heart pounded with urgency\u2014I knew how much this march mattered, how my presence could inspire others. But my grandmother\u2019s heart ached at the thought of leaving her with questions unanswered. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me at the very same moment."}
