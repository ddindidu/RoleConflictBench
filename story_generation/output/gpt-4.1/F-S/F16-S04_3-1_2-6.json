My partner\u2019s messages came in rapid succession\u2014she was having another panic attack, her words desperate and pleading for me to come home. I could almost hear her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me, needed the calm I tried to bring her when the world felt too heavy. But here I was, a voter, and the election official\u2019s voice cut through the noise, calling for everyone with last names A\u2013M to move to the new line. My last name started with B. The new line was longer, slower, but the official\u2019s instructions were clear. I felt the weight of duty\u2014civic responsibility on one side, the person I loved most on the other. People around me shuffled, some grumbling, but I stood frozen, torn between following the rules and rushing home to hold my partner\u2019s hand.
