The house was filled with the scent of my grandmother\u2019s stew, and my father\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions, especially now, when so much seemed to be changing.

I answered, and a legislative aide introduced herself, saying she had ten minutes to discuss the bill I\u2019d been fighting for. My heart pounded.
