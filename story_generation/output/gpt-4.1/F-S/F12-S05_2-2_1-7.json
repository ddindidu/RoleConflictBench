His eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance as he explained the impossible choice his boss had given him. He needed me\u2014my advice, my comfort, the kind of support only a wife could give. I wanted to stay, to listen, to help him untangle his thoughts. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was in less than an hour, and my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and focus. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late or distracted. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to hold my husband\u2019s hand and the duty to stand by my client in court. Both needed me, both expected me to be fully present, but I couldn\u2019t split myself in two. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t ready to give."}
