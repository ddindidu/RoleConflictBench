The whole family was gathered, laughter and congratulations filling the room. I knew how much this moment meant to her\u2014and to all of us. My daughter caught my eye, silently urging me to stay a little longer, to be part of this celebration. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. My volunteer shift at the community center started in twenty minutes. I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there on time, and I prided myself on being reliable. Still, I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I hated the idea of letting them down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s joy, my commitment to serve. I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, wrestling with the guilt of disappointing someone no matter what I chose."}
