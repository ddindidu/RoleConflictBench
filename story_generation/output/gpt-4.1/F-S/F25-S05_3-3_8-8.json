As an advocate, I knew how critical my presence was\u2014missing even a minute could jeopardize the case I\u2019d worked on for months. Just as I was about to leave, my stepdad walked in, his face drawn and tired.

He looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of support I\u2019d promised to give as his step-child. My heart twisted. I wanted to stay, to listen, to be the person he needed.
