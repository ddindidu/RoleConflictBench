My son, Ethan, was at the counter, swinging his legs and munching on crackers, when he suddenly blurted out, \u201cMom, is it okay to tell a little lie if it helps someone?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my client was expecting a call in ten minutes, and I still hadn\u2019t finished reviewing the case notes. Ethan\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for guidance, and I knew this was one of those moments where I was supposed to teach him about honesty and integrity. But my mind was tangled in legal jargon and deadlines, and I worried that if I rushed my answer, I\u2019d miss the chance to shape his values. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t let my client down by being unprepared or unclear. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
