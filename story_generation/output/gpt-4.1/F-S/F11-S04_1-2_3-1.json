My younger brother begged for a movie night, and my parents wanted us all together for dinner. I could see how much it meant to them, especially since we rarely had time like this anymore. Just as we started settling on a plan, I glanced at the clock and remembered the polling station would close in a couple of hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote today, but the errands had taken longer than expected, and now I was running out of time. My mom looked at me, expecting me to chime in and help finalize our plans, but my mind was racing. If I left now, I\u2019d miss out on this rare family moment. If I stayed, I might not make it to vote. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
