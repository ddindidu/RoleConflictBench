It was a message from Mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you all weekend. Everything okay?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the polling station closed. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after all the debates and discussions I\u2019d had with friends about how important it was. But Mom\u2019s texts always carried a weight; she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, and I knew she\u2019d be up all night if I didn\u2019t reply. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between dashing out the door to make it in time and sitting down to send a thoughtful reply. I could feel the pressure building in my chest\u2014my parents expected me to stay connected, to reassure them, but my sense of civic duty was just as strong. The minutes ticked by, and I stood frozen, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible voter, wishing I could be both at once."}
