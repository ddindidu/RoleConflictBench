My granddaughter had just landed her first job, and the thread was alive with congratulations and emojis. I knew she\u2019d be waiting for my message\u2014she always said my words meant a lot. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s notification pinged: the petition to our state senator was closing in minutes. We\u2019d worked for weeks, and my signature could help push it over the threshold. My heart pounded as I scrolled between the chat and the petition link. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, reminding me how much it meant to the family when I was present, how important it was for the kids to feel supported. But the faces of those affected by the policy we were fighting for flashed in my mind, too. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full attention to both at once."}
