My husband sits across from me, his eyes searching mine, waiting for an answer. We\u2019re in the middle of a conversation about our finances\u2014he\u2019s just revealed a medical bill he\u2019s been hiding, and he wants to know everything I\u2019ve been keeping from him, too. He expects honesty, openness, and for us to work through this together. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote, something I promised myself I\u2019d never skip. I feel torn in two\u2014my husband\u2019s trust on one side, my civic duty on the other. He looks at me, vulnerable, needing me to stay. But the clock ticks louder, and I can almost hear the doors of the polling station swinging shut. My chest tightens as I weigh the cost of leaving him in this moment against the cost of not casting my vote. I open my mouth, but the words catch, and I\u2019m frozen, caught between the expectations of the woman he needs and the citizen I want to be."}
