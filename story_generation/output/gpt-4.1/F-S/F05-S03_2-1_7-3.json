She sat quietly at the kitchen table, her hands wrapped around a mug, eyes distant. I remembered our promise to always talk things through, to share our worries and support each other. I wanted to sit down, ask her what was wrong, and really listen. But as I reached for a chair, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the city\u2019s bus route survey. The city had been asking for more citizen input, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved, especially after last year\u2019s transit issues. The survey closed tonight, and I knew my feedback could help shape our neighborhood\u2019s future. I felt torn\u2014my wife needed me, but so did my community. Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides. My heart ached as I stood there, caught between being the husband she needed and the citizen I wanted to be."}
