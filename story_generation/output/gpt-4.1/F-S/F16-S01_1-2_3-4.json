It\u2019s been a long week, and the clothes have sat there, growing into a silent accusation. I promised I\u2019d fold them tonight, and I know my partner is counting on me to keep that promise. But as I\u2019m about to start, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the community center. They\u2019re short-staffed, and I\u2019m needed at the check-in table for tonight\u2019s shift.\n\nAt the center, I greet clients and help them fill out forms. One woman lingers, her voice barely above a whisper as she confides a personal worry. I listen, knowing I must respect her privacy, even as my mind drifts to the laundry at home and my spouse\u2019s likely frustration. I feel torn, pulled between the trust this client places in me and the unspoken agreement with my partner. The expectations press in from both sides, and I can\u2019t see how to meet them both. My heart pounds as I realize I have to choose, but I\u2019m not sure which role needs me more tonight."}
