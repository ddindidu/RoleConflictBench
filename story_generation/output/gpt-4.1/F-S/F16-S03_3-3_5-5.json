My spouse is bustling around the kitchen, calling out for help with the vacuuming and reminding me that her parents will arrive in less than an hour. The living room still needs dusting, and the guest bathroom is far from ready. I know how much it means to her that everything is perfect, and I promised I\u2019d share the load. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place down the street closes in two hours, and today\u2019s ballot measure could change the way our block handles parking and public safety. I\u2019ve read the proposals, and I know my neighbors are counting on everyone to show up and make their voices heard. My mind races\u2014if I leave now, I\u2019ll let my spouse down, but if I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to participate in something that matters to our community. The vacuum hums in the background, and I stand frozen, torn between the expectations of home and the responsibilities of citizenship, feeling the tension knotting in my chest."}
