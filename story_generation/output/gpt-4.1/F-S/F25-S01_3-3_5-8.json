New procedures are mandatory\u2014no exceptions. If we don\u2019t comply, the service will be suspended.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised my stepmother I\u2019d lead the family ceremony today, a tradition she said was vital to honoring my late father\u2019s memory. She\u2019d looked at me with hope, trusting I\u2019d finally step up and show I belonged. \n\nBut the ceremony started at 3 PM, the same time I was needed at the community center. I could hear my stepmother\u2019s voice in my head, urging me not to let the family down, not after everything she\u2019d done to welcome me. At the same time, I thought of the people who depended on our volunteer service, and the coordinator\u2019s warning echoed in my mind. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which part of me I\u2019d have to let down."}
