She confided in me about a struggle she was facing, her eyes darting nervously around the room. I listened, nodding, careful to keep her words safe, as I\u2019d been trained to do. Just as she finished, my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: my grandson was having a hard time, feeling lost and discouraged. My heart ached with the urge to call him, to offer the guidance and comfort only a grandmother could give. But the words the young woman had shared echoed in my mind, reminding me of the trust she\u2019d placed in me as a volunteer. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be a wise, supportive grandmother and the duty to honor the confidentiality of those I help. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, wrestling with what to do next."}
