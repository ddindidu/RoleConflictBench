My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she called, \u201cMom, can you come over? We need you. It\u2019s about Dad.\u201d My heart clenched; family always came first, and as a grandmother, I was expected to be the steady hand, the comforter, the one who held everyone together in a crisis. But as I reached for my coat, my phone lit up again\u2014my latest post about our campaign for clean water had gone viral. Hundreds of people were commenting, asking questions, hungry for information. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist, the chance to educate and rally the community. I could almost feel the weight of all those eyes on me, expecting me to lead, to respond, to seize this rare opportunity. My hands shook as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the momentum of a cause I\u2019d poured my soul into. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which demand to answer first."}
