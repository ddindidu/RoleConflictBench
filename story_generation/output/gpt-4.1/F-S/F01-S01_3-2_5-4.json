She confided in me about her fears\u2014something deeply personal, something she didn\u2019t want anyone else to know. I nodded, reassuring her that her words would stay with me, as I\u2019d promised every person who came through our doors. Just as I finished jotting down her information, my phone buzzed. It was my daughter, her message urgent: \u201cDad, we need you at home. It\u2019s about Mom. Please come.\u201d My heart pounded. As a grandfather, I knew my family needed me now more than ever. But as a volunteer, I was bound to stay, to protect the trust Mrs. Lee had just placed in me, and to respect the privacy of everyone here. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my undivided attention. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two promises I couldn\u2019t break."}
