He\u2019s supposed to say \u201cplease\u201d before I pass the salt, but he\u2019s stubborn tonight, lips pressed tight. I know I should be patient, guide him gently, remind him why manners matter. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does\u2014teaches, models, encourages. But my phone keeps buzzing on the counter. I glance at the screen: notifications piling up. The post about our campaign for clean water is exploding online. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014if I jump in now, I can answer questions, share facts, maybe even sway some opinions. The activist in me is shouting to act, to seize this rare chance. But my stepson is looking at me, waiting for my attention, needing my guidance. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
