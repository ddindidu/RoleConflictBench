She didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell something was wrong. As her older sibling, I knew I should sit with her, listen, and help her through whatever happened at school. But today was also election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before the polls closed. At the polling station, I was almost at the front of the line when an official called out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line was longer, but the official\u2019s voice was firm. I remembered the instructions: follow all directions. My phone buzzed\u2014my sister, asking if I was coming home soon. I felt torn, the weight of her need for comfort pulling me one way, the duty to follow voting rules tugging the other. My heart pounded as I stood between the two lines, caught between being the sibling she needed and the responsible voter I wanted to be."}
