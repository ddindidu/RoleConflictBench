Just as I was about to leave, my younger brother stormed into the living room, his face flushed with anger. He accused me of breaking a promise\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten to help him with his college application, and the deadline was tonight. He demanded we talk it out, right now, to clear the air and fix things between us.\n\nI could see how much it meant to him; he needed me to listen, to communicate openly and rebuild the trust we\u2019d always shared. But the clock was ticking, and I knew if I waited too long, I might miss my chance to vote. My role as a sister pulled me one way, urging me to stay and resolve our conflict, while my responsibility as a voter tugged me in the other, reminding me of my civic duty. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of family and country, unsure which role to honor first."}
