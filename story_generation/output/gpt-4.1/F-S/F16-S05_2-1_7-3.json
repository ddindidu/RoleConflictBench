My spouse walked in, eyes shadowed with worry, and I knew I should ask what was wrong. We\u2019d promised to communicate openly, to share our burdens. I reached for their hand, ready to listen, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the minor hearing I was due to attend in an hour. As an advocate, I was expected to represent my client effectively, no matter how small the case. I couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted or late, even if the stakes were low. My spouse started to talk, voice trembling, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be present, to reassure them, but my mind kept drifting to the courtroom, to the client waiting for me. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice: be the partner my spouse needed, or the advocate my client deserved."}
