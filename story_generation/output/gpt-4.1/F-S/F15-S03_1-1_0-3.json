The city newsletter. I almost deleted it, but the subject caught my eye: \u201cHelp Shape Our Bus Routes\u2014Survey Closes Soon.\u201d I remembered the last time the bus schedule changed; it made getting to the library with the kids a hassle. The survey would only take a few minutes, but I knew how these things went\u2014once I started, I\u2019d want to write thoughtful feedback, maybe even check the city\u2019s map for context.\n\nBut my kids would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there on time today, not rushing in at the last minute. My heart tugged in two directions: the parent who wanted to be present, and the citizen who wanted to make a difference. I stared at the survey link, then at my car keys, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, unsure which to reach for first."}
