As the only child at home, I knew they were counting on me to uphold our customs, to be present, to honor our roots. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cAll volunteers must follow the new safety procedures immediately. If we don\u2019t comply, the service will be shut down.\u201d The urgency in her words was clear\u2014my presence was needed at the community center, and there was no room for negotiation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family\u2019s expectations pulled me one way, the responsibility to my volunteer team tugged me another. My heart pounded as I stared at the two messages, feeling the pressure mount, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly meet both demands at once."}
