As a father, I knew the home loan repayment was looming\u2014just two months away. My wife had reminded me last night, her voice tight with worry, about the bills piling up and the need to keep our home secure for our children. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d find a way, that I\u2019d work extra hours if I had to. But as an advocate, my client\u2019s trial was just days away, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. He was counting on me to be sharp, focused, and relentless in court. Every moment I spent preparing for the case was a moment I couldn\u2019t spend searching for new clients or side work to cover the loan. My phone buzzed with a message from my client, pleading for reassurance. My heart ached with the knowledge that both my family and my client needed me\u2014fully, completely. I stared at the files on my desk, torn between the duty to my family and the oath I\u2019d taken to defend those who depended on me."}
