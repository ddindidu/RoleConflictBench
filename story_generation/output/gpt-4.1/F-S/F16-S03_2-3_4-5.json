My partner had reminded me twice this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, and I\u2019d promised to handle it today. I could hear the washing machine humming in the background, but there was still so much to do\u2014sort, wash, dry, fold. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place down the street would close in two hours. There was a ballot measure up for vote that could change the way our block handled traffic and parking, something neighbors had been debating for months. I\u2019d told myself I\u2019d go, that I\u2019d be the kind of citizen who showed up and made my voice heard. But now, standing in the middle of the mess, I felt pulled in two directions. My family was counting on me to keep things running smoothly at home, but my community needed me, too. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I stood frozen, torn between the laundry room and the front door, heart pounding as the minutes ticked away."}
