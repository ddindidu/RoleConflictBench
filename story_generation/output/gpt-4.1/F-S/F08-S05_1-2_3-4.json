This Saturday, a bright circle marked \u201cFamily Gathering\u201d glowed with my daughter\u2019s handwriting. My grandchildren had been talking about it for weeks\u2014board games, stories, laughter, and the warmth of being together. As a grandmother, I knew how much these moments mattered, how my presence made them feel loved and cherished.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed with a reminder: a crucial hearing for one of my clients was scheduled for the same day. The case was delicate, the stakes high. As their advocate, I was expected to be fully prepared, to stand by them and fight for their rights. They trusted me to be their voice, to not let them down when it mattered most.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family needed me, but so did my client. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s giggle, and at the same time, see the anxious eyes of my client. The expectations clashed inside me, and I sat at my desk, torn, unable to move, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
