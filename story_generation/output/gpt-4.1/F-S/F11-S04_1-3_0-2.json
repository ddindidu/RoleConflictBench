Come celebrate with me\u2014now!\u201d I could almost hear her excitement through the screen. She\u2019d been waiting for this moment for months, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for her, no matter what. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I hadn\u2019t voted yet. Civic duty tugged at me; I\u2019d always believed in the importance of making my voice heard, of showing up when it mattered. But my sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, full of hope and pride, expecting me to show up for her, too. I stood frozen on the sidewalk, torn between the building where my vote could count and the caf\u00e9 where my sister waited, both expecting me, both needing me. My hands shook as I tried to decide which door I would walk through."}
