It\u2019s our tradition\u2014my way of showing them I care, especially since I moved out for college. Tonight, as I dial their number, I glance at the clock. My volunteer shift at the community center starts in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019m the only one with the keys. People will be waiting outside in the cold if I\u2019m late. My mom answers, her voice warm and expectant, already asking about my week. I hear my dad in the background, eager to share his gardening updates. I want to listen, to laugh with them, to reassure them I\u2019m doing well. But my mind keeps drifting to the line forming outside the center, the responsibility I have to those waiting. My parents deserve my full attention, but so do the people counting on me to open the doors. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between being a good son and a reliable volunteer, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
