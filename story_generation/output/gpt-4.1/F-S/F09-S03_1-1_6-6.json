As a citizen, I know how important it is to show up for my community\u2014especially now, when every little bit of participation matters. The clinic needs volunteers, and I\u2019ve always prided myself on being someone who steps up. But my eyes drift to the corner, where my son\u2019s hopeful drawing of a Nintendo sits taped to the fridge. I promised him I\u2019d buy it this month, a reward for his hard work at school. But with bills piling up and the looming tax payment, I\u2019m not sure I can afford both the Nintendo and the extra expenses that come with volunteering\u2014like taking time off work or arranging childcare. My heart aches as I weigh the expectations: my son\u2019s trust in me as his mother, and my responsibility to the community as a citizen. The pressure builds, and I feel torn, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
