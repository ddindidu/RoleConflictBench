Can you come home soon?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew they\u2019d been struggling lately, and I felt the weight of needing to be there, to listen, to help however I could. But I was also here to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself and my parents I\u2019d do. The line was long, but I was almost at the front when an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name fit. The new line was barely moving, but the official\u2019s voice was firm. I hesitated, torn. If I followed instructions, I\u2019d be here even longer, and my parents would wait, maybe worry. If I stayed, I\u2019d be breaking the rules, but I could get home sooner. My heart pounded as I looked between the two lines, feeling the pull of both responsibilities, unsure which to choose."}
