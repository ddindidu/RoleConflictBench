Dad\u2019s voice was softer than usual, and I caught him rubbing his temples when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. They needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed with a message from the activist group: the vote was happening in less than an hour, and the undecided representative was taking calls. This was the moment we\u2019d been preparing for, the chance to make a real difference. My heart pounded as I looked from my parents to my phone. I felt torn in two\u2014my family needed my presence, my comfort, but my cause needed my voice, my action. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unable to move, caught between the people I love and the change I believe in."}
