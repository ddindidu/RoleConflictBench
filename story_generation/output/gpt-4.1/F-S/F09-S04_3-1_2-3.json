He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. As a mother, I knew I had to be there for him, to listen, to help him understand the seriousness of his actions, and to show the school I was taking this seriously. But today was also election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I would vote\u2014my voice mattered, especially this year. I\u2019d already misplaced my main ID, but I could still fetch my spare card from home later if I missed the morning window. My son needed me now, but so did my community. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. If I rushed to the school, I might miss my chance to vote before work. If I voted first, I\u2019d be late to the meeting, and what would that say to the school about my priorities as a mother? I sat at the kitchen table, keys in hand, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities, unsure which door to walk through first."}
