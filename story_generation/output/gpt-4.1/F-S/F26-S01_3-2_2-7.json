Her eyes were red, and she looked so small, so lost. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d she whispered. I nodded, heart aching, ready to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed. But as she began to share her worries, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the community center: a new safety protocol had just been implemented, and as a volunteer, I was expected to be there in fifteen minutes to help ensure everyone followed the new steps. The coordinator had stressed how crucial it was for all volunteers to be present and attentive, especially today. I felt torn\u2014my granddaughter needed me now, but so did the people at the center. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, caught between the needs of my family and my commitment to the community."}
