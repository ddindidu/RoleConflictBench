I glanced at my brother, helmet askew, grinning as he eyed the steep, cracked ramp in our driveway. \u201cWatch this, I\u2019ve almost got it,\u201d he said, clutching his skateboard. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But as an advocate, I had to be at the courthouse on time\u2014today\u2019s hearing could make or break my client\u2019s future. My brother\u2019s last fall had left him limping for days, and the thought of him trying this trick alone made my stomach twist. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to court. I could hear my client\u2019s anxious voice in my head, counting on me to show up, to fight for them. My brother\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, waiting for my encouragement or warning. I stood frozen, torn between the ramp and the courthouse, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which responsibility I could bear to let down."}
