My daughter\u2019s open class was starting soon, and she had begged me to be there. \u201cPlease, Daddy, I want you to see my project!\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with hope. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But now, as I inched forward, an official called out, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name started with B. The new line looked longer, but the official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014this was the rule. I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me; I wanted to set a good example for my kids about following instructions and participating in democracy. But every minute spent here was a minute lost from my daughter\u2019s big day. My heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between being the reliable father she needed and the responsible citizen I wanted to be."}
