He\u2019d barely spoken since we left the house, and I could sense the weight of something troubling him. As his grandfather, I felt the urge to offer comfort, to share some story from my own youth that might help him find his way. I wanted to show him that even when life feels heavy, there\u2019s always a path forward.\n\nJust then, he absentmindedly unwrapped a candy and, without thinking, let the wrapper slip from his fingers onto the grass. My heart tightened. As a citizen, I knew I should remind him of the rules\u2014respect the park, keep it clean, set a good example. The no-littering sign was right there, and the trash bin only a few steps away. But I could see he was hurting, and I worried that correcting him now might push him further into himself, make him feel judged when he needed understanding. I stood there, torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
