My daughter had called twice already, reminding me not to be late for the family gathering. My grandkids had been looking forward to this for weeks, and I promised them I\u2019d be there early to help set up the grill. But as I stood at the polling station, ballot envelope in hand, the poll worker frowned and pointed out the smudge on my signature. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she said gently. I could see the line behind me growing, and I knew that re-signing meant more paperwork, more waiting. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my daughter. I felt torn. As a grandfather, I wanted to keep my promise and be present for my family. As a voter, I felt a duty to follow the rules and ensure my ballot was valid. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I stood there, pen in hand, heart pounding, caught between the two worlds that mattered most to me."}
