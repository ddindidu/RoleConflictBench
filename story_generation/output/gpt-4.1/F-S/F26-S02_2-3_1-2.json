The protest had taken a sudden turn\u2014police were blocking the exits, and panic was rising. I was supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to keep everyone calm and organized, to make sure our voices were heard without anyone getting hurt. But just then, my granddaughter slid onto the bench beside me, her eyes red and distant. She didn\u2019t say much, but I could feel her sadness, the way she leaned into me for comfort. As her grandmother, I knew I should be present, listen, and offer the wisdom she needed. She was lost, and I was her anchor. Yet, my phone kept vibrating, the demands of the protest growing louder. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the crowd that needed my leadership, and toward the child who needed my love. I looked at her, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
