Today was his big day\u2014he\u2019d won a school award, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate. My daughter had asked me to be there early, to help set up and, more importantly, to be present for the moment he shared his news. I could see the pride in his eyes every time he glanced my way.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community center needed me. I was scheduled to sort confidential medical files for the afternoon, a task that demanded my full attention and absolute discretion. The coordinator had stressed how important it was to keep everything private, not even mentioning names to anyone outside the center. They were counting on me to be reliable and trustworthy.\n\nAs I looked at my grandson\u2019s eager face, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My family expected me to be there, fully present, sharing in their joy. The center expected me to honor my commitment and protect the privacy of vulnerable people. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, unsure how I could possibly meet the expectations of both worlds."}
