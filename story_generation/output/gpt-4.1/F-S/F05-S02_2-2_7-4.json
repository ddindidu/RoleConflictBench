I knew I should sit down, ask her what was wrong, and really listen\u2014she\u2019d always said that open communication was what kept us strong. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a call from a legislative aide\u2014one I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was my chance to push for the policy change I\u2019d poured months of work into, and I only had ten minutes to make my case. My wife looked up, her eyes searching mine, silently asking for my attention. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to be present for her and the responsibility I felt to the cause and the people counting on me. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I had to give in that moment."}
