She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt at work, how she worried she was failing us, and how she didn\u2019t know who else to turn to. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her words settle on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent call from the news network. They needed me live, right now, to set the record straight about our movement before the misinformation spread any further. My heart pounded. My mom\u2019s hand gripped mine, desperate for comfort, while my phone vibrated insistently, demanding my voice for the cause I\u2019d poured myself into. I could see the expectation in her eyes, the silent plea for reassurance, and at the same time, I felt the responsibility to speak up for my community. I sat frozen, torn between being the child my mom needed and the activist my cause demanded."}
