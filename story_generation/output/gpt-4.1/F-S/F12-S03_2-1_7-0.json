Remembering our promise to communicate openly, I gently asked, \u201cIs something on your mind?\u201d He hesitated, then admitted he was worried about a mistake at work that could have serious consequences. I wanted to reassure him, to listen and support him as a good wife should. But as he spoke, he absentmindedly crumpled his snack wrapper and, without thinking, tossed it onto the grass\u2014right beneath a bright no-littering sign. My heart clenched. As a citizen, I felt a strong responsibility to respect public spaces and follow the law. I glanced at the nearby trash bin, just a few steps away. Should I interrupt his vulnerable moment to point out the litter, risking making him feel judged or unsupported? Or should I let it go, betraying my own values and the expectations of a responsible citizen? The tension between my roles pulled at me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which expectation to honor."}
