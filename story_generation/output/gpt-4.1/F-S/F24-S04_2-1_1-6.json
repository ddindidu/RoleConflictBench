He barely looked up, but I could see the redness in his eyes. I knew I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, especially after the way things had been at home lately. But I glanced at my phone\u2014today was voting day, and I had promised myself I\u2019d do my civic duty. At the polling station, the official\u2019s voice rang out: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name fit, but the new line was longer and slower. I hesitated, torn between following the rules and wanting to get home quickly to check on my stepbrother. The expectation to support him weighed on me, but so did the pressure to be a responsible voter and follow instructions. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the polling place, wrestling with the demands of both roles, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
