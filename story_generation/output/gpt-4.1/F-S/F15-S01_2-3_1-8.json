The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was circled in bright red\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cUrgent\u2014mandatory procedures must be followed today or we risk shutting down the service. All hands needed.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew how much the community relied on us, and the coordinator\u2019s expectations were clear\u2014no exceptions, not even for personal reasons. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s hopeful voice, and at the same time, I pictured the faces of those who depended on our work. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences if I failed. I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the classroom and the call to serve, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
