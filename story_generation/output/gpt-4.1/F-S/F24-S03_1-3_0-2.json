He\u2019d barely slept, and the final exam tomorrow seemed to be crushing him. I wanted to be there for him, to sit by his side and reassure him that he\u2019d get through it, just like we always promised each other we would. But outside, the city was alive with shouts and banners. I\u2019d joined the demonstration, believing in the cause, but also knowing my duty as a citizen\u2014to respect the law and public property. Suddenly, someone grabbed my arm, urging me to cross the barricade, to make our voices heard. I hesitated, torn. If I stayed, I\u2019d be breaking the law, risking arrest, and betraying my responsibility as a citizen. If I left, I\u2019d abandon my stepbrother when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I stood between the barricade and the thought of my anxious brother waiting at home, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
