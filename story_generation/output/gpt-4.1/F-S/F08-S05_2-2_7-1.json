She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was alive with her updates\u2014her excitement, her nerves, her little victories. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to respond quickly, to share in her joy, to keep the family close and connected. But my laptop screen was filled with legal documents from a client whose case had suddenly become tangled and urgent. As their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, thorough advice, and I knew they were waiting anxiously for my guidance. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the duty of my profession. I stared at the blinking cursor in my granddaughter\u2019s chat, then at the dense legal text before me, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
