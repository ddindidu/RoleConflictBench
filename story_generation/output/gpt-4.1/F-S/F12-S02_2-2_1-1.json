You\u2019re leading the first chant.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just a few minutes left. My heart pounds with anticipation and responsibility. But then I see my husband sitting at the kitchen table, shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. He\u2019s been wrestling with a huge decision at work, and today he finally asks, \u201cCan we talk? I really need you right now.\u201d I see the hope in his eyes, the silent plea for comfort and advice. I know how much he relies on me, how much he needs my support. But the movement needs me too; I promised to be there, to stand at the front and give others courage. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest. I want to be the partner he deserves, but I also want to be the activist I promised to be. My hands tremble as I look from my phone to my husband, torn between two calls that matter deeply to me."}
