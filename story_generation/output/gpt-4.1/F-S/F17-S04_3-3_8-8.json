She was telling me about her anxiety, how she felt lost since Dad\u2019s health started declining. I could hear the hope in her voice, the way she needed me to reassure her, to be the strong one. I wanted to stay on the line, to tell her everything would be okay, to be the child she needed\u2014steady, comforting, present.\n\nBut my eyes kept darting to the clock. I was at the polling station, and the official had just told me there was a problem with my registration. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closed in ten minutes. The official\u2019s tone was firm, the instructions clear: I had to act now, or lose my chance to participate.\n\nMy heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two\u2014one part wanting to stay with my mom, the other knowing I had to follow the official\u2019s directions. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
