The ceremony\u2019s in ten minutes\u2014can you join the video call?\u201d My heart leaps with pride. I promised him I\u2019d be there, cheering him on, just like he\u2019s always done for me. But as I glance at the clock, my stomach tightens. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to go live on the radio, speaking about climate justice\u2014a cause I\u2019ve poured my soul into. The organizers are counting on me to represent our movement, to educate listeners and inspire action. I can\u2019t let them down, not after weeks of preparation. Yet, how can I miss this moment for my brother? He\u2019s worked so hard, and I know how much my support means to him. My mind races, torn between the expectations of being a good sister and a committed activist. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I feel the sting of letting someone down, no matter what I choose."}
