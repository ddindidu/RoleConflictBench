It was Sunday, and I knew she expected a message\u2014just a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d or \u201cDid you eat?\u201d She worried if I didn\u2019t check in, and I could almost hear her voice in my head, gentle but persistent. But my mind was still tangled in the conversation I\u2019d just had with a client. She\u2019d called unexpectedly, desperate for clarity about her case. I\u2019d tried to explain things simply, but I knew she wanted more\u2014specifics, certainty, reassurance. As her advocate, I was supposed to be clear and accurate, but I couldn\u2019t give her the answers she wanted, not in a casual chat, not without more information.\n\nNow, my phone buzzed again\u2014Mom, asking if I was okay. I felt pulled in two directions: the dutiful child who should reassure his parents, and the responsible advocate who shouldn\u2019t overstep or mislead. My thumbs hovered over the screen, my heart heavy with the weight of both roles, unsure which message to send first, or how to be enough for both."}
