The protest march is about to start, and everyone expects me to lead the first chant. I\u2019ve spent weeks organizing, rallying people, and making signs. This is the moment we\u2019ve all worked for. But as I pass the living room, I see my parents sitting together, shoulders slumped, faces drawn with exhaustion. Lately, they\u2019ve been quieter, more distant, weighed down by worries they won\u2019t share. I know they need me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to be their child. My heart aches with the pull in both directions. I want to be there for them, to offer comfort and support, but I also feel the weight of responsibility to my cause, to the people waiting for me outside. My hands tremble as I glance between the door and my parents, torn by the impossible choice between being the child they need and the activist I\u2019ve promised to be."}
