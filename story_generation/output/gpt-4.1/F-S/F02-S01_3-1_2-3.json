The principal\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to come in. Your son was involved in a bullying incident.\u201d My heart twisted with worry and shame. As a father, I knew I had to be there for him, to show up, listen, and help him understand the gravity of his actions. I owed it to him\u2014and to the child he hurt.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the community center. As a volunteer, I was expected to join the afternoon session, where I\u2019d be helping a group of teens. I\u2019d promised to be there, to offer a safe space and keep their trust. Just last week, I\u2019d reassured them that what they shared with me would stay confidential, that I was someone they could rely on.\n\nNow, as I sat there, I felt pulled in two directions. My son needed me, but so did the teens who counted on my presence and discretion. I stared at the school entrance, my mind racing, torn between the demands of being a good father and a trustworthy volunteer."}
