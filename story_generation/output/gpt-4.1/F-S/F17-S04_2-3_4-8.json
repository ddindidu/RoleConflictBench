My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe always vote together, and we never sign anything we don\u2019t fully understand. That\u2019s our way.\u201d Just last night, my family gathered around the dinner table, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions\u2014never rush, never compromise our values, always double-check everything. But now, the election official was explaining, her voice urgent, that my registration didn\u2019t match. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes. She handed me the form, her eyes expectant. I could feel the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, warning me not to act hastily. Yet, as a voter, I was supposed to follow the official\u2019s instructions and make sure my voice was heard. My hands trembled as I stared at the form, torn between the duty to my family\u2019s traditions and the responsibility to participate in the election."}
