My mom was making breakfast, but her eyes looked tired. I remembered to ask, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d She hesitated, then admitted Dad had been feeling down lately, and she was worried. I felt the weight of her words, knowing she needed me to listen, maybe even stay a bit longer. But I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d have time to vote and still get to work on time. I checked my wallet for my ID, but realized I\u2019d grabbed the wrong one. I could go back for the right card later, but that would mean coming home after work, when my parents might be asleep. My mom\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, silently asking for comfort. At the same time, I felt the civic pressure to vote, to do my part. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s needs and my responsibility as a citizen. I stood in the kitchen, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
