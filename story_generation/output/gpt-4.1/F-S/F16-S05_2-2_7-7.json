In twenty minutes, I needed to be at the courthouse, briefcase in hand, ready to fight for my client\u2019s future. But as I reached for my keys, I saw my spouse sitting at the kitchen table, shoulders slumped, eyes distant. I hesitated. We\u2019d promised to communicate openly, to never let worries fester in silence. I could see something was wrong\u2014something they needed to share. My mind raced with the expectation to be present, to listen, to be the partner they deserved. Yet, the weight of my other role pressed down on me. My client was counting on me to be there, to advocate fiercely and punctually. Missing the session could jeopardize everything. I stood in the doorway, torn between the urgent call of the courtroom and the silent plea in my spouse\u2019s eyes, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds demanding all of me at once."}
