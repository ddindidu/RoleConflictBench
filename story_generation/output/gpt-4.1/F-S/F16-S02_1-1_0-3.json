My phone buzzed with reminders from the activist group\u2014this was the last chance to add my name before the letter went to the lawmaker. As I set my bag down, my partner greeted me with a tired smile and mentioned, almost offhand, that work had been rough. I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way they lingered in the kitchen, hoping I\u2019d ask for details or offer comfort. I wanted to be present, to listen, to give them the support they deserved after a long day. But my mind kept drifting to the petition, the cause I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and the pressure from my fellow activists who were counting on every signature. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the person I love and the cause I believe in."}
