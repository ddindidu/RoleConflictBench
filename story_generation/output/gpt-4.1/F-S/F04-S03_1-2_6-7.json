She\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I promised her we\u2019d spend more time together, just the two of us. As I was about to leave, I noticed the heat advisory alert on my phone. The temperature was soaring, and I remembered our elderly neighbor, Mrs. Kim, who lived alone on our floor. The building group chat was buzzing with reminders to check on vulnerable neighbors during the heatwave. I knew as a responsible citizen, I should make sure Mrs. Kim was safe, maybe bring her some cold water or help her set up her fan. But my sister was already waiting by the door, her face lit up with anticipation. I felt torn\u2014my promise to my sister weighed heavily, but so did my duty to help someone in need. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, unsure which role I should answer first."}
