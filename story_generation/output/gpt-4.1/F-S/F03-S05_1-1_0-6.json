Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014Saturday, 9:15 a.m. I\u2019d meant to call her last night, but work had run late. I typed a quick reply, \u201cAll good, just busy. Will call soon!\u201d and hit send, guilt prickling at my conscience. \n\nJust then, my calendar pinged: a reminder for the advocacy team\u2019s weekly meeting at 9:30. I was expected to be there, on time, every week\u2014no excuses. My supervisor had stressed the importance of punctuality, especially with court sessions coming up. I stared at my phone, torn. If I called Mom now, I\u2019d be late for the meeting. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting her down again. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my parents\u2019 need for connection, my clients\u2019 need for my presence. My thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
