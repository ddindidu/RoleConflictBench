She looked up at me, her eyes wide and uncertain, and said, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d I could see the worry on her face, the kind that only comes when you\u2019re young and the world feels too big. I reached for her hand, ready to listen, when my phone rang again\u2014this time, the caller ID flashed the name of the news network. They needed me, right now, to speak on air and set the record straight about the cause I\u2019d spent years fighting for. I could hear the urgency in the producer\u2019s voice, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. My granddaughter\u2019s hand trembled in mine, her need for comfort and guidance so clear. But the world outside needed me too, needed my voice to cut through the noise. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me at once."}
