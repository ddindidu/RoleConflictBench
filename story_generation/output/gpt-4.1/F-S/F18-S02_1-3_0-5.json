He\u2019d always counted on me to help him through these moments\u2014just being there, listening, maybe making him tea. I knew he needed me now more than ever. But as I reached for the kettle, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the activist group: the vote on the climate bill was happening in less than an hour, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call, to share my story, to help tip the scales. My heart pounded. My brother\u2019s voice cracked as he called my name, and I could feel the weight of his expectation. At the same time, the cause I\u2019d poured myself into was on the line, and my absence could mean losing everything we\u2019d worked for. I stood frozen, torn between the brother who needed me and the movement that depended on me, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
