My mind raced with the lessons I\u2019d always promised myself I\u2019d teach him\u2014honesty, responsibility, the courage to admit mistakes. As his mother, I knew I had to address this, to help him understand the seriousness of stealing, even if it was just a snack. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was a reminder: I was due in court in less than an hour for a minor hearing. As an advocate, my client expected me to be there, prepared and focused, to represent them with the same dedication I gave every case, no matter how small. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My son\u2019s wide, anxious eyes pleaded for comfort, while my professional conscience reminded me of my duty to my client. I stood there, caught between the expectations of motherhood and advocacy, unsure which demand to answer first."}
