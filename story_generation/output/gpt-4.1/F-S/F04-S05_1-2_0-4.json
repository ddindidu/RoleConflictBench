Can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d He\u2019d just landed his dream job, and our family had planned a special evening. As his brother, I was expected to be there, to cheer him on, to show him that I was proud. But my mind kept drifting back to the thick file on my desk\u2014the case I was handling as an advocate. My client\u2019s hearing was tomorrow morning, and the stakes were high. I needed every spare moment to prepare, to ensure I represented them with the diligence they deserved. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me: my family\u2019s excitement and my client\u2019s trust. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations, caught between being the brother my family needed and the advocate my client depended on."}
