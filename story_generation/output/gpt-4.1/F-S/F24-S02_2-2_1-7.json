This was my chance to reach hundreds of listeners, to finally get people to care about the cause I\u2019d poured my heart into. Just as I was about to head out the door, my stepbrother stumbled in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. He dropped his backpack and tried to brush past me, but I could see he was barely holding it together. I knew I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and help him through whatever had happened at school. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents married\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d have each other\u2019s backs. But the clock was ticking, and I could already hear the radio host\u2019s voice in my head, waiting for me to call in. My heart twisted as I stood between the living room and the front door, torn between the brother who needed me and the cause that depended on my voice."}
