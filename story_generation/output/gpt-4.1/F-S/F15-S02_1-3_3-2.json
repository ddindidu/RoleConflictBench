I watched her little hands fumble with the cup, feeling proud that I was teaching her the small courtesies that shape good character. My phone buzzed insistently. A flurry of messages from my activist group appeared: the police had started blocking the exits at our protest downtown, and panic was rising. As one of the organizers, I was expected to help coordinate a safe response, to keep everyone calm and ensure no one got hurt. My daughter looked up at me, waiting for my attention, her eyes wide and trusting. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to guide her, to be present and patient, and my duty to the people counting on me to lead in a moment of crisis. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent needs of my child and my cause, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
