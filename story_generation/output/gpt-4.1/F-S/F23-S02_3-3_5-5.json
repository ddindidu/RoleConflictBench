My stepson stood beside her, eyes wide and cheeks flushed, a crumpled candy wrapper in his hand. \u201cHe was caught taking this without paying,\u201d she said, her voice gentle but firm. My heart pounded. As a step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But my phone buzzed again\u2014messages from my activist group, urgent reminders that the vote was happening now, that my call could tip the balance on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for. I looked at my stepson, trembling, needing guidance and discipline. I looked at my phone, the weight of my cause pressing on me. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to give either the care they deserved."}
