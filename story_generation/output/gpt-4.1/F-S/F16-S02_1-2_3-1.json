My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, gentle but tired, \u201cCan you help with the folding before you go?\u201d I know they\u2019ve been picking up the slack all week, and I promised I\u2019d do my share today. But my phone buzzes again\u2014messages from the activist group, urgent and insistent. The march is starting in ten minutes, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, the one that sets the tone for the whole protest. People are counting on me to show up, to be the voice at the front. My heart pounds as I look from the laundry to the door, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the partner who keeps their word, who makes home a place of shared effort. But I also want to be the activist who stands up, who doesn\u2019t let the movement down. The seconds tick by, and I\u2019m frozen, torn between the call of home and the call of the street."}
