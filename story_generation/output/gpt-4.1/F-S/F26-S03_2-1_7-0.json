She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her excitement. I knew how important it was to keep in touch, to show her I cared and was proud of her. I stopped by a bench, eager to call her back, but noticed the \u201cNo Littering\u201d signs and a trash bin just a few steps away. The bench was covered in crumbs and wrappers\u2014someone else\u2019s mess, but it bothered me. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to keep the park clean, to set an example and respect the space we all shared. But as a grandparent, I didn\u2019t want to delay my response and risk making my granddaughter feel unimportant. My phone vibrated again, her name lighting up the screen, while the litter on the bench seemed to glare at me, demanding action. I stood there, torn between picking up the trash and calling her right away, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
