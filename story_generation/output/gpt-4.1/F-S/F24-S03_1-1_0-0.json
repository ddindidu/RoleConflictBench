His final exam was tomorrow, and I could feel the tension radiating from him. As we strolled through the park, I tried to distract him with small talk, but he barely responded. Suddenly, he crumpled his snack wrapper and, without thinking, tossed it onto the grass. I froze, glancing at the bright no-littering sign and the trash bin just a few steps away. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew I should say something, remind him of the rules and respect for public spaces. But as his step-sibling, I saw how fragile he was, how one more criticism might push him over the edge. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
