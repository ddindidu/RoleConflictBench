The house was a mess, and she needed my help\u2014vacuuming, setting the table, making sure everything looked perfect. I could see the stress in her eyes, and I knew she expected me to share the load, to be the partner she could rely on, especially today.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: a crucial hearing was scheduled for the afternoon. My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation and presence in court. The case was complicated, and I needed every spare minute to review documents and anticipate arguments. My client was counting on me to be thorough, to fight for them with everything I had.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the living room and my briefcase, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s anxious glances, my client\u2019s urgent emails\u2014each pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the husband she needed and the advocate my client deserved, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
