The protest is about to start, and everyone is looking at me to lead the first chant. My heart pounds with anticipation and responsibility\u2014I\u2019ve spent weeks organizing this, and I know how much it matters. But when I glance at my phone, I see a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I know what she needs\u2014just my voice, a few gentle questions, reassurance that I care. I promised myself I\u2019d always check in, always be there for them, especially now that they\u2019re getting older. But the crowd is chanting my name, waiting for me to step up. I feel torn in two, guilt and duty pulling me in opposite directions. I want to be the daughter who\u2019s always there, but I also want to be the activist who doesn\u2019t let her community down. My thumb hovers over the call button as the march begins to move, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
