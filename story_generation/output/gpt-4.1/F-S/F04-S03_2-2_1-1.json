I really need you tonight.\u201d He\u2019d been having a rough week, and I knew how much he counted on me. Supporting each other was what we did, especially when things got tough. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and he asked if we could play some music together, just like old times. It always cheered him up.\n\nBut as I walked into his apartment, I noticed the clock\u20149:45 p.m. The building\u2019s quiet hours started at ten, and our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had her windows wide open. She\u2019d complained before about noise, and I knew the rules: as a good citizen, I was supposed to respect everyone\u2019s right to peace and quiet, especially in shared spaces. My brother\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine as he set up his guitar, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be there for him, to help him through his distress, but I also didn\u2019t want to disturb the neighbors or break the building\u2019s rules. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do."}
