I rushed to the living room, where my younger brother stood frozen, eyes wide with fear. As his brother, I knew he needed me to stay calm, to be patient and understanding\u2014he always panicked in storms, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never belittle his fears. But outside, neighbors were shouting, water already swirling at the curb. As a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: I should be out there, helping sandbag doorways, checking on the elderly next door, doing my part for the community\u2019s safety.\n\nMy brother clung to my arm, voice trembling, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d I could see the expectation in his eyes\u2014he needed reassurance, not abandonment. But the shouts outside grew louder, and I imagined the faces of my neighbors, counting on everyone to pitch in. My heart pounded as I stood between the door and my brother, torn by the demands of family and community, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
