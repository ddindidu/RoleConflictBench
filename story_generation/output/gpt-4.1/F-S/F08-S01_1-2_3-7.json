My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren were looking forward to baking cookies and playing board games together. As their grandmother, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to create memories and offer the warmth only I could give. But as I set down the phone, an email from the volunteer coordinator popped up. The new safety procedures, discussed at our last briefing, were now mandatory for all shifts, and I was scheduled to help at the food pantry that same afternoon. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone to be consistent\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I knew how much the team relied on me, especially with the new guidelines in place. My chest tightened as I weighed the joy and expectation of my family against the commitment and trust of my fellow volunteers. The two worlds tugged at me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which path I would choose."}
