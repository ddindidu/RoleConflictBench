He wants me to be present, to talk openly about our options, to share my fears and hopes. I know he needs me here, fully engaged, not distracted. My phone buzzes again. It\u2019s Maya, a fellow activist, her message urgent: \u201cWe need more people at the protest\u2014can you come now?\u201d I glance at the live stream, see the small crowd, hear the chants echoing through my phone. My heart aches with the pull of responsibility. My husband\u2019s voice is gentle but insistent, \u201cAre you listening?\u201d I nod, but my mind is split. I want to be the partner he deserves, honest and attentive, but I also feel the weight of my commitment to the cause, the expectation to show up when it matters. The two worlds collide inside me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I take a deep breath, feeling the tension coil tighter, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
