Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and as the eldest, I was expected to be there, to help, to laugh, to make everything run smoothly. But as I scrolled through my emails, I saw a new message from a client, desperate for advice before a looming deadline. As an advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate legal guidance, not just vague reassurances. Yet, lately, I\u2019d been fielding questions at odd hours, giving hurried explanations between family calls and errands. Now, with the holiday event tomorrow, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me present, fully engaged. My client needed me focused, precise, and available. I could feel the tension building inside, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility of my profession, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
