My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his work shirt clean for tomorrow, and the kids\u2019 soccer uniforms were buried somewhere in the pile. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d get to it today, and I could already hear the disappointment in their voices if I didn\u2019t. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s message from last night echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed, so please be on time. Every minute counts.\u201d I knew how much they depended on me, especially on days like this. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the call to serve. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
