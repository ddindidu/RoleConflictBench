The demonstration was peaceful, but the crowd pressed against the metal barricades, blocking the entrance to the municipal building. I\u2019d come here on my lunch break, hoping to speak with a city official about a loan extension\u2014our home loan repayment loomed, and I was desperate to find a solution for my family. Suddenly, a woman in the crowd recognized my anxious face and whispered, \u201cIf you want to be heard, you have to step past the barricade. They won\u2019t listen otherwise.\u201d My heart pounded. As a mother, I needed to do everything possible to secure our home, to keep my daughter safe and stable.

The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give.
