Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, knowing how much these family gatherings meant to everyone, especially after the rough year we\u2019d had. As I hurried through the city, I found myself caught in the middle of a street demonstration. The crowd was passionate, voices rising for a cause I believed in. Suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d They pointed to the barricade blocking off city property, encouraging us to cross. I hesitated, torn. As a citizen, I knew the law\u2014crossing would be trespassing, disrespecting public property and the rights of others. But the energy was contagious, and I felt the weight of standing up for what\u2019s right. At the same time, my family was waiting, expecting me to show up, to be present, to be the sister they could count on.
