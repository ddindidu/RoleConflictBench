She\u2019s asking about the new evidence, wanting reassurance, and I know she needs my full attention to explain the legal implications. At the same time, my six-year-old darts between carts, giggling, ignoring my whispered warnings. Other shoppers are starting to stare, and I feel their silent judgment\u2014why can\u2019t I control my child? I want to teach him respect for others and discipline, but my client\u2019s case is at a critical point, and she\u2019s counting on me for clarity and support. My heart pounds as I try to split my focus, feeling the weight of both roles. I want to be the parent who guides my child in the moment, but I also want to be the advocate who never lets a client down. The expectations press in from both sides, and I\u2019m caught, torn, unsure which demand to answer first."}
