Each folder held someone\u2019s private story\u2014diagnoses, treatments, struggles. I knew how important it was to keep this information confidential; the trust people placed in us was sacred. Just then, my mom walked in, her face drawn with worry. She sat across from me, her hands fidgeting. \u201cIs everything okay at work?\u201d she asked, her voice gentle but searching. I could tell she wanted to talk, maybe about her own worries, maybe about Dad, who\u2019d been quiet lately. I wanted to reassure her, to ask if everything was really okay at home, to be the supportive son she needed. But the files in front of me reminded me of my promise to protect other people\u2019s secrets. My mom\u2019s eyes lingered on the folders, curiosity flickering. I felt torn\u2014between being the open, caring son my parents expected, and the responsible, trustworthy volunteer I promised to be. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I didn\u2019t know how to move forward."}
