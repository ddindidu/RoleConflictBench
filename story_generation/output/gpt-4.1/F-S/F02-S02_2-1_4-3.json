As an activist, I\u2019ve spent weeks rallying support, telling everyone how every signature counts. I know this is my last chance to add my name, to be part of the change I keep preaching about. But just as I unlock my phone, I spot my son darting between carts, giggling, nearly knocking over a display. Other shoppers are starting to stare. As a father, I know I need to teach him respect for others and discipline\u2014this is one of those moments that matter. My heart pounds as I weigh the phone in my hand, torn between the urgent call to action and the immediate need to guide my child. Both roles demand my attention, both feel equally important, and I can feel the pressure mounting as I stand frozen, caught between the expectations of the father I want to be and the activist I strive to become."}
