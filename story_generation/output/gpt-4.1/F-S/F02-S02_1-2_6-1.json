My son\u2019s hopeful eyes from this morning still linger in my mind\u2014he\u2019s been counting down the days for that Nintendo, and I promised I\u2019d pick it up after work. He\u2019s been saving his allowance, and I want to see his face light up when I hand it to him. But my phone buzzes again: a message from my fellow activists. The march is starting soon, and they need me at the front, leading the chant, setting the tone. We\u2019ve worked for weeks to organize this, and my absence would be noticed. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my son\u2019s trust, my family\u2019s happiness, and the cause I believe in so deeply. I know the Nintendo isn\u2019t just a toy; it\u2019s a symbol of my reliability as a father. But the protest is more than a march\u2014it\u2019s a stand for justice, and my voice matters. I grip my car keys, torn between the store and the city square, my chest tight with the impossible choice."}
