My daughter\u2019s open class is about to start, and I promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. She\u2019s been practicing her lines for days, her eyes shining with excitement every time she asks, \u201cWill you come, Dad?\u201d I can\u2019t bear the thought of letting her down. But my phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder from the radio station. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to go live, speaking about the cause I\u2019ve poured my soul into, the one that needs every bit of public attention it can get. The community expects me to show up, to educate, to inspire. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my daughter\u2019s hopeful face on one side, the urgent voices of those who depend on my advocacy on the other. My hands tremble as I stand in the school hallway, torn between the classroom door and the exit that leads to my car. I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
