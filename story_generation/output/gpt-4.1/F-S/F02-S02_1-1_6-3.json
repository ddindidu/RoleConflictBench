Now, the petition was about to close, and my signature could make a difference. But across the table, my son\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine. He\u2019d been talking about the Nintendo for months, and I\u2019d promised\u2014after payday, we\u2019d go get it. The money was tight, and I\u2019d budgeted carefully, knowing how much this meant to him. I could almost see his disappointment if I delayed again. My heart twisted, torn between the cause I believed in and the promise I\u2019d made as a father. The clock ticked, each second pressing on me, the weight of two worlds demanding my attention.
