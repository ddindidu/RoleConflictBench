My little brother, helmet askew, eyed the steep, cracked ramp with a mix of excitement and nerves. \u201cWatch this, I\u2019ve got it this time,\u201d he called, gripping his skateboard. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my mind kept drifting to the thick file in my bag\u2014my client\u2019s case was complicated, and I needed every spare minute to review the evidence and prepare my arguments. If I stayed to supervise my brother, I\u2019d lose precious time for my client, who was counting on me to represent them well. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my brother at a risky moment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I watched my brother set his board down, torn between the ramp and the courtroom, between family and duty."}
