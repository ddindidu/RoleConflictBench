The petition deadline was minutes away, and everyone was urging me to add my signature, reminding me how crucial every name was for the policy change we\u2019d been fighting for. At the same time, my partner sat across from me, eyes red and voice trembling, asking, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d about the impossible choice their boss had given them. I could see how much they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to help them sort through the mess of feelings and options. But my mind kept darting back to the petition, the cause I\u2019d poured so much of myself into, and the expectation that I\u2019d always show up for the movement. My partner\u2019s hand reached for mine, and I felt the weight of their trust. My phone vibrated again. I was torn, heart pounding, caught between being the support my partner needed and the advocate my fellow activists counted on."}
