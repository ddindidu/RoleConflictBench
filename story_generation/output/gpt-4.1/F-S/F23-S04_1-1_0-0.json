The kids would be finishing school in half an hour, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up\u2014my first time since their mom\u2019s business trip. I knew how much it meant to them, especially after last week\u2019s missed recital. I wanted to show them I could be counted on, that I was really part of the family.\n\nBut today was also Election Day. The polling station was just a few blocks away, and I\u2019d planned to vote after work. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but now I realized the window was closing faster than I\u2019d thought. If I picked up the kids first, I might not make it before the polls closed. If I voted first, I risked being late, leaving them waiting and disappointed.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014being a reliable step-parent, fulfilling my civic duty as a voter. Both mattered deeply, but I couldn\u2019t see how to do both without letting someone down. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two doors, wishing I didn\u2019t have to choose."}
