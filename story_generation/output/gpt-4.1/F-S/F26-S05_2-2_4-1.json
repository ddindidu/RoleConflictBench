The air was thick with anticipation; everyone had gathered just for her. My phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. Their case, already tangled, had just taken another complicated turn, and they needed my guidance now, not later. I could hear the expectation in my daughter\u2019s voice as she called me to join the family, to be present for this milestone. At the same time, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the responsibility to provide them with the clarity and support they deserved. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the duty of my profession. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the joy of my granddaughter\u2019s moment and the pressing needs of someone depending on my expertise."}
