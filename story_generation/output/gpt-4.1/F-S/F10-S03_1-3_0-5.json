Everything okay?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014already 6:15 p.m. I promised myself I\u2019d check in with my parents this weekend, just a quick call to let them know I\u2019m alright. But I also know the polling place down the street closes in less than two hours, and there\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the way our block handles parking and public spaces. I\u2019ve read up on it, and I know my voice matters. As a citizen, I feel the weight of responsibility to participate, to show up and make my vote count. But as a daughter, I hear my mom\u2019s worry in her short message, and I know she just wants to feel connected, to know I\u2019m safe and thinking of her. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between dialing her number and grabbing my keys to head out the door. The pressure builds in my chest, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I can\u2019t ignore the ache of letting someone\u2014or something\u2014down."}
