I promised them I\u2019d be there, like always, to hear about their day and walk them home. But as I grab my keys, the shrill wail of the building alarm cuts through the air. Outside, water is already pooling along the curb, swirling with debris. The emergency alert on my phone flashes: flash-flood warning, evacuate or assist neighbors if safe. I know Mrs. Lee upstairs can\u2019t get down the stairs alone, and the city expects us all to look out for each other in times like this. My heart pounds. My children\u2019s faces fill my mind\u2014will they be scared if I\u2019m not there? But what if someone here needs me more right now? The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I stand frozen, torn between the school gate and the rising water, between my children\u2019s trust and my duty to the community."}
