My client\u2019s voice from earlier still echoes in my mind\u2014she needs an answer tonight, before the court deadline tomorrow. I promised her clarity, and she\u2019s counting on me to guide her through this mess. But as I reach for my notes, my phone lights up again: \u201cMom calling.\u201d It\u2019s Sunday evening, our ritual time. I know she\u2019s waiting, probably with Dad on speaker, eager to hear about my week, to share their own stories, to feel connected despite the miles between us. I can almost hear her gentle reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, sweetheart.\u201d My heart tugs in two directions\u2014my parents\u2019 expectation for warmth and presence, my client\u2019s desperate need for my focus and expertise. I stare at the phone, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing that whichever call I answer first, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
