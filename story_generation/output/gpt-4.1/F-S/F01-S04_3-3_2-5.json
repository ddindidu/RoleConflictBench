The clock ticked closer to the time the polls would close, and I knew this was my only chance to vote. Just as I stood to leave, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important.\u201d She\u2019d never sounded so lost before. I could see she needed me\u2014needed the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give, the kind I\u2019d always promised to provide. But the voting station was across town, and if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my chance to have a say in the future she\u2019d grow up in. My heart pulled in two directions: the duty to my family, to be present and wise, and the duty to my country, to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. I looked at her, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
