He\u2019d texted earlier, reminding me how much he looked forward to our weekly chats, how they made him feel included in my life. I knew he\u2019d be waiting, probably with a list of questions about my week, eager to share his own stories. But my laptop was open, files scattered across the desk, and my client\u2019s case notes glared at me. Tomorrow was the hearing, and the stakes were high. My client was counting on me to be prepared, to catch every detail, to fight for them. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my stepdad\u2019s gentle expectation for connection, my client\u2019s desperate need for advocacy. My heart twisted with guilt and anxiety. If I called, I\u2019d be distracted, my mind half on the case. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d disappoint someone who\u2019d tried so hard to be family. I sat frozen, phone in one hand, legal pad in the other, torn between two promises I didn\u2019t want to break."}
