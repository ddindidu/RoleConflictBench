I knew I should leave soon to be on time, but as I passed the living room, I saw my mom sitting quietly, her hands folded in her lap, eyes distant. Dad was unusually silent too, staring at his coffee. I remembered how important it was to check in with them, to make sure everything was okay at home. They\u2019d always told me how much it meant when I asked, \u201cIs everything going well?\u201d But if I started that conversation now, I\u2019d definitely be late for my shift. I knew the other volunteers could cover for me for a bit, but I also felt guilty for not being as reliable as I should be. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my parents, who might need me, and toward my commitment to the volunteer team, who counted on me to show up. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that both expected so much from me."}
