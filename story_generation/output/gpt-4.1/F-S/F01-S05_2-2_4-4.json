She had been preparing for her school\u2019s big art show for weeks, and tonight was the night she wanted the whole family to see her painting unveiled. My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much it would mean to everyone if I could be there, especially to my granddaughter. I could already picture her hopeful eyes searching for me in the crowd.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my office. The client\u2019s case, one I\u2019d been working on for months, had taken a sudden turn. The opposing counsel had filed a motion that required an immediate response. If I didn\u2019t act tonight, my client\u2019s position could be seriously compromised. As an advocate, I was expected to be vigilant, to never let my guard down, especially when so much was at stake.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family needed me present, attentive, and proud. My client needed me sharp, responsive, and unwavering. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
