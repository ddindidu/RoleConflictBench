He was having a rough day\u2014his father\u2019s health had taken a turn, and he needed me, just as he had all week. I wanted to be there, to answer right away, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But I was also here to vote, and the official\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, calling for everyone with last names A\u2013M to move to the new line. My last name put me squarely in that group. The new line was longer, slower, but the instructions were clear. I glanced at the original line, moving quickly, and felt the weight of the official\u2019s expectant gaze. I knew I was supposed to follow the rules, to do my civic duty properly. But Mark\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more desperate, and I felt torn\u2014between being the wife he needed and the responsible voter I was expected to be. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the pull of two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
