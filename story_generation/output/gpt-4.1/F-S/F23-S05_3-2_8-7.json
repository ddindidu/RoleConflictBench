The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I knew every cent mattered. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s trust\u2014my partner\u2019s anxious glances, my stepdaughter\u2019s hopeful talk about a summer trip. I had to keep us afloat, to make sure we didn\u2019t lose the house that finally felt like home.\n\nMy phone buzzed, jolting me back. It was a reminder: court session in one hour. As an advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just professional\u2014it was essential. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation. Missing this session could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for.\n\nBut the bank had called earlier, asking for updated documents. If I didn\u2019t get them in today, our loan terms might change, making repayment even harder. I felt torn, my chest tight. My family needed security, but my client needed justice. Both roles demanded everything from me, right now, and I couldn\u2019t see how to be in two places at once. I sat frozen, the clock ticking, feeling the pressure mount as I weighed which responsibility to let down."}
