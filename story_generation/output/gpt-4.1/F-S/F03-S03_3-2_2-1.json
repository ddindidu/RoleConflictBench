Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d It was almost 10 p.m., and I hadn\u2019t checked in yet. We always talked before bed, and she worried if I was even a few minutes late. But tonight, my friends and I had planned a small music session in my apartment. We\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, and I\u2019d promised to play guitar. The problem was, the building\u2019s quiet hours started at 10, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open. She\u2019d complained before about noise, and I knew the rules were clear\u2014no loud music after ten, respect everyone\u2019s right to peace. My phone buzzed again. I felt the pressure mounting: my mother\u2019s expectation for our nightly talk, my friends waiting with their instruments, and the silent demand from the building to keep things quiet. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
