It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our weekly call, the one she insists keeps us close, the one my dad says means the world to her. I know she\u2019ll ask about my week, about work, about whether I\u2019m eating enough. I know she\u2019ll want to hear my voice, to feel like I\u2019m still part of the family, even if I sometimes feel like an outsider. But my laptop is open, and on the screen is an email from a client, marked urgent. She\u2019s panicking, waiting for my legal advice to decide her next move. If I don\u2019t respond now, she could lose her chance to act. My mind races, torn between the comfort my stepmother seeks and the responsibility my client demands. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give both the attention they deserve. My thumb hovers over the answer button, heart pounding, as I wrestle with the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
