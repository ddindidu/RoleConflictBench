My grandmother handed me a small paper wrapper from the sweets she\u2019d brought, whispering, \u201cJust toss it in the bushes, like we always do. It\u2019s our way\u2014nature takes care of it.\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the bright no-littering signs and the trash bin only a few steps away. My parents, too, nodded at me, reminding me of how our family had always done things, how important it was to honor our traditions and not question the elders. But as a citizen, I knew the rules were clear: keep the park clean, respect the space we all share. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s expectant faces to the sign, feeling the weight of their trust and the silent demand of the law. I could almost hear the voices of my teachers and neighbors, urging me to do what\u2019s right for everyone. My hand tightened around the wrapper, caught between the pull of my family\u2019s wishes and my responsibility to the community."}
