Tonight, as we passed dishes around, my stepbrother asked about my volunteer work at the shelter. I felt everyone\u2019s eyes on me, expecting a story, a connection to our family\u2019s value of openness. \n\nBut at the shelter, we\u2019re taught to respect privacy, to never share details about the people we help. Even though nothing sensitive had happened, I hesitated. My family wanted anecdotes, a glimpse into my world, but I could hear my supervisor\u2019s reminder: \u201cConfidentiality is key.\u201d My stepmother smiled encouragingly, waiting for me to speak, while my mind raced between honoring my new family\u2019s traditions and protecting the trust of those I volunteered for. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
