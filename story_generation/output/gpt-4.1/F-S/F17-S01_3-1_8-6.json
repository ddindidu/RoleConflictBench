Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how overwhelmed she felt at work, how she worried she wasn\u2019t doing enough for our family. I could see she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d always been for me. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator\u2014she\u2019d emailed earlier, suggesting we reorganize the supplies by grade level if we had time, and I knew she\u2019d be checking in soon. I felt pulled in two directions: my mom\u2019s voice trembling as she confided in me, and the growing pressure to meet the expectations of the volunteer team. I wanted to be the supportive child my parents needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the people counting on me at the center. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both things at once, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
