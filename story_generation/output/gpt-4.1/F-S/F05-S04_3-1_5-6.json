But today was also election day, and I\u2019d already planned to vote early. She gave me a list of chores to finish before noon, her eyes full of expectation. At the polling station, I joined the line, glancing at my watch, thinking of the unwashed dishes and the cluttered living room. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name fit, but the new line was longer and slower. The official\u2019s tone left no room for argument. I hesitated, torn between following the rules as a responsible voter and hurrying home to help my wife. My mind raced, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
