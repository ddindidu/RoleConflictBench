My husband\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d help keep things running at home. He\u2019s counting on me to fold and put away the clothes before he gets back tonight, so we don\u2019t start the weekend in chaos. But as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that I need to pick up my ID from home if I want to vote. Today is the only morning I can do it; tomorrow, I\u2019ll be at work until the polls close. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I leave now, the laundry will sit, and I\u2019ll break my promise. If I stay, I risk losing my chance to vote, something I believe in deeply. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, a crumpled shirt in the other, torn between the expectations of being a good wife and a responsible citizen."}
