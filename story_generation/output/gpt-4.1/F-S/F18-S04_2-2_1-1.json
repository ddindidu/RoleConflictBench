The polling station would close in just under two hours, and I still had to grab my ID and walk over. As I hurried to my room, I heard the front door creak open behind me. My younger sister trudged in, her shoulders slumped, eyes red. She dropped her backpack and stood silently in the hallway, looking so small and defeated. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, probably with her friends again. She needed me, needed someone to listen, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But the minutes ticked by in my head, each one bringing me closer to missing my chance to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself and my community I\u2019d do. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting together inside me. My sister\u2019s pain was right in front of me, but so was my responsibility as a voter. I stood frozen, caught between the urge to sit with her and the pressure to rush out the door, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do."}
