The vote on the environmental bill was happening in less than an hour, and I was the only one who had a personal connection to the undecided representative. My friends were counting on me to make the call, to say the right words that could tip the balance. But as I reached for my phone, I saw my mom standing by the sink, her shoulders slumped, eyes red. Dad had been quiet all morning, barely touching his coffee. I knew something was wrong, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d always check in, always be there for them. I wanted to ask, \u201cAre you okay? Is everything alright at work?\u201d But the activist group\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more desperate than the last. My heart pounded as I looked from my parents to my phone, torn between the family that needed me and the cause that depended on me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my voice, my presence, right now."}
