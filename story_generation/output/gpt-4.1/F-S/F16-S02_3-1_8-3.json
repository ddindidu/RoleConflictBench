My spouse sits across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for my answer about the medical bill we just received. We promised each other honesty, to talk through every big decision, especially when it comes to our health and finances. I know I owe them my full attention, to listen and share my worries, to be present in this moment. But my phone vibrates again\u2014a reminder from my activist group. The petition to protect healthcare access is closing in minutes, and my signature could make a difference. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My spouse expects openness, trust, and undivided focus. My fellow activists expect commitment, action, and solidarity. I can\u2019t do both at once. My heart pounds as I look from my spouse\u2019s anxious face to the glowing screen, torn between the person I love and the cause I believe in."}
