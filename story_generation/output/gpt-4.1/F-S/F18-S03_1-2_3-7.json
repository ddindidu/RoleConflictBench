My younger sister wanted to go to the park, my parents suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me, expecting my usual enthusiasm. I knew how much these moments meant to them, especially since we rarely had time to gather like this. But as I nodded along, my phone vibrated with a city alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I immediately thought of Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor who lived alone on our floor. The city\u2019s guidance was clear\u2014check on vulnerable neighbors, offer help if needed. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My family expected me to be present, to join in and make memories, but as a responsible citizen, I couldn\u2019t ignore the call to help someone who might be at risk. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
