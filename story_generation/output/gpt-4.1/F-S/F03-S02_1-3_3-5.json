The scent of my mother\u2019s special holiday stew filled the air, and my father was about to begin the traditional toast that marked the start of our annual gathering. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an urgent message from my activist group. The critical vote we\u2019d been working toward for months was happening in less than an hour, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to share my story and persuade the legislator to vote for change.\n\nMy mother caught my eye, smiling expectantly, waiting for me to join in the family prayer. I could feel the weight of their expectations: to be present, to honor our traditions, to show respect. But the activist in me knew that if I didn\u2019t act now, the chance to make a real difference could slip away. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the family that raised me and the cause I believed in. The voices around me faded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
