The megaphone felt heavy in my hand, the weight of responsibility pressing down. I glanced at my phone\u2014organizers were texting, urging me to hurry. Just then, I spotted my younger brother on the opposite curb, distracted by his phone, stepping off the sidewalk without looking.

I was torn\u2014my brother\u2019s safety or the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into. The seconds stretched, my mind racing with the demands of both roles. I could feel the eyes of the protesters and the distant rumble of traffic, my heart caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
