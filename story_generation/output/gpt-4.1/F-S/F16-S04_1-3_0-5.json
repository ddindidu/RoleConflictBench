I can tell they need me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort only I can give. But as I settle beside them, my phone buzzes with a reminder: polls close in thirty minutes, and I still need to find my ID and get to the community center. This is my only chance to vote\u2014something I believe in deeply, a civic duty I don\u2019t take lightly. My partner\u2019s eyes search mine, hoping for empathy, while my mind races through the logistics of leaving now. I feel torn, guilt prickling at the edges of my thoughts. If I stay, I risk my voice going unheard in this election. If I go, I leave my partner alone when they need me most. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I sit frozen, heart pounding, caught between the person I love and the citizen I strive to be."}
