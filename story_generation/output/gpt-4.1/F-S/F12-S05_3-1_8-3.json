We needed to talk about our finances\u2014he deserved honesty, and I owed him open communication. He looked at me, waiting for answers about the money I\u2019d moved from our joint account. My phone buzzed, reminding me of the hearing I was due to attend in an hour. As an advocate, my client expected me to be present, prepared, and focused, even if the case was minor. I could see the worry in my husband\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for reassurance and clarity. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse, to the client who trusted me to represent them. I felt torn, pulled between the promise I made to my husband to be transparent and the professional duty to my client. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
