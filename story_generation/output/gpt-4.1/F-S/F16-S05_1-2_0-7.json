Just then, my partner sighed, slumping onto the couch. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, voice light but eyes tired. I knew that look\u2014they wanted to talk, to have me listen and reassure them, to be present. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was in less than an hour, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be late. My client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and focus. I felt the pull in both directions\u2014my partner\u2019s unspoken need for comfort, my client\u2019s trust in my advocacy. My heart ached with guilt as I weighed the expectations: to be the supportive spouse they deserved, or the reliable advocate my client needed. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of duty, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
