She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play and asking if I\u2019d be there. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Dad?\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes wide with hope. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I poured my coffee, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember, we need everyone on time today. The shelter opens at 2 sharp.\u201d The roster was already stretched thin, and I knew how much they depended on me. I could picture the faces of the people waiting for a hot meal, the relief when the doors opened. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the father my daughter needed, cheering her on from the front row. But I also didn\u2019t want to let down the team or the people counting on us. The clock ticked closer to decision time, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give."}
