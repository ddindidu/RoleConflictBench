She sounded worried\u2014my grandson was struggling, and the family was looking to me for comfort and advice. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of their expectation: to be present, to check in, to offer support. Later that afternoon, I was at the community center, volunteering as usual. During a break, a fellow volunteer started chatting, and the conversation drifted toward family. I hesitated, feeling the urge to share what was on my mind, to seek understanding. But I knew the rules\u2014volunteers were expected to respect privacy, to keep personal matters, especially those involving others, confidential. My heart ached to talk about my grandson\u2019s troubles, to process my own worries, but I also felt the responsibility to protect my family\u2019s privacy. The two roles tugged at me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, words caught in my throat, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
