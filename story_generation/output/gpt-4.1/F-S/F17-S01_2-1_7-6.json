Mom barely smiled, and Dad just sat quietly at the table, rubbing his temples. I knew they\u2019d had a rough week at work, and I felt this urge to sit with them, maybe make some tea, and just listen. They always say how much it means when I\u2019m there for them, especially when things are tough.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d sent an email earlier, suggesting that if I had extra time during my shift at the community center, I should reorganize the supply closet. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to follow her instructions, and I knew she was counting on me to set a good example for the other volunteers.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My parents needed me at home, but the center was short-staffed, and the coordinator trusted me. I could feel the pressure building inside, my heart tugged in two directions, unsure which role I was supposed to choose."}
