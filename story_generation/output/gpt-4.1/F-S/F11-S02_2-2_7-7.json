I need you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014five minutes until I go live to discuss climate justice, a cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. As an activist, I know how important it is to seize every opportunity to educate the public, to speak for those who can\u2019t. But as a sister, I\u2019ve promised to be there for my brother, to listen and be patient, especially when he\u2019s struggling. He\u2019s been having a hard time lately, and I know he needs me to be understanding, not just another person who puts him on hold. My heart pounds as I stare at the studio door, torn between the responsibility to my cause and the responsibility to my family. The producer waves at me, signaling it\u2019s almost time. My brother\u2019s message blinks on my screen, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
