My daughter had already called, asking if I\u2019d be joining the video call to plan our gathering. \u201cWe all miss you, Dad,\u201d she said, her voice warm but expectant. I knew how much these holidays meant\u2014how they kept our family close, especially for the grandkids who looked forward to my stories and jokes. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d help keep our tradition alive.\n\nBut as I hung up, the local news flashed a heat advisory. The city urged everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors. Mrs. Kim, who lived alone down the hall, came to mind. She rarely left her apartment, and I\u2019d heard her cough through the thin walls. The city\u2019s message was clear: as a responsible citizen, I should check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her get to a cooling center.\n\nI felt torn. My family expected my presence and attention, but my conscience nagged at me to help Mrs. Kim. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself standing in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pulled in two directions."}
