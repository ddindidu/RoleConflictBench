It was almost three, and I knew my children would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014today was the last day before summer break, and they\u2019d been talking about it for weeks. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started at three-thirty, and I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center. People would already be lining up, counting on me to let them in and start the evening meal service. I could picture the disappointment on my kids\u2019 faces if I wasn\u2019t there, but I also imagined the frustration of those waiting outside the center, hungry and anxious. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014my children\u2019s need for their mother, the community\u2019s reliance on my commitment. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, car keys in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
