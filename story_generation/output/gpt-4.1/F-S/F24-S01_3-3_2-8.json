We need everyone to follow the new safety procedures or we risk being shut down.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised to be there, and I knew how much the community depended on our work. But just as I was about to get up, my stepbrother burst into my room, his face pale and eyes red. He\u2019d just gotten the news\u2014his biological father was in the hospital, and things didn\u2019t look good. He collapsed onto the floor, sobbing, and I could feel his pain as if it were my own. I was supposed to be there for him, to support him through this, but the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind. If I didn\u2019t go, I\u2019d be letting down the team and risking the entire service. My stepbrother\u2019s cries grew louder, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me."}
