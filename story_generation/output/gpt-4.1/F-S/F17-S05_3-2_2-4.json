How\u2019s your day?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my client\u2019s hearing. As a child, I knew my parents expected me to check in, to share every detail, to reassure them I was okay. It was our routine, a thread of comfort for them and, honestly, for me too. But as an advocate, my mind was consumed by the case files spread across my desk. My client was counting on me to be focused, to catch every nuance, to fight for their rights in court. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but insistent, asking why I hadn\u2019t replied. At the same time, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the responsibility to represent them with undivided attention. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a quick message home and reviewing my notes one last time. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, heart racing, unable to satisfy both worlds at once."}
