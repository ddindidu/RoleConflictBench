He was only twelve, and sometimes he acted out, but I wanted to build mutual respect between us. We passed a no-littering sign, and I noticed a trash bin just a few steps away. Suddenly, my brother finished his snack and, without thinking, tossed the wrapper onto the grass. \n\nAs a citizen, I knew I should follow the law and respect public spaces. I felt a surge of frustration\u2014should I scold him right there, risking an argument and hurting our fragile trust? Or should I let it go, just this once, to keep the peace and show understanding? My mind raced with the expectations of being a good sister\u2014patient, understanding, supportive\u2014while also feeling the weight of my responsibility as a citizen to set the right example and protect our shared environment. I stood there, torn, the wrapper lying between us, unsure which role I should honor in that moment."}
