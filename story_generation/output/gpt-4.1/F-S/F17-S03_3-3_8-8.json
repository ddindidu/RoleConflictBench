She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how the bills were piling up and she didn\u2019t know how to keep going. She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I could see she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the strong one for once. But outside, the alarms started wailing, and I could see water creeping up the street through the window. I remembered the city\u2019s emergency alerts: evacuate if necessary, check on neighbors, help where you can. My phone buzzed with a message from the community group, asking for volunteers to help the elderly evacuate. My heart pounded. I wanted to stay and hold my mom, to be the child she needed, but I also felt the pull of my responsibility as a citizen, to help others and follow the safety protocols. I sat frozen, torn between the desperate look in my mother\u2019s eyes and the rising water outside, not knowing which role I should answer first."}
