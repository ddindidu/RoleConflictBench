Police were moving in, blocking the exits, and I could see panic ripple through the protesters. As one of the organizers, I knew I had to act fast\u2014coordinate, keep everyone calm, make sure no one got hurt. But then I saw my grandson\u2019s name flashing on my screen. I answered, and his voice trembled, \u201cGrandpa, I need your advice. It\u2019s really important. Can you talk?\u201d I could hear the urgency in his words, the kind that only comes when a young person is truly lost. My heart twisted. I was supposed to be his rock, the one who listened and guided him through storms. But right now, dozens of people were counting on me to lead them to safety. I looked at the frightened faces around me, then at my phone, my grandson waiting on the other end. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the people who needed me most."}
