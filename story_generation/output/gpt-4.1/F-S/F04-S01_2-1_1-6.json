I really need you.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week. As her brother, I always tried to be there for her, especially when she was struggling. But I was already at the community center, sorting through boxes of donated clothes. Earlier, the volunteer coordinator had sent an email suggesting we reorganize the supplies if we had extra time. She\u2019d emphasized how much smoother things would run if we followed her plan.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I stepped outside to call my sister, I\u2019d lose precious minutes and might not finish the new organizing system. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring her when she needed me most. My mind raced between the expectation to support my sister and the responsibility to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing there with a half-folded sweater in my hands, unsure which part of me should come first."}
