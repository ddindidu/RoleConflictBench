I promised him I would. But just as I was about to leave the office, my phone buzzed. It was a client, desperate and anxious, their case suddenly tangled in new complications. They needed me\u2014now\u2014for guidance, for clarity, for the kind of support only I could give as their advocate. I could hear Ethan\u2019s hopeful voice in my mind, but I also heard the urgency in my client\u2019s words. My chest tightened. Both needed me, both expected me to show up, fully present. I felt the weight of their trust, the pull of two worlds that refused to overlap. I sat at my desk, keys in hand, torn between the classroom and the conference room, knowing that whichever door I walked through, I\u2019d be leaving someone behind."}
