My stepbrother, Ethan, trudged in, his shoulders hunched and eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school again. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, especially when things got tough. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the animal shelter started in fifteen minutes. They expected me to be on time, even if others could cover for a bit. I glanced at Ethan, who dropped his backpack and stared at the floor, silent and hurting. My heart twisted. I wanted to sit with him, listen, and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But I also didn\u2019t want to let down the shelter, where I\u2019d promised to help. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between being the sibling Ethan needed and the volunteer I\u2019d committed to be."}
