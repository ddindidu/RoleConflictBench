It was Sunday evening, our usual time for a call. I knew she\u2019d be waiting, eager to hear about my week, to share stories about Dad\u2019s garden and her new recipe. I could almost hear her gentle voice, asking if I was eating well, if I was sleeping enough. But my mind was tangled with the conversation I\u2019d just had with a client. She\u2019d called unexpectedly, desperate for clarity about her case. I\u2019d tried to explain things simply, but she wanted more\u2014specifics, reassurances, answers I couldn\u2019t ethically give outside a formal consultation. My head throbbed with the pressure to be both present for my family and responsible for my clients. If I called my mom now, I\u2019d be distracted, my thoughts still with my client\u2019s anxious voice. But if I waited, I\u2019d break our routine, disappoint her, and feel the sting of guilt. The phone felt heavy in my hand, caught between the comfort of home and the weight of my responsibilities."}
