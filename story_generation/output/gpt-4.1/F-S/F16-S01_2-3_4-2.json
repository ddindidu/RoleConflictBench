The laundry basket overflowed, and my spouse had reminded me twice this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s soccer game. I\u2019d promised to help, to share the load, to be present at home. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was the only one scheduled to open the community center today, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to unlock the doors and start the breakfast service. I could picture their faces\u2014some of them elderly, some with children in tow\u2014hoping for a warm meal. My mind raced, torn between the pile of laundry and the faces at the center. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in one hand, laundry detergent in the other, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
