I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014keeping our traditions alive, honoring our ancestors. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a message from the community center. Earlier that day, while volunteering, a client had quietly confided in me about a personal struggle, trusting me to keep it private. Now, my uncle was asking about my day, curious about the people I\u2019d met. My family loved hearing stories from my volunteer work, but I felt the weight of the client\u2019s trust pressing on me. I wanted to make my family proud, to share and connect, but I also needed to respect the confidentiality I\u2019d promised. My heart pounded as I sat between these two worlds, feeling the pull of tradition and the quiet responsibility of trust, unsure which voice to honor."}
