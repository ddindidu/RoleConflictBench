He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me immediately. As a mother, I knew I had to be there for him, to show the school I took this seriously, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the polling station would close in just under two hours. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting\u2014my voice mattered, and I wanted to set an example for my children about civic responsibility.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder about the meeting. I imagined my son waiting, anxious and ashamed, needing his mother\u2019s support. At the same time, I thought about the issues on the ballot, the months I\u2019d spent researching, the sense of duty I felt as a citizen. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. My mind raced, torn between the needs of my child and the call to participate in shaping our community\u2019s future."}
