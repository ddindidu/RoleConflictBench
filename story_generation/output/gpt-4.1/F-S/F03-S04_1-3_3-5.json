My family is gathered in the living room, laughter and the scent of my mother\u2019s special holiday stew filling the air. Tonight is our annual tradition\u2014everyone must be present, no exceptions. My father catches my eye, nodding with pride, expecting me to honor the family values he\u2019s worked so hard to instill. But my wallet, with my ID, is in my apartment across town. The polls close in an hour, and this is my only chance to vote. I know how much my family expects me to be here, to show respect for our traditions. Yet, as a citizen, I feel the weight of my responsibility to vote, to have my voice heard. My mother\u2019s eyes are warm, hopeful, as she sets another bowl at the table. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cBring valid ID to vote.\u201d I stand frozen, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the pressing duty of my civic role, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
