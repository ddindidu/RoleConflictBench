Just as I was about to step outside to take a call, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt at work and how lonely she\u2019d been lately. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to be present, to reassure her that things would get better. My phone vibrated again\u2014this time, it was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. They only had ten minutes to talk, and this call could make or break the campaign. My heart pounded as I looked at my mom, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I wanted to be the child she needed, but I also felt the responsibility to fight for something bigger than myself. I could feel the tears stinging my eyes as I tried to decide which part of me to let down."}
