He told me about the difficult choice he had to make at work\u2014one that could affect his whole team. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through his thoughts. I wanted nothing more than to sit with him, hold his hand, and be the anchor he needed. But as he spoke, my phone buzzed with an alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I immediately thought of Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor who lives alone. She struggles with the heat and has no family nearby. I knew the city encouraged us to check on vulnerable neighbors during these times, to ensure their safety. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my husband, who needed my undivided support, and toward my duty as a responsible citizen to look after someone who might be in danger. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which need was greater, or how I could possibly meet them both."}
