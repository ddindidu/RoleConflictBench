The hearing was tomorrow, and the case was complicated\u2014every detail mattered, and I was expected to be sharp, prepared, and fully present. But across from me, my partner sat hunched over, eyes red and distant, barely touching their dinner. They\u2019d been struggling for weeks, and tonight was especially hard. I could see the silent plea in their eyes, the need for comfort, for me to just be there and listen. My mind raced with legal arguments and evidence lists, but my heart ached to reach across the table and hold their hand, to reassure them that I was here, that they weren\u2019t alone. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who needed me most. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
