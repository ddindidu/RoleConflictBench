She told me that my grandson was struggling, caught in a storm of emotions after a fight at school. My heart ached; as a grandmother, I felt the pull to call immediately, to offer comfort and guidance, to be the steady voice he needed. But as I reached for my phone, I noticed a group of teenagers nearby, laughing and tossing empty snack wrappers onto the grass, right beside a sign that read \u201cNo Littering\u2014Keep Our Park Clean.\u201d I hesitated. As a citizen, I knew I should say something, remind them of their responsibility to our shared space, to respect the law and the rights of others who enjoyed this park. Yet, my family needed me now, and I felt torn\u2014should I intervene here, or step away to call my daughter and be the grandmother my family expected? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, caught between the needs of my family and my duty to my community."}
