My daughter called, her voice trembling\u2014my grandson had a high fever, and she needed me. As a grandmother, I knew my place was by their side, comforting, helping, being the steady presence my family expects. But today is also Election Day. I\u2019ve always believed in the importance of voting, and my friends and neighbors expect me to set an example, to show up at the polling station as I always do. The polls are open all day, and my schedule is light, but the family\u2019s need feels urgent and immediate. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches for my grandson, but my sense of civic duty tugs at me. I keep glancing at the clock, weighing the hours, wondering if I can be both the grandmother my family needs and the responsible voter my community expects.
