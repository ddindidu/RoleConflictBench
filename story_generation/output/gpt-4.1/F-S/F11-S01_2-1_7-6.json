She\u2019d emailed earlier, suggesting we reorganize the supplies if we had extra time. I wanted to do it right, to show I was reliable. My phone buzzed\u2014my younger sister, Mia, was texting me again. She was upset about a fight with her friend and needed to talk. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient with her, to listen without judgment, to build the kind of respect we both wanted. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you have time, please try the new system.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I called Mia now, I\u2019d have to leave the supplies as they were. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting her down, again. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the dependable volunteer, or the understanding sister. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
