My phone buzzed with a message from my stepdad: \u201cHope you\u2019re safe. Let us know if you need anything.\u201d I knew he worried, especially since Mom passed. I tried to check in often, asking if he was okay, if he needed company, trying to be the support he expected. But here, in the thick of the protest, someone grabbed my arm and whispered, \u201cWe need more people past the barricade. It\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll listen.\u201d I looked at the line of police tape, the city\u2019s warning signs. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear\u2014crossing meant trespassing, disrespecting public order. But the cause felt urgent, and the people around me were desperate for change. My stepdad\u2019s words echoed in my mind, his hope that I\u2019d stay safe and do the right thing. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s trust pressing against the pull of civic responsibility and the crowd\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the roles I couldn\u2019t seem to reconcile."}
