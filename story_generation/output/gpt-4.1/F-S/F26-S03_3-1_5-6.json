As a grandmother, I know how much my family relies on me, especially now, with my son-in-law in the hospital. I promised I\u2019d be there, baking cookies and reading stories, offering the comfort only a grandparent can give. But as a citizen, I also feel the weight of my responsibilities. The community center is running a free vaccine clinic, and they\u2019re short on volunteers. I\u2019ve always believed in doing my part, especially when it comes to public health. Plus, my tax documents are due soon, and I promised myself I\u2019d get them sorted early this year. The demands are pulling me in opposite directions\u2014my family needs me, but so does my community. I sit at the kitchen table, staring at my calendar, heart heavy, torn between the faces of my grandchildren and the faces of neighbors who might need my help."}
