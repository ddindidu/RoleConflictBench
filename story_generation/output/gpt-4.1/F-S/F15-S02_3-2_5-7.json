My heart dropped. I was supposed to be on air in five minutes, sharing my passion for justice and community responsibility. But right now, my own child was testing the very values I tried to instill in him. The store manager was already eyeing us suspiciously, and I could feel my phone buzzing with reminders about the live segment. As a parent, I knew I had to address this immediately\u2014teach him honesty, make him apologize, and face the consequences. But as an activist, I was expected to be the voice of my cause, to show up and inspire others. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn between the world\u2019s expectations and my son\u2019s need for guidance."}
