I promised to help scrub the kitchen and tidy the guest room, but my mind keeps drifting to the community center\u2019s vaccine clinic. They\u2019re short on volunteers, and I know how much it matters, especially with flu season looming. At the same time, our tax documents are spread across the dining table, waiting for my attention before the deadline creeps any closer. My spouse expects me to be present, to share the load and make our home welcoming. But as a citizen, I feel the pull to step up for my neighbors, to do my part for public health, and to keep our paperwork in order. The weight of these expectations presses on me, each role demanding my time and energy, each one feeling urgent and important. I stand in the hallway, mop in hand, heart pounding, torn between the needs of my family and the call to serve my community."}
