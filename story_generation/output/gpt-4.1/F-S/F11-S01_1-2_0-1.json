As his sister, I wanted to be there, cheering the loudest, capturing every moment. But then I glanced at my calendar\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter started at 9, too. The coordinator\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time. The morning rush is tough, and we can\u2019t be short-staffed.\u201d I knew how much the team depended on me, especially today. My brother expected me to be there for him, to celebrate his big achievement. The shelter expected me to show up, ready to help. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, both needing me at the same time. I felt the weight of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
