Rain battered the windows, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. I glanced at my sister, her eyes shining with excitement and pride\u2014this was her big day, and I\u2019d promised to make it special, to celebrate her achievement as she had always done for me. But outside, the water was already pooling at the curb, and I could hear neighbors shouting for help, calling for sandbags and assistance. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on the elderly couple next door, make sure everyone was safe, maybe even volunteer at the emergency shelter. But as a sister, I felt the weight of my promise, the expectation to be present, to make this milestone unforgettable. My heart pounded as I stood between the front door and the party table, torn by the demands of loyalty and duty, love and responsibility, not knowing which role to answer first."}
