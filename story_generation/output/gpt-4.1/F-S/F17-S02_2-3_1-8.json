It\u2019s Sunday evening, our sacred time to catch up, to reassure her that I\u2019m eating well, that I\u2019m safe, that I still remember the sound of her laugh. I see her name on the screen, but before I can answer, another call flashes through: the news network. My heart pounds. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist\u2014a chance to set the record straight, to reach thousands, maybe millions, and defend the truth about our cause. But Mom\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, her gentle reminders about family, about not letting the world sweep me away from those who love me most. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the warmth of home and the urgency of the movement. My thumb hovers over the screen, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s words and the responsibility to speak out. The seconds tick by, and I can feel my chest tighten, caught between the expectations of being a good child and a committed activist."}
