The home loan repayment loomed over me like a storm cloud, and I knew I had to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. As a mother, it was my job to keep our family secure, to make sure my children never felt the anxiety I carried. But today, as I packed my briefcase, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was in less than an hour. As an advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just a courtesy\u2014it was a duty. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation.\n\nBut the bank had called last night, asking for updated documents, and the only time I could submit them was this morning. If I delayed, the loan process might stall, putting our home at risk. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the courthouse and the bank. Both roles demanded everything from me, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
