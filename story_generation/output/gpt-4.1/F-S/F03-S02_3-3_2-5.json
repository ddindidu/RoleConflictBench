Did you eat?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20147:15 p.m.\u2014our usual time to catch up. I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But my other phone was already ringing with texts from the activist group: \u201cWe need you to call Rep. Harris NOW. The vote is in less than an hour. You\u2019re the only one who can get through.\u201d My heart pounded.

They were counting on me to make a difference, to be the voice that could tip the scales.
