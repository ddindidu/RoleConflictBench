My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you come home soon? Dad\u2019s been quiet all day.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to sit with them, to ask if everything was okay, to be the child who cared enough to notice. But the weight of my civic duty pressed on me too. I\u2019d promised myself I would vote, that I wouldn\u2019t let my voice go unheard. The polling station wasn\u2019t far, but if I went there first, I might miss the window to be with my parents when they needed me most. If I went home, I might not make it to vote in time. My heart pounded as I sat in my car, torn between being the supportive child my parents expected and the responsible voter my community needed. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure of both roles closing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
