My daughter calls, reminding me that everyone expects me to be there early, to help set up and greet the grandkids as they arrive. It\u2019s our tradition\u2014stories, laughter, and the warmth of family. I know how much it means to them, especially since I\u2019m the one who always brings everyone together. But as I set out the tablecloth, I remember: today is also Election Day. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, but the hours overlap with the time I\u2019m supposed to be with my family. My son-in-law mentions how important it is to vote, to have a say in our future, and I agree. Yet, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that if I leave, even briefly, I\u2019ll miss a precious moment with my grandchildren or let down my family\u2019s expectations. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I find myself torn, standing in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pulled in two directions."}
