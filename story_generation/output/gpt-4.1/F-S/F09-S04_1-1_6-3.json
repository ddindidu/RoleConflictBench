He\u2019s been counting down the days, and I know how much it means to him. But as I look at our bank account, I feel a knot in my stomach\u2014money is tight this month, and I need to be careful. Still, I want to keep my promise and see his eyes light up.\n\nAt the same time, today is voting day. I\u2019ve set aside time to go, but as I gather my things, I realize I\u2019ve left my main ID at work. I have a backup, but it\u2019s not the one I usually use, and I\u2019m anxious about whether it will be accepted. I could go back for the other ID later, but that would mean less time to shop for the Nintendo, and possibly missing a good deal.\n\nI feel torn\u2014my son\u2019s happiness and our financial security on one side, my civic duty and the pressure to do things right on the other. My mind races, weighing what matters most, knowing I can\u2019t do it all perfectly."}
