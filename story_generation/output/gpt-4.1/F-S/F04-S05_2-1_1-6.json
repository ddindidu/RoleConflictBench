It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come over. She\u2019d just had a rough argument with her partner and needed someone to talk to. As her brother, I knew how much she counted on me in moments like this. I could picture her sitting on the couch, eyes red, waiting for me to show up and listen, to be the steady presence she\u2019s always found in me.\n\nBut as an advocate, I was expected at a routine meeting in less than an hour. My supervisor had already reminded me twice this week about the importance of punctuality and professionalism. Missing another meeting could mean losing credibility with my colleagues, maybe even risking my position. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my sister\u2019s need for comfort, my duty to my profession. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the person my family needed and the professional I was supposed to be."}
