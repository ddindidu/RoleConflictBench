My wallet, with my ID, was in my jacket by the door, ready for the dash to the voting station. Just as I stood to leave, my mom\u2019s voice trembled from the living room. She and Dad were sitting together, her eyes red, his hands clenched. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper. They poured out worries about Dad\u2019s health, fears about the future, and the weight of uncertainty pressing on them. I could see how much they needed me\u2014my presence, my reassurance, my words. But the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself and my community I would do. My heart pounded as I tried to listen, torn between the urge to comfort my parents and the responsibility to fulfill my civic duty. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the son they needed and the voter I wanted to be."}
