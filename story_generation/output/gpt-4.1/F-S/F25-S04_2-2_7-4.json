I knew they\u2019d been arguing late into the night, and the tension still hung in the air. As their step-child, I felt I should stay, offer comfort, maybe coax a smile or just listen. But today is also the only morning I can swing by home to grab my passport\u2014the ID I need to vote tomorrow. If I miss this window, I\u2019ll lose my chance to have a say in the election, something I promised myself I\u2019d do. My parents need me, but so does my civic duty. I hover in the kitchen, torn between the urge to sit and the ticking clock. My heart aches with guilt either way: if I leave, I abandon them when they\u2019re hurting; if I stay, I risk letting my voice go unheard. The weight of both roles presses down, and I can\u2019t see a way to meet everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014including my own."}
