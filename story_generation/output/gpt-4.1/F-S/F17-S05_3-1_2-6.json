Did you eat lunch?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the advocacy team\u2019s weekly meeting, and I still need to review my notes. I know my parents expect me to reply quickly, to keep them updated about every little thing, and I usually do. It\u2019s our routine, our way of staying close even when I\u2019m busy. But as an advocate, I\u2019m expected to be fully present, on time, and prepared for every meeting and court session. My supervisor made it clear: punctuality and focus are non-negotiable.\n\nI stare at my phone, torn. If I answer Mom now, I\u2019ll be late reviewing the case file, maybe even late to the meeting. If I ignore her, she\u2019ll worry, maybe even call, and I\u2019ll feel guilty for letting her down. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection against my professional responsibility. The meeting reminder pops up, and I\u2019m still frozen, phone in hand, caught between being a good child and a reliable advocate."}
