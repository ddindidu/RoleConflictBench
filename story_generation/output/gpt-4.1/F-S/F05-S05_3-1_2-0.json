She needed clarity, reassurance, and precise legal advice\u2014something I prided myself on providing. But as I typed out a careful response, I heard my wife\u2019s quiet sob from the living room. She\u2019d been struggling for weeks, her world upended by her father\u2019s illness, and she needed me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my undivided attention. I felt the weight of her expectation, the silent plea in her eyes every time I glanced her way. Yet, my client\u2019s case was urgent, and I knew a careless word could cost her dearly. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my client and the love I owed my wife. Each role demanded all of me, right now, and I felt myself stretched thin, heart pounding, unable to silence the guilt that came with even considering one over the other."}
