The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had groceries to put away. Just as I started to rush, my husband called from the living room, his voice trembling. He\u2019d been agonizing over a work decision for days, and now he needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to listen, to help him sort through his options. I could see the worry etched on his face, the way his hands fidgeted with his phone. He was counting on me to be his anchor, to offer the support only I could give.\n\nBut the thought of missing my chance to vote gnawed at me. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let anything get in the way this year. Civic duty mattered, and I wanted my voice heard. Yet here I was, torn between being the partner he deserved and the citizen I aspired to be. My chest tightened as I weighed his pleading eyes against the ticking clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
