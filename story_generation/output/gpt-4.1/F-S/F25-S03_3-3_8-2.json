My stepfather\u2019s voice buzzed in my ear through the phone, trembling as he confessed how lost he felt since losing his job. He needed me\u2014he said I was the only one he could talk to, the only one who understood. I pressed the phone tighter, trying to sound steady, offering words of comfort while my heart pounded with worry for him.\n\nSuddenly, the crowd surged forward. A friend grabbed my arm, eyes wide with urgency. \u201cCome on! We have to cross\u2014this is our chance to make a statement!\u201d The barricade loomed ahead, police watching, the line between protest and trespass clear. I hesitated, torn. As a citizen, I knew the law, the importance of respecting boundaries and public order. But my friend\u2019s grip tightened, and the crowd\u2019s energy pulled at me.\n\nMy stepfather\u2019s voice cracked through the phone, desperate for reassurance. My friend tugged harder, demanding action. I felt split in two\u2014one part needed to be the steady support my family relied on, the other pressured to stand up and act as a member of my community. My heart raced, caught between the voices on either side, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
