My stepbrother had just called, his voice trembling as he told me about the news\u2014our dad\u2019s illness had taken a turn for the worse. He needed me, just to talk, to be there for him, like we always promised we would. But at that moment, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name was right in that range. The new line was barely moving, but the official\u2019s voice was firm, and the sign clearly said to follow instructions. I could see people glancing at me, waiting for me to move. My phone buzzed again\u2014my stepbrother, probably needing comfort. I felt torn, the weight of my promise to him pressing against the civic duty to follow the rules. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between being the sibling he needed and the responsible voter I was supposed to be."}
