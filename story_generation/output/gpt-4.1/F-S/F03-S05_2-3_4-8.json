As her son, I knew how much it meant to her and everyone else that I be there, honoring the rituals passed down through generations. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was scheduled for the same evening. As an advocate, my client depended on me to be present, to argue their case at a critical moment. The judge had warned that any delay could jeopardize the outcome. My heart pounded as I pictured my family waiting for me, disappointment shadowing their faces, while at the same time, I imagined my client\u2019s anxious eyes in the courtroom. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my loyalty, each unwilling to yield. I stared at the clock, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
