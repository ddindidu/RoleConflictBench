My spouse and I had agreed to split the chores evenly\u2014relatives were coming, and the house had to be spotless. I promised to vacuum and tidy the living room before heading out to vote. But at the polling station, things got complicated. An official announced that voters with last names A\u2013M, like mine, needed to switch to a new line. The original line was moving faster, but the instructions were clear. I glanced at my watch, anxiety rising. If I followed the official\u2019s directions, I\u2019d be stuck here longer, and the chores at home would pile up, leaving my spouse to handle everything alone. But if I ignored the instructions, I\u2019d be disregarding the rules and possibly causing trouble. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my spouse about the cleaning. I felt torn, caught between being a responsible partner and a rule-abiding citizen, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me as I stood at the crossroads, unsure which role to honor first."}
