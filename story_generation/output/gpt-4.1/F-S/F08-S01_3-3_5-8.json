My daughter\u2019s voice trembled over the call, asking if I could come over right away\u2014my grandson had a high fever, and she needed help. As a grandmother, I knew my family counted on me, especially in moments like this. But just as I reached for my coat, another message flashed on my screen. It was from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive. The food pantry where I volunteer was facing a critical inspection, and every volunteer was required to follow new procedures immediately. If we didn\u2019t comply, the service might be shut down, leaving dozens of families without support. My heart pounded as I stared at the two messages. My family needed me, but so did the people who relied on the pantry. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure which call to answer first."}
