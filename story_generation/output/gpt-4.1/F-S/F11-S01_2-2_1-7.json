It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you come home? I really need to talk.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted with worry\u2014being there for him was something I\u2019d always promised. But just then, the volunteer coordinator walked by, reminding us about the new safety steps: no one could leave their post until the next shift arrived, and we had to log every item for inventory. She looked at me, expecting my full attention and compliance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my brother needed his sister, but the center needed a reliable volunteer. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush home and the responsibility to follow the rules I\u2019d agreed to. I stared at my phone, caught in the middle, not knowing which role to let down."}
