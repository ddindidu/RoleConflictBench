The polling station will close in ten minutes, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, no matter what. But just as I reach for my coat, my daughter bursts into the living room, her face glowing. \u201cMom, can you come? Lily wants to tell everyone her news!\u201d My granddaughter\u2019s voice floats from the kitchen, excitement bubbling. I see the family gathered, waiting for me, their eyes full of expectation. I know how much these moments mean\u2014being present, sharing in their joys, making memories. But the weight of my civic duty presses on me. If I leave now, I might miss Lily\u2019s big announcement. If I stay, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote, something I\u2019ve always told my family is important. My keys tremble in my hand as I stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility I feel as a citizen."}
