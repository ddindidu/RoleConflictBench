My stepbrother was curled up at the other end, his face buried in his arms, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. He\u2019d just gotten the news about his dad\u2019s illness, and I knew he needed me\u2014needed someone to just sit with him, to listen, to be present. But my phone kept lighting up. The post about our campaign for clean water was exploding online, and everyone was tagging me, waiting for my voice to add credibility and context. This was the moment I\u2019d been working toward for months, the chance to reach thousands, maybe even change minds. I could almost feel the weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressing on me: \u201cDon\u2019t let this opportunity slip by.\u201d But here, in this living room, my stepbrother\u2019s pain was raw and immediate. I felt torn in two, guilt and urgency twisting in my chest, as I stared at the screen and listened to his quiet crying, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
