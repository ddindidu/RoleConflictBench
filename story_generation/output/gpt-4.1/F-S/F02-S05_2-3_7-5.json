The kids\u2019 laughter echoed from the next room, a bittersweet reminder of why I worked so hard. We were running low on groceries, and the rent was due in a week. As a father, I felt the weight of their needs pressing down on me\u2014ensuring there was food on the table, a roof over our heads, and some sense of security.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, and I saw a message from my client. The trial was tomorrow, and everything hinged on my preparation tonight. He was counting on me\u2014his future, his freedom, maybe even his family\u2019s well-being, all depended on how well I represented him. I knew I needed to spend the evening reviewing evidence, crafting arguments, and anticipating the prosecution\u2019s moves.\n\nYet, I also knew that if I didn\u2019t take on extra work or find a way to bring in more money soon, my own family would suffer.
