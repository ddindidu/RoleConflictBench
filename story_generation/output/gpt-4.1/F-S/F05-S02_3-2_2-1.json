She needs me. She\u2019s sitting alone in our living room, the weight of her crisis pressing down, and I promised I\u2019d be there, her anchor. But outside, the city pulses with anticipation. The protest march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, my voice setting the tone for hundreds who look to me for courage. My fellow activists are counting on my presence, my energy, my leadership. I can almost hear the crowd gathering, feel the urgency in the air. I glance at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the person I love and the cause I believe in. Both need me\u2014right now. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations: to be the steady support my partner needs, or the passionate leader my movement demands. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
