It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our ritual call, the one she waits for all week. I can almost hear her voice, warm and expectant, ready to ask about my week and share stories from home. But my laptop is open to a mountain of case files, and tomorrow is the trial that could change my client\u2019s life forever. I promised her I\u2019d always keep in touch, that I\u2019d never let work swallow me whole. Yet, as an advocate, I know I can\u2019t afford to be distracted now; every detail matters, every argument could tip the scales. My client is counting on me to be fully present, to fight for their future with everything I have. The phone keeps ringing, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle hope for connection, my client\u2019s desperate need for justice. My heart aches as I stare at the phone, torn between the daughter I want to be and the advocate I need to become."}
