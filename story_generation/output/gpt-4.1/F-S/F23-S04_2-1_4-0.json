My heart thudded with the familiar anxiety of being a step-parent\u2014always aware that my words and actions are measured, not just by him, but by his father and the silent expectations of what it means to be a \u201cgood\u201d parent. I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect for public spaces, about self-control. That\u2019s what I promised myself I\u2019d do: guide him, set boundaries, help him grow.\n\nBut today was also Election Day. I\u2019d planned to vote after our errands, but the polling station was only open for another hour. If I stopped now to have the talk he needed, we\u2019d be late. If I rushed him, I\u2019d be the impatient adult, the outsider who cared more about rules than about him. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding I shape a child\u2019s character, the other insisting I fulfill my civic duty. I stood frozen, torn between the two, as my stepson\u2019s laughter echoed down the aisle."}
