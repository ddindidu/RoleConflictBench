Miss you!\u201d I know she wants to hear from me, just a quick call or a text to let her know I\u2019m okay. I glance at the clock\u2014almost 10 p.m.\u2014and remember I promised my friends we\u2019d play music in my apartment tonight. We\u2019ve been looking forward to it all week, and I don\u2019t want to let them down. But as I set up the speakers, I notice my neighbor\u2019s window is open across the courtyard. The building\u2019s quiet hours start at ten, and I know the rules: keep the noise down, respect everyone\u2019s right to peace. My phone vibrates again, another message from Mom, and I feel the weight of her expectation to stay connected. At the same time, I feel the pressure to be a good neighbor and law-abiding citizen. My friends are already here, waiting, and I\u2019m torn\u2014caught between being the daughter my mom hopes for and the responsible citizen my community expects."}
