My husband had worked late all week, and I knew he was counting on me to keep the house running smoothly. The laundry had been piling up for days, and I promised myself I\u2019d finally fold it today. But as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed with an alert: a heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Patel, our elderly neighbor who lived alone on our floor. She struggled with the air conditioner and sometimes forgot to drink enough water. As a responsible citizen, I felt a duty to check on her, maybe bring her some cold water or help adjust her AC. But the thought of leaving the laundry unfinished gnawed at me\u2014my husband would be home soon, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the expectations of home and the needs of my community, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
