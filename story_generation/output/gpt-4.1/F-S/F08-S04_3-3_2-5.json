The clock ticked louder than usual, reminding me that this was my only chance to vote. Just as I stood up, my granddaughter burst in, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d She sat down across from me, clutching her phone, her hands shaking. I could see she was on the verge of tears, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed the comfort and wisdom I\u2019d always promised to give.\n\nBut the minutes were slipping away. If I stayed, I might miss my chance to vote, something I\u2019d always told my family was a civic duty, a responsibility I took seriously. Yet, how could I turn away from my granddaughter in her moment of need? My heart ached as I looked from her anxious face to the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
