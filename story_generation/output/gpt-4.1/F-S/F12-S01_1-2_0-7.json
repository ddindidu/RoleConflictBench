He sounded tired, a little frustrated, and I could tell he needed me to listen, to offer comfort and understanding. I wanted to be present for him, to ask questions and reassure him that things would get better. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer group\u2014tonight was my shift at the shelter, and the coordinator had stressed the importance of the new safety procedures. We were told, in no uncertain terms, that everyone had to be on time and fully briefed before starting. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the need to be a supportive wife, and the responsibility to follow the strict guidelines as a volunteer. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to figure out how to be what both roles demanded of me, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
