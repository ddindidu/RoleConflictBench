My shift at the community center was almost over, and I was supposed to pick up my kids from school in twenty minutes. I knew how much they looked forward to seeing me at the gate, especially today, the last day before summer break. As I started to gather my things, a woman approached the check-in table, her eyes darting nervously. She leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and began to share something deeply personal\u2014something she clearly needed to get off her chest. I could see the trust she was placing in me, expecting me to listen and keep her words safe. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids\u2014don\u2019t be late!\u201d I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My children expected me to be there, present and reliable, but this woman needed me, too, and I couldn\u2019t betray her trust. My mind raced, caught between the pull of motherhood and the responsibility of being a compassionate volunteer, unsure which demand I could bear to let down."}
