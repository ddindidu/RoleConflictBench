The school bell would ring in fifteen minutes, and my kids would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for me. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014no after-school program, no waiting in the office, just me, like I always tried to be. But here I was, standing at the polling station, ballot in hand, as the poll worker frowned at the smudged envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she said gently. I knew the rules\u2014every instruction mattered, and I wanted my vote to be valid. But the minutes ticked by, and I imagined my children\u2019s faces, the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there. My duty as a father pulled me one way, my responsibility as a voter the other. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
