My partner\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cCan you please handle the laundry today? The kids need clean clothes for tomorrow.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. Just as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Maya, a fellow activist. \u201cWe\u2019re live now. Hardly anyone showed up. Can you come? We need more voices.\u201d I watch the live stream for a moment\u2014familiar faces, signs held high, their voices urgent. My heart aches to be there, to stand with them, to fight for what I believe in. But the laundry sits at my feet, a different kind of duty, no less important. I feel torn, pulled in two directions by the people who need me. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations, the guilt of letting someone down pressing in from both sides."}
