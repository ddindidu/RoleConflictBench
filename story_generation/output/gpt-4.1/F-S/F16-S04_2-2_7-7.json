As her spouse, I knew I should ask, listen, and share my own worries too. So, after we cleared the plates, I sat beside her and opened up about the stress at work, hoping she\u2019d feel safe to do the same. Just as she started to talk, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I still hadn\u2019t mailed my ballot, and the drop-off site closed soon.\n\nWe drove together, and at the polling place, a worker handed my envelope back, pointing out a smudge on my signature. \u201cPlease re-sign, or your vote might not count,\u201d she said. I hesitated, remembering the strict instructions about not altering the envelope after sealing. My mind raced\u2014should I follow the official\u2019s request, or stick to the rules as written? Jamie squeezed my hand, her eyes searching mine, still waiting for the conversation we\u2019d started at home.
