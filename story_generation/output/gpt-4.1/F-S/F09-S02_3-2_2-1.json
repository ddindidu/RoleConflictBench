It\u2019s the school\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate. The principal\u2019s voice is stern, asking me to come in immediately. My heart sinks. I\u2019m supposed to be at the front of the march, leading the first chant, the one I spent weeks preparing. People are counting on me to speak out, to show up, to be the face of our cause. But my son needs me, too. The school expects me to address his behavior, to show I\u2019m a responsible parent, to support him and the child he hurt. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands tremble as I stare at the protest sign in one hand and my car keys in the other, torn between the mother my son needs and the activist my community expects."}
