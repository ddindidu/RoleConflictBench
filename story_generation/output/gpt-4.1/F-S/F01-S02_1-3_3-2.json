The living room is filled with laughter as my grandchildren chase each other, their parents setting the table for our long-awaited family gathering. I promised them I\u2019d be present, really present, this time\u2014no phone calls, no distractions. But my phone vibrates urgently in my pocket. A message from the activist group flashes on the screen: \u201cPolice are blocking exits. We need you to help coordinate a safe response\u2014now.\u201d My mind races. I know the risks if I don\u2019t act quickly; people could get hurt, and our cause could suffer. Yet, I see my daughter\u2019s hopeful smile, the way my grandson tugs at my sleeve, eager for my attention. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for my presence, and my responsibility to the movement. My hands tremble as I hold the phone, torn between the warmth of home and the urgency outside, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
