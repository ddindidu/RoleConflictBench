My grandson had been in a minor accident, and though he was safe, she was overwhelmed and needed someone to talk to. As a grandfather, I\u2019ve always promised to be there for my family, especially in times of crisis. I could hear the strain in her words, the unspoken plea for comfort and advice. At the same time, I glanced at the clock\u2014my volunteer shift at the community center started in half an hour. They counted on me to be punctual, but I also knew that if I was a little late, the other volunteers could manage without me for a while. Still, I prided myself on reliability, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down. My heart tugged in two directions: the urgent need to support my family, and the commitment I\u2019d made to my volunteer work. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the expectations of being a dependable grandfather and a responsible volunteer, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
