As a parent, I knew I had to make sure there was enough money for groceries, rent, and the kids\u2019 school supplies. Every dollar mattered, and lately, it felt like there were never enough. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the volunteer coordinator. \u201cReminder: All volunteers must follow the new safety steps at tomorrow\u2019s event. No exceptions.\u201d I\u2019d promised to help at the food bank, and the coordinator had been clear: anyone not following the new guidelines would be sent home. But the shift was unpaid, and I\u2019d just been offered a last-minute job for the same time, one that would help cover this month\u2019s bills. My heart pounded as I stared at the message, torn between the urgent need to provide for my family and my commitment to the volunteer team. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t see how to meet the expectations of both. The weight of the decision pressed down on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unable to move forward."}
