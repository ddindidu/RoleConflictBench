My younger sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d help her plan a picnic, and my parents looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d join in the fun. Just then, the shrill sound of the building alarm cut through our conversation. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning\u2014water was already rising along our block. I knew, as a responsible citizen, I should help neighbors, check on the elderly couple upstairs, and follow the emergency protocols. But my family\u2019s anxious faces pulled at me; they wanted me to stay, to help them gather our things and keep everyone calm. My heart pounded as I stood between the living room and the front door, torn by the weight of both roles\u2014my family\u2019s need for comfort and my duty to the wider community. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt paralyzed, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
