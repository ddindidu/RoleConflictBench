I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for me at the gate, hoping I\u2019d be on time for once. As a mother, I knew how much it meant to them that I was there, present and attentive, especially with the school year ending soon. But tonight was also the night I\u2019d promised to help organize a small music gathering in our building\u2019s common room. The plan was to start setting up right after school, but the event would run into the evening, brushing up against the building\u2019s strict quiet hours. \n\nI remembered last month\u2019s warning from the building manager about noise complaints. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always kept her windows open, and she\u2019d made it clear she valued her peace. As a citizen, I felt responsible for respecting her rights and the building\u2019s rules. The thought of disappointing my children or upsetting my neighbors twisted inside me. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the expectations of being a good mother and a considerate citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
