The activist group\u2019s message is urgent: the vote is happening in an hour, and my call could sway the undecided representative. I know how much this bill matters\u2014months of work, late nights, and hope for real change. But as I reach for my laptop, I see my son\u2019s hopeful eyes. \u201cDad, are we going to the store? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo today.\u201d He\u2019s been saving, counting down the days, and I promised I\u2019d make it happen. I glance at the clock. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the window to call the legislator. If I stay, I\u2019ll break my promise and disappoint him, maybe even shake his trust. My mind races, torn between the cause I\u2019ve poured myself into and the little boy who just wants his dad to keep his word. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I can\u2019t see a way to be enough for both."}
