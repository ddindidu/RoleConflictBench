The poll worker pointed out the smudge on my signature and politely asked me to re-sign, explaining it was to ensure my vote would count. I nodded, but my mind raced back to my mother\u2019s words that morning: \u201cNever change your signature once you\u2019ve signed something important. It\u2019s a matter of integrity\u2014our family\u2019s way.\u201d I\u2019d grown up with these traditions, watching my parents treat every signature as a solemn promise, never to be altered or redone. Now, as a voter, I was expected to follow the poll worker\u2019s instructions, to trust the process and do what was necessary for my ballot to be valid. But as a daughter, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s values pressing on me, warning me not to betray what I\u2019d been taught. My hand hovered over the envelope, torn between honoring my family\u2019s tradition and fulfilling my civic duty. The poll worker waited patiently, but inside, I was caught in a storm of loyalty and responsibility, unsure which role I could bear to disappoint."}
