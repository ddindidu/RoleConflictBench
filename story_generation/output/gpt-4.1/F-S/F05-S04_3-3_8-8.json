She wanted to know everything\u2014every detail, every worry I had about our finances and my own health. I owed her that openness; it was the foundation of our marriage. But my phone buzzed, a reminder that the polling station would close soon. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, and now, standing in line, an official told me there was a problem with my registration. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the doors closed in ten minutes. My wife was waiting at home, expecting a real conversation, not a hurried excuse. The official was waiting for me to follow instructions, no time for delay or distraction. I felt torn, the weight of two promises pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
