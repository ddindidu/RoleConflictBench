They\u2019d been wrestling with a difficult decision at work, and I knew they needed me\u2014my full attention, my encouragement, my support. I reached for their hand, ready to listen, to be the spouse they counted on. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes was closing soon. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, to be a responsible citizen and give feedback that could help our community. The survey would only take a few minutes, but I knew how much my partner needed me right now. My mind raced, torn between being present for the person I love and fulfilling my duty as an engaged citizen. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt a knot of guilt and anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to decide which role to honor in this moment."}
