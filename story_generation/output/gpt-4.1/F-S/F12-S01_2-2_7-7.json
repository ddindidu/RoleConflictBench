He\u2019d been distant all week, and I knew I should reach out, ask him what was wrong, and share my own worries from the day. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or busy we were. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a reminder about the new safety procedures we\u2019d just been briefed on. She wanted confirmation that I\u2019d read and understood every step before tomorrow\u2019s event. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my husband needed me to be present, to listen and talk, but the coordinator expected me to be diligent, focused, and responsive. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close my laptop and turn to my husband, and the responsibility to reply to the coordinator, review the guidelines, and prove I was a reliable volunteer. My heart pounded as I sat there, caught between the person I loved and the cause I cared about, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
