My partner had mentioned this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for their soccer game tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised to handle it tonight. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey on bus routes was closing soon.

The city was finally asking for feedback, and I knew my input could help shape the routes for years to come. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in.
