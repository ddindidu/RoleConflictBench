It means a lot to everyone.\u201d My little sister had even sent a string of excited emojis, counting down the days. I knew how much these gatherings mattered\u2014how my presence was expected, how I was supposed to be the supportive sibling, the one who never missed a family moment.\n\nBut on my desk, the thick file for Ms. Carter\u2019s case sat open, its pages marked with urgent notes. The hearing was scheduled for Monday, and I was her advocate\u2014her only hope, she\u2019d said, her voice trembling. She needed me to be prepared, to fight for her with everything I had.
