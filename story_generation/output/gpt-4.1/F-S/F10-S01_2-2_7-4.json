Dad barely touched his dinner, his eyes distant. I knew they needed me\u2014just to listen, to reassure them, to be the daughter who could help shoulder their worries. But my mind kept drifting back to the community center earlier that day. A client, voice trembling, had confided in me about a personal struggle while I helped her with paperwork. She\u2019d asked me not to tell anyone, trusting me with her secret. Now, as I watched my parents\u2019 exhaustion, I wondered if sharing what I\u2019d heard\u2014without names\u2014might help them understand the weight I carried, maybe even bring us closer. But I\u2019d promised confidentiality. My parents needed my openness, my trust, but my client needed my silence. I felt torn, the expectations of being a good daughter and a trustworthy volunteer pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which part of me should speak."}
