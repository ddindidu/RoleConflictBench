But as she spoke, I recognized the legal undertones in her situation, the same kind of questions my clients bring to me as an advocate. My mind raced with the professional obligation to provide clear, accurate legal advice, to avoid overstepping or giving incomplete information in a casual setting. Yet, as her grandparent, she expected warmth and personal insight, not a clinical response. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, the urge to protect her with my experience clashing with the boundaries of my profession. My heart ached to comfort her, but my training warned me to tread carefully. I hesitated, caught between the love of a grandparent and the duty of an advocate, unsure which voice should speak first."}
