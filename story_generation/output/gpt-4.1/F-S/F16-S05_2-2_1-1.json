The case had taken a complicated turn, and I knew I needed to review documents and prepare a thorough response. But across from me, my partner stared into their coffee, eyes clouded with worry. They\u2019d just told me about the impossible choice their boss had given them\u2014take on a risky project or risk being sidelined. I could see how much they needed me, not just to listen, but to reassure them, to help them find clarity. My mind raced with legal arguments and deadlines, but my heart ached to be present for the person I loved. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressing on one shoulder, my partner\u2019s vulnerability on the other. I wanted to be everything for both, but the demands clashed, leaving me frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
