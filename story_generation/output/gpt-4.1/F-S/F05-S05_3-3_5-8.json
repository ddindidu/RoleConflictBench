As her husband, I knew she expected me to help\u2014she\u2019d been working all week, and this visit mattered to her. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was in two hours. As an advocate, my client was counting on me to be there early, to review last-minute details before the high-stakes hearing. I could feel the tension knotting in my stomach. If I stayed to help, I\u2019d risk being late to court, letting down my client and possibly jeopardizing the case.

The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, and I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in one hand, a dust cloth in the other, torn between two worlds that refused to wait."}
