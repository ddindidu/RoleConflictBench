My stepbrother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, shaky and raw\u2014he\u2019d just gotten the news about his father\u2019s illness, and I could hear him trying not to cry. I knew he needed me, needed someone to sit with him, to listen, to just be there. But I was already late for my voting appointment, and the polling place was closing soon. I rushed out, promising I\u2019d be back as soon as I could.\n\nAt the polling station, my hands trembled as I filled out my ballot. The poll worker frowned, pointing out the smudged signature on my envelope. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to re-sign this, or your vote might not count,\u201d she said.

My heart pounded as I stared at the envelope, torn between being the sibling he needed and the responsible voter I was supposed to be."}
