My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and I was the only one with the keys to open the community center. I knew people would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on the warm meal we served every Thursday. As I reached for my coat, I noticed my spouse sitting at the kitchen table, staring into their coffee, shoulders slumped. I hesitated. We\u2019d promised to communicate openly, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. I remembered how I\u2019d felt last week when they brushed off my concerns, and I didn\u2019t want to do the same. But if I stayed to talk, I\u2019d be late, and the people outside would be left in the cold, maybe thinking no one cared. My spouse looked up, eyes searching mine, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I stood in the doorway, torn, the keys cold in my hand, unsure which need was greater."}
