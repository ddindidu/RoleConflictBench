Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone. It\u2019s been too long since we were all together.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, and I knew how much these gatherings meant to her. At the same time, my volunteer coordinator\u2019s text popped up: \u201cReminder\u2014shift starts at 6 sharp. We\u2019re short-staffed, so please be on time.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The dinner was at 5:30, but with traffic and cleanup, there was no way I could make it to the shelter by six. My siblings expected me to be present, laughing and sharing stories, while my team at the shelter needed every hand. I could picture the disappointed faces at home and the overwhelmed volunteers at the shelter. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between two places I cared about, unsure which part of me I\u2019d have to let down."}
