It\u2019s Sunday morning\u2014my parents\u2019 day. Every week, I call them, listen to my mother\u2019s stories, and reassure my father that I\u2019m eating well. They wait for my call, and I know how much it means to them. But today, my client\u2019s hearing is scheduled earlier than usual. The judge is strict about punctuality, and my client\u2019s future could hinge on my presence. I glance at the clock. If I call my parents now, I\u2019ll be late for court. If I skip the call, I\u2019ll hear the disappointment in my mother\u2019s voice later, the quiet sigh, the unspoken worry. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: the dutiful son who never misses a call, the responsible advocate who never lets a client down. I stand in the hallway, phone in one hand, briefcase in the other, torn between two worlds that both need me, both right now."}
