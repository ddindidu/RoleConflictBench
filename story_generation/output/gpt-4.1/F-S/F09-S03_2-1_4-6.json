As a mother, I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running indoors is dangerous and disrespectful. I want to teach him discipline, to help him grow into a considerate person. But my mind is racing with other demands. As a citizen, I\u2019ve promised myself to get our tax documents in order early this year\u2014no last-minute panic. And this weekend, the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic, and they need volunteers. I feel responsible to help, to set an example for my children about giving back and supporting public health. The weight of these expectations presses on me: my son\u2019s behavior needs correcting now, but my civic duties are urgent too. I can\u2019t help but feel torn, my heart tugged in two directions, wondering which role I should answer first."}
