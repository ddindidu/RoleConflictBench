My volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes, and I was the only one with the keys to open the community center. I pictured the line of people already waiting outside, counting on me to let them in. But right now, I was in the supermarket with my son, who was darting between aisles, giggling as he dodged my attempts to catch him. Other shoppers shot me disapproving looks. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running indoors was wrong\u2014teach him about respect and discipline, just like I always promised myself I would. But every minute spent here meant another minute those people would be left standing in the cold, maybe thinking I\u2019d forgotten them. My son\u2019s laughter echoed, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the mother who taught her child right from wrong, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the people who needed me at the center. My hands trembled as I reached for my son, torn between two promises I couldn\u2019t keep at once."}
