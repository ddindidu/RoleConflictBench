I could sense something was weighing on him\u2014he\u2019d barely touched his breakfast, and the usual spark in his voice was gone. As his grandfather, I felt the urge to reach out, to offer the kind of guidance my own father once gave me. I wanted to tell him that it\u2019s okay to feel lost sometimes, that I was here to listen, no matter what.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes. The coordinator had stressed how important it was for everyone to be on time today, with so few hands available. I knew they were counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the boy who needed me now, and toward the people waiting for me at the shelter. I sat there, torn, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
