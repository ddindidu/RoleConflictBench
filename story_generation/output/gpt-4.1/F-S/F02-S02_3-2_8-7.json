The home loan repayment is due in two months, and I know I need to start planning, maybe even take on extra work to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. My wife\u2019s voice drifts in from the living room, reminding me that the kids need new shoes, and I feel the weight of every dollar we spend. My phone buzzes, jolting me back. It\u2019s a reminder: I\u2019m scheduled to go live on the radio in five minutes to talk about our community\u2019s fight for clean water. People are counting on me to speak up, to educate, to inspire action. I glance at the clock, my heart pounding. If I do the show, I lose an hour I could use to search for freelance gigs or budget. If I skip it, I let down everyone who believes in our cause. The expectations press in from both sides, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
