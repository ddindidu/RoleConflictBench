My son had been caught bullying a classmate. As a father, I was expected to show up at the school, to listen, to guide him, to make sure he understood the seriousness of his actions. I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my chest. But outside, the city was alive with protest. As a citizen, I believed in standing up for justice, in respecting the rights of others, and following the law. Yet, here I was, swept along in a crowd, someone urging me to cross the barricade, to make a statement. My mind raced\u2014should I be the father my son needed right now, or the citizen my city demanded? Both roles pulled at me, each with its own expectations, each with its own consequences. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the call to guide my child and the call to stand with my community."}
