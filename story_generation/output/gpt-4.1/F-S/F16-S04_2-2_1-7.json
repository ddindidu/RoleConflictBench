She was on the verge of tears, overwhelmed by a decision at work that could change her career. She needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my calm words, my full attention. I promised I\u2019d be there for her, that I\u2019d help her think it through. But as I stepped into the polling station, my phone buzzed again. I silenced it, heart pounding, and handed my ballot to the poll worker. She frowned, pointing out a smudge on the envelope. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to re-sign this, please,\u201d she said, her tone firm. I remembered the instructions: follow every rule, no exceptions, or risk my vote not counting. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014my partner, waiting, needing me. I felt torn, caught between the duty to support the person I love and the responsibility to uphold the integrity of my vote. My hands trembled as I stared at the envelope, the poll worker\u2019s expectant gaze on me, my partner\u2019s voice echoing in my mind."}
