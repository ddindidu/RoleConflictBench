Lily wants to show everyone her first piano recital video before school.\u201d As a grandmother, I know how much these moments mean\u2014Lily\u2019s shy smile, the way she looks for me in the crowd. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture her disappointment if I missed it.\n\nBut as I hung up, I glanced at the calendar and felt a knot in my stomach. Tomorrow is Election Day, and I realized my ID is still at home, a forty-minute drive away. Today is the only window I have to get it, with appointments and errands stacked up tomorrow.
