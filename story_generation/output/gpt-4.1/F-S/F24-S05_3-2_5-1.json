My stepmom had sent a long message about how important it was for all of us to be together this year, especially since it was the first time we\u2019d all be under one roof since Dad remarried. I knew how much it meant to her, and to my younger stepbrother, who kept asking if I\u2019d be there for the big family dinner. At the same time, my work email pinged with a message from a client whose case had suddenly become more complicated. She needed urgent, detailed legal advice, and as her advocate, I was the only one she trusted to guide her through the mess. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me to show up, be present, and bond, while my client needed my undivided attention and expertise. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly meet both demands, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
