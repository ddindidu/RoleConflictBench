Being his sister means showing up, celebrating his big moments, and making him feel seen. But as I\u2019m getting ready, I remember the online candidate forum for our district is streaming at the exact same time. I\u2019ve always believed in being an active citizen\u2014staying informed, asking questions, and voting responsibly. This election feels especially important, and I know my feedback could make a difference. My inbox is full of reminders from the community group I joined, urging everyone to participate tonight. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My brother expects my support, my community expects my engagement. I stare at my phone, the graduation cap emoji blinking at me, while my laptop pings with the forum\u2019s live link. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles presses down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
