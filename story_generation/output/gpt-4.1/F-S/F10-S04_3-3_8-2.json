It was Mom, her voice trembling. \u201cCan you come home? Dad and I\u2026 we just had a big argument. I need you.\u201d My heart clenched. I\u2019d never heard her sound so fragile. I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the polling station closed. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, determined to have my voice heard. But now, Mom needed me, really needed me, and I could hear Dad in the background, his voice low and sad. I felt torn in two. If I rushed to the polling station, I might make it, but I\u2019d have to ignore my parents\u2019 pain. If I went home, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote, something I\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks. My hands shook as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both my family\u2019s expectations and my civic duty pressing down on me."}
