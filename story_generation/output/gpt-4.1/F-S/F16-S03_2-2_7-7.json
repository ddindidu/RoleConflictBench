I knew something was wrong, and as a partner, I felt the urge to sit down, listen, and share my own worries from work, hoping we could support each other. That\u2019s what we promised\u2014open communication, no matter how busy or tired we were. But as I reached for their hand, my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I immediately thought of Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor who lives alone on our floor. As a responsible citizen, I felt compelled to check on her, maybe bring her some water or help set up her fan. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my spouse needed me here, to talk and be present, but Mrs. Lee might need me too, right now, for her safety. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn by the demands of love and duty, unsure which way to turn."}
