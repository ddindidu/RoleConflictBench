She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply closet\u2014nothing urgent, just \u201cif you have time, try this.\u201d I knew she valued flexibility, but I also wanted to show I could follow her guidance and be reliable. As I reread her message, my spouse walked in, shoulders tense, eyes tired. I remembered my promise to be more open, to share and listen, especially when one of us seemed off. I wanted to ask about their day, to talk about my own worries at work, but the thought of the supply closet nagged at me. If I didn\u2019t do it now, I might not get another chance this week. My spouse sat down, clearly waiting for me to start the conversation we both knew we needed. I felt torn\u2014should I close the laptop and be present, or squeeze in the volunteer task to prove I was dependable? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the roles I cared about most."}
