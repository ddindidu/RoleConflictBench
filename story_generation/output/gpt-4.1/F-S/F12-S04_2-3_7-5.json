I knew something was wrong. As his wife, I\u2019ve always believed in open communication, and I could feel the weight of his unspoken worries pressing between us. I wanted to sit down, hold his hand, and ask him to share what was on his mind, just as we promised we would when things got tough. But as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polls would close in less than an hour. This was my only chance to vote, and I needed to bring my ID, which was buried somewhere in the mess of my work bag upstairs. The pressure mounted: do I stay and be the supportive wife he needs right now, or do I rush out to fulfill my civic duty as a voter, knowing there won\u2019t be another chance? My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of being present for my husband and the responsibility of casting my vote."}
