She needed me to talk to him, to help him through this rough patch. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always tried to be the steady hand, the one who listens and offers comfort, and I know how much my family relies on me to keep us connected, especially in hard times. But today, I\u2019m also scheduled for my volunteer shift at the community center. Just yesterday, our coordinator emphasized the importance of the new safety procedures\u2014no exceptions, no distractions. We\u2019re short-staffed, and I know how much they count on me to set an example. My phone buzzes again with a message from my daughter, pleading for advice. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart aches for my family, but my sense of duty to the center is just as strong. I stand in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which need is greater or how to choose."}
