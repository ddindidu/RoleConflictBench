He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, and now he was determined to try a new trick he\u2019d seen online. As his sibling, I felt a knot of worry tighten in my stomach\u2014I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the advocacy meeting was starting in fifteen minutes, and I was expected to be there, on time, as always. My supervisor had already warned me about punctuality, and missing another session could put my position at risk. I glanced from my brother, poised at the top of the ramp, to the clock on my phone. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to the meeting, but I\u2019d have to leave him alone, risking his safety. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late again, and my colleagues would notice. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands of being a good sibling against my responsibilities as an advocate, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
