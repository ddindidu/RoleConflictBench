I know how much they look forward to these calls\u2014Mom always asks about my job, Dad wants to hear about my friends. But today, I also remember that I left my driver\u2019s license at home last week, and tomorrow is Election Day. The only time I can swing by my apartment to grab my ID is this morning, before work. If I miss this window, I won\u2019t be able to vote. My parents expect to hear my voice, to feel included in my life, but my civic duty demands I make this detour. I stare at my phone, torn between dialing their number and rushing out the door. My heart pounds with guilt and anxiety, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
