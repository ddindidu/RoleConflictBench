Mom\u2019s counting on everyone being there.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, reminding me how much these gatherings meant to our parents. At the same time, my email pinged with a new message from a client. Their case, already complicated, had just taken another unexpected turn. They needed me\u2014tonight, if possible\u2014to review documents and offer guidance before a crucial deadline. \n\nMy heart thudded with the weight of both worlds. As a sibling, I was expected to show up, laugh, and be present, to help keep our family traditions alive. As an advocate, I owed my client my full attention and expertise, especially now when the stakes were so high. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and responsibility tangling inside me. I wanted to be there for my family, but I also couldn\u2019t let my client down. The pressure built as I tried to figure out how to be both the sibling my family needed and the advocate my client deserved."}
