I was supposed to be fully present, watching her read aloud, catching her proud glances. But just before I left for the school, a neighbor I volunteer with called, anxious about a rumor spreading in the community. She wanted to talk, to know if I\u2019d heard anything, to trust me with her worries. Now, as I waited, another parent from the class sat beside me and, in a friendly tone, asked about my volunteer work. The conversation drifted, and soon she was asking about the people I help\u2014nothing too personal, but enough to make me pause. I felt the weight of my daughter\u2019s expectation that I\u2019d be there for her, focused and cheering her on, and the responsibility to protect the privacy of those I support. My mind raced, torn between being the attentive parent my daughter deserved and the trustworthy volunteer my neighbor needed. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could meet without letting someone down."}
