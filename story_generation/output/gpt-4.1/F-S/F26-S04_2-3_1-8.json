My granddaughter sat on the stairs, her eyes red and distant. I could tell something was weighing on her\u2014she\u2019d barely spoken since I arrived. As a grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer comfort, and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. She needed me, and I could see it in the way she glanced up, almost asking for help without words.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. The election official had just told me I needed to fill out a provisional ballot form because of a registration issue, and the polling station would close in ten minutes. I was expected to follow every instruction, to do my civic duty and make sure my vote counted. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my granddaughter, who needed guidance, and toward the polling place, where my presence was urgently required. I hesitated, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
