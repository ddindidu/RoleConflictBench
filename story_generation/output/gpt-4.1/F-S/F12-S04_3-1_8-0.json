We needed to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up and the choices we\u2019d have to make. He looked at me, waiting for honesty, for the open communication we\u2019d promised each other. My phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. The polling station was just a few blocks away, and I had plenty of time, but the hours were ticking by. I knew how important it was to vote, to show up and have my say, but I also knew how much my husband needed me to be present, to talk through every detail without distraction. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my marriage and the responsibility I felt as a citizen. I wanted to be fully here, to listen and share, but the thought of missing my chance to vote gnawed at me. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, caught between two promises I didn\u2019t want to break."}
