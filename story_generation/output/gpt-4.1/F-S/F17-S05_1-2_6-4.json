My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cCan we talk tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014court was in the morning, and I still needed to review the evidence, prepare my notes, and anticipate the opposing counsel\u2019s moves. My client was counting on me; their future depended on my focus and skill. But my parents needed me, too. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice, soft and uncertain, asking if everything was okay at home. I was their child, the one who checked in, who listened, who tried to hold the family together. The weight of their unspoken worries pressed on me, just as the responsibility to my client did. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the home I came from and the person I was becoming. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they deserved at the same time."}
