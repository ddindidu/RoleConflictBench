The bank closes in an hour, and I still haven\u2019t found the documents I need to review our home loan status. The repayment is due in two months, and I promised myself I\u2019d get ahead of it this time\u2014for my kids, for our security. But then I see the voting card on the kitchen table, a stark reminder that the polls close tonight. It\u2019s my only chance to vote, and I need to bring my ID, which is buried somewhere in the same pile of paperwork I need for the bank. \n\nMy son tugs at my sleeve, asking what\u2019s for dinner, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down. If I focus on the loan, I might miss my chance to vote, letting my voice go unheard. If I rush to the polls, I risk not finding the right documents in time, putting our home at risk. My hands tremble as I shuffle through the papers, torn between my duty as a mother and my responsibility as a citizen, knowing I can\u2019t give both my all tonight."}
