My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about our finances. We\u2019d agreed to talk openly, to lay everything on the table\u2014no secrets, no half-truths. I could see the worry in their face, the need for reassurance, for honesty. But as I tried to focus, my mind kept drifting to the clock. I was the only volunteer scheduled to open the community center this morning, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to let them in and start the day\u2019s service. If I left now, I\u2019d break the trust my spouse and I had worked so hard to build. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a crowd of people who needed help. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
