I know it\u2019s my stepmom\u2014she always calls at this time, expecting our weekly check-in. She worries if I miss it, and Dad says it\u2019s important to keep her feeling included, especially since I moved out. But the organizers are waving me over, their eyes searching for me. I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, to set the tone for the march we\u2019ve spent weeks planning. People are counting on me to be there, to show up for the cause I believe in. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the comfort of family and the urgency of the movement. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both expectations presses down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
