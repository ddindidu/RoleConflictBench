We chatted about our days, and I mentioned, almost offhand, that I\u2019d seen a coworker toss a coffee cup on the ground outside the office. My wife paused, looking at me with that gentle expectation she always has when she wants me to open up. \u201cDid you say anything to him?\u201d she asked, her voice soft but curious. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a husband, I knew she valued honesty and open communication\u2014she wanted to know my thoughts, my actions, the little things that made up my day. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: I should have spoken up, reminded my coworker to respect public spaces, maybe even picked up the cup myself. Now, with her waiting for my answer, I felt torn between admitting I\u2019d stayed silent\u2014failing both her expectation for openness and my own sense of civic duty\u2014or glossing over the moment to avoid disappointing her. The park felt suddenly quieter as I wrestled with what to say next."}
