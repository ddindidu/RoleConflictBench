My heart pounded as I listened to the principal\u2019s voice: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me at the school immediately. As a parent, I knew I had to be there for him, to understand what happened, to show him right from wrong. But as I grabbed my keys, my calendar notification buzzed\u2014a court session in less than an hour, one I\u2019d spent weeks preparing for as an advocate. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence and punctuality. I could picture my son, scared and waiting, and my client, anxious and counting on me. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands, feeling the pull of two worlds that refused to overlap. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the child who needed guidance and the client who needed justice, unable to move."}
