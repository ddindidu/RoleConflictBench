I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014preserving our traditions, honoring our ancestors. But as I held the sash, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was starting. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch, ask questions, and be an informed citizen. The election was close, and my voice mattered. My family expected me to carry on our customs, to be present and respectful. My community expected me to participate, to help shape our future. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, my heart racing as I glanced between my mother\u2019s hopeful face and the glowing screen. I wanted to be the daughter my family needed, but I also wanted to be the citizen my community deserved. The ceremony was about to begin, and the forum was already live. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
