We were catching up after a long day, and I could sense they wanted to talk more deeply about something that had happened at work. I knew how important it was to communicate openly, to share and listen, to be present. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the volunteer coordinator. The new directive was urgent: we had to implement strict new procedures immediately, or the service we provided to the community would be shut down. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to engage, to be the spouse they needed. At the same time, the responsibility to my volunteer team and the people we served loomed large. I could feel my heart racing, torn between the need to be present at home and the duty to act quickly for the volunteer organization. I hesitated, caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
