Mom made your favorite.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014family dinner starts in twenty minutes. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I know how much it means to them, especially after missing last week. But outside, the crowd is already gathering, signs raised, voices humming with anticipation. The protest march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant. The organizers are counting on me; I helped plan every detail, and my absence would be noticed. My heart pounds as I picture my family waiting at the table, laughter echoing through the house, while at the same time, I imagine the energy of the march, the hope in everyone\u2019s eyes. I feel torn, pulled in two directions by people I care about and causes I believe in. The weight of their expectations presses on me, and I stand frozen, keys in one hand, protest sign in the other, unable to move."}
