They mentioned, almost in passing, that they\u2019d had a rough meeting at work yesterday. I could tell there was more beneath the surface, but I was distracted. Today is the only morning I can swing by home to grab my passport\u2014the only valid ID I have for voting. The polls are open tomorrow, but I\u2019ll be out of town for work. My spouse expects me to listen, to be present, to ask about their day and show I care. But my mind keeps drifting to the logistics of voting, the importance of my voice in this election, and the fear of missing my only chance. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me for not being fully there for my partner, yet anxious about failing my civic duty. The clock ticks, and I wrestle with the weight of both roles, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
