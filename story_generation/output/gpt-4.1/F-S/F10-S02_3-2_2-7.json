Mom\u2019s name flashes on the screen, her usual morning call. I know she expects me to answer, to tell her about my day, to reassure her that I\u2019m eating well and not overworking myself. We talk every morning, without fail. But today, my mind is racing with talking points and statistics\u2014I\u2019m about to go live on air, representing my activist group, hoping to reach hundreds of listeners and maybe change a few minds. The producer waves at me, signaling two minutes left. My phone vibrates again, a message from Dad: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you yet.\u201d Guilt twists in my stomach. I want to be the daughter who never lets them worry, but I also want to be the activist who never misses a chance to speak out. My hands tremble as I stare at the phone, torn between the comfort of family and the urgency of my cause, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
