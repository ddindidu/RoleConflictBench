My spouse sat across from me, concern etched on their face. We\u2019d agreed to be open about everything, especially big decisions like our finances and health. I knew we needed to talk about the medical bills piling up and whether we could afford the new treatment my spouse needed. But just as I was about to start the conversation, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. As a citizen, I felt a duty to help out, especially since I\u2019d organized the tax paperwork early and could spare the time. But my spouse was expecting my full attention tonight, to talk honestly and work through our worries together. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I stay and have the hard conversation, or go help at the clinic, knowing the community was counting on volunteers like me? My heart pounded as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
