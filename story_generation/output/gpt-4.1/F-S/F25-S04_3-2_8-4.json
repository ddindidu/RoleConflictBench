His eyes were red, and he looked smaller than usual. He started talking about how overwhelmed he felt since losing his job, how he worried about Mom and me, and how he didn\u2019t know what to do next. I could see he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the steady one for once. But all I could think about was the voter ID card sitting in my desk drawer upstairs. Today was the only time I could grab it before the polls closed tomorrow, and I knew how important it was to vote\u2014my friends and family expected me to do my civic duty. I felt torn, standing there, nodding as my stepdad poured his heart out, my mind racing with the fear of missing my one chance to get my ID. I wanted to be the supportive stepchild he needed, but the clock was ticking, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility waiting for me outside this kitchen."}
