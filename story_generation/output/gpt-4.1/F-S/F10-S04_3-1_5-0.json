It\u2019s a role my grandmother once held, and now, it\u2019s my turn to honor our family\u2019s traditions. I know how much this means to everyone\u2014especially to my parents, who have always taught me that our customs are sacred. But as I rehearse the words I\u2019ll say, my phone buzzes with a reminder: today is election day. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, to have a say in the future I want. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, but the ceremony will take hours, and my family expects me to stay until the very end. I feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, while my own sense of civic duty tugs in the opposite direction. My heart pounds as I try to figure out how to be both the daughter my family needs and the citizen I want to be."}
