My client\u2019s case was complicated, and I\u2019d spent weeks preparing every detail, knowing how much was at stake for them. As an advocate, I owed them my full attention and the sharpest representation I could offer. But across from me, my spouse waited, eyes searching mine, the air thick with the weight of our unfinished conversation. We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about the choices we had to make together\u2014choices that demanded honesty and patience. I could see the expectation in their face: to be present, to communicate openly, to share my worries and listen to theirs. Yet my mind kept drifting to the legal arguments I still needed to refine, the evidence I had to review. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my client and the promise I\u2019d made to my partner to always be transparent. My heart pounded as I tried to find the words, knowing that whatever I said next would shape both my marriage and my client\u2019s future."}
