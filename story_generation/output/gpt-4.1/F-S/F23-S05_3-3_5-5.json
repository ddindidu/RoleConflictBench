My heart pounded, torn between the stern voice in my head\u2014reminding me that as his step-parent, I needed to teach him right from wrong\u2014and the urgent buzz of my phone in my pocket. It was my client\u2019s mother, calling again. The trial was tomorrow, and I was their advocate, the one person standing between them and a future forever changed. I could hear my stepson\u2019s shaky breath, see the fear in his eyes, and I knew he needed me to guide him, to show him consequences and compassion. But my client needed me too, needed my focus and preparation, my unwavering attention. The store manager was approaching, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s trust, my professional duty\u2014each demanding all of me, right now. I took a deep breath, feeling the impossible pull, knowing that whatever I chose, something would be left undone."}
