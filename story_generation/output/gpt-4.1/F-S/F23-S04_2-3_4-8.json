I know I should stop him\u2014teach him about respect and discipline, like I promised his father I would. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes, and I still need to vote. I rush to the front, dragging my stepson by the hand, only to be told by the election official that there\u2019s a registration mismatch. I have to fill out a provisional ballot form, and it\u2019s a long process. The official\u2019s eyes are stern, expecting me to comply immediately. My stepson tugs at my sleeve, restless and bored, and I can feel the stares of other shoppers. I\u2019m torn\u2014do I kneel down and correct his behavior, risking my chance to vote, or do I focus on the paperwork, letting his wildness go unchecked? My heart pounds as I try to balance the weight of being a good parent and a responsible citizen, knowing I can\u2019t fully satisfy both at this moment."}
