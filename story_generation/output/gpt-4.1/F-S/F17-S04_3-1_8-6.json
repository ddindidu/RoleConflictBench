The official\u2019s voice echoed, \u201cA\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B, so I hesitated, glancing at the new, longer line. I wanted to follow the rules, but the original line was moving so much faster. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a text from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad\u2019s having a hard day.\u201d I knew what that meant\u2014she needed me, needed my calm words and steady presence. I felt the weight of her expectation, the way she leaned on me when things got tough at home. But here, I was a voter, expected to obey the officials, to do my civic duty properly.
