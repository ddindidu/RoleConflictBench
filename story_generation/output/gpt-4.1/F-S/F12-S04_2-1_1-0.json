He looked up at me, eyes clouded with worry, and told me about the difficult choice he had to make at work\u2014one that could change the course of his career. He needed me, not just to listen, but to help him sort through his options, to reassure him that whatever he chose, I\u2019d be by his side. I wanted to give him my full attention, to be the supportive wife he deserved.\n\nBut today is also Election Day. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, so there\u2019s no real excuse not to go. I know how important it is to vote, to have my voice heard, especially in this election. I feel the weight of civic duty pressing on me, the expectation that I\u2019ll show up and do my part.\n\nAs I sit across from my husband, I feel torn. If I leave now to vote, I might miss the moment he needs me most. If I stay, I risk letting my civic responsibility slide. My heart aches as I wrestle with these conflicting demands, unsure which role to honor first."}
