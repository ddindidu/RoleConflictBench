It was my younger sister, her voice trembling on the other end. \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk. It\u2019s about what happened last night.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that only a brother would recognize. I knew I should be there for her, to listen and help us work through the argument that had left us both raw. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d talk things out, build trust, never let misunderstandings fester.\n\nBut as I glanced at my watch, my heart pounded. The hearing was in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client depended on me to be there, prepared and on time. The judge had warned us: any delay could jeopardize the entire case. My absence would be unprofessional, maybe even disastrous.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the urgent call of family and the unyielding demands of my profession. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, unable to move in either direction."}
