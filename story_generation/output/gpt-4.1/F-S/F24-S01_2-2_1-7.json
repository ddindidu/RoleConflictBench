My stepbrother, Ethan, trudged in, his shoulders hunched and eyes red. He barely glanced at me before heading to his room, but I could feel the weight of his sadness. As his step-sibling, I knew I should go after him, sit with him, and let him talk about whatever happened at school. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014always be there, especially on the hard days.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone must arrive on time and review the new safety procedures before starting.\u201d Last week, she\u2019d emphasized how crucial it was to follow the updated steps, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down or risk anyone\u2019s safety. I stood in the hallway, torn between the closed door behind which Ethan needed me, and the responsibility waiting for me at the community center. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which role I was supposed to choose, feeling the pressure of both expectations closing in on me."}
