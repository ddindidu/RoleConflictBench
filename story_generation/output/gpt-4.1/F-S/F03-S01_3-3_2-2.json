I glanced at the screen\u2014three unread messages from Mom. She always wanted to know how I slept, what I\u2019d had for breakfast, and if I was feeling okay. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d check in every morning, and she expected a real conversation, not just a quick \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But I was already running late for my volunteer shift at the community center. Today, I was the only one with the keys, and I knew there\u2019d be a line of people waiting for the doors to open. The thought of them standing in the cold made my stomach twist. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my parents\u2019 need for connection, the community\u2019s need for service. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a thoughtful reply and sprinting the last block to the center. The pressure built inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
