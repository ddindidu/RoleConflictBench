My little brother wanted to go hiking, Mom suggested a movie night, and Dad was already making a grocery list. I knew they expected me to join in, to help plan and be part of whatever we decided. But my mind kept drifting to the envelope on my desk upstairs\u2014my only valid ID, which I needed to bring to the polling station tomorrow. I\u2019d forgotten it at home, and this morning was my only window to go back and get it before work. If I left now, I\u2019d miss out on the family discussion, maybe even disappoint them by not being present. But if I stayed, I risked not being able to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d do this year. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
