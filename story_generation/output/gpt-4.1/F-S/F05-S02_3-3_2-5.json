The vote was happening in less than an hour\u2014a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and now it all came down to one undecided representative. My hands trembled as I scrolled through the talking points, ready to make the call that could tip the scales. But beside me, my wife\u2019s eyes were red and swollen. She\u2019d barely spoken all morning, her world unraveling after the news about her father\u2019s health. She reached for my hand, her grip desperate, wordlessly asking me to stay, to listen, to just be there. I could feel her need for comfort, for my undivided attention, and I wanted nothing more than to hold her and promise everything would be okay. But the phone kept buzzing, the group\u2019s expectations echoing in my mind. I was torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demand urgent, each role vital. I stared at the phone, then at her, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
