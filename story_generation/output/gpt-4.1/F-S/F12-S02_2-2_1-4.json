His eyes were tired, searching mine for reassurance as he explained the impossible choice his boss had given him. He needed me\u2014needed my advice, my comfort, the kind of support only I could give. I reached for his hand, ready to listen, when my phone buzzed. It was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. The message was clear: \u201cI have ten minutes to talk about the bill\u2014can you speak now?\u201d My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist, a chance to make real change. But my husband\u2019s voice trembled as he asked, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I could see the weight on his shoulders, feel the expectation to be present, to be his anchor. Yet, the phone in my hand felt just as heavy, filled with the hopes of everyone counting on me to fight for our cause. I looked from his anxious face to the glowing screen, torn between the two worlds that needed me, both right now."}
