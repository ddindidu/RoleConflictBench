Call us when you get a chance.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, so I quickly text back, \u201cAll good, love you!\u201d But I can almost hear her voice, wishing for a real conversation. I glance at the clock\u2014today\u2019s the last day to vote, and I promised myself I\u2019d go early. I grab my bag, but as I\u2019m about to leave, I realize my driver\u2019s license isn\u2019t in my wallet. I remember it\u2019s in the drawer at my parents\u2019 house, just a short drive away. I could go there, see them, and pick it up, but I also have my passport here, which is valid for voting. If I use the passport, I\u2019ll have time to vote and get on with my day, but I\u2019ll miss the chance to see my parents face-to-face, something they\u2019ve been hinting at for weeks. I stand in the hallway, torn between being the dutiful daughter who visits and the responsible voter who gets things done efficiently, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
