My partner trusted me to keep us afloat, and I felt the weight of that responsibility every day. I\u2019d been cutting corners, skipping small luxuries, and planning every dollar, knowing that in two months, the bank would expect its due. \n\nMy phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply room at the shelter, mentioning it would be helpful if someone could take the initiative\u2014if time allowed. I knew she meant me. I\u2019d always been the reliable one, the one who followed through. But reorganizing would take hours, hours I\u2019d planned to spend reviewing our finances and maybe picking up an extra shift. \n\nI stared at the email, feeling the familiar tug-of-war inside me. My family needed me to be practical, to focus on our future. The shelter needed me to be present, to go the extra mile. I closed my eyes, torn between the two worlds, unsure which one I could afford to let down."}
