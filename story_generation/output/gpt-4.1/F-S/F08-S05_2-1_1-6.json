Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the weight she carried, the silent plea for comfort and guidance. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to set everything aside, to share stories of my own struggles and reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. She needed me to listen, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, a sharp reminder of my other life. The advocacy group\u2019s meeting was in twenty minutes, and my attendance was not just expected\u2014it was required. These meetings shaped the outcomes of cases I cared deeply about, and punctuality was a mark of my commitment. I glanced at the clock, feeling the familiar tug-of-war inside me. My granddaughter\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for answers, just as my colleagues would soon be searching for my presence. The demands of both worlds pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the call of family and the call of duty, my heart aching with the impossibility of being fully present in both roles at once."}
