We\u2019re in the middle of a serious talk about our finances\u2014she wants to know everything, every detail, and I know she expects me to be open, to lay it all out so we can make decisions together. My phone buzzes with a reminder: polls close in two hours. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I\u2019d do my part as a citizen, but the conversation with my wife is nowhere near finished. She\u2019s waiting for answers, for reassurance that I\u2019m not hiding anything, and I can feel the weight of her trust pressing on me. At the same time, the thought of missing my chance to vote gnaws at me. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demand my full attention. My heart pounds as I try to listen to her, but my mind keeps drifting to the ticking clock and the polling station across town. I want to be the husband she needs, but I also want to be the responsible voter I believe I should be."}
