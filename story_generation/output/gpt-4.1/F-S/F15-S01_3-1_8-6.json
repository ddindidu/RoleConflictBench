The numbers glared at me\u2014our home loan repayment was due in two months, and every dollar counted. I needed to find ways to save, maybe even pick up extra shifts at work. My mind buzzed with worry about keeping us afloat, about making sure my kids never felt the weight of my anxiety.\n\nJust then, my phone chimed. It was an email from the volunteer coordinator at the food pantry. She\u2019d sent a brief suggestion: if I had time during my next shift, could I reorganize the supply shelves according to a new system? She said it would help everyone, but only if I could manage it. I knew the pantry relied on volunteers to keep things running smoothly, and I wanted to do my part. But the thought of spending extra time there\u2014time I could use to work more hours or plan our finances\u2014made my chest tighten.\n\nI stared at the email, torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of the volunteer team, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
