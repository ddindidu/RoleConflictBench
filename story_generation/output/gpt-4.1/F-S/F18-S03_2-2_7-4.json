I promised myself I\u2019d watch, stay informed, and maybe even submit a question about the new park proposal. Civic engagement matters to me\u2014I want to be the kind of citizen who pays attention and speaks up. But as I open my laptop, I hear the clatter of wheels in the driveway. My little brother is outside, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp with a determined glint. He\u2019s been talking about this new skateboard trick for days, and I know he\u2019s going to try it now, alone. I\u2019m torn. As his sibling, I should be out there, making sure he\u2019s safe, ready to help if he falls. But as a citizen, I feel the pull to participate, to listen, to contribute to the community discussion. My heart pounds as I hover between the door and the screen, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, unsure which one I can let go of, even for a moment."}
