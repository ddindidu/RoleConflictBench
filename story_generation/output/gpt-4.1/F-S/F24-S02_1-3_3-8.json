My stepsister grinned at me, nudging my arm, and my mom looked hopeful\u2014she\u2019d been trying to get us all together more often. I knew they wanted me to say yes, to be present, to help us feel like a real family. Just as I opened my mouth to agree, my phone buzzed. It was the news network. They needed me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019d poured my heart into. My activist friends were counting on me to speak up, to educate, to not let this moment slip by. I felt my stomach twist. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint my family\u2014again. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down everyone who believed in me and the movement. My mom\u2019s eyes met mine, full of expectation, while my phone vibrated insistently in my hand. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
