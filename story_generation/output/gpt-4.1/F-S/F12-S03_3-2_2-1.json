It helps.\u201d I know how much he needs me right now\u2014my presence, my comfort, the familiar melodies that soothe his anxiety. But as I reached for the speaker, I remembered the building\u2019s strict quiet hours. It\u2019s already past ten, and our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open.

My husband\u2019s eyes pleaded with me, desperate for relief, while my mind raced with the knowledge that breaking the rules could disturb others and even get us fined.

The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the person my husband needed and the citizen I was expected to be."}
