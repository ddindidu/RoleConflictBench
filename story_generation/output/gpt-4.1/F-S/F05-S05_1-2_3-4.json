My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cWe agreed to share the chores, remember?\u201d\u2014and I know she\u2019s right. She\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d handle the laundry this time. But my phone buzzes again, and I see another email from my client. Their hearing is tomorrow, and the case is complicated\u2014property disputes, custody battles, lives in the balance. They\u2019re counting on me to be prepared, to fight for them with everything I have. I glance at the clock, feeling the hours slip away. If I fold the laundry now, I\u2019ll lose precious time to review the case files. If I dive into work, the laundry will sit there, another broken promise at home. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014be a reliable partner, be a dedicated advocate. Both roles demand my best, but tonight, I can\u2019t give both what they deserve."}
