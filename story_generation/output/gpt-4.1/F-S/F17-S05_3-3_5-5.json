Our traditions have always been the glue holding us together, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially my grandparents. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my client was scheduled for the same day. As an advocate, I\u2019d spent months preparing, knowing that my client\u2019s future depended on my presence and performance in court. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014my family expecting me to honor our heritage, my client relying on me for justice. I could feel the tension building inside, torn between the duty to my roots and the responsibility to someone who had placed their trust in me. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
