It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked if she could come over. She needed to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about something that was weighing on her heart. As her grandmother, I knew how important it was to be there, to listen, to offer the kind of guidance only years of living can provide. But as an advocate, I had a client depending on me to be present and prepared at a crucial court session. The judge would not look kindly on tardiness, and my client\u2019s future could hinge on my punctuality and focus. My heart ached as I looked at the clock, feeling the pull of both worlds. My granddaughter\u2019s trust in me, her need for comfort, pressed against the professional duty I owed to someone else\u2019s life and liberty. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two calls, each demanding my full presence, each impossible to ignore."}
