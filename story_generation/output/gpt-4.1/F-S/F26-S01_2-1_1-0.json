I could tell something was weighing on her, something more than just a tough math problem. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she might need, to remind her that she\u2019s not alone and that things will get better. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. My volunteer shift at the community center started in twenty minutes, and I was expected to be there on time, as always. I knew the other volunteers could cover for me if I was a little late, but I also knew how much reliability mattered in our work. I felt torn, caught between the pull to be the steady presence Emma needed and the commitment I\u2019d made to my team. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
