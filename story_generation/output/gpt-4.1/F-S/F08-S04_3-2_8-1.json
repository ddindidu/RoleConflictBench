It was already late afternoon, and I still had groceries to put away. My phone buzzed\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She rarely called during the day, so I answered, only to hear her voice trembling. My grandson was in trouble, and she needed someone to talk to, someone to help her figure out what to do next. I listened, offering comfort, but my mind kept drifting to the voting slip on the kitchen table. Polls would close in just a couple of hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, no matter what. My family always expected me to be the steady one, the person who checked in, who listened, who was there. But my civic duty tugged at me too\u2014what kind of example would I set if I let this chance slip by? I could hear the pain in my daughter\u2019s voice, but the clock kept ticking, and I felt torn in two, pulled by love and responsibility, unsure which role to honor first."}
