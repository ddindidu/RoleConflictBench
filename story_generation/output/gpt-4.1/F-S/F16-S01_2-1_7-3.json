I could tell something was weighing on their mind, so I asked gently, \u201cIs everything okay at work?\u201d They hesitated, then began sharing their worries about a difficult colleague and the stress it was causing. I listened, offering comfort, but my own thoughts kept drifting. Earlier that day, while volunteering at the community center, I\u2019d had a casual chat with a client who mentioned feeling isolated at work\u2014nothing too personal, but it echoed my spouse\u2019s situation eerily.\n\nNow, as my spouse opened up, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to be honest and supportive, to share everything on my mind as we always promised. But I also knew I was expected to respect the privacy of those I helped as a volunteer, even if the details seemed harmless. The urge to connect the dots and offer insight was strong, but so was the responsibility to keep confidences. I found myself caught between the trust of my spouse and the trust of those I volunteered to help, unsure which expectation should guide my next words."}
