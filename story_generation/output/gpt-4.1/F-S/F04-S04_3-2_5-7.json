Mom\u2019s counting on you to help with the decorations.\u201d Today was our family\u2019s big holiday celebration, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories, just like every year. But I was also at the polling station, ballot in hand, ready to vote for the first time. The poll worker frowned at my envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the signature smudged. Please re-sign here, exactly as before, or your vote might not count.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down. My family needed me, but so did my civic duty. The poll worker\u2019s eyes were patient but firm, while my phone kept buzzing with reminders of my brotherly role.
