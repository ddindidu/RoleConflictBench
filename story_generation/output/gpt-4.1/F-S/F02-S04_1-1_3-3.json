She grinned, wiping her face, and I felt that familiar surge of pride\u2014teaching her these small lessons felt so important. Just then, my phone buzzed: a reminder to bring my ID to the polling station. I checked my wallet and realized I\u2019d left my main ID in my office drawer. I had a backup card, but it was buried somewhere in the cluttered study, and I\u2019d need to search for it.\n\nMy daughter tugged my sleeve, asking if I\u2019d help her practice saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I could fetch my main ID and vote early, but I\u2019d miss this morning\u2019s chance to guide her. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk a rushed, stressful search for the backup card later. The weight of being a good father pressed against my duty as a responsible voter, and I sat there, torn, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
