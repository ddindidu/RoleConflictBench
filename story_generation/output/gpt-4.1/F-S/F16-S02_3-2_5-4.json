My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, \u201cCan you help me with the guest room? They\u2019ll be here in two hours!\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. The house was still a mess, and we\u2019d promised each other to make a good impression on the relatives. Just as I picked up the vacuum, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. \u201cI have ten minutes now to discuss your proposal,\u201d she said briskly. My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist, a chance to push for real change. But my partner was counting on me, and the house was far from ready. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call to action and the promise I\u2019d made at home, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
