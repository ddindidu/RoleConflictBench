The vote was happening in less than an hour, and I was the one who had built a relationship with the undecided representative. They needed me to call, to make the case one last time, to maybe tip the scales. But across from me, my husband\u2019s face was drawn and anxious. He\u2019d just come home, voice trembling as he described the impossible choice his boss had given him\u2014take on a project that could mean a promotion, but at the cost of his values. He needed me, needed my full attention, my support, my advice. I could see it in his eyes, the way he reached for my hand. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the partner he could lean on, but I also knew what was at stake if I didn\u2019t act now. The phone vibrated again. I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible demands of love and duty."}
