Today is the anniversary of my great-grandfather\u2019s passing, and my family expects me to help prepare the altar and join the prayers, just as we do every year. My mother reminded me last night, \u201cIt\u2019s important to honor our traditions. Your presence means a lot.\u201d But as I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember, we need everyone here right at 9 a.m. sharp. We can\u2019t start without you.\u201d The shelter\u2019s roster is tight today, and I know how much they rely on me. My heart pounded as I looked between the family altar and my volunteer uniform. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each one pulling me in a different direction. I wanted to be the devoted child my family hoped for, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the people who counted on me at the shelter. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which door I would walk through."}
