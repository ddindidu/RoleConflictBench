I really need you.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when things got tough. But before I could even reply, my other phone rang. It was the media coordinator from our activist group\u2014CNN wanted me on air in twenty minutes to address a wave of misinformation about our cause. This was the moment we\u2019d been preparing for, the chance to reach millions and set the record straight. My heart pounded as I stared at both screens. My sister needed me, maybe more than ever, but so did the movement I\u2019d poured my soul into. I felt torn in two, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be the brother she could count on, but I also knew how much my voice mattered right now. I stood frozen, caught between the pull of family and the call to fight for something bigger, not knowing which way to turn."}
