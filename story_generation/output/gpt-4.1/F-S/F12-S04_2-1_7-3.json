As his wife, I knew I should sit down, ask him what was wrong, and really listen. We\u2019d promised each other to communicate openly, especially when something was weighing us down. But as I reached for the kettle, I remembered today was voting day. I\u2019d planned to go early, but in my rush, I\u2019d left my main ID on the hallway table. I could use another card, but it was in my office across town. I could still fetch it later, but the lines would be longer, and I might not make it back in time for dinner. My husband looked up, eyes searching mine, clearly wanting to talk. I felt torn\u2014should I sit and be the supportive wife he needed, or should I leave now to fulfill my civic duty as a voter, making sure I had the right identification? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the roles I was supposed to play."}
