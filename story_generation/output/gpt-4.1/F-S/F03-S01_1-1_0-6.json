I know it\u2019s probably Mom or Dad\u2014they always text on weekends, just to check in. I promised I\u2019d keep in touch, especially since I moved out last year. But the volunteer coordinator just sent an email, suggesting we reorganize the supply shelves if we have extra time. I glance at the clock; my shift ends in an hour, and the shelves are a mess. I want to do a good job here, to show I\u2019m reliable and can follow through on suggestions. But my parents expect a reply, even if it\u2019s just a quick \u201cI\u2019m good, love you.\u201d I feel the pressure building\u2014if I stop to text, I\u2019ll lose precious minutes, but if I ignore my parents, I\u2019ll feel guilty for not keeping my promise. My hands hover over my phone, torn between being the dependable son and the committed volunteer, wishing I could be both at once."}
