My husband had an early meeting tomorrow, and my daughter needed her uniform for a school event. I\u2019d told them I\u2019d handle the laundry tonight. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a client, frantic, her message urgent: a legal deadline had shifted, and she needed my advice now to avoid a costly mistake. As an advocate, I knew how much she depended on me for clarity and swift action. My mind raced, torn between the pile of clothes and the blinking phone. Both roles demanded my full attention, both equally important in different ways. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from all sides\u2014my family\u2019s trust in me as a partner, my client\u2019s trust in me as her advocate. My heart pounded as I stood in the laundry room, caught between the hum of the washing machine and the insistent ring of responsibility."}
