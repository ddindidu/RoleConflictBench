This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, and educate them about the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. I know I should jump in, add more information, answer questions, keep the momentum going. But just as I\u2019m about to type, my sister\u2019s voice cracks from the other room. She\u2019s been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her. She needs me now, not as an activist, but as her sister\u2014someone to listen, to comfort, to support her through this mess. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, the urgent pull of my responsibility to the movement and the quiet, desperate need of the person I love most. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the glowing screen and the closed door, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
