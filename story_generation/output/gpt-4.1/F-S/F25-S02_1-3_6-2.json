The police had begun blocking the exits, their presence suddenly more than just a backdrop to our protest. My phone buzzed with his reply, a simple, \u201cWe\u2019re fine, but your mom\u2019s been quiet lately. Can we talk tonight?\u201d I felt the weight of his words, the unspoken request for me to be present, to listen, to be the glue holding our patchwork family together. But right now, my activist group needed me. People were looking to me for direction, waiting for me to help coordinate a safe exit, to keep everyone calm and organized. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention\u2014one hand on my phone, the other waving to get my friends\u2019 attention. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my family\u2019s need for reassurance and my responsibility to the people here, both urgent, both impossible to ignore."}
