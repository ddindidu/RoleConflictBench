Just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She never called during work hours unless it was serious. I hesitated, torn, as the poll worker noticed a smudge on my envelope and asked me to re-sign it to ensure my vote would count. I knew the rules: follow every instruction, no distractions, no phone use in the polling area. But my sister\u2019s voice in my head was urgent, reminding me of our promise to always be there for each other, especially when things got tough.

I stared at the envelope, my phone vibrating again, caught between the rules of the polling place and the unspoken rules of family."}
