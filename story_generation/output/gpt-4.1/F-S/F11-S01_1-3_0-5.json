I\u2019d been trained to keep everything I saw and heard within these walls to myself. But as I flipped through the folders, my heart skipped when I saw my sister\u2019s name. She\u2019d just gotten a big promotion at work, and we were supposed to celebrate tonight. I knew she\u2019d want me to be happy for her, to support her, and to share in her joy. But now, holding her medical file, I felt a knot in my stomach. There was something here she hadn\u2019t told me\u2014something serious. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the sister who should be there for her, and the volunteer who must keep this secret. My hands trembled as I closed the file, torn between the urge to protect her and the duty to respect her privacy."}
