The principal\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYour child was caught bullying another student.\u201d As a parent, I knew I had to address this, to show up for the meeting, to guide him toward kindness and responsibility. But as we strolled, he unwrapped a snack and, without thinking, tossed the wrapper onto the grass, right beneath a bright no-littering sign. I froze. As a citizen, I believe in respecting public spaces and following the rules. I wanted to correct him, to insist he pick it up and use the trash bin just a few steps away. But I also worried\u2014if I scolded him now, would it make him defensive before the school meeting? Would it push him further away when I needed to reach him most? The expectations pressed in from both sides: to be a good parent, to be a responsible citizen. I stood there, torn, the wrapper lying between us, unsure which role to answer first."}
