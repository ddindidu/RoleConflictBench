She smiled, but I could tell something was off. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, and she nodded, launching into a story about a difficult meeting and a coworker who\u2019d been less than kind. I listened, trying to be present, to offer the comfort she deserved. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the activist group. The petition to push for the new policy was closing in minutes, and my signature, as a local organizer, was expected. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 voices: \u201cWe need every leader\u2019s name on this.\u201d My wife\u2019s voice faded into the background as I wrestled with the urge to pull out my phone and sign, knowing she needed my full attention. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014her need for support, their need for action. I stood there, torn, the seconds ticking by, unsure which demand to answer first."}
