My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids at 3:00\u2014last day of school!\u201d I pictured their faces, eager and searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. But then, an email notification flashed across my screen: \u201cBallot measure voting closes at 5:00 PM\u2014make your voice heard!\u201d The measure would directly impact our neighborhood, and I\u2019d spent weeks reading up, talking with neighbors, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a citizen. I knew my vote mattered, that I should show up, participate, and set an example. But the polling place was in the opposite direction from the school, and traffic at this hour was always a nightmare. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my children\u2019s eyes against the guilt of neglecting my civic duty. Both roles demanded my presence, my time, my care. I sat frozen, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
