The polling station closes in ten minutes, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year. But as I grab my keys, I hear my stepbrother\u2019s voice from his room\u2014shaky, on the verge of tears. His final exam is tomorrow, and he\u2019s been spiraling all week. I know he needs me; we promised to be there for each other, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through as a blended family. I hover in the hallway, torn. If I leave now, I might make it to the station in time, fulfilling my duty as a voter. But if I go, I\u2019ll be abandoning him when he\u2019s most vulnerable, breaking the trust we\u2019ve worked so hard to build. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cLast chance to vote!\u201d My stepbrother\u2019s muffled sobs drift through the door. I stand frozen, keys in hand, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me, unsure which one I\u2019m about to break."}
