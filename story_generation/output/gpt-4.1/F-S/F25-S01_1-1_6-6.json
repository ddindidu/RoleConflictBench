She\u2019d suggested that, if I had time after my usual shift, I could reorganize the supply closet to make things easier for everyone. I knew she\u2019d appreciate it if I took the initiative, and I wanted to show I was reliable. But just as I was about to reply, my stepdad walked in, looking tired. I remembered how Mom had mentioned he\u2019d been stressed lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more often. \u201cEverything okay at work?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but he just shrugged and mumbled something about a long day. I could feel the tension in the room, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d be there for him and Mom, especially since things had been rough between them. My mind raced\u2014should I stay and talk, or head out to the community center and help with the supplies? Both roles pulled at me, each expecting something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
