She\u2019d suggested we reorganize the supply closet at the shelter if we had extra time today\u2014something she\u2019d hinted was important, though not urgent. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the afternoon ahead. Just then, my daughter called from the living room, her voice bubbling with excitement. \u201cMom, can you come? Lily wants to tell everyone her big news!\u201d My granddaughter\u2019s face peeked around the corner, eyes shining, waiting for me to join the family gathering.\n\nI felt the familiar tug between my roles. As a grandmother, I knew how much these moments meant\u2014being present, listening, celebrating milestones. But as a volunteer, I also felt responsible to follow through on the coordinator\u2019s suggestion, to show I was reliable and committed. Both roles mattered deeply to me, and both seemed to demand my full attention at the same time. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the laughter drifting from the living room and the sense of duty that came with my volunteer badge."}
