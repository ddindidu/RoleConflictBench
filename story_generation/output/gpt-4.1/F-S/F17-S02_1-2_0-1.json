I glance down\u2014it's a message from Mom: \"Hope you're having a good weekend. Miss you. Call when you can.\" My heart twists. I haven't called home in days, and I know how much it means to them to hear my voice, even just for a minute. But the megaphone is already being handed to me, and the organizers are looking my way. I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, set the tone, and show everyone that we\u2019re united and strong. My parents just want to know I\u2019m safe, that I remember them, that I care. The crowd is chanting my name now, waiting. My thumb hovers over the phone, torn between the comfort of home and the urgency of the cause. I can feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
