As a step-parent, I knew how much my family depended on me to keep things afloat, especially now with the loan due in just two months. Every dollar mattered, and I\u2019d been carefully planning, cutting corners, and working extra hours to make sure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. My phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive. The community service I volunteered for was at risk of being shut down unless we all followed new, mandatory procedures\u2014procedures that would require more of my time and strict adherence to their guidelines. I could hear my partner in the next room, talking to the kids about summer plans, and I felt torn. The coordinator\u2019s expectations were clear, and I didn\u2019t want to let down the people who relied on our service. But every hour I spent volunteering was an hour I couldn\u2019t use to earn extra money or plan for the loan. My mind raced, caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my commitment to the community, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
