My son bounced into the room, eyes shining. \u201cMom, is today the day? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo after your next paycheck!\u201d His excitement tugged at me, but I knew our budget was tight. I wanted to keep my promise, to give him something special, but I also needed to make sure we had enough for groceries and bills.\n\nLater, at the community center, I poured coffee for the other volunteers. The conversation turned to the families we were helping. Someone asked about a woman I\u2019d visited last week. \u201cShe seemed so down. Did she say why?\u201d I hesitated, feeling the weight of their curiosity and my responsibility to protect her privacy. I wanted to connect with my fellow volunteers, to share and be part of the group, but I knew I couldn\u2019t betray the trust of those we served.\n\nAs I sat there, my mind raced between my son\u2019s hopeful face and the expectant eyes of my peers, feeling the pressure of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
