This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate thousands, maybe more, if I can just add the right comment now. But as I start typing, my son tugs at my sleeve, his eyes wide with hope. \u201cDid you get the Nintendo, Mom? You promised.\u201d I remember the look on his face last week, the excitement in his voice. I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to it, and I know how tight money is this month. I promised him, and I want to keep that promise. But if I don\u2019t seize this moment online, the momentum for my cause might fade. My heart pounds as I weigh the cost of the Nintendo against the fleeting window of attention for my activism. Both roles demand my full attention, and I feel myself pulled in two, unable to let either go."}
