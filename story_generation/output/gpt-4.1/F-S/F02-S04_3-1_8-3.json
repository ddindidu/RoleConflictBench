The home loan repayment was looming, and I needed to make sure every cent was accounted for. As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my family depended on me to keep a roof over our heads. I checked my wallet, counting the cash and cards, making a mental note to skip any unnecessary expenses this month. \n\nBut today was also election day. As a voter, I knew I had to bring valid identification to the polling station. I had my driver\u2019s license, but my passport and other IDs were tucked away in a drawer at home. The polling place was across town, and I\u2019d planned to go before work, but if I forgot the right ID, I\u2019d have to come back later, losing precious time I could spend working overtime or searching for side gigs to help with the loan.\n\nThe expectations clashed in my mind\u2014should I risk the extra trip and lose time I desperately needed for my family\u2019s financial security, or should I focus on my duties as a citizen and make sure my vote counted? The pressure from both sides left me standing in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move."}
