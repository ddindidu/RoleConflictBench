My sister\u2019s text had just come through: \u201cI need you. Please call me.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I could picture her, alone in her apartment, probably crying. I wanted to run to her, to be the sister she could always count on, just like we promised after Mom died.\n\nBut the election official was in front of me, clipboard in hand, explaining that my registration didn\u2019t match. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form,\u201d she said, \u201cand you have ten minutes before we close.\u201d Her tone was firm, and the line behind me was restless. I knew the rules\u2014follow every instruction, don\u2019t hold up the process, do my civic duty.\n\nI stared at the form, my phone buzzing again. My sister needed me now, but so did my responsibility as a voter. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest. I felt torn in two, desperate not to let either role down, but knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
