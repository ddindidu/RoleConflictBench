Today, my stepsister handed me a bright red ribbon, her eyes expectant. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she whispered, nodding toward a low-hanging branch near the path. But right beside it, a city sign glared: \u201cNo Littering. Keep Our Parks Clean.\u201d The trash bin was only a few steps away, a silent invitation to do what I knew was right as a citizen. My heart pounded as my family watched, waiting for me to honor our tradition, while the rules of the city pressed on my conscience. I could feel both sets of expectations tightening around me, each demanding loyalty, each impossible to ignore."}
