I\u2019m really upset about what you said earlier.\u201d My heart sinks. We\u2019d argued this morning\u2014he felt I was too harsh about his lack of interest in my activism, and I\u2019d brushed him off, thinking I\u2019d fix it later. But now, \u201clater\u201d is five minutes before I go live to educate the public about climate justice, something I\u2019ve worked toward for years.
