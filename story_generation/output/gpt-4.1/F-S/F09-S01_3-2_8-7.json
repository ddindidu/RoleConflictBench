My mind raced with calculations\u2014cutting back on groceries, maybe skipping the kids\u2019 extracurriculars, picking up extra shifts at work. The pressure to keep us afloat pressed down on me, heavy and relentless.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a reminder about the new safety steps we\u2019d been briefed on last week. \u201cEveryone must apply them consistently,\u201d she\u2019d emphasized. I knew how important it was\u2014one mistake could put someone at risk. But the extra time and attention these steps required meant I\u2019d have to stay longer at the center, time I desperately needed to sort out our finances and maybe even look for a side job.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My family needed me to be practical, to secure our home. But the people at the center counted on me to be reliable, to follow through on my commitments. I stared at the screen, anxiety twisting in my chest, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
