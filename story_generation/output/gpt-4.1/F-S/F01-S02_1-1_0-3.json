The deadline to sign was minutes away, and as an activist, I knew how much my voice mattered. My phone buzzed with reminders from my group chat\u2014this was the moment to stand up for the policy we\u2019d been fighting for. Just then, my granddaughter slid into the chair beside me, her eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She needed my attention, my stories, my wisdom\u2014everything I\u2019d promised to give as her grandfather. But the clock was ticking, and the petition needed my name. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the urgency of the cause and the quiet plea of the child I loved."}
