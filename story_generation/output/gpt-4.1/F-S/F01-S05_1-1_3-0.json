My grandson had called me yesterday, his voice bubbling with excitement about showing me his new model train set. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture his expectant face. But as I sat at my desk, my phone buzzed with another message\u2014this time from a long-time client, anxious about a sudden legal complication. She wanted to stop by for a quick chat, just to \u201cget a sense\u201d of her options before making any decisions. I knew these casual consultations often led to more questions, and I felt the weight of my responsibility to give her clear, accurate advice, not just generalities. My mind tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family, the trust of my client. I could feel the tension building in my chest, torn between the promise I made to my grandson and the duty I owed to someone relying on my expertise."}
