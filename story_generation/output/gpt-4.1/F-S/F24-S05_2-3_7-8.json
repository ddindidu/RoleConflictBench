As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But he just grinned, already rolling his board to the edge. My phone buzzed\u2014another reminder about the court session. As an advocate, I had to be there, on time, no excuses. The judge had warned me: one more late arrival, and my client\u2019s case could be dismissed. I glanced at my watch, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d make it. But if I stayed, I could stop my stepbrother from doing something reckless. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the courtroom and the ramp, my mind racing as I tried to figure out which responsibility I was about to betray."}
