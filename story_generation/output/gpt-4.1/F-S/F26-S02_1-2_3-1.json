The living room is filled with laughter as my grandchildren chase each other around the coffee table, their parents chatting nearby. Today is our long-awaited family gathering, circled in red on the calendar for weeks. I promised to bake cookies with the kids and listen to my daughter\u2019s stories from work. Yet, my phone buzzes insistently\u2014messages from fellow activists. The protest march, the one we\u2019ve planned for months, is starting in minutes. They need me at the front, leading the first chant, my voice lending strength to our cause. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the expectation to be the loving, present grandparent, and the responsibility to stand up for justice. My hands tremble as I look from the eager faces of my family to the protest sign leaning by the door. I know I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the choice tears at me."}
