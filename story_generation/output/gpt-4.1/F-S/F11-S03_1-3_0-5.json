They\u2019re about to announce the winners!\u201d He\u2019s been working for months on his science project, and today is the awards ceremony at his school. I promised I\u2019d be there, cheering him on, just like he did for me last year. As I grab my keys, I catch a news alert\u2014today is the last day to vote on a ballot measure that will decide whether our block gets a new park or a parking lot. The polling place is only a few blocks away, but it closes in two hours, and I haven\u2019t voted yet. I know how important it is to participate, to have my voice heard as a citizen. But my brother is counting on me, and I can\u2019t bear the thought of him scanning the crowd and not seeing me. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the expectations of being a supportive sister and a responsible citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
