I really need to talk.\u201d He never asks for help unless it\u2019s serious. As his sister, I know I should be there for him, especially when he\u2019s struggling. But today is also the only time I can swing by home to grab my ID before work, and I need it to vote tomorrow. If I miss this window, I won\u2019t be able to participate in the election\u2014something I\u2019ve always believed is my responsibility as a citizen. My brother\u2019s voice sounded shaky on the phone, and I can\u2019t shake the image of him sitting alone, waiting for me. At the same time, I feel the weight of my civic duty pressing on me. I pace the kitchen, torn between the urge to rush to my brother\u2019s side and the knowledge that missing my chance to vote would mean letting down my own values. My heart pounds as I try to figure out which role I can\u2019t afford to let down."}
