Mom looks at me, expecting my input, and I know how much it means to her when we all join in. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that the polling station closes in ten minutes. I glance at the clock, my heart pounding. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the rest of this rare family moment, but if I stay, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. Dad asks for my opinion on the plans, and my sister nudges me, waiting for my answer. I feel their eyes on me, wanting me to be present, to be part of the family. But the weight of my civic duty presses on me, the knowledge that my vote matters. My mind races, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility I have as a citizen. I grip my phone tightly, caught in the space between two worlds, unsure which expectation I should let down."}
