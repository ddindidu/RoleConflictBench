They\u2019d both been so tense lately\u2014work, bills, and the awkwardness of blending our families. I knew they needed me, even if it was just to sit with them, offer a hug, or crack a joke to lighten the mood. But tonight was supposed to be my night. My friends and I had planned a late-evening music session, something we\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks. The only problem was, our building\u2019s quiet hours started at ten, and Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, always left her windows open. She\u2019d complained before about noise, and I knew the rules: as a good citizen, I should respect her right to peace and the building\u2019s regulations. But as a step-child, I felt this pressure to bring some joy home, to show my parents I could be the glue holding us together. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stared at my phone, torn between the expectations of my family and my responsibility to the community."}
