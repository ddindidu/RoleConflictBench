Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant\u2014he\u2019d been trying to include me more, to rebuild the closeness we\u2019d lost over the years. But just as I was about to reply, an email from the volunteer coordinator popped up. The subject line read: \u201cURGENT: Mandatory Procedures\u2014Immediate Action Required.\u201d The message was clear: if we didn\u2019t follow the new guidelines tonight, the service we\u2019d worked so hard to build could be shut down. I could almost hear the coordinator\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of my responsibility to the team and the people we serve. My brother\u2019s expectation for me to show up and be present clashed painfully with the coordinator\u2019s demand for my commitment. My chest tightened as I weighed the disappointment in my brother\u2019s eyes against the trust my team placed in me. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in from all sides."}
