I know I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why we don\u2019t run indoors\u2014how we respect others and follow rules. That\u2019s what a good father does, and I want to be that father. But my mind keeps drifting to the envelope on the kitchen counter at home\u2014my only valid ID. The polls are open tomorrow, but today is the only window I have to grab it before work and errands swallow up my time. If I leave now, I can make it home and back before my next meeting. If I stay, I can teach my son the lesson he needs, but risk missing my chance to vote. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the responsibility to shape my child and the duty to participate in our democracy. My heart pounds as I watch my son, torn between the father I want to be and the citizen I\u2019m expected to be."}
