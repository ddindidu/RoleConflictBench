It was my younger brother, Sam, asking if I could join him and his friends for lunch\u2014something he rarely did. He sounded hopeful, mentioning how he wanted me to meet his new friends and how much it would mean to him. As his sister, I knew how important it was to be included in his life, to show him that I cared and respected his efforts to reach out. But as an advocate, I had a court session scheduled in less than an hour, one that could determine the outcome of my client\u2019s case. The expectation was clear: I needed to be there, on time, prepared. My heart pounded as I stared at Sam\u2019s message, torn between the rare opportunity to strengthen our sibling bond and the professional duty I owed my client. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each carrying its own consequences. I stood frozen in my hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
