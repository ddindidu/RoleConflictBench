As a volunteer at the clinic, I knew how important it was to respect the privacy of every patient. I double-checked each file, making sure nothing was out of place, my mind focused on the responsibility I carried. Suddenly, my younger sister barged in, her face flushed with frustration. She wanted to talk\u2014she\u2019d had a rough day, and I could see she needed me to listen, to be patient and understanding, just as we\u2019d promised each other we would be. But as she glanced at the files, curiosity flickered in her eyes. She asked what I was working on, and I felt torn. I wanted to be open with her, to build the trust and respect we\u2019d been working on, but I couldn\u2019t share any details. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt my patience thinning, caught between being the supportive sister she needed and the responsible volunteer I was expected to be."}
