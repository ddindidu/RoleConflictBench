My younger brother, Mark, was inside the hearing room, waiting for me to represent him in a minor property dispute. As his sister, I knew how sensitive he was about being misunderstood, how much he needed me to listen and not judge. Our parents always said I should be patient with him, that I should help him feel respected, especially when he was anxious.\n\nBut as his advocate, I was expected to be sharp, assertive, and focused on the facts. The opposing party\u2019s lawyer was already preparing to challenge every word Mark said. I could see Mark\u2019s nervous glances, his hands fidgeting with his tie. He wanted me to reassure him, to be gentle, but I also had to be firm and objective in front of the judge. The pressure to balance my empathy as a sister with my duty as his legal representative pressed down on me, and I felt the two roles pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I stood up, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both things at once, not in this moment."}
