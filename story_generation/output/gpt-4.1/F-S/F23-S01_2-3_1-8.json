Tomorrow was the open class at Lily\u2019s school\u2014the first one since I became her step-parent. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on from the back row. I knew how much it meant to her, especially after everything she\u2019d been through. But just as I was about to set a reminder, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cURGENT\u2014All volunteers must be present tomorrow to implement new safety procedures. Non-compliance could mean shutting down the center.\u201d My heart pounded. The center relied on us, and I\u2019d promised to be dependable. I could picture the disappointment in Lily\u2019s face if I missed her big day, but I also imagined the chaos if the center closed, leaving so many people without support. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, caught between the expectations of being a good step-parent and a responsible volunteer."}
