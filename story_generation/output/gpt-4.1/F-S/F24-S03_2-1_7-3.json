He grinned at me, excitement and nerves flickering in his eyes. As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. The ramp was steep, the concrete cracked\u2014one wrong move and he could get seriously hurt. I wanted to tell him to stop, to wait until we found a safer place, but I also didn\u2019t want to crush his confidence.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes was closing soon. As a citizen, I felt responsible to give feedback\u2014my route to school might change, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved in local decisions. But Max was already setting up for his trick, and I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I focus on Max, or take a moment to fill out the survey? My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and my phone, caught in the middle of what I owed to my family and my community."}
