Our kids had soccer games and a birthday party, and everyone needed clean clothes. I\u2019d promised to help more around the house, and I could see the fatigue in my spouse\u2019s eyes after a long week. But as I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community center was running a free vaccine clinic, and they were short on volunteers. I\u2019d already organized our tax documents early, feeling proud to be a responsible citizen, but this was different. The clinic needed help now, and I knew how important it was for our neighborhood\u2019s health. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me at home, but my community needed me, too. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, laundry in one hand, phone in the other, heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
