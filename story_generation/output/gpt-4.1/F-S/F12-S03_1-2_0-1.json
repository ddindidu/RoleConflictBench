He didn\u2019t seem upset, but I could tell he needed a little comfort\u2014maybe a distraction, maybe just my company. He mentioned how music always helped him unwind, and I knew he\u2019d love to play his favorite songs, maybe even dance a little in the living room like we sometimes do. I wanted to be there for him, to help him shake off the stress and feel cared for.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was already past ten. Our building\u2019s quiet hours had started, and I remembered how our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open at night. She\u2019d complained before about noise, and I knew the rules were there for a reason\u2014to respect everyone\u2019s peace. I felt torn, caught between wanting to be the supportive wife my husband needed and the responsible citizen I tried to be. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, and I sat there, music queued up, unsure which part of myself I should honor."}
