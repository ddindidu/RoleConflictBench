My little brother tugged at my sleeve, insisting I help him convince everyone to pick the amusement park. I knew they expected me to join in, to laugh and argue and be part of the plan. But my mind kept drifting back to the polling station earlier that day. I\u2019d been waiting in line to vote, following every instruction, when an official announced that everyone with last names A\u2013M should move to a new line. My last name started with \u201cB,\u201d so I hesitated, glancing at the new line, which was longer and slower. The official\u2019s voice was firm, and I felt the pressure to comply, but I also wanted to get home quickly for family time. Now, as my family looked to me for input, I felt torn\u2014caught between being the reliable sister they expected and the responsible voter who followed every rule. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I could feel my frustration building, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
