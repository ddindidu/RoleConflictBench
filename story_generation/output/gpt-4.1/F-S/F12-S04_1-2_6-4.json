He asks about my day, and I want to tell him everything\u2014how work was overwhelming, how I\u2019m worried about the upcoming vote, how I need to remember to bring my ID from home. But I hesitate. He\u2019s been so stressed lately, and I don\u2019t want to add to his burden. Still, I know he expects me to be open, to share what\u2019s on my mind, just as I expect him to do with me.\n\nAt the same time, I keep glancing at the clock. If I don\u2019t leave soon, I\u2019ll miss my only chance to grab my ID before work. The polls are open tomorrow, but I can\u2019t risk forgetting again. My role as a voter demands responsibility, following the rules, making sure I\u2019m prepared. But my role as a wife tugs at me, urging me to stay, to talk, to be present. The two expectations pull me in opposite directions, and I feel the tension rising in my chest as I try to decide what to do next."}
