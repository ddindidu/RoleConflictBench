My sister was already teasing me about being late, and Dad had made it clear that tonight\u2019s family dinner was important\u2014our first gathering in months. But as I laughed along, my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close at 7 p.m. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, no matter what. Civic duty, I kept telling myself. Yet, here I was, surrounded by family who expected me to be present, not just physically but emotionally, sharing stories and laughter. The polling station was a twenty-minute drive away, and if I left now, I\u2019d miss the main course and probably disappoint everyone. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote, something I\u2019d been passionate about for weeks. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my family against the responsibility I felt as a citizen, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
