She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play and asking if I\u2019d be there to watch. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But this morning, an email from the volunteer coordinator popped up on my phone. She suggested that, if I had time, I could reorganize the supply closet at the community center\u2014something she\u2019d hinted was overdue. I knew she counted on me to set an example for the other volunteers, to be reliable and thorough. My mind raced with the expectations: my daughter\u2019s hopeful face, the coordinator\u2019s trust in me, the sense that both needed me at the same time. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between being the mother my child deserved and the volunteer everyone depended on."}
