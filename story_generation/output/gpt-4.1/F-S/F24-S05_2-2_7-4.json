He grinned, balancing his skateboard at the top of the steep, uneven ramp he\u2019d built himself. \u201cWatch this,\u201d he called, ready to try a trick he\u2019d only seen online. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the urgent call with my client, whose case was teetering on a knife\u2019s edge. They were counting on me to be present, focused, and ready to advocate for them in a dispute that could change their life. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Jamie\u2019s safety in my hands, my client\u2019s trust on the line. My mind raced, torn between running to stop Jamie or stepping away to take the call. The demands clashed inside me, each one shouting for my attention, and I stood frozen, caught in the impossible space between family and duty."}
