My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place for the ballot measure about our block\u2019s safety improvements would close in two hours. I\u2019d researched the issue, talked with neighbors, and felt a responsibility to cast my vote and maybe even speak with the officials there. I could picture my daughter\u2019s hopeful face, waiting for me in her classroom, and at the same time, I felt the weight of my duty as a citizen, knowing my voice mattered for our community. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations\u2014my child\u2019s trust and the community\u2019s future. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure mount as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
