As we spread out our blanket and unpacked sandwiches, laughter filled the air. My youngest granddaughter, giggling, handed me her empty juice box. I noticed the trash bin was a good distance away, and the kids were already tugging at my sleeve, wanting me to join their game. I hesitated, the juice box in my hand. The park had clear no-littering signs, and I\u2019ve always believed in setting a good example as a responsible citizen. But the expectation to be present and attentive as a grandparent pulled at me just as strongly. Should I leave the children for a moment to dispose of the trash properly, or stay and risk sending the wrong message about respecting public spaces? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the joy of family and the duty of citizenship, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
