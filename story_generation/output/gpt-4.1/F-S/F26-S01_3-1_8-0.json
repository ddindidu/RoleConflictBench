My grandson had been in a minor accident\u2014nothing life-threatening, but enough to shake the whole family. She needed me, not just as a mother, but as the steady presence I\u2019ve always tried to be for my grandchildren. I could hear my grandson in the background, sniffling, asking for Grandma. My heart ached to be there, to comfort him, to reassure my daughter that everything would be alright.\n\nBut then I glanced at the clock. My volunteer shift at the food pantry started in less than an hour. I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I also knew how much they counted on my reliability. I\u2019d promised to help with the morning deliveries, and the coordinator had mentioned how much they appreciated my punctuality. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me, but so did the people at the pantry. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
