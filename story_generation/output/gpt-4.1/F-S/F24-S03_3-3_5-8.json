My stepbrother grinned, already planning games for the car ride, and my mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019ll mean a lot if you come,\u201d she said. I knew how important it was to show up, to be part of this new family, to help us all feel like we belonged together. But as I started packing, my phone blared with a flash-flood warning. Sirens wailed outside, and I saw neighbors scrambling, water already pooling at the curb. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on Mrs. Lee next door, make sure the storm drains weren\u2019t blocked, maybe even volunteer at the emergency shelter. But my family was waiting, bags by the door, expecting me to join them, to be present and make memories. My heart pounded as I stood between the window and the hallway, torn by the weight of both responsibilities, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
