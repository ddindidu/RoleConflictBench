We needed to talk about our finances\u2014about the unexpected expenses and the way our savings seemed to be slipping through our fingers. My spouse looked at me, expecting honesty, wanting to understand every detail so we could face this together. I wanted to be open, to share everything, but my mind kept circling back to the family I\u2019d been helping as a volunteer. Their struggles had shaped my perspective on our own situation, but I\u2019d promised to keep their story private. As my spouse pressed for more context, asking why I seemed so anxious about our own spending, I felt torn. I wanted to explain, to be fully transparent, but I couldn\u2019t betray the trust of those I was helping. The urge to be a good partner clashed with my responsibility as a volunteer, and I felt the tension rising inside me, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
