My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist\u2014a chance to set the record straight, to educate thousands in real time.

Just minutes ago, they\u2019d finally opened up about the stress at work, the fear of layoffs, the weight they\u2019d been carrying alone. I\u2019d promised to listen, to be present, to communicate openly, just as we\u2019d always said we would. Now, the phone kept ringing, the world outside demanding my voice, while the world inside our home needed my ear. I felt torn, guilt and urgency battling inside me, as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
