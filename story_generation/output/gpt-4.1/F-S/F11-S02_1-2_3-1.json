My little brother is excitedly waving a flyer for the new amusement park, and Mom is already talking about what snacks to pack for our family outing. I nod along, trying to sound enthusiastic, but my mind is racing. The protest march is starting in less than an hour, and I promised to lead the first chant. The group is counting on me; I helped organize everything, and my absence would be noticed. But my family rarely spends weekends together, and I know how much it means to them when I join in. I feel my chest tighten as my brother looks at me, waiting for my answer. My activist friends are sending urgent texts, asking where I am. I want to be there for both, but I can\u2019t split myself in two. The weight of their expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the disappointment I\u2019ll cause, no matter which way I turn."}
