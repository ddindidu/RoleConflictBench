My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight?\u201d I promised I would, but my phone buzzes with a reminder\u2014tomorrow is the trial. My client\u2019s future hangs in the balance, and I still need to review the case files, polish my arguments, and anticipate the prosecution\u2019s moves. The weight of their trust presses on me; they\u2019re counting on me to fight for them, to be sharp and prepared. But here, at home, I\u2019m needed too. I see the fatigue in my partner\u2019s eyes, the quiet hope that I\u2019ll share the load. My heart twists as I stand between these two worlds, each demanding more than I feel I can give. The laundry waits, the files wait, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, torn by the expectations of the people who need me most."}
