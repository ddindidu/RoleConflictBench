Now, as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the news network\u2014urgent, they say. Misinformation is spreading fast, and they need my voice, my facts, my passion, right now. My heart pounds. I know how much this moment matters for our cause, how many people might listen and learn. But I also know my wife is counting on me, that she\u2019s carried the weight of our home all week. I feel split in two, the activist in me ready to leap into action, the husband in me aching to keep my word. The laundry sits between us, a quiet battleground, as I stand frozen, phone in hand, torn by the demands of both worlds."}
