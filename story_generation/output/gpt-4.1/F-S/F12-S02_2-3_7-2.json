He hadn\u2019t said much all evening, and I knew something was weighing on him. As his wife, I wanted to reach out, to ask him what was wrong, to share my own worries about work and the world. We\u2019d promised each other honesty, to never let silence grow between us. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed urgently. Messages from fellow activists flashed on the screen: the police had started blocking the exits at our protest downtown. Panic surged through me. As an organizer, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety. I needed to coordinate, to send instructions, to make sure no one got hurt. My husband\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for connection, for the openness we\u2019d built our marriage on. But my mind was already racing, torn between the person he needed me to be and the leader my community depended on. My hands shook as I held the phone, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
