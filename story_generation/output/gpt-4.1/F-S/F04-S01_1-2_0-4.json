We\u2019re celebrating my promotion!\u201d I smiled, feeling proud. As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her, and I promised I\u2019d be there to cheer her on. Just then, a client approached, nervously clutching her paperwork. As I helped her fill out the forms, she leaned in and whispered about a personal struggle she was facing, trusting me with details she hadn\u2019t shared with anyone else. My heart ached for her, and I wanted to help, but she asked me to keep it between us. I glanced at the clock\u2014my sister\u2019s dinner was in an hour. I felt torn. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate and support my sister. But as a volunteer, I was bound to respect this client\u2019s privacy and offer her the time and attention she needed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
