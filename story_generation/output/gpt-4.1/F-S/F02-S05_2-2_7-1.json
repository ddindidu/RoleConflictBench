As a father, I knew I had to ensure my family\u2019s needs were met, to keep the fridge stocked and the bills paid. But tonight, my mind was tangled in the details of a client\u2019s case that had suddenly grown more complicated. As an advocate, I owed my client clear, thorough advice\u2014anything less would be a betrayal of my professional duty. Yet, the hours I spent poring over legal documents meant less time to take on new cases, less income, and more worry about making ends meet at home. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. My family needed security; my client needed answers.
