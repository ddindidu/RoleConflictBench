Lily\u2019s art project won first prize! She wants to show everyone tonight.\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014these are the moments I cherish as a grandmother, being present for my family\u2019s milestones, making memories together. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter starts at six. I\u2019m the only one with the keys tonight, and people will be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start dinner service. I know how much the staff and guests rely on me, and I hate the thought of letting them down. Yet, the thought of missing Lily\u2019s big moment tugs at me. My family expects me to be there, to celebrate, to be the supportive grandmother I strive to be. But my commitment to the shelter is just as real. I sit at the kitchen table, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
