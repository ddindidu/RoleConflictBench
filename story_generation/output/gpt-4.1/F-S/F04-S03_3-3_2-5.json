I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I grabbed my keys, heart pounding, already picturing her tear-streaked face. As I stepped outside, I noticed the flyer taped to my door\u2014today was the last day to vote on the new zoning law that would change our block forever. The polling place was just a few blocks away, but it closed in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d always participate, that I\u2019d never take my responsibilities as a citizen lightly. But my sister was waiting, probably pacing her living room, counting on me to be there for her like I always had. I stood on the sidewalk, torn between the pull of family and the weight of civic duty, feeling the minutes slip away as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment."}
