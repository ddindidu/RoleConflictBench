I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, \u201cWe hardly get to see you these days.\u201d\n\nBut as I set my phone down, I noticed a new email from the volunteer coordinator at the community center. She\u2019d written, \u201cIf you have time today, could you try reorganizing the supply closet? It would really help us out for next week\u2019s event.\u201d I knew she was counting on me; I\u2019d promised to be reliable, and the other volunteers often looked to me for guidance.\n\nMy heart thudded with anxiety. I wanted to be the dependable sister, present for my family, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the team at the center. Both sides expected me to show up, to give my best. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
