The fridge was nearly empty, and the kids\u2019 shoes had holes in them. I needed to pick up an extra shift at the caf\u00e9\u2014just enough to cover groceries and maybe a new pair of sneakers. My boss texted, asking if I could come in for a few hours. I said yes before I remembered: today is election day.\n\nThe polling station is only a few blocks away, and the polls are open all day. I know how important it is to vote, to have my voice heard for the sake of my children\u2019s future. But the caf\u00e9 needs me now, and so does my family. If I don\u2019t work, we might not have enough for dinner this week. If I don\u2019t vote, I feel like I\u2019m letting down not just myself, but everyone who depends on the choices we make as a community.\n\nI stare at the clock, torn between the responsibility to provide and the duty to participate. My heart pounds as I weigh what matters most, knowing that whatever I choose, something will be left undone."}
