She smiled at me, her eyes hopeful, as she handed me the family\u2019s heirloom tablecloth to set the table\u2014a tradition she insisted I help with every year. I knew how much it meant to her, to my step-siblings, to see me embrace these rituals, to feel like I truly belonged. But as I unfolded the cloth, my phone buzzed with an alert: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone on our floor. The city had urged everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, to offer water or a cool place to rest. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my stepmother\u2019s silent plea for unity, the city\u2019s call for compassion and responsibility. My heart pounded as I stared at the tablecloth, torn between honoring my family\u2019s expectations and answering the urgent need just beyond our door."}
