The phone buzzed with another urgent email\u2014my client needed a detailed explanation of the new legal developments, and I knew I had to respond with clarity and precision. But as I started typing, I caught a glimpse of my husband across the room, his shoulders slumped, eyes distant. He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I remembered my promise to always communicate openly, to share and listen when something weighed on our minds.\n\nI wanted to close the laptop, to ask him what was wrong, to be present as his wife. But the pressure from my client\u2019s case pressed in, demanding my attention and expertise. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the man I loved, who needed me to notice and care, and toward my client, who relied on my guidance. The expectations clashed inside me, each urgent, each important, and I sat frozen, torn between the roles that defined me."}
