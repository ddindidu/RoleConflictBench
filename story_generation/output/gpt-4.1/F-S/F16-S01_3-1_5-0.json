My spouse was bustling around, dusting shelves and fluffing pillows, reminding me that the house had to be spotless before the relatives arrived this evening. \u201cCan you vacuum the living room next?\u201d they called, and I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectation. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community center started in thirty minutes. I knew the team could manage without me for a little while, but I also knew they counted on me to be reliable and on time. My mind raced, torn between the guilt of leaving my spouse to handle the chores alone and the responsibility I felt toward my fellow volunteers. I could picture the disappointed look on my spouse\u2019s face if I left now, and the subtle letdown in my coordinator\u2019s voice if I arrived late. My heart pounded as I dried my hands, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I would let down."}
