The school\u2019s reminder pops up: \u201cOpen class today at 2 PM. Parents welcome!\u201d My daughter\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019ll be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I tuck the phone away, a fellow activist grabs my arm, panic in her voice. \u201cThe police are blocking the exits. We need you to help coordinate\u2014now.\u201d I look around at the crowd, people I\u2019ve led and supported, all relying on me to keep them safe and organized. My mind races. My child expects her parent in the audience, cheering her on. My fellow activists expect their leader, calm and resourceful, to guide them through this tense moment. Both roles demand my presence, my care, my responsibility. I feel torn in two, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me as I try to figure out where I\u2019m needed most, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
