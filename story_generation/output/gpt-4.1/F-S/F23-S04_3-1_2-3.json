I\u2019d already set out my driver\u2019s license, but I knew my passport was buried somewhere in the bedroom, just in case. As I sipped my coffee, the school called. My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in for a meeting\u2014immediately, if possible. My partner was at work, unreachable, so it was on me.\n\nI stared at the clock, calculating. The polling station was open all day, but the school meeting was now. Ethan needed me to show up, to prove I cared, even if I was still learning how to be his parent. But voting mattered, too. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it, not this year. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014Ethan\u2019s anxious face, the principal\u2019s disappointment, the civic duty I owed my community. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing someone would be let down, no matter what I chose."}
