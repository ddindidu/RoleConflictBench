Mom always says to keep an eye on him, especially since he\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood. I glance at my phone\u2014fifteen minutes until my volunteer shift at the community center. The coordinator\u2019s text from this morning flashes in my mind: \u201cPlease be on time. We\u2019re short-staffed today.\u201d I promised I\u2019d help set up before the doors open, and I know how much they\u2019re counting on me.\n\nBut Jamie\u2019s dragging his feet, stopping to poke at a stray cat. He\u2019s in no hurry, and I can\u2019t just leave him. I feel the pressure building in my chest\u2014if I rush him, he might get upset or wander off, but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be late and let the team down. I try to smile and nudge him along, but my mind is racing, torn between being the responsible sibling and the reliable volunteer. The minutes tick by, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m about to let someone down, no matter what I choose."}
