But as I sorted through the clothes, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: a routine meeting at the firm in less than an hour. As an advocate, punctuality isn\u2019t just expected\u2014it\u2019s demanded. Missing even a routine meeting could mean letting down my colleagues, or worse, my clients. My mind raced, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the ticking clock. I could almost hear my husband\u2019s voice, gentle but tired, asking if his shirt would be ready. At the same time, I pictured my supervisor\u2019s raised eyebrow if I walked in late again. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, a fistful of laundry in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
