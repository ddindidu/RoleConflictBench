My client\u2019s trial was tomorrow, and every detail mattered\u2014one misstep, and their future could be lost. But as I listened, my six-year-old darted between the supermarket aisles, giggling and weaving dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. Other shoppers shot me disapproving looks. I knew I should hang up, kneel down, and teach my child about respect and discipline, about how we behave in public. That\u2019s what a good parent does.
