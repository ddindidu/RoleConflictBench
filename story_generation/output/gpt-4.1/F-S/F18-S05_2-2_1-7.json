My younger brother trudged in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. He didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell something was wrong. As his sibling, I knew I should sit with him, listen, and help him through whatever had happened at school. He needed me\u2014he always had, especially when things got tough with his friends. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was in less than an hour, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be late. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the urge to drop everything for my brother and the professional duty that demanded my immediate attention. My heart pounded as I weighed the silent plea in his eyes against the ticking clock and the expectations of my role as an advocate."}
