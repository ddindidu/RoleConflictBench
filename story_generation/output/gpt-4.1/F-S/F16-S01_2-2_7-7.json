They\u2019d been quiet all evening, their brow furrowed, and I knew I should ask what was wrong. We\u2019d promised each other to always talk things through, to share our worries and support one another. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator, reminding us about the new safety procedures. There had been an incident last week, and now everyone was expected to follow the updated steps without exception. I was supposed to review the guidelines tonight and be ready to help others stick to them at tomorrow\u2019s event. My spouse finally sat down across from me, looking like they wanted to talk. I felt torn\u2014should I set aside the volunteer responsibilities for now and focus on my partner, or should I make sure I\u2019m fully prepared for my commitment to the team? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel the tension building inside as I tried to decide what to do next."}
