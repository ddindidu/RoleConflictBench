I knew I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, especially in public places. My partner always said I should be firm but kind, and I wanted to live up to that. Just as I was about to call him back, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote before the polls closed. We rushed to the polling station, my mind still on the lesson I needed to give.\n\nInside, a poll worker handed me my ballot and envelope. As I signed, my stepson tugged at my sleeve, restless and loud. The poll worker frowned at the smudged signature and asked me to re-sign, explaining it was important to follow the rules exactly. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the need to model good citizenship and respect for the voting process, and the responsibility to guide my stepson\u2019s behavior. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to address first, feeling pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both demands at once."}
