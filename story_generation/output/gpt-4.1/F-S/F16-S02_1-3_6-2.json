I want to tell them everything, to be honest like we promised. But my phone buzzes urgently in my pocket\u2014messages from fellow activists flood in. The police have started blocking the exits at the protest site, and panic is rising. I\u2019m supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to keep everyone calm and out of harm\u2019s way. My partner leans in, waiting for me to open up, to share the truth about my day and my fears. But if I do, I risk worrying them, maybe even putting them in danger. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m breaking the trust we\u2019ve built. My heart pounds as I glance between my partner\u2019s expectant face and the glowing screen, torn between the promise of honesty at home and the urgent call to action in the streets."}
