My stepsister\u2019s eyes lit up, and my mom nudged me, expecting me to join in the excitement. I knew they wanted me to be present, to help us all feel more like a real family. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, asking for clarification about their case. As an advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate advice\u2014even during these casual, off-the-clock moments. I glanced at my family, laughing and planning, and then at my phone, where someone was waiting for guidance only I could give. My mom caught my eye, her look a silent plea to be part of this moment. My client\u2019s message blinked insistently. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of belonging and the duty to my client. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
