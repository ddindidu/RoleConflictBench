The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow. As a step-parent, I know I need to make sure we\u2019re financially stable\u2014my partner and stepdaughter are counting on me. Every dollar matters, and I\u2019ve been combing through our expenses, trying to find ways to save. Suddenly, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district is streaming now. As a citizen, I believe in being informed, voting, and giving feedback. I want to help shape the community my family lives in. But the thought of spending an hour watching the forum, when I could be working on our budget or picking up an extra shift, fills me with anxiety. I feel torn\u2014my family needs me to focus on our finances, but my community needs engaged citizens. My heart pounds as I stare at the screen, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities, unsure which demand to answer first."}
