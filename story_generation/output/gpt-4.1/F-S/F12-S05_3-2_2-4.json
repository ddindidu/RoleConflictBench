The hearing was tomorrow, and the case was complicated\u2014every detail mattered, and I needed to review the files one more time. But across the room, my husband sat slumped on the couch, his eyes red and distant. He\u2019d barely spoken all week, and tonight he finally asked, \u201cCan you just sit with me for a while?\u201d My heart twisted. He needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to be present, to listen, to reassure him that things would be okay. But my client was counting on me, too. If I didn\u2019t prepare, I could jeopardize their future. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be the wife who could hold her partner through the storm, but I was also the advocate who couldn\u2019t let her client down. My hands trembled as I looked between my husband and the files, torn by the impossible choice."}
