My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up the kids\u2014school ends in 30 minutes.\u201d I pictured their eager faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially with the school year ending soon.\n\nBut across my desk, a stack of case files waited, and my client sat nervously in the lobby. The hearing was minor, the stakes not life-changing, but I was their advocate. They expected me to show up, to fight for them, to be present and prepared. I could hear the echo of my own words: \u201cEvery client deserves my best, no matter how small the case.\u201d\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My children\u2019s trust, my client\u2019s hope. I wanted to be everywhere at once, to not let anyone down. My mind raced, torn between the school parking lot and the courthouse, between being the parent my kids needed and the advocate my client deserved."}
