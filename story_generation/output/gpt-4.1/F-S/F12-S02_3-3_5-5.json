My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him move the furniture before his parents arrived. The house was a mess, and we\u2019d promised each other it would be spotless for the relatives. I could feel the weight of his expectation\u2014this was our shared responsibility, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the advocacy group. The bill we\u2019d been fighting for was coming to a surprise vote in less than an hour. The outcome depended on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a direct line to her office. They needed me to call, to persuade, to make a difference\u2014right now.\n\nI looked at the half-cleaned kitchen, the cluttered living room, and my husband\u2019s anxious face. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the home I\u2019d promised to help prepare, and the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into. I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossibility of being both the wife my family needed and the activist my movement depended on."}
