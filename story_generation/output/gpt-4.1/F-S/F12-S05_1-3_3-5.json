My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cDid you get a chance to fold these?\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, that I\u2019d pull my weight at home. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another message from my client, desperate and anxious. Tomorrow\u2019s trial could change everything for her. I should be reviewing case notes, prepping arguments, making sure I don\u2019t miss a single detail. My mind is split: one half in the courtroom, the other in my living room. I want to be the partner who keeps our home running, but I also can\u2019t let my client down. The expectations press in from both sides, and I feel myself pulled taut, unable to give either role what it truly deserves. I stand between the laundry and my briefcase, heart pounding, knowing I have to choose where to turn next."}
