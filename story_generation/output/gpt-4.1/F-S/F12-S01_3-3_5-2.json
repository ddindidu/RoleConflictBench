The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry still in baskets, and the guest room needed fresh sheets. He looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d help him get everything ready. I knew he counted on me to share the load, especially when it came to making a good impression on his family.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. My volunteer shift started in less than an hour, and today, I was the only one scheduled to open the community center. People would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on our services for their morning meal. If I didn\u2019t show up on time, the doors would stay locked, and those people would be left standing in the cold.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my husband\u2019s anxious glances, the mental image of the waiting crowd. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, cleaning spray in the other, torn between the home that needed me and the community that depended on me."}
