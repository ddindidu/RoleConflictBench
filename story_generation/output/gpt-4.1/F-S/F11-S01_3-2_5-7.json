It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you!\u201d My little brother had even sent a string of pleading emojis. I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially after the year we\u2019d had. But as I scrolled through my emails, I saw the reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease remember, all volunteers must be present for the new safety protocol training. Attendance is mandatory, and we need everyone to help implement the changes.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. I wanted to be the dependable sister, the one who never missed a family moment, but I also knew how important it was to follow through on my commitment to the shelter. The coordinator had stressed how crucial these new steps were for everyone\u2019s safety. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I felt toward the people who relied on me at the shelter. I sat frozen, unable to decide which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down."}
