I listen, trying to be present, knowing how much it means to them that we share these moments, that I\u2019m not just a body in the room but someone who truly hears them. My phone buzzes. I glance down and see the name of the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. My heart leaps\u2014this is the chance to push for the policy change I\u2019ve poured months into. The aide only has ten minutes, and if I miss this, the bill could stall. My partner is still talking, their eyes searching mine for understanding, for the open communication we promised each other. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be here, fully, and the urgency to answer that call, to be the activist I promised I\u2019d be. My hand hovers over the phone, torn between the life we\u2019ve built and the cause I believe in."}
