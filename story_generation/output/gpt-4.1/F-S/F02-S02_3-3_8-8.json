The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a weight pressing on my chest. My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the other room, reminding me gently that we needed to tighten our budget, that the kids\u2019 school fees were coming up too. I nodded, feeling the pressure to keep our family secure, to make sure we never missed a payment.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was the news network. They needed me on air\u2014now\u2014to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist: a chance to reach thousands, maybe millions, to set the record straight. But the appearance would mean missing a crucial freelance job I\u2019d lined up for extra income, money we needed for the loan.\n\nMy heart pounded. My family needed stability, but my community needed my voice. I stared at the phone, torn between the two worlds, feeling the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
