The grandkids were excited to see me, and I knew how much these holiday calls meant to everyone, especially since we couldn\u2019t all be together in person this year. At the same time, I glanced at the voting pamphlet on the counter. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote in person, just as I always had. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was clear, but the hours overlapped with our family call. My daughter expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be the glue that held our family together. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of my duty to vote, to have my voice heard. The thought of disappointing my family or neglecting my civic responsibility twisted inside me, leaving me restless and uncertain as the clock ticked closer to both commitments."}
