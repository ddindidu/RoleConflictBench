I glanced down\u2014another message from Mom, asking if I was safe, if I\u2019d eaten, if I could send a quick photo. She always wanted to know everything, and I tried to answer every text, every call, no matter how busy I was. It was our unspoken rule: daily updates, no exceptions.\n\nBut now, a protest leader was urging us forward, telling us to cross the barricade and occupy the city steps. \u201cThis is our right!\u201d he shouted. The police line was just ahead, and the tape marked the boundary\u2014crossing it would be breaking the law. I felt the weight of my phone in my hand, my mother\u2019s worried words on the screen, and the pressure of the crowd behind me. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the law and public property, but as a daughter, I didn\u2019t want to worry my parents or hide anything from them. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my family and my responsibility as a member of society."}
