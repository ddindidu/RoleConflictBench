My briefcase was packed, my notes reviewed, and I knew how important it was to show up on time\u2014my clients and colleagues depended on my reliability. But across from me, my younger brother hunched over his textbooks, his hands trembling as he tried to focus. He\u2019d barely slept, and I could see the anxiety etched on his face. He looked up at me, eyes pleading for reassurance, for the kind of support I\u2019d always promised to give as his sibling. I wanted to stay, to talk him through his worries, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But the clock kept ticking, and the weight of my professional responsibility pressed down on me.
