The petition deadline was minutes away, and my signature could help push the bill forward. I\u2019d spent weeks rallying support, drafting emails, and organizing calls. But across from me, my husband stared at his untouched coffee, eyes clouded with worry. He\u2019d just told me about the ultimatum his boss gave him\u2014accept a transfer or risk losing his job. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to help him weigh his options. I could see how much he was struggling, and I wanted to be fully present for him. But my phone kept lighting up, the group\u2019s messages growing more urgent. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the cause I believed in, and the person I loved. My hands hovered over my phone, my mind racing, as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
