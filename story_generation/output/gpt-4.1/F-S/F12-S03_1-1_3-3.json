He\u2019s been working late all week, and I know he\u2019s counting on me to fold and put things away before he gets home. But as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes closes tomorrow. I\u2019ve been meaning to fill it out, to give feedback about the stop near our street that\u2019s always crowded. I believe in being an active citizen, in making my voice heard, especially when it comes to things that affect our daily lives. Yet, the laundry sits there, a tangible task, while the survey feels urgent in a different way\u2014an invisible duty to my community. My mind races, torn between the expectations of being a supportive wife and a responsible citizen. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my time, each important in its own right. I sit, paralyzed, unsure which responsibility to tackle first."}
