She suggested that, if I had time after my usual shift, I could reorganize the supply closet to make things easier for everyone. I knew she\u2019d appreciate it if I took the initiative, and I wanted to show I was reliable. But as I read her message, I heard my mom sigh in the living room. Lately, she and Dad seemed more tired, quieter. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in with them more, ask if everything was okay, be the kind of child who noticed when things weren\u2019t right. I glanced at the clock, calculating if I could do both\u2014stay late at the center and still be home in time to talk to my parents before they went to bed. My chest tightened as I imagined letting down the coordinator or missing the chance to support my family. I wanted to be dependable in both places, but I could already feel the pull, the impossibility of being fully present for both at the same time."}
