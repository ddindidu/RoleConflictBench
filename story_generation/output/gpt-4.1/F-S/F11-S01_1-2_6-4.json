She waved, excited to see me, and I felt a warm rush of affection. We\u2019d promised to include each other in more of our lives, and I\u2019d invited her to join me after my shift so we could hang out. As I helped a client fill out forms, she leaned in and quietly shared a personal concern about her living situation, trusting me to keep it private. Just then, Mia came over, curious about what I was doing and eager to chat. She asked who I was talking to and what was going on, wanting to be part of my world. I could see the hope in her eyes\u2014she wanted to feel included, to share in my experiences. But the client\u2019s words echoed in my mind, and I knew I couldn\u2019t betray her trust. My heart pounded as I stood between my sister\u2019s expectation of openness and the client\u2019s need for confidentiality, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
