She\u2019d asked if I could help fold it tonight, since she\u2019d been running errands all day. I promised I would, knowing how much she values us sharing the load at home. But as I reached for the first towel, my phone buzzed\u2014a new email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested we reorganize the supply closet at the shelter, if we had a spare hour after our usual shift. Her message was polite, but I knew she expected me to step up, especially since I\u2019d been volunteering longer than most.\n\nI felt torn. If I left the laundry, I\u2019d be letting my wife down, making her feel like she\u2019s carrying the housework alone. But if I skipped the extra organizing at the shelter, I\u2019d disappoint the coordinator and maybe set a bad example for the newer volunteers. My mind raced, guilt tugging from both sides, as I stood in the living room, laundry in one hand and phone in the other, not sure which responsibility to choose."}
