She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than the usual, and I knew she wanted me to open up, to share what was really on my mind. I wanted to tell her everything, to be the husband who communicates, but my thoughts kept drifting to the envelope on the hallway table\u2014my only valid ID. The polls were open tomorrow, but today was the only morning I could swing by home to grab it before work. If I forgot, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. I felt the pressure mounting: be present, be honest with her, but also be responsible, fulfill my civic duty. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to connect with my wife and the need to remember the ID. I tried to focus on her words, but the anxiety gnawed at me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded at the same time."}
