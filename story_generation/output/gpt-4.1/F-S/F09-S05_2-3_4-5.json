I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or polite. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014guides her child, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: a message from my client\u2019s family, desperate for reassurance before tomorrow\u2019s trial. The weight of their trust pressed on me. I was their advocate, the one who had to be prepared, focused, and available. Their future depended on my attention right now. My heart pounded as I watched my son weave between shoppers, torn between the urge to discipline him and the obligation to respond to my client. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t give it to both at once. I stood frozen, caught between the expectations of motherhood and the responsibilities of advocacy, unsure which demand to answer first."}
