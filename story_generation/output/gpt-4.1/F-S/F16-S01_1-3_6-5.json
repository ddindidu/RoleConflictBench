My spouse poured us both a cup of tea and slid into the chair across from me, asking about my day. It was our little ritual\u2014talking openly, sharing the small victories and frustrations that made up our lives. I wanted to tell them about the woman who\u2019d finally gotten her medication, or the young man who\u2019d found a job after months of searching. But the files in front of me were stamped with bold letters: CONFIDENTIAL. I could see the curiosity in my spouse\u2019s eyes, the gentle expectation that I\u2019d let them in, just as I always had. My heart twisted as I tried to balance the trust we\u2019d built at home with the trust placed in me by the people I was helping. I hesitated, words caught in my throat, torn between the comfort of sharing and the duty of silence."}
