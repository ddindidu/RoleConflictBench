My father, usually so animated, barely spoke during dinner. The air at home felt heavy, and I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to just be present. But my phone buzzed with reminders: another meeting at the firm, a court session in the morning, and a client expecting updates by noon. As an advocate, punctuality and presence were non-negotiable; missing even a routine meeting could mean letting down a client or losing credibility with colleagues. My parents\u2019 silent pleas for comfort clashed with the relentless demands of my profession. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me for even considering leaving them alone tonight, yet anxiety rising at the thought of falling behind at work. The clock ticked, and I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the home that needed me and the career that demanded me."}
