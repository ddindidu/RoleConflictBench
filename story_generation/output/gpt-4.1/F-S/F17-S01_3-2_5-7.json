The new safety steps are non-negotiable.\u201d I knew how important these guidelines were\u2014lives depended on us getting it right. But as I looked up, I saw my mother carefully arranging the ceremonial tablecloth, her eyes hopeful. \u201cYou\u2019ll lead the prayers this year, just like your grandfather did,\u201d she said.
