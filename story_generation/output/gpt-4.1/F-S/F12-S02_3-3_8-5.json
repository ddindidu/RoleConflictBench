We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about whether we could afford the treatment his doctor recommended. He wanted me present, open, and fully engaged\u2014no distractions, no half-truths. I owed him that.

The outcome would affect thousands, and the undecided representative was taking calls for the next hour only. My heart pounded. My husband\u2019s voice was gentle but insistent, \u201cWe need to be honest with each other.\u201d At the same time, my activist friends were counting on me to speak up, to make a difference.
