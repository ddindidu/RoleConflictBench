Dad moved slower than usual, sighing more often, and I could feel the heaviness in the air. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, listen, maybe make them laugh. I wanted to be there, to show them I cared, to offer the comfort they\u2019d always given me.\n\nBut today is also election day. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, so there\u2019s no real excuse not to go. I know how important it is to vote, to have my voice heard, to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. I can almost hear my civics teacher\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that every vote counts.\n\nYet, as I watch my parents, I feel torn. If I leave now, even for a short while, will they feel abandoned? But if I stay, am I neglecting my duty as a voter? The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I sit at the table, wrestling with what to do next."}
