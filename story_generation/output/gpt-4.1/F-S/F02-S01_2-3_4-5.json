As I reached for a box of cereal, he darted down the aisle, weaving between carts and nearly knocking over a display. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in and teach him discipline, to show that I was a responsible father who instilled good values. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I needed to be at the community center soon, where I\u2019d be sorting confidential medical files. There, I was trusted to respect people\u2019s privacy, to never let a detail slip, not even to my family. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the need to correct my son\u2019s behavior in public, to be the father everyone expected, and the responsibility to uphold strict confidentiality as a volunteer. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need to guide my child and the looming duty to protect the privacy of strangers. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
