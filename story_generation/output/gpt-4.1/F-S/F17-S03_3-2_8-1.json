We\u2019d been planning it for weeks, and I knew how much everyone was looking forward to it. But just as I was about to reply, my mom knocked softly and came in, her eyes red and tired. She sat beside me and, for the first time, shared how overwhelmed she felt at work and how lonely she\u2019d been lately. She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I could feel how much she needed me to listen, to be there for her.\n\nAt the same time, I remembered the building\u2019s strict quiet hours. Our neighbor, who always kept her windows open, had complained before about noise. As a citizen, I knew I should respect her right to peace and follow the rules. But as a child, I felt the weight of my mom\u2019s vulnerability, her need for comfort. My friends were waiting, the music was supposed to be an escape, but now I was torn\u2014between being the support my mom needed and being a responsible member of my community. My heart pounded as I sat between these two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
