The phone buzzed with another message from them, pleading for guidance before tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I knew I needed to review the documents one more time, to be absolutely certain my advice was flawless. Just then, my spouse walked in, their face drawn and eyes searching. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d they asked quietly. I could see the worry etched in their features, the kind that only comes from holding something in too long. I remembered our promise to always communicate openly, to never let work or stress build walls between us. But my client\u2019s crisis pressed on my conscience\u2014if I didn\u2019t respond soon, their situation could spiral. My spouse sat across from me, waiting, vulnerable. My phone vibrated again.

My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, torn between the person I love and the person who depends on my expertise."}
