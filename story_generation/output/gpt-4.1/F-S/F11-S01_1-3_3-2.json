My younger brother looked at me, his eyes bright, and asked if I\u2019d come along for the hike they\u2019d been planning for weeks. My mom chimed in, saying it wouldn\u2019t be the same without me. I felt the warmth of their expectations, the comfort of being wanted and included. But as I nodded along, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled to open the community center early Saturday morning. As the only volunteer assigned, I knew people would be waiting outside, counting on me to unlock the doors and start the day\u2019s service. My family\u2019s laughter filled the room, but my mind raced with worry. If I joined the hike, I\u2019d let down the people who needed me at the center. If I kept my commitment to volunteer, I\u2019d disappoint my family and miss out on memories. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
