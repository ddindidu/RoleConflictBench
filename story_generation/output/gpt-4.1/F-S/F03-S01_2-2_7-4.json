I knew they were carrying more than they let on, and I felt the weight of their unspoken worries pressing on me. As their son, I wanted to be there for them, to ask what was wrong and offer comfort, but I also knew they valued their privacy and didn\u2019t always want to talk.\n\nLater that afternoon, at the community center, I was volunteering at the check-in table. A woman leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal struggle she was facing. She asked me not to tell anyone. I nodded, feeling the seriousness of her trust. But as I listened, I realized her situation was eerily similar to what my parents might be going through. My mind raced\u2014should I share what I\u2019d learned with my parents to help them, or keep the client\u2019s confidence as I\u2019d promised? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which role I owed more."}
