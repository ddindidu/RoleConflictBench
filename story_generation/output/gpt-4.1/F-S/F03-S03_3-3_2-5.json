Did you eat?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just two hours left before the polling place closes. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the way our block handles parking, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote and maybe even talk to the volunteers about my concerns. But my parents expect me to check in every evening, to share the little details\u2014what I ate, how work went, if I\u2019m feeling okay. If I don\u2019t reply soon, my mom will worry, maybe even call. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the dutiful son who keeps his parents close, and the responsible citizen who shows up for his community. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between typing out a long message and grabbing my jacket to head out the door. The minutes tick by, and I can feel my chest tighten, caught between the comfort of family and the call of civic duty."}
