You know I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d Maya was her best friend, and I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately. But as a volunteer at the community center, I\u2019d just finished sorting through confidential files, including Maya\u2019s. I could see the concern in my sister\u2019s eyes, the expectation that I\u2019d be honest and help her understand. That\u2019s what sisters do\u2014communicate openly, resolve misunderstandings, and build trust. But the weight of the files I\u2019d handled pressed on me. I\u2019d promised to respect the privacy of everyone who came to us for help. My sister\u2019s trust or Maya\u2019s confidentiality\u2014both mattered deeply. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
