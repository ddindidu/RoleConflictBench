She told me my grandson was struggling, shutting himself away after a painful breakup. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my family needed me to reach out, to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom. But today, the city was alive with protest. I joined the crowd, feeling the pulse of shared frustration, when suddenly a voice beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we mean it!\u201d They pointed to the barricade, the line we weren\u2019t supposed to cross. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear: respect boundaries, protect public property, don\u2019t incite chaos. Yet, my phone vibrated again\u2014my family needed me, but so did my community. I stood there, torn, the demands of my roles pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I weighed what was right for my family against what was right for my city."}
