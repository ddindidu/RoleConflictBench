My sister\u2019s trembling voice still echoed in my ears\u2014she\u2019d just called, sobbing, after getting terrible news from her doctor. I wanted nothing more than to step outside, call her back, and be the comforting presence she needed. But the election official\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name was right in that range. The new line was longer, slower, and people grumbled as they shuffled over. I knew the rules: follow instructions, don\u2019t cause trouble, respect the process. But my phone buzzed again in my pocket, and I imagined my sister alone, waiting for me to be there for her. I felt torn in two\u2014my duty as a voter pulling me one way, my love as a sibling pulling me the other. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the demands of the moment and the needs of someone I loved."}
