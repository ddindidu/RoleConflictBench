I kept glancing at him, making sure he stayed close to the curb and away from the busy road. Mom always said it was my job to look out for him, and I took that seriously. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the activist group I\u2019d joined. The petition to ban single-use plastics was about to be sent to our state senator, and this was my last chance to add my name. I knew how important every signature was; I\u2019d spent weeks urging others to sign, telling them how much change depended on our voices. But as I slowed down to pull out my phone, my brother darted ahead, chasing a stray soccer ball that rolled into the street. My heart pounded. I could see the petition deadline ticking down, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, unsure which demand to answer first."}
