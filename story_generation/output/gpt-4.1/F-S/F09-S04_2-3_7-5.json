My shift at the diner just ended, and I have exactly forty minutes before the polls close. My purse is heavy with the tips I need to buy groceries for the week, but my ID is at home, left behind in the rush to get the kids ready for school this morning. I know I can\u2019t afford to miss another day of work, not with the bills piling up and the fridge nearly empty. But I also know how important this election is\u2014everyone\u2019s been saying every vote counts, and I want to be the kind of citizen my children can be proud of. If I go home for my ID, I might not make it back in time. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll lose my only chance to vote. My phone buzzes with a reminder from my daughter about dinner, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I stand on the sidewalk, torn, the sky darkening, and I can\u2019t decide which part of me should win tonight."}
