The legal documents sprawled before me demanded my full attention; every word I wrote could change the outcome for someone who trusted me. As an advocate, I owed them clarity and precision, especially now that their case had grown so tangled. But my phone buzzed with a message from home: my husband reminding me that the rent was due, and the groceries were running low. My heart clenched. As a mother, I was responsible for keeping our family afloat, making sure my children never felt the weight of our financial worries. The pressure to take on more clients, to work longer hours, pressed against the need to give each case the care it deserved. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made to my family and the duty I owed my client. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
