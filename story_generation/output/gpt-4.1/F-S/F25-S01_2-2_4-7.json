I nodded, but my phone buzzed with a reminder from the community center\u2014tonight was my shift as a volunteer, and the coordinator had stressed that we must follow the new safety protocol: no open flames in the building, not even for ceremonies. The memory of her stern voice\u2014\u201cNo exceptions, please. We can\u2019t risk it\u201d\u2014clashed with my stepmother\u2019s gentle insistence. My heart pounded as I imagined disappointing her or letting down the team at the center. I wanted to be the stepchild who respected family values, but I was also committed to my role as a responsible volunteer. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stared at the flickering candle on the table, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
