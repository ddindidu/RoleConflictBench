My heart pounded as I knelt to his level, ready to teach him about honesty and consequences, just as I\u2019d promised myself I would as his step-parent. Then my phone buzzed\u2014an unknown number. I almost ignored it, but the screen flashed the name of the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was the moment to push for the bill I\u2019d poured my energy into, the one that could change lives. I had ten minutes, maybe less, to make my case. But right now, my stepson\u2019s wide, guilty eyes were on me, waiting for guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urgent need to be present for him, to teach him right from wrong, and the once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a difference as an activist. My mind raced, torn between the child who needed me and the cause that depended on my voice."}
