She\u2019d barely slept in days, her eyes red from crying, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my calm, my words, my presence. The demonstration surged around us, voices rising in anger and hope. Suddenly, a stranger pressed a sign into my free hand and urged me forward, past the barricade, onto the city property marked off-limits by police tape. \u201cWe need everyone,\u201d he insisted, \u201cfor real change.\u201d I glanced at my wife; her face was pale, anxious. She hated crowds, hated conflict, but she\u2019d come because she didn\u2019t want to be alone. I felt the weight of her need for reassurance, for safety, for me to stay by her side.
