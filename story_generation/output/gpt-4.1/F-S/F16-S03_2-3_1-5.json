The polling place was just down the street, and I knew how important it was to participate, to have my voice heard as a citizen. But across from me, my partner sat hunched over, eyes red, hands trembling. They\u2019d just come home from work, overwhelmed by a decision that could change the course of their career. They needed me\u2014needed my advice, my encouragement, my presence. I could see the expectation in their eyes, the silent plea for support. At the same time, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me, the knowledge that my absence at the polls could mean letting my community down.
