The petition to ban single-use plastics was about to close, and my signature could help push it over the threshold. I knew how important it was\u2014every name counted, and I\u2019d promised to be more involved. But across from me, my younger sister was venting about her new job, her voice tight with frustration. She needed me to listen, to be patient and not judge her for her choices, even though I disagreed with some of them. I could see how much she valued our talks, how she trusted me to understand her.
