Her voice trembled as she confided in me about her worries\u2014Dad\u2019s health, the bills piling up, her own exhaustion. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. I wanted to be the daughter she needed, to offer comfort and strength.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the community center.
