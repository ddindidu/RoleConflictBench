My mom\u2019s voice echoed in my head, \u201cIt would mean a lot if you came. We\u2019re finally feeling like a real family.\u201d I wanted to be there, to laugh with my stepbrother, to show I cared. But my phone buzzed again\u2014an email from my supervisor at the legal aid office. \u201cCourt session rescheduled to Friday morning. Your client\u2019s future depends on this.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d fight for her, that I\u2019d be there, no matter what. But the family trip was the same weekend, and missing the start would mean missing the bonding everyone kept saying we needed.
