My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the living room, reminding me that his parents will arrive in less than an hour. The house is only half-ready, and I promised I\u2019d help with the final touches\u2014setting the table, fluffing the pillows, making sure everything is perfect. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: today is election day. I rush to the polling station, heart pounding, only to be told by the official that my registration has a mismatch. If I want my vote to count, I must fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station closes in ten minutes. I stare at the paperwork, my mind racing. If I stay, I\u2019ll be late getting home, and my husband will have to handle everything alone. If I leave, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. I stand frozen, torn between my duty as a wife and my responsibility as a voter, feeling the minutes slip away."}
