My parents chimed in, asking if I could finally join them, since I\u2019d missed the last few outings. Their hopeful faces made me feel warm and guilty at the same time. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who showed up, who laughed and made memories with them. But as I reached for my phone, I saw the reminder: a minor court hearing scheduled for Saturday morning. My client\u2019s case wasn\u2019t high-stakes, but I knew how much it meant to her\u2014she\u2019d called me twice today, anxious about the outcome. As her advocate, I was expected to be there, to represent her with the same dedication I\u2019d give any other case. The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. My heart ached as I listened to my family\u2019s plans, feeling the weight of my client\u2019s trust on my shoulders. I stared at my calendar, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
