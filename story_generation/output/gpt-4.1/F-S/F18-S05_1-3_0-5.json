As an advocate, I knew how much was riding on this case\u2014my client\u2019s entire future could change based on my performance. I needed to review the files one more time, polish my arguments, and get a good night\u2019s sleep. But from the living room, I heard my younger brother\u2019s anxious pacing. He was preparing for his final exam, the one that would determine if he could graduate on time. He\u2019d always counted on me to be there, to listen and reassure him when things got tough. I could see the expectation in his eyes when he finally sat across from me, textbook in hand, voice trembling as he asked if I had a minute. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the supportive sibling he needed, but the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed down on me. I felt torn, caught between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my client, both expecting my undivided attention, both needing me right now."}
