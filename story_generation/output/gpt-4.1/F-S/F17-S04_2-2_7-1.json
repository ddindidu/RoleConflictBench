Dad barely spoke during dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer a gentle word or a hug. But as I cleared the plates, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polls would close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, to have my say, to do my part. But errands had run late, and now time was tight. My parents needed me here, now, more than ever. Yet, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me, the expectation that I show up, that I make my voice heard. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the quiet plea in my parents\u2019 eyes and the ticking clock of democracy."}
