My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to respond to the question about our finances. We\u2019d agreed to be honest, to share everything, especially now that we were considering a big health decision. I could see the worry in their face, the need for reassurance, for clarity. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I was due in court in less than an hour for a minor hearing. The case wasn\u2019t high stakes, but my client was anxious, counting on me to be there, to represent them with the same dedication I gave every case. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in: the promise to my spouse to be fully present and open, and the professional duty to my client, who trusted me to stand up for them. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment, feeling the pull of loyalty in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved at the same time."}
