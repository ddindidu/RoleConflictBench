Her voice trembled\u2014she needed to talk, right now. She\u2019s never asked for help so directly before. I could hear the weight in her words, the kind of worry that keeps a young person up at night. As her grandfather, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, to listen, to share what I\u2019ve learned from my own tangled path through life. But the clock was ticking. If I didn\u2019t get my ID today, I might not be able to vote tomorrow, and I\u2019ve always believed in doing my civic duty, in shaping the world she\u2019ll inherit. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to comfort her, to be the steady hand she needs, and the responsibility to fulfill my role as a voter. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the expectations of family and country, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
