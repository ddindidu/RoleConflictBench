My shift at the shelter started in twenty minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today.\u201d Just as I reached for my keys, my granddaughter slid into the chair across from me, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, voice trembling. She spoke about feeling lost as she started high school, unsure how to make friends or handle the pressure. I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed my full attention, my stories, my reassurance. But the minutes ticked by, and I knew the shelter was counting on me too. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to guide my granddaughter through her worries, and the responsibility to show up for those who depended on my help. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
