The street is familiar, but today, I keep glancing at my watch. The polling station is just a few blocks away, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year\u2014my first time, and I want to do it right. The hours are generous, and my schedule is light, but I can\u2019t shake the worry that something might happen if I leave my brother alone, even for a short while. Mom always says to look out for each other, and I know she trusts me to get him home safe. But the urge to fulfill my civic duty tugs at me. I could drop him at home and double back, but that means leaving him alone for longer than I\u2019d like. If I take him with me, he\u2019ll be tired and cranky. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility of being a good sibling against the importance of being a responsible voter. The polling station sign comes into view, and I slow my steps, torn between two promises I made\u2014to my family, and to myself."}
