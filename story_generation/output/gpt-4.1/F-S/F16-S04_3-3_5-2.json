My spouse is in the kitchen, frantically wiping down counters, calling out for help with the guest room sheets. Our relatives will arrive in less than an hour, and the house is still a mess. I promised I\u2019d help\u2014after all, we agreed to split the chores, especially when company comes. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. My spouse\u2019s voice rises, frustration clear, \u201cCan you please vacuum the living room?\u201d I freeze, torn.
