My younger sister, Maya, was in the kitchen, clearly upset about something. She started venting about her frustration with the election, how she felt her voice didn\u2019t matter, and how she thought voting was pointless. I could feel my patience slipping as she kept going, but I remembered how important it was to be a supportive brother, to listen and respect her feelings even if I disagreed. At the same time, I was anxious about making sure I had the right identification for the polling station. I knew I could fetch another ID later if needed, but I wanted to get it right the first time. The clock was ticking, and I felt torn\u2014should I stay and listen to Maya, showing her the patience and understanding she deserved, or should I focus on my own responsibility as a voter and make sure I had everything in order before leaving? The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood there, keys in hand, caught between being the brother Maya needed and the responsible voter I wanted to be."}
