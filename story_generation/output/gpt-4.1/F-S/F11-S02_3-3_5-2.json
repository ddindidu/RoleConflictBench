Everyone\u2019s counting on you to help with the holiday dinner.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant, and I knew how much it meant to my family that I was there, especially this year. But as I glanced up, the tension in the air was unmistakable. Police had started blocking the exits of the protest, and the crowd was growing anxious.
