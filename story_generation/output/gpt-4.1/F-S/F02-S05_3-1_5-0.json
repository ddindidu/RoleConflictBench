The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and my son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. He needed to understand honesty and discipline, even if it meant facing embarrassment or punishment. But as an advocate, I was trained to see every side, to explain rights and options, to protect people\u2014even from themselves. My mind raced with legal nuances: Was this really theft? What if the store pressed charges? I could already hear myself giving a client a calm, rational explanation about intent and juvenile law. But this wasn\u2019t a client. This was my son, looking to me for guidance, for comfort, for justice. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different, and I felt the impossible pull between being his father and being the advocate I\u2019d always been."}
