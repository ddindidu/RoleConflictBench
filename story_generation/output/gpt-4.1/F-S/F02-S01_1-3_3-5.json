He\u2019d just spilled his juice, and I was about to gently remind him about being careful and cleaning up after himself\u2014another lesson in responsibility. My phone buzzed with a message from the community center: they needed me to help sort confidential medical files for the afternoon. I\u2019d promised to teach my son about honesty and discipline, and he looked up at me, waiting for my guidance. But the files at the center were sensitive; I couldn\u2019t bring him along, nor could I discuss any details with him, even if he asked. The expectation to be a present, instructive father clashed with my duty as a volunteer to protect others\u2019 privacy. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure how to honor both without letting one slip."}
