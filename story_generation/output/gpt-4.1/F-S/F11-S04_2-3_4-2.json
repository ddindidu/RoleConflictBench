The family dinner was already in full swing, laughter and the clatter of dishes echoing from the dining room. Mom had asked me twice if I\u2019d be home on time, and my little brother had texted, \u201cDon\u2019t be late!\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But as I slipped on my shoes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after all the debates and discussions about how every vote counts. My parents always said being a good citizen mattered, too. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of my family waiting for me and the cold urgency of my civic duty. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to decide which door to walk through."}
