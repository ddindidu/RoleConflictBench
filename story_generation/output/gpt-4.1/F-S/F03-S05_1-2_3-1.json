The case had taken a complicated turn, and she needed my guidance\u2014now, not later. I glanced at the clock. In half an hour, my family would gather in the living room for our annual holiday tradition, a ritual my parents cherished and expected me to uphold. My mother had already reminded me twice that morning, her voice gentle but firm: \u201cThis is important to your father and me. We don\u2019t get these moments back.\u201d\n\nBut my client\u2019s message was urgent, and as her advocate, I was expected to provide clear, timely advice. She was counting on me to help her navigate a maze of legal issues, and I knew a delayed response could cost her dearly. My laptop sat open, the cursor blinking on a half-written email, while the aroma of my mother\u2019s cooking drifted through the house, mingling with the weight of expectation. My heart pounded as I stared between the glowing screen and the family photos on the wall, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my client, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
