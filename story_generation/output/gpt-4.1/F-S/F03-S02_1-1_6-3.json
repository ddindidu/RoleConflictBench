The petition deadline was minutes away, and everyone was urging me to add my name before it was sent to the lawmaker. My laptop was open, the link ready, but I hesitated. Across from me, my mom was quietly folding laundry, her face drawn and tired. I remembered how she\u2019d been sighing more than usual lately, and I knew I should ask if everything was okay at home, offer her the support she always gave me. But the clock was ticking, and my activist friends were counting on me to help push for the policy change we\u2019d worked so hard for. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s needs and the cause I believed in. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations, unsure which role to answer first."}
