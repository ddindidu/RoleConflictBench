The house buzzed with urgency\u2014relatives would arrive in just a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. We\u2019d promised each other to share the load, to make our home welcoming together. My phone vibrated on the counter, and I glanced at the screen: an alert from my activist group. The message was urgent\u2014a surprise vote on the bill we\u2019d fought for all year was happening in less than an hour. The outcome would hinge on one undecided representative, and I was supposed to call, to persuade, to be the voice for change. My spouse called out, asking for help with the guest room. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the cause that defined so much of who I am. The weight of both expectations pressed in, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to ignore either call."}
