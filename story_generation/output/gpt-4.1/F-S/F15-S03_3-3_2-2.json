The protest was growing louder, people chanting for justice, and someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d They pointed to the barricade, the line we weren\u2019t supposed to cross. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to stand up for what I believed in and the knowledge that crossing that line would break the law, disrespecting the city\u2019s rules.\n\nJust then, I checked my phone. A message from the school: my child had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in, to address the situation, to show my child the importance of respect and responsibility. As a parent, I was expected to guide my child, to teach them right from wrong, to be present at these crucial moments. But as a citizen, I was also expected to uphold the law, to respect boundaries, to set an example.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something different, each with its own expectations. My mind raced, caught between the needs of my child and the call of my conscience as a member of this community."}
