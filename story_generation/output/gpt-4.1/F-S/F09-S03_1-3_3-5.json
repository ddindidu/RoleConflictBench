My son sits at the kitchen table, fidgeting with his spoon, refusing to eat his vegetables. I know I should be patient, guiding him gently, teaching him about respect and discipline\u2014showing him that we finish what\u2019s on our plate, that we listen to our parents. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place down the street closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the way our block is managed, and I\u2019ve promised myself to be an active citizen, to vote, to have my voice heard. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my son\u2019s expectant eyes, the civic duty tugging at my conscience. If I rush him, am I failing as a mother? If I stay, am I neglecting my responsibility as a citizen? My mind races, torn between the lessons I want to teach at home and the example I want to set in the world outside."}
