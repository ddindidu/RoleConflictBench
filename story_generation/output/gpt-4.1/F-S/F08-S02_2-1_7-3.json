She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was alive with her updates\u2014her nervousness, her pride, the little victories of her first week. I knew how much it meant to her that I replied quickly, that I shared in her excitement and made her feel seen. At the same time, my laptop screen glowed with an urgent email from my activist group. The petition we\u2019d worked on for weeks was about to be sent to the state senator, and there was a final call for signatures. My name, as one of the more senior members, would carry weight. I could feel the pressure from both sides: the warmth and responsibility of being a supportive grandmother, and the duty to stand up for the cause I believed in. My heart tugged in two directions, the demands of family and activism colliding in the quiet of my kitchen."}
