He grinned, skateboard in hand, ready to try a trick he\u2019d only watched online. As his older sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, and I could already picture him tumbling down, scraped and bruised. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift at the clinic was starting in ten minutes. I was supposed to be sorting confidential medical files, making sure no one\u2019s private information was ever exposed. The clinic trusted me to be careful, to respect the privacy of every patient. My brother called out, \u201cWatch me!\u201d and I felt the pull in both directions. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning him at a risky moment. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my shift, letting down the people who counted on my discretion. My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and my responsibilities, torn by the weight of both roles."}
