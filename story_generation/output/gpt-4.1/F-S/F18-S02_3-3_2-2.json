The police had started blocking the exits, and I could see panic flickering in the eyes of the people I\u2019d helped organize. I knew I had to act fast\u2014send out messages, coordinate a safe exit, keep everyone calm. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw a text from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I called her, and her voice was shaky, barely holding back tears. She\u2019d just gotten terrible news, and she needed me\u2014her big sibling, her anchor. I could hear her pain, and every instinct told me to drop everything and be there for her, to listen, to comfort. But the shouts around me grew louder, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t help now, people could get hurt. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the chaos, torn between the desperate need of my sister and the urgent responsibility to the people counting on me here."}
