The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I needed every spare dollar to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. As a parent, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest\u2014my kids depended on me to keep our home safe and secure. I\u2019d planned to spend the day reviewing our finances, maybe even picking up a few extra hours at work if I could. But today was also election day. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, so there was really no excuse not to go. Still, every minute away from my financial planning felt like a risk. I could hear my children laughing in the next room, and I knew what was at stake. Yet, as a citizen, I felt the pull of duty\u2014my vote mattered, and I wanted to set an example for my kids about civic responsibility. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I sat at the kitchen table, paralyzed by the impossible choice between my family\u2019s immediate needs and my role in shaping our future."}
