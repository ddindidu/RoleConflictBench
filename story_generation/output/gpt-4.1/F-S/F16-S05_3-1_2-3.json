Their eyes were red, voice barely above a whisper as they recounted the day\u2019s anxieties. I knew how much they needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my unwavering presence. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to be the anchor they so desperately sought. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the minor hearing scheduled in less than an hour. My client\u2019s case wasn\u2019t life-altering, but they still expected me to show up, to advocate with the same diligence I gave every case. I could hear my partner\u2019s breath hitch, feel the weight of their need, and at the same time, the professional obligation tugged at me, insistent and unyielding. My heart pounded with guilt and frustration, torn between the person I loved and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold. I stared at the clock, feeling the seconds slip away, caught in the impossible space between being the spouse my partner needed and the advocate my client deserved."}
