The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry scattered, and dust everywhere. As a wife, I felt the weight of expectation to make our home welcoming, to coordinate every detail so our relatives would feel comfortable and cared for. I started making a list: vacuum, mop, prepare snacks, freshen up the guest room. \n\nJust as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I immediately thought of Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor who lives alone. The city had asked residents to check on vulnerable neighbors, to offer water or a cool place to rest. As a citizen, I knew I should go to her, make sure she was safe, maybe invite her over. \n\nBut the clock was ticking, and I could already imagine the disappointment in my husband\u2019s eyes if the house wasn\u2019t ready. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the duties of a wife and the responsibilities of a good citizen, unsure which path to take first."}
