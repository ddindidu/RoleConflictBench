I really need you.\u201d He never reached out unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014just ten minutes before my next client meeting. As his sister, I knew he expected me to listen, to be there for him, especially now when he was struggling with a breakup and feeling lost. I wanted to drop everything and call him, to be the person he could lean on.\n\nBut as I opened my laptop, my client\u2019s file stared back at me. She was waiting for urgent legal advice about a contract dispute that could cost her business everything. She trusted me to be focused, precise, and clear\u2014her livelihood depended on it. My mind raced, torn between the sibling bond that demanded my presence and the professional duty that required my undivided attention. My heart ached for my brother, but my conscience nagged at the responsibility I owed my client. I sat frozen, phone in one hand, legal notes in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
