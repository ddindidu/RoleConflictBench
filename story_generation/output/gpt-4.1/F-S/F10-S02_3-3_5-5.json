The vote on the environmental bill was happening in less than an hour, and I was the only one with a personal connection to the undecided representative. My friends were counting on me to make the call, to sway the vote that could change everything we\u2019d worked for. But from the living room, I could hear my mother\u2019s voice, calling me to join the family. Today was the day I was supposed to lead the ancestral ceremony, a role passed down through generations. My parents had spent weeks preparing, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions, to show respect for our heritage. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me, the pride in their eyes when they spoke of my role. My hands shook as I stared at my phone, torn between the legacy of my family and the future I was fighting for."}
