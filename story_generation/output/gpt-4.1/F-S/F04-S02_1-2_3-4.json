My mom looked at me, expecting me to chime in, to be present, to help decide. I wanted to be there, to be the brother who showed up, who didn\u2019t disappear behind a screen or a cause. Just as I opened my mouth to suggest the new pizza place, my phone buzzed. It was a number I recognized immediately: the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. The message was clear\u2014she had ten minutes to talk, right now, about the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into. My activist side screamed at me to grab this chance, to fight for the change I believed in. But my family\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting, hoping I\u2019d be part of this simple, ordinary moment. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the brother they needed and the activist I\u2019d promised to be."}
