The case had taken a sudden turn, and she needed my guidance more than ever. My notes sprawled across the table, legal documents demanding my full attention. Just as I began to explain her options, my daughter\u2019s name flashed on my phone. I hesitated, torn. She never called during work hours unless it was urgent. My mind raced\u2014my grandson had been sick, and now my family needed me. I could hear my client\u2019s breath on the line, waiting for reassurance, while my heart ached to be with my family, to comfort and support them. The weight of responsibility pressed down on me from both sides. I was expected to be the steady hand for my client, offering clarity and calm, but I was also the grandmother, the one my family turned to in moments of crisis. My hands shook as I stared at the two calls, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
