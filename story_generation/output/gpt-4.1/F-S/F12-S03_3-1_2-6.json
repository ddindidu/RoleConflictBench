My husband was in the next room, his world unraveling after the news he\u2019d received last week. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my quiet presence. I could hear him pacing, the floor creaking with every anxious step. I wanted to be there, to hold him, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together.\n\nBut the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and I\u2019d promised to help. They were short-staffed, and I knew how important it was for everyone\u2019s safety. As a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: to show up, to do my part, to set an example. The taxes, too, needed my attention\u2014another civic duty, another expectation.\n\nI felt torn, pulled in two directions by love and obligation. My husband\u2019s pain was immediate and raw, but the needs of my community pressed in, just as urgent in their own way. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
