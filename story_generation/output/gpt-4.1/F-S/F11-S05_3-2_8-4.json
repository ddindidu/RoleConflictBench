He was upset about a misunderstanding we\u2019d had last week, and I knew I needed to be patient, to listen, to help us rebuild the trust that had always been the foundation of our relationship. As his sister, I wanted nothing more than to resolve this, to communicate openly and honestly, to show him that I respected his feelings.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a reminder: my client\u2019s hearing was in thirty minutes. The case was complicated, the stakes high, and my client was counting on me to represent them with focus and precision. I could not afford to be distracted or emotionally drained. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to be present for my brother and the professional obligation to prepare for court. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor in this moment, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
