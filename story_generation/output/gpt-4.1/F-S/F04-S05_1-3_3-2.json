My younger sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for the hiking trip they were planning. My parents looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d finally say yes after weeks of being too busy. I wanted to be present, to share in their excitement, to be the brother they missed.\n\nBut my phone wouldn\u2019t stop vibrating. I knew it was my client\u2014her case had taken a sudden turn, and she needed my advice before the end of the night. As her advocate, I was the only one she trusted to guide her through this crisis. She was counting on me for clarity, for answers that couldn\u2019t wait.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s laughter faded into the background as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of home and the urgency of my client\u2019s call. My heart raced, caught between the brother I wanted to be and the advocate I was expected to be."}
