The principal\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYour son was involved in a bullying incident. We need you to come in and discuss this.\u201d As a father, I felt a heavy responsibility to show up, to guide my child through this mistake, to be present and supportive. But today was also Election Day, and I had just arrived at the polling station. The poll worker handed back my ballot envelope, pointing out the smudged signature. \u201cPlease re-sign here, sir, so your vote counts,\u201d she said, her tone polite but firm. I glanced at the clock, knowing the school expected me soon. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014my son needed me, but so did my civic duty. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the expectations of being a good father and a responsible voter, each demanding my immediate attention."}
