My son\u2019s hopeful face flashed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days for this Nintendo, and I\u2019d promised, after months of saving, that today would be the day. I could almost hear his excited laughter, see the way he\u2019d hug me, grateful and proud. But as I reached for the box, my phone vibrated again, this time with frantic messages from my fellow activists. The police had started blocking the exits at the protest downtown, and panic was spreading. I was supposed to be there, helping coordinate a safe response, making sure no one got hurt.
