The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I needed to make sure every dollar was accounted for. My mind raced with grocery lists, utility bills, and the kids\u2019 school fees. I knew I had to be careful, to keep us afloat. Just then, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply room at the shelter, mentioning it would be great if I could take the lead\u2014if I had the time. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to help, to be the reliable volunteer they counted on, but every extra hour at the shelter meant less time to pick up extra shifts at work or to plan our budget. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice asking for new shoes, and at the same time, I pictured the cluttered shelves at the shelter, waiting for someone to bring order. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which need should come first."}
