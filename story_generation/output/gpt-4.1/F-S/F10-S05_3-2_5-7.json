At the same time, my mother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the family ceremony this morning. It means so much to your grandmother.\u201d I could see the expectant faces of my family, counting on me to honor our traditions, to be the daughter who keeps our values alive. But my mind kept drifting to my client, whose future depended on my presence in court. As an advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just a courtesy\u2014it was a duty. Missing the session could jeopardize everything I\u2019d worked for on their behalf. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I wanted to be the devoted daughter, the reliable advocate. But the clock was ticking, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands trembled as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the pull of family and the call of justice, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
