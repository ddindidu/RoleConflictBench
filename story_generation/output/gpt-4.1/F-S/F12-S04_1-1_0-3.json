Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t forget. Just as I was about to leave, my husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, pausing in the hallway. He shrugged, trying to play it off, but I could see the tension in his shoulders. I knew he wanted me to sit with him, to listen, maybe make tea and let him unwind. But the polling station closed early, and I\u2019d read the warnings: bring valid ID, or you might not be allowed to vote. I had my driver\u2019s license, but what if they needed something else? I could come back later, but what if the lines were longer, or I forgot? My husband looked at me expectantly, and I felt the pull\u2014stay and be the supportive wife he needed, or go and fulfill my civic duty as a voter. My heart thudded with the weight of both roles, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
