At the same time, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the activist group: the vote on the bill we\u2019d been fighting for was happening in less than an hour, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call, to use my voice and experience to sway the decision. My heart pounded as I looked at my granddaughter, her hopefulness so fragile, and then at my phone, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. I wanted to be the wise, steady presence she needed, but I also felt the pull of my commitment to the cause, knowing how much was at stake.
