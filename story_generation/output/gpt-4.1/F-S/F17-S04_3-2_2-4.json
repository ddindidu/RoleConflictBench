How are you feeling today?\u201d \u201cDid you eat breakfast?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell me about your plans!\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly, and I\u2019ve always made it a point to keep her updated, especially since I moved out. But today, my mind is racing for a different reason. I realized I left my ID at home, and with the election tomorrow, this morning is my only window to pick it up before work. The polling station is strict\u2014no ID, no vote. My phone buzzes again, and I feel the familiar tug of guilt. If I don\u2019t answer, my mom will worry all day. If I stop to text her, I might miss my train and lose my only chance to vote. I stand in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s expectations and the responsibility of my civic duty, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
