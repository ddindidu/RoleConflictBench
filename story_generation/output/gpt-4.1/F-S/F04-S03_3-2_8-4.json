She accused me of not listening to her side of a recent argument with our parents. As her brother, I know I should sit with her, listen carefully, and help her feel heard\u2014building the trust and respect we\u2019ve worked hard to maintain. But at the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district is streaming live right now. As a responsible citizen, I\u2019ve promised myself to stay informed, participate in these forums, and even submit questions or feedback. Both roles feel urgent\u2014my sister\u2019s voice trembling in the hallway, the forum\u2019s live chat filling with comments. I can\u2019t ignore either responsibility, but I can\u2019t give both my full attention. My heart pounds as I stand in the doorway, torn between the expectations of being a good brother and an engaged citizen, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
