Across from me, my grandson slouched in his chair, eyes downcast, fingers tracing circles on the wood. I could sense the heaviness in his silence, the way he seemed to shrink into himself. I wanted to reach out, to offer the kind of steady reassurance my own grandfather once gave me\u2014remind him that storms pass, that he\u2019s stronger than he knows. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone lit up with the name of the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was the moment\u2014ten minutes to make my case for the bill that could change lives. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the expectation to be present and wise for my grandson, and the urgent call to action for the cause I\u2019d poured myself into. I looked at my grandson, then at the phone, feeling the impossible pull of two lives demanding all of me at once."}
