He needed me\u2014needed my words, my touch, my unwavering presence. I tried to listen, to reassure him, to be the anchor he so desperately sought. As we passed a bench, he pulled a crumpled tissue from his pocket, wiped his eyes, and, distracted by his pain, let it fall to the ground. I saw the no-littering sign just a few steps away, the trash bin within easy reach. My heart twisted. I knew I should pick it up, respect the rules, set an example as a responsible citizen. But if I broke away, even for a moment, would he feel abandoned? Would he think I cared more about a rule than his suffering? The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to him, my duty to the community. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of a loving wife and a conscientious citizen, my mind racing as I tried to decide which role to honor in this moment."}
