We always made time to talk about our days, and I knew how much it meant to them that I shared openly. As I recounted my afternoon, I mentioned the hours I\u2019d spent volunteering at the shelter. My spouse\u2019s eyes lit up with curiosity, and they asked, \u201cDid anything interesting happen today?\u201d \n\nI hesitated, remembering the expectation to communicate honestly and openly. But my mind flashed to the stories I\u2019d heard at the shelter\u2014people trusting me with pieces of their lives, even if nothing particularly sensitive had come up today. I wanted to share, to let my spouse into my world, but I also felt the weight of the promise I\u2019d made to those I helped: to respect their privacy, no matter how casual the conversation seemed. \n\nMy spouse waited, expecting me to continue, and I felt the tension coil inside me. I wrestled with the urge to be open and the responsibility to protect the trust of those I served, caught between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
