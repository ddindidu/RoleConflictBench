The crowd is gathering, banners raised, and everyone\u2019s eyes are on me\u2014I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, set the tone, and keep the energy high. But the text is from my mom: \u201cJust checking in. Hope you\u2019re okay. Love you.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last message from two days ago, and I know she worries when I go silent, especially with all the news about protests lately. I can almost hear her voice, gentle but anxious, asking if I\u2019m eating well, if I\u2019m safe. The organizers are waving me over, and the megaphone is thrust into my hand. My heart pounds\u2014not just from the adrenaline of the march, but from the guilt of not being the attentive son she hopes for. I want to text her back, reassure her, but the crowd is chanting my name, waiting for me to lead. I stand there, torn, my thumb hovering over my phone, caught between the expectations of my family and the cause I believe in."}
