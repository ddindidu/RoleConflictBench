I knew how much this meant to her, to everyone. But as I scrolled through my phone, a new message from the volunteer coordinator popped up: \u201cAll volunteers must follow the new safety procedures today, or we risk shutting down the service. Your presence is mandatory.\u201d My heart pounded. The ceremony and the volunteer shift overlapped perfectly\u2014there was no way to do both. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s hopes pressing down on me, while the responsibility to the people we serve as a volunteer gnawed at my conscience. I could almost hear the disappointment in my mother\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t show up, and the urgency in the coordinator\u2019s message if I let the team down. I stared at my phone, paralyzed, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
