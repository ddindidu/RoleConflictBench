My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my client, desperate for reassurance before tomorrow\u2019s trial. As a child, I was expected to be present, to honor our family\u2019s customs, to help set the table and share stories, just as I had every year. But as an advocate, I knew my client\u2019s future hinged on my preparation tonight; the trial was in the morning, and there were still documents to review, arguments to refine. My father caught my eye, smiling, expecting me to join the toast. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the devoted child, but the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed on me. I felt torn, the warmth of family pulling me one way, the gravity of my professional duty pulling me another. I stared at my phone, then at my family, feeling the impossible tension between who I was to them and who I needed to be for someone else."}
