My grandson just won a big award at school, and they want to celebrate with music and laughter in our apartment. As a grandmother, I feel the pull to be present, to clap along, to make this moment special for him. He looks at me with those hopeful eyes, waiting for my approval to turn up his favorite song and dance with the family. But as a citizen, I know our building\u2019s quiet hours start at 9 p.m., and it\u2019s already past eight-thirty. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open, and she\u2019s mentioned before how noise carries at night. I can almost hear her sigh of frustration if we get too loud. My heart aches, caught between the joy of my family and the responsibility I feel toward my neighbors. I want to be the grandmother who celebrates every milestone, but I also want to be the neighbor who respects the rules and the peace of others. The music speaker sits on the table, and everyone looks to me, waiting for my answer."}
