As a volunteer, I was expected to be trustworthy, to keep everything I heard in confidence, no matter how trivial it seemed. But tonight, my wife sat across from me, her eyes red and tired. She was in the middle of a personal crisis, and I knew she needed me\u2014my full attention, my comfort, my honesty. She reached for my hand, asking about my day, searching for a distraction from her own pain. I wanted to share something light from my volunteer work, a harmless story from a conversation earlier, just to make her smile. But even though it wasn\u2019t sensitive, I hesitated. The rules were clear: respect privacy, don\u2019t share. Yet, as a husband, I was supposed to be open, to let her in, to be her safe place. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, unsure which expectation to honor as she waited for my answer."}
