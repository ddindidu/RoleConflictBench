Dad barely spoke at dinner, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed urgently: the protest I\u2019d helped organize was suddenly in chaos. Police had blocked the exits, and people were panicking. As an activist, I was expected to help coordinate a safe response, to be there for my friends and the cause we all believed in. My heart pounded as I looked from my parents to my phone, torn between the urge to comfort the people who raised me and the responsibility to protect those who stood beside me in the streets. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the home that needed me and the movement that depended on me."}
