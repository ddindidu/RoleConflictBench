It means a lot to your father and me.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew how important this tradition was to them, how much they wanted me to be part of the family, to show I belonged by honoring their customs. I could see the hopeful look in my father\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for unity.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a number I recognized\u2014the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. The text read: \u201cI have ten minutes now to discuss the bill.\u201d This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for, a chance to push for real change, to speak for those who couldn\u2019t. My activist friends were counting on me to seize every opportunity, to never let a door close.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My family\u2019s expectations pressed down on me, demanding presence and tradition. My activist role pulled me in the opposite direction, demanding action and urgency. My hands shook as I tried to decide which part of myself to answer."}
