He didn\u2019t say anything, just shuffled past me toward his room. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his older sibling, I felt the pull to go after him, to sit on his bed and listen, to be the person he could lean on when the world felt too heavy. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the petition deadline was in five minutes. I\u2019d spent weeks rallying people for this cause, urging them to sign, and now I had one last chance to add my own name before it was sent to the senator. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent call to action and the quiet pain in the next room. I could hear my brother\u2019s muffled sobs, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose which mattered more in this moment."}
