My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they needed me\u2014just to listen, to reassure them, to be present. I wanted to sit with them, ask about their day, and offer the comfort I knew they craved. But as I cleared the dishes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey about the new bus routes was closing soon. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, to help shape the community and make sure voices like mine were heard. The survey would take time and thought, and I felt the weight of responsibility as a citizen pressing against the pull of my family\u2019s needs. My heart ached, torn between the urge to be the daughter my parents needed and the citizen my city expected. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, listening to the quiet hum of the house, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
