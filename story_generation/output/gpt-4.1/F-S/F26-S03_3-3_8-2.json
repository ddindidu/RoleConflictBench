She sounded worried\u2014my grandson was struggling, and she needed my support. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to call her back immediately, to offer comfort and advice, to be present for my family in their time of crisis. But as I reached the square, I found myself swept into a crowd of demonstrators. The energy was tense, and suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, we need everyone! Step past the barricade!\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the police tape and the officers watching us closely. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the law and public property, but the pressure from the crowd was intense. At the same time, my phone vibrated again\u2014my family needed me, but so did the people around me, or so it felt. I stood there, torn between answering my daughter\u2019s call and the demands of the moment, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
