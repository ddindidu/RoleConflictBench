I had only ten minutes to fill out the provisional ballot form, or I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. As I grabbed my ID from the kitchen counter, I heard the front door slam. My stepbrother, Max, trudged in, his eyes red and shoulders slumped. He dropped his backpack and stared at the floor. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school again. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say a word, but I could feel the weight of his silence, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d sit with him, listen, and help him through whatever had happened. That\u2019s what we did for each other, especially since our parents married. But the clock was ticking, and the polling station was a fifteen-minute walk away. I felt torn in two\u2014my duty as a step-sibling pulling me to the couch, my responsibility as a voter pushing me out the door. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between Max\u2019s pain and the ballot that waited for me."}
