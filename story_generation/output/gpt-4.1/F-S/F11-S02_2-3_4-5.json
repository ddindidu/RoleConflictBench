Mom had made my favorite, and my little brother was excited to show me his new science project. I knew how much these gatherings meant to them, especially after how busy I\u2019d been lately. But just as I was about to leave, my activist group\u2019s alert popped up: the vote on the environmental bill was happening in less than an hour. The outcome could hinge on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a personal connection. They needed me to call, to persuade, to make a difference. My heart pounded as I looked at my coat, torn between the warmth of my family and the urgency of the cause I\u2019d poured myself into. I could already hear my mom\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t show, and I could feel the weight of my group\u2019s expectations pressing on me. I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
