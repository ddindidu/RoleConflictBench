My mother reminded me, as she always did, that it was my turn to lead the ritual this year\u2014a tradition passed down for generations. I felt the weight of her expectations, the pride in her eyes, and the unspoken rule that I must not let our heritage fade. As we reached a quiet spot, my uncle handed me a bundle of incense and paper offerings, explaining that burning them here, under the old tree, would honor our ancestors best. I glanced at the nearby trash bin and the bright no-littering signs, remembering the city\u2019s strict rules about open flames and litter in public spaces. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s hopeful faces to the official warnings. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and respecting the laws and shared spaces of my community."}
