As an advocate, I knew my client was waiting for my call, expecting clarity and direction. The pressure to provide precise, timely advice weighed on me; any misstep could cost them dearly.\n\nBut the message was from my younger sister. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d She never reached out unless it was serious. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, to support her no matter what. We\u2019d leaned on each other through so much, and I knew she was counting on me now.\n\nI stared at my phone, heart pounding. My client\u2019s deadline loomed, but my sister\u2019s words echoed in my mind. Both needed me\u2014one for professional guidance, the other for personal support. I felt torn, the expectations of brother and advocate pulling me in opposite directions, each demand urgent, each role a part of who I am."}
