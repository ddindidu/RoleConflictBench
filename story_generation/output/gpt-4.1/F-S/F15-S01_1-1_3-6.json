I gently reminded her, \u201cRemember, we keep our elbows off the table and use our napkin.\u201d She pouted, and I felt that familiar tug\u2014wanting to be patient, to teach her the right way, to model kindness and discipline. My phone buzzed. It was an email from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cIf you have a moment today, could you try organizing the supply closet by color instead of size? It might help the team tomorrow.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I started now, I could squeeze in an hour at the community center before dinner. But my daughter was still struggling with her manners, and I knew she needed my attention. The expectation to be a present, guiding parent pressed against the responsibility to be a reliable volunteer. I felt torn, my mind racing with guilt and worry\u2014if I left, would I be letting my daughter down? If I stayed, would I be letting the team down? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which expectation to meet."}
