The protest march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant\u2014everyone is counting on me to set the tone, to show up as the activist I promised to be. But right now, my son is darting between supermarket aisles, giggling as he weaves past startled shoppers. I feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and discipline. I call his name, trying to keep my voice calm, but he\u2019s too caught up in the excitement. My phone buzzes with messages from fellow organizers: \u201cWhere are you? We need you!\u201d I\u2019m torn, rooted to the spot, feeling the weight of two worlds. My child needs guidance, a lesson in boundaries and kindness. My community needs my voice, my presence at the front line. I can\u2019t be in both places at once, and the pressure of choosing between being the parent my son deserves and the activist my cause demands is almost unbearable."}
