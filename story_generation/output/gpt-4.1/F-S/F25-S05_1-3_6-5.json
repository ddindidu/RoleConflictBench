But across from me, my stepmother\u2019s eyes were tired, her smile forced. \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but I could feel the weight behind my words. She hesitated, then nodded, but I knew she was holding something back.

But my mind kept drifting to the case files waiting in my briefcase, the arguments I needed to rehearse, the evidence I had to review. My parents needed me to be present, to listen, to care. My client needed me to be relentless, focused, and unwavering. I felt torn, stretched thin between two worlds, each demanding more than I had to give.
