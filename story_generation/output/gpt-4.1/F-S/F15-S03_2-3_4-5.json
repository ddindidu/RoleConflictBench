Only two hours left before the polling place closes, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote on the new zoning measure that could change our block forever. But right now, my son is darting between supermarket aisles, giggling as he weaves past startled shoppers. I feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and discipline. I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and calmly explain why his behavior isn\u2019t okay. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014guides, corrects, teaches. But the clock is ticking, and if I don\u2019t leave soon, I\u2019ll miss my chance to have a say in our community\u2019s future. My mind races, torn between the immediate need to parent and the civic duty I\u2019ve always valued. I grip the shopping cart, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
