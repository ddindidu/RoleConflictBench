He\u2019d just had another argument with our parents, and I could see he needed someone to listen. But before I could say anything, a client approached, her voice barely above a whisper as she confided a private concern about her living situation. She looked at me with pleading eyes, trusting me to keep her secret. My brother, impatient and hurt, hovered nearby, waiting for me to acknowledge him, to show him the patience and understanding he\u2019d come to expect from me as his brother. But the client\u2019s words weighed heavily on me\u2014I knew I had to respect her privacy, to keep her trust. I felt torn, my brother\u2019s need for support clashing with my responsibility to the client. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectations of both roles, feeling the pressure mount with every passing second."}
