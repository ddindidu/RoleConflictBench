I knew I should listen closely, ask questions, and show I cared\u2014open communication is something we promised each other. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind\u2014everyone must be on time, no exceptions, the roster is tight. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My partner\u2019s voice faded into the background as I weighed my options. If I cut the conversation short, I\u2019d hurt their feelings and break our trust. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the team and possibly disrupt the whole shift. My chest tightened as I tried to focus on both worlds at once, feeling the pressure of being needed in two places, in two different ways, at exactly the same time."}
