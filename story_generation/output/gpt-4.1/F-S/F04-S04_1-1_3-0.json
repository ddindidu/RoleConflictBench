My sister\u2019s eyes lit up as she suggested a picnic at the park, and everyone chimed in with excitement. I knew how much these moments meant to them\u2014my parents always said weekends were for family, and I\u2019d promised to be more present. But as the conversation buzzed around me, my phone buzzed too: a reminder that today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but my family wanted to leave for the park early to get a good spot. \n\nMy brother nudged me, \u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I nodded, but my mind raced. If I left to vote before we went, I\u2019d delay everyone and dampen the mood. If I waited until after, I risked running late or missing my chance if something came up. I felt torn\u2014my family expected me to be there, fully present, but my duty as a voter tugged at me too. The weight of both roles pressed on me as I tried to smile, hiding the storm of indecision inside."}
