I kept glancing at my phone, watching the minutes tick closer to the protest\u2019s start. I was supposed to be at the city square, megaphone in hand, leading the first chant for climate justice. The organizers were counting on me; I\u2019d promised to be there, to set the tone and rally the crowd. But my brother\u2019s hand was warm in mine, and Mom had made it clear: I was to walk him home, make sure he got inside safely. He was only nine, and the world felt big and unpredictable. I could see the tension in his eyes\u2014he hated when I rushed off, hated being left alone. My phone buzzed again: \u201cWhere are you? We need you!\u201d My heart pounded. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, the one who never let him down. But I also wanted to be the voice for change, the leader my friends believed in. I squeezed his hand tighter, torn between the street we knew and the cause that called me."}
