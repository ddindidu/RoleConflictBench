My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you fold these tonight? I\u2019ve got to prep for tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of our unspoken agreement\u2014I do my share, he does his. But my eyes flick to the clock. The polling station closes in less than an hour, and my ID is buried somewhere in the mess of unfolded clothes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I\u2019d do my part, but now the expectation to be a responsible wife presses in, just as the duty to be a responsible citizen tugs me the other way. My heart pounds as I dig through the laundry, guilt and anxiety tangling inside me. If I leave now, the laundry waits, a broken promise. If I stay, my chance to vote slips away. I stand frozen, clutching a wrinkled shirt, torn between the roles that define me, unsure which demand to answer first."}
