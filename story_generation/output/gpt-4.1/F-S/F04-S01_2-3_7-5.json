He\u2019d been upset, feeling like I never trusted him enough to share what was really going on in my life. I wanted to build mutual respect between us, to be patient and understanding of our differences, but it was hard when he pressed for details I couldn\u2019t give. Now, as a volunteer at the clinic, I was sorting through confidential medical files, my brother texting me again, asking about my day and why I seemed so distant. He wanted to know more, to feel included, but I was bound by my promise to respect the privacy of the people I was helping. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my brother\u2019s expectation for openness and trust, and my duty to protect the confidentiality of those I served. My phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, torn between the urge to reassure my brother and the responsibility I owed to the clinic. The two worlds felt impossibly far apart, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice between them."}
