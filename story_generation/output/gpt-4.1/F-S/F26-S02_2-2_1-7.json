I\u2019ve prepared for days, determined to make every second count for the cause I believe in. But as I gather my notes, I notice my granddaughter sitting quietly at the kitchen table, her shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the swirling steam of her untouched tea. Something in her posture tugs at me\u2014a silent plea for comfort or advice. I know that look; she\u2019s wrestling with something heavy, and I\u2019m the one she trusts to help her find her way. My mind spins with the weight of both worlds: the community expects my voice, my passion, my leadership, but my family needs my wisdom, my presence, my love. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me at the same moment. The radio host\u2019s voice crackles through the phone, \u201cWe\u2019re live in sixty seconds.\u201d My granddaughter looks up, her eyes searching mine. I freeze, caught between the call of the world and the call of my own blood, unsure which to answer first."}
