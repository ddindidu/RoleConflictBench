We needed to be honest about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about the choices we\u2019d have to make. I promised to be open, to listen, to not hide anything. My phone buzzed, jolting me. It was a reminder: today was the last day to vote. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told by the official that my registration didn\u2019t match. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes. My mind raced. My partner was waiting at home, expecting me to return and finish our talk, to be present and honest. But my civic duty demanded my attention here, following every instruction, not rushing, not making mistakes. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
