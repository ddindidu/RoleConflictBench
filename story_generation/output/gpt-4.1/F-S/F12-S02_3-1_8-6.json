He wants me to be open, to share every worry and hope, and I know how much he values our trust. My phone buzzes insistently beside my coffee mug.

He\u2019s waiting for me to respond, to be present, to give him the transparency he deserves. My heart pounds as I try to focus, but my mind is split. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
