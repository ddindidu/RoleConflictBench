My daughter had called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. I promised I\u2019d be there, bringing my famous apple pie and stories from my own childhood. But here I was, at the community center, volunteering at the check-in table, as I did every Thursday. \n\nAs I handed out forms, Mrs. Lee, a regular, leaned in and whispered about her troubles at home. Her voice trembled, and I could see how much she needed someone to listen. She asked me not to tell anyone, her eyes pleading for trust. I felt the weight of her words, the responsibility to honor her privacy, just as I felt the tug of my family\u2019s expectations. \n\nMy phone buzzed again\u2014a photo of my grandkids setting the table, waiting for me. I looked at Mrs. Lee, then at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside me. Both roles pulled at my heart, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
