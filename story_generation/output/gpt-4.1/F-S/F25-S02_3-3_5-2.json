My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014messages from my activist group. The protest downtown had taken a turn; police were blocking exits, and people needed guidance to stay safe. I was supposed to be there, helping coordinate our response, making sure no one got hurt. My stepmother\u2019s expectation weighed on me: to honor the family, to prove I belonged. But my friends at the protest needed me, too. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the warmth of family acceptance and the urgent call to action for justice. Both sides demanded all of me, right now, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
