She was beaming, holding an envelope, eager to share her news with the whole family. I could see the anticipation in their eyes, and I felt the warmth of being needed, of being present for these moments that knit us together. Just as she began to speak, the city\u2019s emergency sirens wailed, and the building alarms blared. The news anchor\u2019s voice crackled from the TV: a flash-flood warning, water rising fast along our block. As a citizen, I knew I should help my neighbors, check on the elderly next door, and follow the evacuation plan. But as a grandmother, I saw my family\u2019s faces\u2014my daughter\u2019s trembling hands, my grandchildren\u2019s wide eyes\u2014waiting for me to share in their joy and reassure them. My heart pounded, torn between the pull of family and the call of civic duty, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
