He asked about my day, and I hesitated, feeling the weight of everything I couldn\u2019t say. I wanted to be open, to share the tension that had been building all afternoon, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. Messages from fellow activists flashed on the screen: the police had started blocking the exits at the protest site, and panic was spreading. I was supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to keep everyone calm and organized, but here I was, expected to be present, honest, and attentive as a wife. My husband looked at me, waiting for an answer, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to reassure him, to be the partner he needed, but my mind raced with strategies and escape routes. The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, unsure which voice to answer first."}
