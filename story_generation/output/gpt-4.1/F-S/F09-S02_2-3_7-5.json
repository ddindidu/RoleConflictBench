My son tugs at my sleeve, asking if we can have his favorite cereal tomorrow, and I force a smile, promising I\u2019ll try. The rent is due in three days, and my paycheck from the caf\u00e9 barely covers groceries. I know I should call my manager and ask for an extra shift\u2014maybe I can pick up a few hours tonight and make up the difference. \n\nBut my phone buzzes with a message from the activist group: the vote is happening now, earlier than expected. The legislation could change everything for families like mine, but only if we convince the undecided representative. They need me to call, to share my story, to be the voice for so many who can\u2019t speak up. \n\nMy heart pounds. If I don\u2019t act now, the chance will be gone. But if I don\u2019t work, my family might go without. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I stand frozen, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the urgent call to fight for something bigger."}
