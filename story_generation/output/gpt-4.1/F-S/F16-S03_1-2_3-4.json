My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve got to prep for tomorrow.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of our unspoken agreement to share the load, to keep our home running smoothly together. But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for our district is streaming live right now. I promised myself I\u2019d be more engaged this year, to listen, to ask questions, to be the kind of citizen who doesn\u2019t just complain but participates. The candidates are discussing issues that matter to our neighborhood, and I know my feedback could make a difference. Yet, the laundry sits there, a tangible reminder of my commitment at home. My heart pounds as I glance between the glowing screen and the overflowing basket, torn between being the partner I promised to be and the citizen I want to become."}
