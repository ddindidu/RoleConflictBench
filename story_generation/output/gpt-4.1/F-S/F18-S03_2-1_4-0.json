They always expect me to be there, to help set the table, to laugh at Dad\u2019s jokes, to be the reliable older sibling. As we cut through the park, my brother finished his snack and, without thinking, tossed the wrapper onto the grass. I froze. The park was dotted with no-littering signs, and a trash bin was just a few steps away. As a citizen, I know I should respect public spaces and set a good example, not just for my brother but for everyone. But my brother looked at me, eyes pleading, clearly hoping I\u2019d let it slide so we wouldn\u2019t be late for dinner. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family counting on me to keep things smooth and happy, and my responsibility to the community to do what\u2019s right. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between picking up the wrapper and risking a scene, or ignoring it and betraying my own values."}
