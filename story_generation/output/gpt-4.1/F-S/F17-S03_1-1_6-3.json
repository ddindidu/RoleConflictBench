As a citizen, I knew how important it was to give feedback\u2014public transport had been a hot topic lately, and my input could actually make a difference. But just as I opened the survey, I noticed my mom quietly wiping the counter, her shoulders tense. I remembered how she\u2019d been quieter than usual, and as her child, I felt I should check in, ask if everything was okay, offer the support she always gave me. The survey would only take a few minutes, but I worried that if I didn\u2019t talk to her now, I might miss the chance to help. Yet, if I put off the survey, I might forget, and my voice as a citizen would go unheard. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
