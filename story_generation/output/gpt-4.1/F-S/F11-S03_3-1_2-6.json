I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get everything organized early this year, and the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend was another chance to do my part for public health. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice reminding me how important it is to contribute to the community, to set an example. \n\nBut then my phone buzzed. It was my sister, her message shaky and urgent\u2014she needed me. She\u2019d always been there for me, and we\u2019d promised to support each other, no matter what. I knew she was going through a rough patch, and she was reaching out now, trusting I\u2019d be there. \n\nI stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure build. If I went to her, I\u2019d miss the clinic and fall behind on my taxes. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to my sister, my duty to my community\u2014caught in the middle, unsure which role to choose."}
