My family gathered around, laughter and stories echoing off the walls. This was our tradition\u2014every year, no matter what, we came together. My parents expected me to be present, to listen, to honor the rituals that shaped our family. But tonight, my phone buzzed with reminders: the online candidate forum for our district was streaming live. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to watch, to stay informed, to participate in the civic process and maybe even ask a question. My father caught my distracted glance at the screen and frowned, expecting my full attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for togetherness and my duty to engage as a responsible citizen. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the choice, torn between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and fulfilling my civic obligations."}
