His eyes were clouded with worry as he explained the dilemma at work\u2014his boss had asked him to lead a project he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle. He needed me, not just to listen, but to reassure him, to help him believe he could do it. I could see how much he was struggling, and I wanted nothing more than to stay, to offer the comfort and encouragement he deserved.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was supposed to be there on time, to set an example and help with the morning setup. I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I also knew how much the organization relied on my reliability. My heart twisted as I glanced between my husband and the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my fellow volunteers down. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
