I glanced at my phone\u2014flash-flood warning. The water was already creeping up the street, swirling around the tires of parked cars. My parents sat on the couch, faces drawn and anxious. Lately, they\u2019d seemed so much older, weighed down by worries they wouldn\u2019t share. I knew they needed me, just to sit with them, to reassure them that everything would be okay.\n\nBut outside, neighbors were gathering, some already moving sandbags, others calling for help. As a citizen, I felt the pull to join them, to do my part for the community, to help keep everyone safe. Yet, every time I moved toward the door, I caught my mother\u2019s eyes\u2014wide, searching, silently pleading for comfort. My father\u2019s hand trembled as he scrolled through the news.
