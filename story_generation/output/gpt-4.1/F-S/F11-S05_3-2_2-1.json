As an advocate, I knew I needed to focus, to provide the clear, precise advice my client depended on. But the message was from my younger sister: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d She never reached out like this unless it was serious. My heart twisted. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, to be there no matter what. I glanced at the clock; my client was expecting a call in twenty minutes, and I still hadn\u2019t finished preparing my notes. My mind raced with the demands of both roles\u2014my sister\u2019s voice in my head, raw and vulnerable, and my client\u2019s trust, heavy on my shoulders. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. I wanted to be the sister she needed, but I couldn\u2019t ignore my professional responsibility. My hands hovered over the phone, caught between answering her call and returning to my work, the weight of both expectations making it hard to breathe."}
