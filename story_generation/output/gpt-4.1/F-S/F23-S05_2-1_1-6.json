She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on from the back of the classroom. As her step-parent, I knew how much it meant to her, especially since she\u2019d only just started calling me \u201cMom.\u201d But then my phone buzzed: a reminder for the advocacy meeting, the one I couldn\u2019t miss without letting down the clients who depended on me. The meeting was at the same time as Lily\u2019s open class. My supervisor had already warned me about punctuality, and my clients needed my voice in that room. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014Lily\u2019s trust and excitement on one side, the weight of my professional responsibility on the other. My chest tightened as I imagined disappointing either side, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would feel let down. I sat at the kitchen table, the invitation to Lily\u2019s class in one hand and my work phone in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
