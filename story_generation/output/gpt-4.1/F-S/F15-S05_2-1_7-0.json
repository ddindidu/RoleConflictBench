As a parent, I knew the bills were piling up at home\u2014groceries, rent, my daughter\u2019s school trip. My family depended on me to keep us afloat, and every dollar mattered. But as an advocate, I was supposed to give my clients honest, thorough legal advice, even during these quick, informal consultations. Today, a client sat across from me, desperate for answers, but unwilling or unable to pay for a full session. I could give a general overview, skirt the details, and move on\u2014maybe squeeze in more clients, earn a bit more, and help my family. But I also knew that wasn\u2019t what my role as an advocate demanded. My heart twisted as I looked at the client\u2019s anxious face, feeling the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing against the duty I owed to those who came to me for help. The two worlds collided inside me, and I hesitated, caught between the expectations of my home and my profession."}
