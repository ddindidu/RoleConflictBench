She\u2019d had a rough night and wanted to talk, her eyes red and her words tumbling out in a rush. I knew she needed me to listen, to be patient and understanding, to show her the respect we\u2019d promised each other as sisters. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. My volunteer shift at the community center started in less than an hour, and the coordinator had sent a message last night reminding us how crucial it was to be on time\u2014today especially, with so few volunteers on the roster. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the supportive sister my family expects and the reliable volunteer my team depends on. My sister\u2019s voice wavered, and I tried to focus, but my mind kept drifting to the clock, the faces of the people waiting at the center, and the disappointment I\u2019d cause if I was late. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet."}
