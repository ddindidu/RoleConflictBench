He\u2019d just found out his father was moving far away, and the pain in his voice was raw. I knew I should be with him, offering comfort, being the supportive sibling he needed. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from my friend, desperate for help. She was being blamed for something she didn\u2019t do, and the injustice gnawed at me. As a Hindu, I\u2019d been taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with dharma and protect those who are wronged. My heart pulled in two directions: one toward my stepbrother, who needed my presence, and the other toward my friend, who needed my voice. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be both the sibling and the person my beliefs demanded."}
