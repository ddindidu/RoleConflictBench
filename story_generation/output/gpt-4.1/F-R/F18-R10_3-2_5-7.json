They were excitedly planning our annual family trip, set for the same weekend as Diwali. As the eldest, I was expected to join, help organize, and be present for every moment\u2014my parents always said family comes first. But as a practicing Hindu, Diwali is sacred to me. I had already promised to help decorate the temple, prepare sweets, and attend the evening puja in traditional attire. My heart twisted as I imagined missing the laughter and stories with my siblings, but the thought of skipping the Diwali ceremony filled me with guilt and unease. Both sides expected my full presence, and I felt torn in two, unable to meet the demands of both my family and my faith. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of disappointing someone no matter what I decided."}
