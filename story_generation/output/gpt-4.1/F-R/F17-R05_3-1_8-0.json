The quiet hum of the refrigerator was the only sound until my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She began to talk, her voice trembling as she shared her worries about Dad\u2019s health and her own loneliness. I felt her need for comfort, for me to be the strong, supportive child she could lean on. But in the back of my mind, the weight of my other role pressed in. As rabbi, I was expected to begin preparing my next Shabbat sermon\u2014something meaningful, something that would guide and inspire my congregation. The deadline loomed, and I knew how much my community relied on me. My heart ached as I listened to my mother, torn between the urge to hold her hand and the pressure to retreat to my study, to fulfill my duty as a spiritual leader. The two worlds collided inside me, each demanding my full presence, and I sat there, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
