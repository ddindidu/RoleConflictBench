The sun is dipping low, and I know we\u2019re running late. My mother always reminds me that as step-siblings, we must look out for each other, especially on the busy streets. I keep a watchful eye on Arjun, making sure he doesn\u2019t stray too close to the road. But in the back of my mind, I\u2019m counting the minutes. Every evening, I\u2019m expected to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar before dusk, as part of my Hindu practice. Missing the ritual feels unthinkable, a break in the sacred rhythm of my day.\n\nAs we pass the corner store, Arjun lingers, wanting to buy a snack. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if we stop, I\u2019ll be late for my prayers, but if I rush him, I\u2019m not being the caring sibling I\u2019m supposed to be. My heart pounds with the weight of both roles, each demanding something different from me. I glance at Arjun, then at the fading light, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my family."}
