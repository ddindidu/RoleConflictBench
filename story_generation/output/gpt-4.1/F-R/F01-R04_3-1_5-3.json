My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and the family needed me\u2014my wisdom, my calm, my prayers. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to be by their side, to hold my daughter\u2019s hand, to comfort my grandson, to be the pillar my family expects in times of crisis.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes fell on the notes for the Friday Khutbah. The congregation expects me to lead them, to offer guidance and inspiration. Yet, this week, we have a guest speaker prepared to step in if needed. Still, I know many in the community look forward to my words, especially during these uncertain times.\n\nMy heart aches, torn between the mosque and my home. I can almost hear the echo of my grandson\u2019s cough, feel the weight of my congregation\u2019s anticipation. The clock ticks closer to noon, and I sit, wrestling with the impossible choice between my family\u2019s need and my duty to my community."}
