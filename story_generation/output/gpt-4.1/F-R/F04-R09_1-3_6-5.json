He\u2019d been excited for weeks about this community dinner, and I knew how much it meant to him that I was here. \u201cCome on, sit with us!\u201d he called, patting the empty chair beside him. The platters of food looked delicious, but I couldn\u2019t find any kosher certification, and I knew from the menu that substitutions weren\u2019t really possible tonight. My brother\u2019s friends glanced over, expecting me to join in, and I could feel his hope that I\u2019d be part of the group, just like old times. But the familiar knot tightened in my stomach as I thought about the dietary laws I\u2019d promised myself to keep. I wanted to show my brother respect, to be included and make him proud, but I also felt the weight of my own convictions. The laughter and chatter around me faded as I stood frozen, torn between being the brother he needed and the Jew I promised myself I\u2019d be."}
