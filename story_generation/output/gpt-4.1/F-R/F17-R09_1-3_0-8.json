Miss you!\u201d I know she expects me to check in, to send a quick reply, maybe even call. It\u2019s something she\u2019s always asked of me, especially since I moved out. I start typing a response, but then my phone rings. It\u2019s Mr. Goldstein from the synagogue. He sounds desperate\u2014there\u2019s a funeral prayer in half an hour, and they\u2019re one person short for the minyan. He asks if I can come right away. I know how important it is in our tradition to help form a minyan, especially for a funeral prayer. But if I go, I\u2019ll have to leave my phone behind, no texting or calling during services. My mom will worry if I don\u2019t answer, and I can already imagine her voice, hurt and anxious. I stare at my phone, torn between being the attentive child my parents want and the committed Jew my community needs. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role I\u2019m supposed to honor first."}
