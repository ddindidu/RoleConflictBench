She had an early meeting tomorrow, and our son needed his uniform clean for school. I knew the laundry couldn\u2019t wait. But as I reached for the detergent, I caught sight of the clock\u2014almost sunset. My heart skipped. This was the sacred time I set aside each day to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar, a practice my parents instilled in me since childhood. Missing it felt like neglecting a part of myself, a quiet betrayal of my faith. Yet, the thought of my wife\u2019s tired face and my son\u2019s disappointment tugged at me. I stood frozen, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the soft glow of the altar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
