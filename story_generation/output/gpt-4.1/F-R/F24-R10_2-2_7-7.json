He grinned at me, excitement in his eyes, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014my mom always said I should look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the family puja was in less than an hour. I was supposed to be home, dressed in my kurta, helping set up the offerings and lighting the lamps. My stepbrother begged me to stay, to spot him as he tried the new trick, but I could already hear my dad\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions and be on time for the ceremony. My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and the path home, torn between keeping my stepbrother safe and fulfilling my duty as a Hindu. I didn\u2019t know which expectation weighed heavier, but I knew I couldn\u2019t meet both."}
