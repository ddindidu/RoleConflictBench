As the eldest sister, I was expected to help organize everything, keep my younger siblings in line, and join every activity with a smile. My phone buzzed with a message from my boss: a last-minute work errand at the train station before we left. I rushed there, only to see a colleague quietly slip ahead in the ticket queue, ignoring the line. As a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to speak up when something was wrong, no matter how small. But my family was waiting, and I could already hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me not to be late or cause a scene. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between calling out the unfairness and hurrying back to my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
