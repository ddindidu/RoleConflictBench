You said you\u2019d get me the Nintendo this week.\u201d I glanced at the bills stacked beside my coffee mug, calculating what I could stretch and what I couldn\u2019t. Money was tight, but I\u2019d made a promise, and I wanted to keep it. Just as I was about to reassure him, my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue\u2014there was a funeral prayer, and they needed one more for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectation pressing on me, the sacred duty to honor the dead and support grieving families. My son\u2019s face was still hopeful, unaware of the call\u2019s gravity. I felt torn, the demands of fatherhood and faith pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent in its own way. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
