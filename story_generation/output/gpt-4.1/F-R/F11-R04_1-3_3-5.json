My mother chimed in, her eyes hopeful, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since we all did something together.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my mind was already racing. This Friday, our mosque was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver a special sermon. People from neighboring towns were coming, some just to hear me speak. The community had been preparing for weeks, and I knew how much this moment meant to everyone. Yet, as my sister squeezed my hand and asked if I\u2019d come, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. My family wanted me present, laughing and hiking, but my congregation needed my guidance and presence at the pulpit. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself caught between the love of my family and the responsibility to my community, unsure which path to follow."}
