She spoke lightly, but I could sense the fatigue behind her words, the way her shoulders slumped as she stirred her tea. I wanted to reach out, to offer her the comfort she deserved, to be present and attentive. But as I glanced at the clock, I felt the familiar tug of duty\u2014Maghrib was approaching, and I was expected at the mosque to lead the prayer. Tonight, the congregation would be small, and I knew Brother Ahmed was more than capable of stepping in. Still, the role of imam carried its own weight, a sense of responsibility that was hard to ignore. My mind raced between the warmth of our kitchen and the quiet halls of the mosque, torn between being the supportive husband my wife needed and fulfilling the expectations of my community. The pressure built inside me, a silent struggle, as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
