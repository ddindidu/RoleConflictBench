The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down. As a mother, I knew I had to ensure our financial stability\u2014my children depended on me to keep a roof over their heads. Every dollar counted, and I was already considering taking on extra work or cutting back on groceries.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was struggling again, her family in crisis, and she needed someone to talk to\u2014someone to listen, to pray, to offer hope. As her pastor, I was expected to be there, to provide unwavering support and guidance, no matter how tired or stretched I felt.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. My heart ached for Sarah, but my mind raced with worries about my own family. How could I be present for her when my own world felt so precarious? The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which need to answer first."}
