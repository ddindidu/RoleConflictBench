My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the situation\u2014our family needed me, my wisdom, my presence. As a grandfather, I felt the weight of their expectations, the need to be the pillar holding everyone together. Yet, as I listened, my mind kept drifting to what I had witnessed earlier that day: a neighbor, someone respected in our community, taking bribes and causing harm to innocent people. My heart pounded with the teachings of my faith\u2014dharma, truth, and justice. As a Hindu, I knew I could not ignore such wrongdoing. The urge to act, to speak out, gnawed at me, but so did the desperate need of my family for my support. I felt torn, my roles pulling me in opposite directions, my conscience wrestling with the impossible choice between standing by my family and upholding the moral principles I hold sacred."}
