My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the emergency\u2014my grandson was in the hospital, and she needed me. My heart ached with the urge to rush to their side, to hold my daughter\u2019s hand and comfort my frightened grandchild. Yet, just that morning, Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading the daily reflections for our retreat, a responsibility I knew was sacred and not easily passed to another. The sisters were counting on me for guidance and spiritual nourishment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the pull of my family\u2019s need, the call of my spiritual duty. My mind raced with questions\u2014could I abandon my sisters in their time of reflection? Could I turn away from my family when they needed me most? The expectations of both roles tangled inside me, leaving me suspended in a moment of painful indecision."}
