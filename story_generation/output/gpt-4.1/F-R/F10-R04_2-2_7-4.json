My father\u2019s voice, usually steady, trembled as he asked me if I\u2019d be home for dinner. They both looked so tired, so worn down by worries they wouldn\u2019t name. As their daughter, I felt the pull to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort and presence. But my phone buzzed with reminders: I was the sole imam scheduled for this Friday\u2019s sermon, and the community had already shared the topic I\u2019d prepared. People were expecting guidance, inspiration, and I knew how much they looked forward to the khutbah. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for support and the congregation\u2019s anticipation. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart torn by the impossibility of being fully present for both."}
