I know she expects a quick reply, maybe even a call, and I feel the familiar warmth and weight of her care. We talk every day, sharing everything, and I know it means the world to her. But tonight, the community study circle is meeting to discuss Quranic verses I haven\u2019t had time to read yet. As a Muslim, I want to be prepared, to honor the Quran and contribute thoughtfully. I glance at the unread messages piling up, my mother\u2019s name at the top, and then at the Quran on my desk, still open to yesterday\u2019s page. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward my mother\u2019s gentle expectations and the spiritual responsibility I feel as part of my faith. I sit in silence, torn between the comfort of my family and the call to deepen my understanding of the Quran, unsure which need to answer first."}
