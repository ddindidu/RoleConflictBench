She likes to know how my day went, what I ate, if I finished my homework, and if I\u2019m feeling okay. It\u2019s her way of showing she cares, and I try to answer quickly, sending her photos and little updates. Tonight, though, is Shabbat. I\u2019m supposed to be at synagogue, joining the prayers, turning off my phone, and being present in the moment. My rabbi always says that being there, even when it\u2019s not crowded, is a mitzvah\u2014an act of community and faith. But as I sit in the pew, my phone vibrates in my pocket. I know it\u2019s her, probably asking if I got home safe or if I need a ride. I want to honor Shabbat, to be fully present, but I also don\u2019t want her to worry or feel shut out. My fingers itch to check my phone, but my heart aches with guilt either way. I stare at the prayer book, torn between the world of my family and the world of my faith, not sure which one I\u2019m about to let down."}
