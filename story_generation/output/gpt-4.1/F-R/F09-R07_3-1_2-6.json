My heart sank as I read that my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. As a mother, I felt a surge of responsibility and shame. I needed to be there for my child, to understand what happened, to guide him, and to show the school that I took this seriously. Just as I was about to call the school, my phone rang again. It was Mei, my friend from the temple. She sounded excited, eager to discuss the sermon we\u2019d attended last night about compassion and non-harming. She wanted to meet for tea and reflection, something I\u2019d promised to do more often as part of my spiritual practice. I felt torn\u2014my role as a mother demanded immediate action and presence, while my Buddhist path called for calm reflection and community. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
