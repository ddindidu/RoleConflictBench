My wife calls from the hallway, her voice tinged with fatigue, \u201cCan you please start the laundry? The kids need clean clothes for tomorrow.\u201d I glance at the overflowing basket, guilt pricking at me. I promised her I\u2019d help more, and I know how much she\u2019s been juggling this week. But my study is littered with open books and scattered notes\u2014I haven\u2019t finished my sermon for tonight\u2019s Shabbat service. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, a message that will carry them through the week. I feel the weight of their anticipation pressing on my shoulders. My mind races, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the quiet, persistent needs of my family. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the hum of the washing machine and the echo of my unfinished sermon both demanding my attention."}
