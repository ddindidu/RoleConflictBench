At the same time, I could hear my stepbrother pacing in the next room, his anxiety almost palpable as he muttered formulas under his breath, preparing for his final exam tomorrow. I knew he needed me\u2014he always said I was the only one who could calm him down before big tests. But the thought of letting down the congregation, who trusted me to guide them in prayer, weighed heavily on my heart. My mind raced with the expectations: to be a source of comfort for my brother, to be a pillar of faith for my community. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turned. The call to prayer echoed from my phone, and my brother\u2019s voice cracked as he called out for me. My hands trembled, caught between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
