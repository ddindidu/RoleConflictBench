My son had been caught bullying another child, and the principal wanted to meet with me immediately. As a mother, I felt a surge of shame and worry\u2014my child needed me, needed guidance and comfort, and I knew I should be there to face this with him. But as I glanced at the clock, the bell for the special healing service echoed through the halls. Sister Agnes was gravely ill, and the whole community was gathering to pray for her recovery. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to show unity and faith, especially at such a crucial moment. My heart twisted between the two worlds\u2014my son\u2019s pain and the community\u2019s need. I could not be in both places at once. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I closed my eyes, torn, unsure which path to take."}
