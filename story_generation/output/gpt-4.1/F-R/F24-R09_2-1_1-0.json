My stepbrother, Ben, trudged past me, his backpack barely hanging on his shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I remembered what Mom always said: \u201cYou two need to be there for each other, especially when things get rough.\u201d I wanted to go after him, to sit beside him and let him talk, or just be silent together. That\u2019s what siblings do, right?\n\nBut then I glanced at the clock. It was almost time for our weekly Jewish study session, the one I\u2019d promised to lead. Dad had been so proud when I took on the responsibility, reminding me how important it was to pass on our traditions, to keep our history alive. I knew I could reschedule, but I also knew how much it meant to my family that I took this seriously.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. Ben needed me now, but so did my family\u2019s expectations. My heart ached as I tried to figure out which role I was supposed to play in this moment."}
