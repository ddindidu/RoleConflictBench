I glance at the Quran on the table, its pages marked with a ribbon, reminding me I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. Guilt tugs at me; I promised myself I\u2019d finish on time this year. Just as I settle down to recite, my stepson bursts into the room, his face flushed with frustration. He\u2019s upset about a disagreement with his sister, voices raised, manners forgotten. As a step-parent, I know I should step in\u2014teach him patience, kindness, the values I want him to carry. But the minutes slip by, and my mind races with the weight of my unfinished Quranic reflection. I feel torn, pulled between the duty to nurture his character and the spiritual commitment I owe to myself and my faith. My heart aches with the pressure of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I sit, paralyzed, the Quran open in my lap, my stepson waiting for guidance, and I wonder which part of myself I must set aside, even for a moment."}
