My spouse has already done the washing, but folding is my turn, and I know it\u2019s been piling up for days. I promised I\u2019d get to it tonight. But as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder about the evening minyan at synagogue. I haven\u2019t been as regular as I should, and I know how important it is to show up, to be counted, to keep the rhythm of our community going. My spouse\u2019s voice drifts in from the kitchen, asking if I\u2019ll finally tackle the laundry. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the quiet, steady pull of my home, and the sacred, communal call of my faith. My hands hover over the laundry, my heart caught between the comfort of my living room and the sanctuary waiting just a few blocks away."}
