The house buzzed with urgency\u2014her relatives would arrive in just a few hours, and every corner needed to shine. She glanced at me, her eyes silently pleading for help with the laundry and the guest room. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation: we were a team, and today, she needed me present, attentive, and reliable.\n\nMy phone vibrated on the counter. It was Brother Ahmad, a long-time congregant. His message was brief but heavy: \u201cImam, can I meet you today? It\u2019s urgent. My family is falling apart.\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to guide, to offer comfort and wisdom. As an imam, I was his anchor, and he was reaching out in a storm.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. My wife\u2019s voice called from the hallway, asking for help with the bedsheets. My heart ached, caught between the home that needed me and the community that depended on me. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure mount, unsure which call to answer first."}
