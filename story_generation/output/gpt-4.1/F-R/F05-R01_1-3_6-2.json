She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the weight I carried, but my mind was tangled with the conversation I\u2019d just had at church. Earlier, a member of the congregation had come to me, desperate and broken, seeking guidance for a decision that could change their life forever. As their pastor, I listened, offered scripture, and tried to be the steady presence they needed. Now, as a husband, I felt the pull to be vulnerable, to let my wife in. But the stories I carried weren\u2019t mine to share, and the burden of confidentiality pressed against my need for connection. I could see the disappointment flicker in her eyes as I hesitated, torn between the sacred trust of my calling and the honest intimacy my marriage deserved. The words caught in my throat, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the husband she needed and the pastor I was called to be."}
