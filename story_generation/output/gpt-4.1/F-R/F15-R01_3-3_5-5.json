My son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a parent press down on me. I needed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with love and discipline. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the church council, desperate for my presence at the shelter, where frightened families needed comfort and leadership. I could hear the voices of my congregation in my mind, expecting me to be their steady support in crisis. My heart twisted as I looked at my son, knowing he needed me now, too. The demands of both worlds crashed together inside me, and I stood frozen, torn between the child who needed a parent and the community that needed a pastor."}
