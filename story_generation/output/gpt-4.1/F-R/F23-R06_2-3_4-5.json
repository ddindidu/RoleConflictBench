Other shoppers glanced our way, some with disapproval. As his step-parent, I knew I should step in, teach him about respect and discipline, show him how to behave in public. That\u2019s what his father and I agreed on\u2014guiding him, helping him grow into a good person. But today was Sunday, and my church community expected me at the service, to worship and help with the food drive. I could already feel the weight of their absence if I didn\u2019t show up, the subtle disappointment in their eyes. I wanted to be there, to honor my faith and commitment. But here I was, torn between my responsibility to this child and my devotion to my church. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension twist inside me. I glanced at my phone, the service starting soon, and then at my stepson, still running, still laughing, waiting for me to choose which role I would fulfill."}
