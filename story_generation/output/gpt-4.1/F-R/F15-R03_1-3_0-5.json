My children will be waiting, their faces pressed against the window, searching for me among the other parents. I promised I would be there today, the last day before summer, to pick them up and hear their stories. But as I glance at the clock, the convent\u2019s bell tolls, calling me to prayer. Today, I am not just any sister\u2014I have been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, a rare honor and a duty I cannot take lightly. The Mother Superior\u2019s words echo in my ears: \u201cYou are our representative, Sister. The community looks to you.\u201d My heart aches with the weight of both worlds. I imagine my children\u2019s disappointment, their small hands clutching their backpacks, while I picture the expectant faces of the faithful, waiting for me to guide them in prayer. The minutes slip away, and I stand frozen, torn between the sacred and the maternal, knowing that whatever I choose, a part of me will be left behind."}
