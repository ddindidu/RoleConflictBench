My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the situation\u2014my grandson was struggling, and the family needed me. As a grandparent, I felt the pull to be there, to comfort, to listen, to offer the warmth only a grandmother can give. Yet, just as I was about to leave, my phone rang again. It was Brother Ahmed, a devoted member of our mosque. His voice was heavy with worry; he asked if I could meet him soon, saying he was overwhelmed by family troubles and needed guidance. As the imam, I knew my community looked to me for support, especially in times of crisis. My heart ached, torn between the family who needed my presence and the congregant who sought my counsel. Both roles demanded my compassion, my time, my undivided attention. I sat in silence, feeling the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, unsure which path to take, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
