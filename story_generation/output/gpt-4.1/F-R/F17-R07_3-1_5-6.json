I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014keeping our traditions alive, honoring our ancestors. But as I rehearsed the prayers, my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I could meet to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. He wanted to reflect, to deepen our understanding together, just as our teacher encouraged. I felt torn. My family needed me to be present, to carry on our customs. But my heart longed for the quiet, thoughtful space of spiritual study. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I stared at my phone, my mind swirling with guilt and longing, unsure which path to follow."}
