It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come right away\u2014she needed me. She never called unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew my place was by her side, to listen, to comfort, to be the one she could lean on when the world felt too heavy. But as a rabbi, I had a sanctuary full of people waiting for me, a young boy about to step into adulthood, a family who had entrusted me with this sacred moment. The expectations pressed in from both sides: my family needed my presence, my congregation needed my leadership. I felt the weight of both roles, the pull of love and duty, and the ache of knowing I could not be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the brother my sister needed and the rabbi my community expected."}
