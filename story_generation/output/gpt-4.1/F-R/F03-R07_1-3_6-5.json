She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I felt the familiar tug of worry. As their son, I knew I should ask if everything was alright, offer comfort, and listen to whatever was weighing on her. My parents had always leaned on me for emotional support, especially since Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But tonight was also the weekly group meditation, and I was leading the session. As a Buddhist, I was expected to guide others in mindfulness, to be present and centered for the community. The group relied on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMeditation group in 30 minutes.\u201d I glanced at my mother, then at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside me. I wanted to be a good son, to be there for my parents, but I also wanted to honor my commitment to my Buddhist practice and the group. My heart raced as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
