Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at the clock, realizing I haven\u2019t checked in since last weekend. Guilt prickles at me; I know how much my parents value our regular chats, even if it\u2019s just a quick text. As I start typing a reply, another message pops up\u2014this time from Tenzin, my friend from the Buddhist center. He\u2019s eager to talk about the sermon we attended yesterday, wanting to reflect on the teachings and share insights. I feel a tug in both directions. My parents expect me to be present, to show I care by keeping in touch. But Tenzin and my Buddhist practice call for my attention too, asking me to engage deeply, to be mindful and present in spiritual conversation. I stare at my phone, torn between the comfort of family and the pull of my spiritual path, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
