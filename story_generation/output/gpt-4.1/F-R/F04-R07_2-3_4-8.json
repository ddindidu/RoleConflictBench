Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I know how much these family gatherings mean, especially since Dad\u2019s been unwell. As a brother, I\u2019m expected to be there, to laugh, to listen, to help keep the family close. But earlier today, my Buddhist teacher asked if I could prepare a summary of the Heart Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. It\u2019s an honor, and I know how important it is to dedicate time for study and reflection, to deepen my understanding and help others on their path. I sit at my desk, torn. The warmth of my family\u2019s voices echoes in my mind, but so does the quiet call of the Dharma. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each pulling me in a different direction. My heart aches as I stare at the clock, knowing I can\u2019t be fully present for both."}
