My parents have been planning a small celebration for weeks, and he\u2019s asked me to be there, to stand beside him as he receives his diploma. As his sister, I know how much this means to him\u2014and to me. We\u2019ve always promised to support each other, to show up for the big moments.\n\nBut tonight is also my turn to lead the evening prayer at the mosque. The congregation is small, and another worshipper, fully qualified, is present and willing to step in. Still, as the imam, I know the community expects me to be there, to guide them in prayer, to be a steady presence. I can almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I\u2019m absent, even for a night.\n\nI sit in my room, my phone buzzing with messages from my family, my prayer robe laid out on the bed. My heart aches as I weigh the joy of my brother\u2019s achievement against the quiet responsibility I hold at the mosque. The expectations press in from both sides, and I find myself torn, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both need me tonight."}
