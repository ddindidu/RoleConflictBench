As a child in my family, I was expected to uphold our traditions, and this week, my parents asked me to lead the Havdalah ceremony\u2014a role my grandfather once held. They spoke with pride, their eyes shining with hope that I would carry the torch. But as a rabbi, my congregation awaited my Shabbat sermon, and I had yet to prepare. The service was only days away, and I knew how much my community relied on my words for guidance and comfort. My mind raced between the two worlds: the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations, the gravity of my rabbinic duties. I felt torn, the pressure mounting as I imagined disappointing either my parents or my congregation. My heart ached with the knowledge that I could not give both my full self, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between the child my family needed and the rabbi my community expected."}
