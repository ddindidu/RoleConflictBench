As her son, I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014attend every family gathering, uphold every ritual, never let our heritage fade. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting at the church, desperate for guidance about a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer wisdom rooted in faith and compassion. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family\u2019s embrace and the quiet sanctuary where someone needed me. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and fulfilling my calling as a pastor."}
