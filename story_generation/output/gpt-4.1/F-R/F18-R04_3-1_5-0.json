It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of laughter, shared meals, and the rare chance to see everyone together. As the eldest, I knew my presence mattered, especially to my younger siblings who looked up to me for guidance and support.\n\nBut as the imam of our small mosque, I also felt the weight of another responsibility. Even though Brother Ahmed could lead the prayers in my absence, and the congregation was never more than a handful for the daily salah, I knew some of the elders cherished my presence. They expected me to be there, to offer comfort, advice, and a sense of continuity. I could almost hear Uncle Farid\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cYour leadership brings us together, beta.\u201d\n\nCaught between the warmth of my family and the quiet duty to my community, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. Both sides needed me, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the silent plea in either set of eyes."}
