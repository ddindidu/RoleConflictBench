But my mind was far from tranquil. As a nun, I was expected to be present for morning prayers, to lead by example in devotion and discipline. The bell was about to ring, calling us all to the main chapel. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my husband. He wrote that the children needed groceries, and the rent was due. Our savings were nearly gone. As a step-parent, I was responsible for ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability, and I knew I could pick up a few hours of work this morning if I left now. But leaving would mean missing prayers, disappointing the sisters, and breaking the sacred rhythm of our day. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the chapel\u2019s call and my family\u2019s needs, feeling the weight of both vows pressing in on me."}
