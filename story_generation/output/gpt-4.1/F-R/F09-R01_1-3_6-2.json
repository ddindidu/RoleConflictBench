The Nintendo, remember?\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of his expectation. Money was tight this month, and I knew buying the game console would mean cutting back on groceries or skipping a bill. But I\u2019d promised, and I wanted to keep his trust, to give him something to look forward to.\n\nJust as I was about to answer, my phone buzzed. It was a member of my congregation, her voice trembling with fear and confusion. She needed to talk\u2014right now. Her choices could change her life, and she was looking to me for spiritual guidance, for wisdom and comfort. I glanced at my son, then at the phone, feeling the pull from both sides. My heart ached with the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down. The expectations pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, unable to move."}
