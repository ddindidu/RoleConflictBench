But as I gathered my things, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of our congregation. \u201cPastor, could you call? I\u2019m having a hard day.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling since her husband passed, and I\u2019d told her she could always reach out. \n\nI stood in the doorway, keys in hand, torn. My children expected me to be there, to show them they mattered most. But Mrs. Carter needed comfort, and as her pastor, I felt responsible for her well-being.
