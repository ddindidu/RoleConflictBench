Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still new to the neighborhood. I keep an eye on the cars, making sure he doesn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. He\u2019s talking about his favorite video game, but my mind is on the weekly Jewish study session I promised to lead for the kids at the community center. It\u2019s supposed to start in an hour, but Sam\u2019s been quiet lately, and I know he\u2019s had a tough week. I feel like I should take him for ice cream, maybe talk things out, make sure he\u2019s okay. But if I skip or reschedule the study session, I\u2019ll be letting down the kids who look forward to learning about our traditions, and I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m not honoring what my parents expect of me as a Jewish role model. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me as we turn the corner, and I wonder which path I should take today."}
