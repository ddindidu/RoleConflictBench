My phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my midday mantra. I closed my eyes for a moment, quietly repeating the sacred words under my breath, feeling the familiar calm settle over me. But just as I reached the end of the chant, I saw my brother step off the curb, not even glancing at the cars speeding by. My heart lurched. As a sibling, I was supposed to always look out for him, to keep him safe. But as a Hindu, I was supposed to give my full attention and respect to my daily ritual, not interrupt it halfway. I felt torn\u2014should I break my focus and call out to him, or finish my mantra and trust he\u2019d be okay? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and for a split second, I stood frozen, caught between my devotion and my duty as a sister."}
