My daughter had called me earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my granddaughter had won a school award, and they wanted to celebrate together after Friday prayers. She insisted I join them in the main prayer hall, where the whole family would gather before heading out. As a grandmother, I longed to be there, to see my granddaughter\u2019s proud smile, to share in the joy and laughter. But as I glanced down, I realized my abaya was at home; I had rushed out in a long skirt and a loose blouse, not quite the modest attire I usually wore for Jumu\u2019ah. The mosque\u2019s rules were clear, and my faith\u2019s expectations even clearer. I could feel the weight of my family\u2019s anticipation, the warmth of their love pulling me in one direction, while my sense of religious duty tugged me firmly in another. My hands trembled as I hesitated at the threshold, torn between the joy of being a grandmother and the responsibility of being a Muslim."}
