Lately, they had seemed more stressed than ever, and I knew they needed me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my words. I wanted to rush to them, to sit close and hold my mother\u2019s hand, to reassure my father with a gentle smile. But as I glanced down, I realized my scarf had slipped, and my sleeves were pushed up from helping my mother carry her things. I remembered the expectation to dress modestly, especially in the mosque, especially for Friday prayers. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the daughter who should be there for her parents, and the Muslim who must uphold the dignity of her faith. My heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between fixing my appearance before entering the prayer hall or going straight to my parents, just as I was, to offer the support they so clearly needed."}
