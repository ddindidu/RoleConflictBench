My children\u2019s school day is ending soon, and I promised I\u2019d be there to pick them up, just like I always am. They look for me at the gate, their faces lighting up when they spot me. It\u2019s a ritual I cherish, a small but important way I show up for them. But today, my phone buzzes with a reminder: I\u2019m scheduled to chant a Torah portion at synagogue. It\u2019s not just any service\u2014it\u2019s one I committed to weeks ago, and the community is counting on me. I can already picture the rabbi\u2019s expectant look, the congregation waiting for my voice to fill the sanctuary. My chest tightens as I weigh the two worlds pulling at me. My children\u2019s trust, their need for me to be there, versus my responsibility to my faith and community. I feel torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, wishing I could split myself in two. The minutes tick by, and I know I have to choose, but I\u2019m paralyzed, caught between the two parts of myself that matter most."}
