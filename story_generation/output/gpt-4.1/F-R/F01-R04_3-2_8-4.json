My grandson had been in an accident\u2014nothing fatal, but serious enough to shake the whole family. As a grandfather, I felt the urge to rush to their side, to hold my daughter\u2019s hand, to comfort my grandson, to be the pillar my family needed. My wife\u2019s eyes pleaded with me to go, to be present, to fulfill the role I have always cherished.\n\nBut as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. A reminder: I am the sole imam scheduled for today\u2019s Friday sermon. The topic, \u201cPatience in Times of Trial,\u201d has been announced to the entire congregation. People are expecting guidance, comfort, and wisdom from me. There is no one else to step in at the last minute. The community relies on me, especially now, when so many are struggling.\n\nI sit in my study, torn. My heart aches for my family, but my duty to my congregation weighs heavily. Both need me, both expect me to be present, to lead, to comfort. I close my eyes, feeling the pressure build, knowing I must choose, but not yet knowing how."}
