The community looks to me to be present, to chant, and to help set an example of devotion. But at home, my younger sister is waiting for me. We had a disagreement earlier\u2014one of those arguments that leaves the air heavy and hearts bruised. She wants to talk, to work through our differences, and I know that as her sister, I should be patient and understanding, building the mutual respect that our relationship needs. \n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I leave for the temple, I risk making my sister feel abandoned, as if her feelings matter less than my religious duties. If I stay, I let down my community and my own spiritual commitments. My mind races, torn between the quiet pull of family and the solemn call of faith. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move in either direction."}
