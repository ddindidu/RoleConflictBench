I knew I should ask, should open the door for them to share what was weighing on their mind. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honest, open communication, especially when life felt heavy. But I glanced at the clock. In five minutes, I was supposed to begin my evening meditation, the only quiet ten minutes I\u2019d have all day. My mind was already buzzing with anticipation, craving the stillness, the gentle return to breath and presence that my Buddhist practice offered. I felt torn\u2014my heart ached to be present for my spouse, to listen and support, but my spirit yearned for the peace I found in meditation. The expectations pressed in from both sides: be the attentive partner, be the mindful practitioner.
