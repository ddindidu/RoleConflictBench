They needed me\u2014needed my support as they wrestled with a difficult decision at work. I could see the vulnerability in their eyes, the silent plea for encouragement, for reassurance that whatever choice they made, I would stand by them. I reached for their hand, but my mind was elsewhere. Earlier that day, I\u2019d witnessed a friend being treated unjustly by a colleague. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and speak out against wrongdoing. The urge to intervene, to defend my friend, gnawed at me. Yet, my partner\u2019s needs pulled me in the opposite direction. I felt torn, my heart heavy with the weight of both responsibilities. How could I be fully present for my partner when my conscience demanded action elsewhere? The expectations pressed in on me, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the supportive spouse my partner needed and the principled person my faith expected me to be."}
