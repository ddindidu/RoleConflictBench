She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. As her step-child, I knew she expected me to check in, to ask if she was okay, to be the emotional glue in our patchwork family. I wanted to ask, \u201cAre you alright? Is there anything I can do?\u201d But my mind kept drifting to the office function this afternoon. \n\nIt was a big event, and everyone would be there\u2014men and women, managers and interns. As a Muslim, I was expected to dress modestly, but the invitation had specifically mentioned \u201cbusiness casual,\u201d and I knew from past experience that meant dresses and short sleeves for women. My stepmother had even laid out a dress for me, something she thought would help me fit in. I could feel her hope that I\u2019d blend, that I\u2019d make friends, that I\u2019d be happy. \n\nI wanted to support her, to show her I cared, but I also felt the weight of my faith, the need to stay true to myself. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, caught in the middle, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
