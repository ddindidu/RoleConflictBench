I knew I should ask her if everything was alright, offer her the comfort she always gave me as a child. But my mind was elsewhere, caught up in the quiet repetition of my mantra, the only part of my daily ritual I could manage lately. I felt guilty for not lighting the lamp or offering flowers at the small altar in my room, but between school, chores, and my parents\u2019 worries, I barely found time for even this. My mother glanced at me, her eyes searching, and I wondered if she sensed my distance. I wanted to reach out, to be the supportive daughter she expected, but the weight of not fulfilling my religious duties pressed on me. I felt torn, as if I was failing both as a daughter and as a Hindu, unable to give either role what it truly deserved."}
