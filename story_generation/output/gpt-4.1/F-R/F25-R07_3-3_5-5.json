It shows you\u2019re truly part of the family.\u201d Her eyes had been hopeful, and I knew how much it meant to her and my father. The ceremony was tonight, the same time as my weekly meditation group. As a Buddhist, I was supposed to lead the session, guiding everyone in mindfulness and stillness. They depended on me, and I\u2019d promised to be there. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMeditation group, 7 PM.\u201d My heart pounded. If I chose the ceremony, I\u2019d disappoint my sangha and break my commitment to mindful practice. If I chose meditation, I\u2019d let down my family, who still sometimes saw me as an outsider. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which path to follow."}
