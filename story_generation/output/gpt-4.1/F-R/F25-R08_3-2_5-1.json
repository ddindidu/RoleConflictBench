She caught my eye and smiled, her voice warm but firm as she asked me to lead the blessing this year. It was a big deal\u2014my first time, a sign that I was truly part of the family. I knew how much it meant to her, to everyone, that I honor their traditions and help keep them alive. But as I nodded, my mind drifted to the Quran on my nightstand upstairs. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily readings. I could feel the weight of my faith pressing on me, the quiet guilt of not keeping up with my spiritual commitments. The ceremony would take time, and afterward, there would be stories, laughter, and cleaning up\u2014no quiet moment for reflection or catching up on my recitation. My heart tugged in two directions: the longing to belong, to be the stepchild who finally fit in, and the need to honor my faith, to be the Muslim I promised myself I would be this Ramadan."}
