My grandson, Ethan, is struggling\u2014he\u2019s withdrawn, his grades slipping, and she\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end. As a grandmother, I ache to be there, to listen, to offer the comfort only a grandparent can give. I promised her I\u2019d come by this afternoon, to sit with Ethan, maybe coax him to talk, or at least let him know he\u2019s not alone. But as I hang up, my phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder about Daniel\u2019s bar mitzvah. Months of preparation, a family counting on me as their rabbi to guide their son through this sacred milestone. They expect my full presence, my words, my blessing.
