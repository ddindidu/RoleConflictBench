My mother\u2019s message blinks on the screen: \u201cHow are you, darling? We miss you.\u201d I know she waits for my reply, a simple text to reassure her, to bridge the distance between us. As her child, I owe her that comfort, that small sign of love. But tonight, the convent is holding a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who has grown so frail. The Mother Superior has asked all of us to attend, to pray together for her recovery. As a nun, I am expected to be present, to show my devotion and solidarity with my sisters. My thumb hovers over the phone, torn between the quiet pull of family and the solemn call of my religious life. The minutes slip by, the bell rings again, and my heart aches with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
