Today was the day of the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a sacred event I had helped prepare for every year since I took my vows. The abbot had asked me to arrive early, to help with the altar and guide the younger volunteers. My mind drifted to the gentle rhythm of chanting, the scent of incense, the peace I always found in service.\n\nBut as I moved through the kitchen, my phone buzzed. A message from my daughter: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom\u2014Lila\u2019s art show is at 8. She\u2019s so excited to show you her painting!\u201d My granddaughter\u2019s first big event, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, clapping in the front row.\n\nI stood in the kitchen, torn. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate Lila\u2019s achievement, to be the grandmother who never missed a milestone. My Buddhist community needed my devotion, my hands, my heart. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each calling me in a different direction."}
