My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help fold these tonight?\u201d I promised I would, but now it\u2019s late, and the sermon for Sunday is only half-written. The congregation expects guidance, clarity\u2014words that will help them navigate their own tangled lives. I know they count on me to be prepared, to offer wisdom rooted in faith. But here, in my living room, the expectation is simpler: be present, share the load, show love in small, practical ways. My laptop glows with the unfinished sermon, while the laundry sits, a quiet reminder of my other promise. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. I want to be a good spouse, a good pastor. But tonight, I can\u2019t see how to be both."}
