The High Holiday sermon weighed on my mind; the congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and wisdom. I could already picture the sanctuary filled with familiar faces, all waiting for my words. My phone buzzed, and I saw my sister\u2019s name. Her voice trembled as she told me our brother was in the hospital, needing family by his side. My heart twisted. As a brother, I should be there, holding his hand, offering comfort, showing him he\u2019s not alone. But as a rabbi, I was expected to stand before my community, to lead them through one of the holiest days of the year. The clock ticked, each second tightening the knot in my chest. I felt torn, pulled by love and duty, by the needs of my family and the needs of my congregation. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
