I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201d I know how much this final means to him, how he\u2019s been struggling with anxiety for weeks. As his sister, I want nothing more than to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019s capable and loved. But as I glance at the clock, I remember Sister Agnes\u2019s reminder that I have spiritual study and reflection scheduled this evening. Just then, the parish secretary knocks on my door, her voice gentle but urgent: \u201cSister, Mrs. Ramirez is here. She\u2019s in crisis and needs to speak with you.\u201d My heart twists. I feel the weight of my brother\u2019s need for comfort and the parishioner\u2019s need for guidance. Both expect my presence, my compassion, my undivided attention. I sit in my small room, torn between the call of family and the call of faith, wishing I could split myself in two."}
