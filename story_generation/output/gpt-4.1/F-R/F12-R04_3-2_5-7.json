My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him move the furniture to make space for our relatives who would arrive in a few hours. The house was still a mess, and I knew my in-laws expected everything to be spotless and welcoming. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Amina, a congregant who rarely reached out. She wrote, \u201cPlease, can I see you today? I really need to talk. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d As the imam, I knew how much she depended on my guidance, especially now when her family was in turmoil. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014my family needing me to be present, efficient, and supportive, and my community needing me to be compassionate, available, and wise. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the expectations of my home and my calling."}
