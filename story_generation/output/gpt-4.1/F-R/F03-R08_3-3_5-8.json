Our family had always placed great importance on these rituals, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me.\n\nBut in my heart, another call tugged at me. My doctor\u2019s words were still fresh: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, you should go this year. Your health may not allow it again.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage was a sacred duty, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation I had longed to fulfill.
