He was determined to master a new skateboard trick on the old, uneven ramp, despite my warnings. As his step-sibling, I felt a fierce responsibility to keep him safe, to be there in case he fell or needed help. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah was about to begin. As the rabbi, I was expected to lead the ceremony, to guide a young boy and his family through a sacred milestone, something they had prepared for over months. I could already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to appear, the Torah open and ready. My stepbrother glanced at me, seeking approval, while my mind raced between the pull of family and the weight of my spiritual duty. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
