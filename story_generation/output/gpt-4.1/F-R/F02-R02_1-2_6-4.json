The Nintendo, remember?\u201d His birthday was just days away, and I\u2019d assured him I\u2019d make it happen, even though money was tight. I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up, to be the father he deserved\u2014one who provided not just for needs, but for joy.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation. She was struggling again, asking if I could meet her this evening for counseling. As her priest, I knew how much she depended on these talks, how my guidance helped her hold things together. She needed me, and I couldn\u2019t turn her away.\n\nBut the Nintendo would mean dipping into the little savings we had, and the only time I could buy it was tonight\u2014before the store closed, before my promise faded into another disappointment. My heart ached, torn between the father my son needed and the priest my community expected. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
