But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder from the church app. The daily prayer service was about to begin. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but the congregation had come to expect my presence, my guidance, my prayers. I knew some of them found comfort in these moments, especially the elderly who rarely left their homes. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family, the needs of my community. I could almost hear my spouse\u2019s voice, hopeful for clean clothes, and the quiet anticipation of the faithful, waiting for me to lead them. I stood in the laundry room, torn, the hum of the washing machine and the distant chime of the church bell echoing my inner turmoil."}
