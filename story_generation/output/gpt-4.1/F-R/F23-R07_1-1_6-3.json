He\u2019s been waiting all week for the Nintendo, his eyes lighting up every time he mentions it. I know how much it means to him, and as his step-parent, I feel the weight of making good on my word, of providing the things that make him feel loved and secure. But the numbers in my bank account are tight, and I worry about what buying the console will mean for our bills this month.\n\nAt the same time, I glance at the clock. My ten-minute window for meditation is approaching\u2014a small, sacred space I carve out each day to practice mindfulness, to breathe and let go of the anxieties that pile up. But today, my mind is anything but quiet. The tug-of-war between my roles is relentless: the urge to fulfill my promise and the need to honor my Buddhist practice. I close my eyes, feeling the tension in my chest, torn between the expectations placed upon me and the peace I so desperately seek."}
