Jacob\u2019s got something big to share with the family!\u201d I could hear my grandson\u2019s laughter in the background, and my heart warmed at the thought of being there, seeing his face light up as he told us his news. I know how much it means to them when I\u2019m present, really present, not just in the room but listening, sharing in their joy. That\u2019s what being a grandfather is about\u2014showing up, making memories.\n\nBut earlier today, I\u2019d run into Mark at the grocery store. He looked tired, worn down, and when I asked, he admitted things were rough at home. I could see the weight he carried, and as a Christian, I felt that tug\u2014the call to reach out, to offer a listening ear, maybe even invite him over for dinner. \u201cLove your neighbor,\u201d Jesus said. I want to live that out, not just in words but in action.\n\nNow, as evening approaches, I feel torn. My family expects me, needs me. But so does Mark, in a different way. I sit in my chair, wrestling with what love and loyalty really mean tonight."}
