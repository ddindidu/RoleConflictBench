My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014she\u2019s been shouldering more than her share lately, and I promised I\u2019d help tonight. I want to keep that promise, to show her I\u2019m present, not just in body but in effort. But my phone buzzes, and I see the message: \u201cFather, I really need to talk tonight. Is now okay?\u201d It\u2019s from Mark, a parishioner who\u2019s been struggling for weeks. He trusts me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. I know how much this means to him, how much he\u2019s counting on me. My heart twists. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t fold laundry and hold someone\u2019s pain at the same time. Both roles tug at me, each with their own silent plea. I stand in the hallway, the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, unsure which need should come first."}
