It was my brother, his voice trembling. \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. As his sister, I knew I should be there\u2014he\u2019d always been my confidant, and now he was reaching out in a rare moment of vulnerability. But the class was in an hour, and I was the only rabbi available tonight. People were counting on me to teach, to guide, to be present for their questions and learning. I could picture the regulars, waiting with their books open, expecting me to lead them. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need of my brother and my responsibility to my community. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
