He\u2019d been so excited, his eyes shining as he talked about the Nintendo all his friends had. I\u2019d told him I\u2019d find a way, that I\u2019d make it happen, even though money was tight. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of providing, of not letting him down, of being the adult he could trust. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the meeting with Mother Superior. She\u2019d asked me to lead the daily reflections for the retreat\u2014an honor, but also a responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual focus. My heart twisted. How could I pour myself into spiritual study and guide others when my mind was tangled with worries about money and my stepson\u2019s hopes? The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure build, knowing a choice had to be made, but not yet knowing which part of myself I would have to set aside."}
