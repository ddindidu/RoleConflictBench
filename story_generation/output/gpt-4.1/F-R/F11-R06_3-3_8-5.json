I knew how important it was to be present, not just for worship but to show my commitment to the community. At the same time, my younger sister sat across from me, her eyes red from crying after our argument last night. She barely touched her breakfast, and I could feel the tension between us. I remembered our parents always said that as sisters, we should talk things through and never let misunderstandings fester. I wanted to reach out, to listen and rebuild the trust between us, but the clock was ticking closer to the time I needed to leave for church. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my faith and my community, and toward my sister, who needed me right now. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
