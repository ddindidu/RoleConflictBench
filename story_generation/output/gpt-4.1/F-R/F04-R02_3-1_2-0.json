It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come over. She never called unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew I was supposed to be there for her, to listen and help her through whatever storm she was facing. But as the priest of our small parish, I was also expected to lead the daily prayer, even if it was just a routine service. The congregation, though small tonight, would be waiting for me, expecting the comfort and guidance that came with our prayers. I could hear the desperation in my sister\u2019s voice, but I also pictured the quiet church, the candles already lit, the faithful gathered. My heart twisted, torn between the pull of family and the call of duty. I stood in the sacristy, phone in hand, wrestling with the weight of both roles, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
