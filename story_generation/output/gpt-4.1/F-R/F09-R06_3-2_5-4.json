Shame and worry twisted inside me. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him and help him understand the seriousness of stealing. I wanted to march him back to the counter, make him apologize, and explain why honesty matters. But as I glanced at my watch, I realized church service was about to start. As a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to worship and community, the expectation that I would be present, setting an example for my children about faith and devotion. I could feel the eyes of the store staff on me, waiting for my response, while my son\u2019s wide, frightened eyes pleaded for comfort. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to address my son\u2019s mistake and the deep sense of responsibility to my faith community. I stood there, wrestling with the impossible choice, my hands trembling as I tried to decide what to do next."}
