The store was quiet, but the crinkle of the wrapper sounded deafening. I knew what was expected of me as his step-parent: to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him so he\u2019d grow into a good person. But as a Christian, I was taught to show love and forgiveness, to offer kindness even when it was hard. My mind raced with questions\u2014should I scold him harshly, make an example of this moment, or should I kneel down, look him in the eye, and gently guide him toward honesty? I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My hands trembled as I reached for his shoulder, torn between the urge to correct and the call to show compassion."}
