I could see he needed reassurance, the kind only a grandfather could give\u2014stories of my own missteps, gentle advice, the comfort of knowing he wasn\u2019t alone. Yet, tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a commitment I cherished. We were to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I felt the weight of my spiritual community\u2019s expectations pressing on me. I wanted to be present for Ethan, to offer him the wisdom he sought, but my heart also yearned for the quiet reflection and shared learning of the sangha. The clock ticked on the wall, each second tightening the knot in my chest as I wrestled with the pull of these two worlds, both asking for my presence, both deserving of it."}
