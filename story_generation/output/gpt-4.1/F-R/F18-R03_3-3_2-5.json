My brother\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, barely holding together as he told me about the diagnosis. I could hear the fear, the need for comfort, the silent plea for me to be there, as I always had been. My heart ached to drop everything and rush to his side, to hold his hand and remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil\u2014an honor entrusted to me by the Mother Superior, a duty to my sisters and to God. The entire community would be watching, expecting me to guide them in faith and strength. I felt torn, the weight of my habit pressing down on me, the pull of family and faith stretching me in opposite directions. My brother needed me as his sister, but my sisters in Christ needed me as their leader. I closed my eyes, caught in the silent storm of my own heart, unsure which call I could answer without betraying the other."}
