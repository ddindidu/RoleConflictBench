Their voice was light, but I could sense the fatigue beneath the words, the subtle plea for comfort. I wanted to reach out, to offer the warmth and reassurance they needed, to be present and attentive as a loving spouse should be. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the special healing service at the convent was about to begin. Sister Agnes was ill, and the community had gathered to pray for her recovery\u2014an act of solidarity and faith that I was expected, even needed, to attend. My heart pulled in two directions, torn between the quiet needs of my home and the sacred call of my vocation. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, the urge to be everything to everyone, and the fear that, in trying, I might fail them both."}
