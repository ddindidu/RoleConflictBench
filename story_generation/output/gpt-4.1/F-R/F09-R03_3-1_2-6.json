The quiet was a balm, and I had looked forward to this afternoon of spiritual reading all week. Just as I began to lose myself in prayer, my phone buzzed. It was the school. My heart clenched as I listened: my son had been caught bullying another child. They needed me to come in, to talk, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. As a mother, I knew I should be there, to guide him, to show him right from wrong, to support him through this mistake. But as a nun, I was expected to honor my commitment to spiritual reflection, to keep this sacred time for God. The demands pulled at me from both sides\u2014my child needed me, but so did my faith. I sat there, torn, the silence now heavy with the weight of my decision."}
