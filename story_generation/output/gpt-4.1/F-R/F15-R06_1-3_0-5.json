It was almost three, and my children would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014just like every Friday. But today, the church had called an urgent meeting, right before the evening service. As a committed member, I was expected to help set up and lead the opening prayer. Pastor had reminded us last Sunday how important it was to show up, to be present for the community, especially now when so many depended on us. I could hear my daughter\u2019s voice in my mind, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d and at the same time, I pictured the disappointed looks from my church family if I didn\u2019t show. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the school and the church, between my children\u2019s trust and my faith community\u2019s expectations. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me."}
