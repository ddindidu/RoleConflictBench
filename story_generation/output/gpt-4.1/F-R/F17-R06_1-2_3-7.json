As a child in this family, I\u2019m expected to participate fully, to honor our customs, and to be present for every ritual, every meal, every laugh. This year, though, I noticed something different. My cousin, Sarah, sat quietly in the corner, her eyes red and distant. I remembered what I\u2019d learned in church: to show love and kindness, to reach out to those who are hurting, just as Jesus would.\n\nBut as I stood up to go to her, my mother caught my eye and shook her head slightly, reminding me with just a look that I was needed at the table, that our traditions came first. I felt torn\u2014my heart ached to comfort Sarah, to be the Christian I wanted to be, but I also didn\u2019t want to disappoint my family or break the flow of our cherished evening. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which part of myself I should honor."}
