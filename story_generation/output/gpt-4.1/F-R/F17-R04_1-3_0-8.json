My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cHow are you, beta? Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially on weekends when she expected a call or at least a text. I started typing a quick reply, but just then, the door creaked open and a man stepped in, his eyes red and swollen. He barely managed a greeting before breaking down, telling me about the loss of his brother and how he felt lost, desperate for guidance. As an imam, I knew my duty was to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and counsel. But as a son, I felt the tug of my mother\u2019s expectations, her need for reassurance that I was safe and well. My heart pounded as I glanced between my phone and the grieving man, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence in a different way."}
