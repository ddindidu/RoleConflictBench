My granddaughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d sent a message, eager to share her first-day stories. I knew she expected me to call, to listen, to celebrate her little victories. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done as her grandmother\u2014be present, be supportive, keep our bond strong through regular calls and gentle encouragement.\n\nBut as I glanced out the window, I saw Sister Maria hurrying past, arms full of blankets. The news had spread quickly: the family next door had lost their home to a fire last night. The convent was mobilizing, gathering food, clothing, and comfort for them. As a nun, I was expected to join in, to put aside personal matters and serve those in immediate need.\n\nMy heart pulled in two directions. I wanted to be there for my granddaughter, to hear her voice and share her joy. Yet, I felt the weight of my vows, the urgent call to help our neighbors in crisis. The phone felt heavy in my hand as I sat, torn between love and duty, unsure which call to answer first."}
