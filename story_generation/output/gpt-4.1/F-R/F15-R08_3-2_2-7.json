He had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me. As a parent, I knew I had to be there for him, to guide him through this mistake and show him the right path. My heart ached with worry and disappointment, but I also felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my friends, excitedly sharing their plans for Hajj this year. I had been saving for years, setting aside every spare coin, dreaming of fulfilling this pillar of my faith. The money was finally enough, and my friends were urging me to join them. The thought of standing in the holy land, completing my religious duty, filled me with longing.\n\nBut now, with my son in trouble, I wondered if I could leave him at such a crucial time. My roles as a parent and as a Muslim seemed to pull me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention. I felt torn, unsure which path to take, my heart heavy with the weight of both love and faith."}
