My son sits at the table, fidgeting with his spoon, refusing to say \u201cthank you\u201d when I hand him his meal. As a parent, I know this is a teaching moment\u2014patience, consistency, and gentle correction are needed to instill these small but important values. Yet, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the community memorial service at the temple is tonight. As a Buddhist, I am expected to attend, to show respect for the departed and solidarity with my sangha. The ceremony is important, a chance to practice compassion and presence with others. But if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss this crucial time with my son, and the lesson may slip away. If I stay, I neglect my spiritual community and the commitments I hold dear. My heart aches, pulled between the quiet needs of my child and the collective call of my faith, unsure which path honors my responsibilities more."}
