My children would be finishing school in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like every Friday. They always looked for me, their faces lighting up when they spotted me in the crowd. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was about to start. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for my community. The committee had been waiting for my guidance, and this was the only time everyone could meet before the busy season began. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I didn\u2019t show up. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my children\u2019s trust in me as their parent, my congregation\u2019s reliance on me as their priest. I stood in my office, keys in one hand, meeting agenda in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which door I would walk through."}
