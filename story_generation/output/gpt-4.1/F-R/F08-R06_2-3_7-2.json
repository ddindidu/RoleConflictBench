She had just started her new job, and I knew how much it meant to her. As her grandmother, I felt the weight of staying connected, of being the one she could always turn to for encouragement and advice. She wanted to share her excitement, her worries, and her small victories with me. I was expected to listen, to celebrate, to be present.\n\nBut today, her message was different. She confided in me about a situation at work\u2014her boss had asked her to do something that went against the Christian values I hold dear. She was unsure, looking to me for guidance, maybe even for approval. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I knew what I should say, the moral line I should draw. But as her grandmother, I wanted to comfort her, to support her unconditionally, to keep our bond strong. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the tension rising inside, unsure which part of myself should speak first."}
