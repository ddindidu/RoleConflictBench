The principal\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind: \u201cYour son was involved in bullying today.\u201d As a father, I knew I had to be present, to show up for my child, to guide him and hold him accountable. I pictured his face, anxious and ashamed, waiting for me inside. I wanted to be firm, to teach him right from wrong, but also to comfort him, to let him know I was there no matter what.\n\nBut as a Christian, I felt another pull. Just this morning, I\u2019d learned that Mark, a friend from church, was struggling\u2014his wife had left, and he was alone. I\u2019d promised to visit, to offer support, to be the hands and feet of Christ. I could almost hear the words from Sunday\u2019s sermon: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d How could I turn away from someone in need?\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My son needed me now, but so did Mark. I stared at the school doors, my heart torn between the demands of fatherhood and the call to Christian compassion, unsure which path to take first."}
