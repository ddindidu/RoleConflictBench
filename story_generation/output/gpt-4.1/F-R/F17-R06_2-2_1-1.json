It\u2019s our tradition\u2014me sitting on my bed, phone pressed to my ear, listening to Mom\u2019s gentle questions and Dad\u2019s quiet laughter. They expect me to share everything: my classes, my friends, even the little things that bother me. Tonight, though, my heart pounds as I dial. This week, I saw a friend cheat on an exam. I know, as a Christian, I should be honest and maybe even encourage my friend to come clean. But if I tell my parents, they\u2019ll worry, maybe even call the school. If I don\u2019t, I feel like I\u2019m hiding the truth, betraying my values. My parents want to know everything, to trust me. My faith tells me to act with integrity. I stare at the ceiling, phone ringing, torn between being the open, honest child they expect and the Christian who must stand for what\u2019s right, even if it means causing trouble. The line clicks, and I hear my mom\u2019s voice, warm and expectant. My throat tightens as I try to decide what to say."}
