My spouse\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cCan you help with the guest room? They\u2019ll be here in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the day pressing down. The house was a whirlwind of laundry, dusting, and last-minute preparations. I knew how much it meant to my spouse that everything be perfect for the relatives\u2019 visit. \n\nJust as I reached for the vacuum, the church secretary called. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here\u2014she\u2019s in tears, says she needs to talk to you right away.\u201d My heart clenched. As a priest, I knew the importance of being present for those in crisis, offering comfort and guidance when it\u2019s needed most. But at home, my absence would mean letting my spouse down, leaving them to shoulder the burden alone. \n\nI stood in the hallway, mop in hand, torn between the sacred duty to my congregation and the promise I\u2019d made to my partner. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt the familiar ache of not knowing how to be enough for everyone."}
