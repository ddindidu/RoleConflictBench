She expects me to help prepare the traditional dishes, join in the prayers, and sit with the family as we share stories from the past. I know how much it means to her, to all of them, that I uphold these customs and show respect for our heritage. But at the same time, my Buddhist meditation group meets every Sunday at the same hour. That hour of mindfulness and stillness is something I look forward to all week\u2014it grounds me, helps me find peace, and is a commitment I made to myself and my practice. As I stand in the kitchen, the scent of spices in the air and my mother\u2019s voice calling for help, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My heart aches with the fear of disappointing my family, but I also feel a deep longing for the quiet sanctuary of meditation. I close my eyes, torn between the warmth of tradition and the serenity of my spiritual path, unsure which call to answer."}
