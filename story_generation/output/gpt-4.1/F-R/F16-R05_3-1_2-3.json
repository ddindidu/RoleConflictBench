My partner\u2019s eyes were red, their hands trembling as they recounted the latest wave of anxiety that had crashed over them. I reached out, holding their hand, feeling the weight of their need for comfort and stability. They needed me here, now, to listen, to reassure, to simply be present. But in less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the adult education class. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I knew several regulars looked forward to these sessions, carving out time in their busy weeks to learn and connect. I could picture their expectant faces, the questions they\u2019d prepared, the quiet satisfaction of shared study. My partner\u2019s voice wavered, pulling me back. I felt torn, my heart aching with the knowledge that whatever I chose, someone would be left wanting. The clock ticked on, and I sat suspended between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
