My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the stories we\u2019d share. As a grandmother, I knew how important it was to be present, to nurture those bonds and create memories.\n\nBut then, the phone rang again. It was the church deacon, his voice heavy. He explained that a member of our congregation had been caught in a scandal, and the church needed trusted members to stand firm in upholding our Christian values, even if it meant confronting uncomfortable truths. He asked if I could attend an urgent meeting\u2014at the exact time as the family gathering.\n\nI felt torn. My family expected my warmth and presence, but my faith demanded integrity and courage, even when it was hard. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I sat in silence, wrestling with the expectations of my loved ones and the call to live out my Christian convictions, unsure which path I would choose."}
