My spouse\u2019s message was clear: \u201cCan you finish the laundry before dinner? The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I glanced at the overflowing basket, feeling the weight of my promise to help more at home. Just then, the church\u2019s front door creaked open. I saw Anna, her face streaked with tears, standing in the entryway. She barely managed to say, \u201cI need to talk. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d As a priest, I knew my calling was to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. But as a spouse, I\u2019d promised to be present, to share the load, to not let my family down again. My heart pounded as I stood between the laundry room and the sanctuary, torn by the needs of those I love and those I serve, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds demanding all of me at once."}
