The incense, the rhythmic chanting, the careful offerings\u2014these rituals are the foundation of my faith, a discipline I have never allowed myself to neglect. Yet, as I sit cross-legged before the altar, my mind drifts to the looming home loan repayment. In two months, a large sum is due, and I know I must work extra hours, perhaps even take on a second job, to ensure my family\u2019s security. My wife and children depend on me; their comfort and future rest on my shoulders.\n\nBut the extra work means less time for my prayers. The thought of rushing through rituals, or worse, skipping them, fills me with guilt and anxiety. My faith demands devotion and consistency, but my family needs my time and financial support. Each expectation tugs at me, and I feel myself stretched thin, torn between the sacred and the practical. As I light the final lamp, I wonder how I can honor both duties without failing either."}
