My son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in tonight to discuss what happened. As a father, I knew I needed to be there for my child, to show him right from wrong, to support and guide him through this mistake. But tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a time I cherished for reflection and spiritual growth. We were set to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I felt a responsibility to my sangha, to my own practice, to show up and learn together. The two worlds pulled at me\u2014one demanding my presence as a parent, the other calling me to deepen my understanding and compassion. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. My son needed me, but so did my own spiritual path. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
