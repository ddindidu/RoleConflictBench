He was upset\u2014again\u2014about something I\u2019d said last week, and he wanted to talk. As his sister, I knew I should call him, listen, and try to clear the air. We\u2019d always promised to be honest with each other, to work through misunderstandings instead of letting them fester. But as a pastor, I was under pressure to finalize my lesson plan for the community leaders\u2019 workshop. The church expected me to guide others in understanding and applying complex theological ideas, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be unprepared. My phone buzzed with another message from my brother, just as an email from the church board popped up, reminding me of the importance of tomorrow\u2019s session. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me to be present and open, but my congregation needed me to be focused and wise. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stared at the phone, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
