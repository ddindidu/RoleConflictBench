My stepbrother nudged me, grinning, and I knew he wanted me to join in, to be part of the family, to laugh and share in the planning. I wanted that too. But my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big deal\u2014everyone from work would be there, including my boss and colleagues of all genders. As a Muslim, I always tried to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, but my stepmom had already laid out a dress for me, something she thought would help me \u201cfit in\u201d at work, something sleeveless and above the knee. She wanted me to feel included, to look like everyone else, to make a good impression. I could feel the pressure from both sides\u2014my family wanting me to blend in, my faith asking me to stand out. My heart pounded as I stared at the dress, torn between the warmth of belonging and the comfort of my beliefs, not knowing which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
