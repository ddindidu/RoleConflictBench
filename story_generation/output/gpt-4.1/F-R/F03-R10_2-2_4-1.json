Lately, my parents had become more insistent about upholding our customs\u2014no phones at the table, everyone present, and a prayer before eating. I understood their wishes; these rituals were the threads that held our family together. But as a practicing Hindu, I also felt a deep responsibility to perform my daily puja, lighting the lamp and offering prayers at our home altar at dusk. The timing always clashed with dinner, and my absence from the table\u2014even for a few minutes\u2014was met with disapproval. My mother\u2019s disappointed glance and my father\u2019s gentle reminders weighed on me, while my heart tugged me toward the altar, where the lamp waited to be lit. Each evening, I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet call of my faith, feeling the pressure build as I tried to honor both, yet knowing I could not fully satisfy either."}
