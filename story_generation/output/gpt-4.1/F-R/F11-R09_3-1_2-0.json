I really need you.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his sister, I always promised to be there, no matter what. I glanced at the clock\u2014our weekly Jewish study session with the kids was about to start. I\u2019d spent all week preparing stories about our family\u2019s history, hoping to pass on the traditions and values that meant so much to me. The kids were waiting in the living room, their books open, eyes bright with curiosity.\n\nBut my brother\u2019s message tugged at me. He never asked for help unless he truly needed it. I could shift the lesson to another day, but I worried about losing momentum, about letting the kids down or missing a chance to connect them to our heritage. My heart ached, torn between the role of the supportive sister and the devoted teacher of our faith. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
