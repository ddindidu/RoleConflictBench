He was upset again, frustrated with our parents and lashing out at me for not taking his side. As his sister, I knew I should listen patiently, respect his feelings, and try to understand his point of view, even if I disagreed. But just as I started to type a gentle reply, my phone rang\u2014a member of my congregation, Mrs. Lee, was on the line, her voice trembling as she asked if I had a moment to talk. She needed comfort, spiritual guidance, someone to remind her of hope and faith. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my brother needed a patient, understanding sister, while Mrs. Lee needed a calm, wise pastor.
