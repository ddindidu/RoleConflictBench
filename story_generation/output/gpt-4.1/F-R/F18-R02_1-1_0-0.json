His final exam was tomorrow, and the anxiety was written all over his face. He kept glancing at his notes, muttering formulas under his breath, and every so often, he\u2019d look at me, searching for reassurance. I knew he needed me\u2014just to listen, to remind him he was capable, to be the steady presence he\u2019d always counted on.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In twenty minutes, I was supposed to be at the chapel, leading the daily prayer service. Even though it was optional, the community expected me to be there, to guide them in faith and offer comfort. I could already imagine the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, the questions about my commitment.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother\u2019s need for support was immediate and real, but so was my responsibility to the congregation. I sat there, caught between the pull of family and faith, unsure which path to take."}
