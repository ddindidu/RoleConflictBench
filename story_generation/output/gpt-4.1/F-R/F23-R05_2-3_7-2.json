My stepdaughter\u2019s voice drifted in from the living room, asking if we could go grocery shopping soon. I knew the fridge was nearly empty, and the rent was due in a week. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of providing for my family, making sure they never felt the insecurity I\u2019d known as a child. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday sermon was only days away. As the rabbi, the congregation looked to me for inspiration, for words that would carry them through the year. I was expected to prepare something meaningful, something that would touch every soul in the sanctuary. My mind raced\u2014should I pick up extra hours at the tutoring center to cover expenses, or devote the time to crafting the sermon my community needed? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself pulled apart, desperate not to fail either my family or my congregation."}
