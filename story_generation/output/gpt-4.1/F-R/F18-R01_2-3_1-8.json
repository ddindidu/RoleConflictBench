The community leaders were counting on me to guide them through some of the most challenging theological concepts, and I felt the weight of their expectations. Just as I was reviewing my outline, I heard the front door slam. My younger brother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. He barely glanced at me before heading to his room, but I could feel the heaviness radiating from him. As his sibling, I knew I should go to him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014he needed me now more than ever. But the clock was ticking, and I still had so much to prepare for the workshop. The congregation expected clarity and inspiration, and I couldn\u2019t let them down. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to be the supportive brother he needed, and the responsibility to be the pastor my community relied on. I sat at my desk, torn, the silence of the house pressing in as I wrestled with what to do next."}
