I really need your advice,\u201d he said, his voice trembling. I could see he was carrying a heavy burden, and my heart ached to be the guiding hand he needed. Yet, tonight was also the community Quran study circle\u2014a gathering I had committed to, where we would discuss verses I hadn\u2019t yet read or reflected upon. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of my responsibility to honor the Quran, to be prepared and present with my brothers and sisters in faith. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my faith. I wanted to give my grandson my full attention, to share my wisdom and comfort him, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual obligations, the expectation to be a devoted member of my community. The clock ticked on, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
