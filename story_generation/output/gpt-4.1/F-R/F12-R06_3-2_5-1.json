As a wife, I know it\u2019s my responsibility to help make everything perfect\u2014cleaning, cooking, making sure every detail is just right. My husband expects me to coordinate the chores, and I feel the pressure to meet his family\u2019s standards. But as I\u2019m scrubbing the kitchen, I overhear him on the phone, making up a story about why the house might not be spotless, blaming our busy schedules and even exaggerating my workload. He wants me to go along with it, to nod and smile if anyone asks. \n\nBut my Christian values tug at me. Honesty is important, and I know I shouldn\u2019t support a lie, even a small one meant to save face. I feel torn\u2014should I support my husband and keep the peace, or should I gently correct the story, risking embarrassment and tension? My heart pounds as I set down the sponge, caught between my roles as a supportive wife and a faithful Christian, unsure which expectation I can bear to disappoint."}
