The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and I was supposed to be there, waiting at the gate, smiling and waving as my stepchildren spilled out with their friends. It was important to them, and to my partner, that I showed up\u2014proof that I cared, that I was part of the family. But as I reached for my keys, I caught sight of the small altar in the corner of the living room. My daily puja had been reduced to hurried whispers of a mantra between chores, and today, I hadn\u2019t even managed that. Guilt gnawed at me. My faith asked for more\u2014a few quiet minutes, incense, a lamp, a sense of peace. But the world outside demanded my presence, my attention, my love for children who were still learning to trust me. I stood in the hallway, torn between the gentle pull of my tradition and the urgent call of my new family, heart pounding as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor."}
