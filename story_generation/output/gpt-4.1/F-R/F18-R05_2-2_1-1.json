He tried to brush past me, but I caught his arm gently. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, my heart tightening. He shook his head, mumbling something about friends and how nothing ever goes right. I wanted to sit with him, to listen and reassure him, to be the sibling he needed right now. But as I glanced at the clock, my mind raced with the unfinished sermon notes scattered across my desk. Shabbat was only hours away, and as the rabbi, the community expected me to deliver a thoughtful, inspiring message. I could already imagine the congregation waiting, the weight of their anticipation pressing on me. My brother\u2019s pain pulled me one way, my duty to my community the other. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the impossible stretch between being the sibling he needed and the rabbi everyone expected."}
