My heart swelled with pride, and I knew he wanted me there for the family dinner they were planning\u2014a celebration of his achievement. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to support him, to be present for his milestones, and I could already picture his hopeful face scanning the room for me.\n\nBut as I read the message, Mother Superior approached, her voice gentle but firm. She asked if I would lead the daily reflections for our community during the upcoming retreat. It was a rare honor, a sign of trust, and I knew how much preparation and spiritual focus it would require. The retreat overlapped exactly with my brother\u2019s celebration. My mind spun with the weight of both expectations: my family\u2019s need for my presence, my community\u2019s need for my guidance. I felt torn, the two worlds pulling at me, each demanding a part of my heart I wasn\u2019t sure how to divide."}
