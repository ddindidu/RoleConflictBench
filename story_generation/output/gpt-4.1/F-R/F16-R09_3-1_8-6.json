My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to say something\u2014anything\u2014about the medical bill that had just arrived. We\u2019d always promised to be honest with each other, to talk things through, no matter how uncomfortable. But tonight was also Erev Shabbat, and I was expected at synagogue, as I had been every Friday for years. The community counted on me, even if my absence wouldn\u2019t tip the scales. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be present for my partner, to share my fears and listen to theirs, and the pull of tradition, the comfort and responsibility of joining my congregation in prayer. My heart thudded with anxiety, torn between the sacredness of my marriage and the sacredness of my faith, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
