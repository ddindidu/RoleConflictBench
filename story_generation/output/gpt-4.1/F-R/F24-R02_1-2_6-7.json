Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s younger and still learning the ropes of our blended family. I glance at my watch\u20144:15. The parish\u2019s children\u2019s class starts at 4:30, and I\u2019m supposed to be there early to set up. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the church secretary: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the lesson plan and snacks!\u201d I feel a knot tighten in my stomach.\n\nMy stepbrother lingers by the corner store, eyeing the comic books in the window. He wants to stop, but if I do, I\u2019ll be late for the class. If I rush him, I\u2019ll break the promise I made to Mom to always walk him home safely, never leaving him behind. I can\u2019t call anyone for help\u2014everyone\u2019s busy. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the parish expects me to be a reliable leader, but my family expects me to be a caring sibling. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the church and my brother, unsure which path to take."}
