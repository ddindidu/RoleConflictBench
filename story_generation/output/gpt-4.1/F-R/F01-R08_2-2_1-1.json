Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. The guilt pressed on me; I had promised myself to finish the Quran this month, to reflect and grow closer to Allah. Just as I was about to begin, I heard a soft knock. My grandson stood at the door, his eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. I could sense something was weighing on him, something he wasn\u2019t ready to share with anyone else. As a grandfather, I knew I should offer him my time, my ear, and the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But the Quran called to me too, reminding me of my spiritual duties and the promise I\u2019d made to myself and to God. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the boy who needed me, and toward the words that nourished my soul. I sat there, torn, the silence between us heavy with expectation."}
