The house buzzed with urgency\u2014relatives would arrive in a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. My spouse\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for help with the vacuuming and the guest room. I nodded, feeling the weight of our shared responsibility. But my mind kept drifting to the half-finished sermon on my desk upstairs. Sunday was approaching fast, and the congregation expected guidance on a difficult moral issue. I knew they relied on me to offer clarity and hope, and I felt the pressure to craft every word with care. The clatter of dishes and the hum of the washing machine clashed with the quiet call of my pastoral duty.

My heart ached with the fear of letting someone down, and I stood frozen, unsure which role to answer first."}
