The pride in her voice was unmistakable, and I could hear Ethan in the background, bubbling with excitement. As his grandfather, I know how important it is to be present, to call, to celebrate these milestones, to let him know how proud I am. But as I hung up, I glanced at the calendar and felt a knot in my stomach. Tonight is the service at synagogue, and I am scheduled to chant a portion\u2014a commitment I made weeks ago, one that carries weight in my community and in my faith. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m being pulled in two directions. If I go to the service, I\u2019ll miss the family dinner they\u2019ve planned for Ethan, the chance to be there for him in this moment. If I skip the service, I\u2019ll be letting down my congregation and my own sense of religious duty. The expectations press in on me, and I sit at the kitchen table, phone in hand, heart heavy, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
