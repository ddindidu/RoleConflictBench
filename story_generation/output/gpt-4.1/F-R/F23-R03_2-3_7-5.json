My stepdaughter\u2019s voice echoed from the next room, asking if we could buy groceries this week. I felt the weight of my promise to provide, to keep our little family afloat. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the Mother Superior, reminding me of the honor and duty of leading the prayer vigil tomorrow. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to guide others in faith, especially at such a significant event. But the vigil meant missing a shift at the bakery\u2014the only extra work I could find to help pay for food and rent. My heart twisted, torn between the sacred call to serve God and the urgent, practical needs of my family. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure of both worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left wanting."}
