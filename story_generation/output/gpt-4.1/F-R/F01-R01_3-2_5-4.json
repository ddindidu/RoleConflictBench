My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the family emergency\u2014her husband had been rushed to the hospital, and she needed me to stay with the children. My heart ached to be there for them, to offer comfort and stability as only a grandfather could. Just as I was about to reassure her, my phone buzzed. It was a member of my congregation, her voice barely holding together as she described her own crisis\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she needed my guidance, my prayers, my presence. I could hear the desperation in her words, the same kind of fear I saw in my daughter\u2019s eyes. Both needed me, both expected me to be their anchor. I felt torn, the weight of my responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure how I could possibly be enough for everyone who needed me right now."}
