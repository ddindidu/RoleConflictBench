The fridge was nearly empty, and the rent was due in three days. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of their trust\u2014my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure there was food on the table and a roof over our heads. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: Friday Khutbah, 1:00 PM. This week was special; the community had organized a celebration, and people from neighboring towns were coming just to hear my sermon. As the imam, I was expected to inspire, to lead, to be present for my congregation at this milestone. But the only way to cover our expenses was to take a last-minute shift at the warehouse\u2014right during the sermon. My heart pounded as I imagined the disappointment in my family\u2019s eyes if I failed them, and the letdown in my community if I was absent. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding all of me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which duty to betray."}
