My family gathered around, laughter echoing as they prepared for our annual tradition\u2014each of us sharing a story from the past year. My mother caught my eye, her look gentle but expectant. She wanted me to share something meaningful, to honor our family\u2019s way of connecting and remembering. But my phone buzzed quietly in my pocket. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. Her husband had just been admitted to the hospital, and she was reaching out for comfort, for prayer, for guidance. I could almost hear her trembling voice in the words she typed. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the warmth and belonging of my family, and toward the responsibility I felt for my congregation. I wanted to be present for both, but the weight of their expectations pressed on me, making it hard to breathe. I stared at my phone, torn, as my family waited for me to speak."}
