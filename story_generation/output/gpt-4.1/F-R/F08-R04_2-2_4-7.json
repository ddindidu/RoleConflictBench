My daughter had just announced her promotion, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. As a grandmother, I knew how much these moments meant\u2014my presence, my stories, my hugs. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Amina, a devoted member of our mosque. Her words were urgent: she needed to meet with me tonight, her family troubles weighing heavily on her heart. As the imam, I was her guide, her confidante, and she trusted me to help her find peace. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family, and the duty I felt to my community. I could hear my grandchildren calling for me, but I also saw Amina\u2019s anxious face in my mind. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
