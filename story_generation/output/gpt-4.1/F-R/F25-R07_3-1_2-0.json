She expects me to reply quickly, to share every detail, to reassure her that I\u2019m present in this new family. I know it\u2019s important\u2014she\u2019s trying to build a bond, and I want to honor that. But tonight, as I sit cross-legged on the temple floor, the soft hum of the evening chant begins. The community expects me to be fully present, to let go of distractions, and to join in the ritual with my whole heart. My phone vibrates in my pocket, a reminder of my other world. I feel torn\u2014if I answer, I\u2019ll break the sacred silence and seem disrespectful to my Buddhist community. If I ignore it, I\u2019ll disappoint my stepmother, who\u2019s trying so hard to connect. My hands tremble in my lap, caught between two worlds, each demanding my attention, each with its own claim on my loyalty."}
