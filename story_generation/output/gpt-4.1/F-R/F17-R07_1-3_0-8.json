Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I can almost hear her voice, gentle but expectant, wanting to know about my week. I type a quick reply, but my mind is elsewhere. My Buddhist teacher asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a responsibility I can\u2019t take lightly. I promised myself I\u2019d spend tonight in quiet study, reflecting deeply, not just skimming notes. But as I try to focus, my phone lights up again. Dad sends a photo of our dog, and I feel a tug of guilt. They want to connect, to hear about my life, and I want to be a good child, present and attentive. Yet, my heart is pulled toward the teachings, toward the silence and contemplation I promised my teacher. I sit at my desk, torn between the warmth of family and the call of the Dharma, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
