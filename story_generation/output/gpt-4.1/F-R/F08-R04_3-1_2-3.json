My granddaughter, eyes red and voice trembling, clutched my hand. \u201cGrandma, I need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered, her words heavy with worry. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to comfort her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades, to be the steady presence she needed right now. But in less than an hour, I was expected at the mosque. As the imam, the community looked to me for guidance, for the words that would shape their week. Today, though, a guest speaker was ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My heart twisted. My granddaughter\u2019s need was urgent, but so was my duty to the congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my voice. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
