The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. As a father, I felt the weight of providing for my family, making sure there was enough for rent, food, and the kids\u2019 school supplies. My son\u2019s shoes had holes in them, and my daughter needed a new backpack. I knew I had to find a way to bring in more money, maybe take on extra work or cut back even further.\n\nBut as a pastor, my heart was pulled in another direction. The sermon for Sunday was only half-written, and I knew my congregation needed guidance. They looked to me for wisdom, for reassurance in uncertain times. I was supposed to teach them about faith, about trusting in God\u2019s provision, about living with integrity and not letting material worries consume us.\n\nThe clock ticked loudly. My mind raced between the demands of my family and the expectations of my church. I felt torn, the pressure building inside me, unsure how to be both the father my family needed and the pastor my congregation expected."}
