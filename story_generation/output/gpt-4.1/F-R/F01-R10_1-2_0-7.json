As a Hindu, I knew how important it was to be present, to honor tradition, to show my respect by arriving on time and dressed properly. Just as I was about to leave, my granddaughter appeared at the door, her eyes uncertain. \u201cDadaji, can I talk to you?\u201d she asked, her voice small. She was entering a new phase in her life, and I could see she needed guidance\u2014my guidance. As a grandfather, I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would listen, share my wisdom, and help her find her way. But the ceremony was about to begin, and everyone would be waiting for me. My heart pulled in two directions: the duty to my faith and family tradition, and the duty to my granddaughter, who needed me now. I stood there, torn, the seconds ticking by, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in on me."}
