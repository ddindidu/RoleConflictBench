I knew they\u2019d been struggling lately, and I felt a son\u2019s duty to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort. But as I glanced at the clock, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Friday sermon. As the imam, the community expected me to stand before them, to guide and inspire. Today, though, a guest speaker was ready, his notes in hand, prepared to step in if I needed. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my parents, who needed their son, and toward my congregation, who looked to me for leadership. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which door to open."}
