The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. My son tugged at my sleeve, asking if we could buy new shoes for school. I nodded, hiding my anxiety. As a father, I knew I had to find a way to provide, to keep the lights on and food on the table. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In an hour, I was expected at the church to lead the weekly religious education class. The children and their parents counted on me to guide them, to be present and prepared. I could not let them down. Yet, I also knew that if I took on a few extra hours at the hardware store today, I could bring home enough to cover groceries for the week. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s needs on one side, my parish\u2019s expectations on the other. I closed my eyes, torn, the decision looming, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
