He accused me of betraying his trust, and his words stung more than I expected. As his brother, I know I should talk things through, listen to his side, and work toward rebuilding the respect between us. That\u2019s what our parents always taught us\u2014never let anger fester, always communicate openly.\n\nBut as a Christian, I feel another pull. I remember the teachings of Jesus: love your neighbor, forgive those who hurt you, show kindness even when it\u2019s hard. My brother\u2019s harsh words echo in my mind, and I feel the urge to respond with compassion, to let go of my pride and embrace him with understanding.\n\nYet, I\u2019m torn. If I reach out too quickly, will I be betraying my own hurt, letting him think his words were justified? If I hold back, am I failing to show the love and forgiveness my faith demands? The expectations of being a good brother and a faithful Christian twist inside me, and I sit in silence, wrestling with what to do next."}
