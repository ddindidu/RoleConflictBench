My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my sister suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me for my opinion. I wanted to be present, to share in the warmth and the easy banter, but my mind kept drifting. In the back of my head, I heard the ticking clock\u2014Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t even started thinking about my next sermon. As a rabbi, I was expected to offer something meaningful, something that would resonate with the congregation. The pressure to inspire weighed heavily on me, and I knew I needed quiet time to reflect and prepare. Yet here I was, expected to be the attentive sibling, fully engaged in family plans. My heart tugged in two directions: the comfort of family togetherness and the solemn responsibility of spiritual leadership. I smiled at my siblings, but inside, I wrestled with the impossible choice between being present for them and fulfilling my calling as a rabbi."}
