He\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I knew how much it would mean to him if I showed up. As his brother, I wanted to build our relationship, to make sure he felt included and respected. But when I arrived, I realized the plan was to go to a club known for its wild parties\u2014something that clashed with my Christian values. My faith teaches me to avoid situations that might compromise my morals, and I could already feel the tension rising inside me. My brother looked at me, hopeful, expecting me to join in and be part of his world. At the same time, I felt the weight of my beliefs, the responsibility to live according to my faith. I stood there, torn between being the supportive brother he needed and staying true to the principles that guide my life, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
