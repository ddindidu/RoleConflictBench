She needed me\u2014her eyes had pleaded for comfort as she described the impossible choice her boss had given her. I wanted to hold her, to reassure her that she was strong enough, that I believed in her. But as I reached for her hand, I caught sight of my reflection in the glass. My shirt sleeves were rolled up, and I hadn\u2019t changed into my long-sleeved kurta yet. The call to prayer drifted from the mosque\u2019s loudspeakers, reminding me that I was moments away from joining the congregation. As a Muslim, I knew I should dress modestly before entering the prayer hall, but as a husband, I felt torn\u2014my wife needed me now, not after I changed. My heart pounded as I stood between the door to the prayer hall and the living room, wrestling with the weight of both expectations, feeling the pressure of time and the ache of wanting to be enough for both."}
