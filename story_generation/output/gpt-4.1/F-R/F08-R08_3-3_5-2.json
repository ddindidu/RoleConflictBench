There\u2019s trouble at home\u2014my grandson is sick, and my family needs me. As a grandmother, I know my presence brings comfort, and I ache to be there, to hold my daughter\u2019s hand and soothe my grandson\u2019s fevered brow. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle, a gathering I\u2019ve committed to as a Muslim. We\u2019re discussing verses I haven\u2019t yet read, and I promised myself I\u2019d be prepared, to honor my faith and deepen my understanding. The expectation to nurture my family tugs at my heart, while the duty to my faith and community weighs on my conscience. I sit at the kitchen table, torn, the Quran open before me, my phone buzzing with messages from my daughter. My heart aches with the impossible choice\u2014do I go to my family, or do I fulfill my spiritual commitment? The clock ticks, and I feel the pressure mounting, caught between love and devotion, unsure which path to take."}
