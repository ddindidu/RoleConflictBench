My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cWe need you with us for the family trip this weekend. It\u2019s important to your father.\u201d I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I\u2019d missed so many gatherings before. As a step-sibling, I was expected to show up, to be present, to help knit this patchwork family together. But Sunday was also the day of the main weekly service at church, the one I led as priest. My congregation counted on me for guidance, for prayers, for the comfort of tradition. I could already picture the pews filled with familiar faces, waiting for me to step up to the altar. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. If I chose one, I\u2019d disappoint the other. I wanted to be a good sibling, to belong, but I also felt the sacred responsibility to my community. I sat in silence, torn between the warmth of family and the solemn call of faith, unable to move forward, caught in the tension of two lives that refused to fit together."}
