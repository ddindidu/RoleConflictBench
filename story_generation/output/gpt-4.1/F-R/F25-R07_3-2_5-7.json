I knew how much this meant to her and my father\u2014how important it was to show that I belonged, that I respected their family\u2019s traditions. My heart pounded with the weight of their expectations, the hope that I would finally step fully into my role as their child.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a time I cherished for its quiet reflection and the gentle guidance of my teacher. We were to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to honor my commitment to spiritual growth. The two worlds pulled at me\u2014one demanding outward participation, the other inward contemplation. I could feel the tension building inside, the fear of disappointing my family, the worry of neglecting my practice. I sat in silence, torn between the voices of tradition and the call of my own spiritual path, unsure which to answer."}
