My stepsister clapped her hands, already planning our itinerary. As the newest member of this blended family, I felt the pressure to join in, to show I belonged by participating in every family activity. But as everyone\u2019s eyes turned to me, waiting for my input, my mind drifted elsewhere. I remembered my own promise to myself as a Muslim\u2014to save for Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. I was only a few years into my career, and every extra euro I earned went into my Hajj fund. The thought of spending a large sum on a spontaneous trip made my chest tighten. I wanted to be part of the family, to share in their joy, but I also felt the weight of my religious commitment. My heart pounded as I tried to find words, torn between the expectations of my new family and the spiritual journey I longed to fulfill."}
