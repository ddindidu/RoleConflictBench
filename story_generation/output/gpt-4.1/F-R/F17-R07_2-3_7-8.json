My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. I wanted to sit with them, to offer comfort, to be the child they could lean on.\n\nBut in my room, the invitation from my Buddhist teacher sat on my desk, a gentle but firm reminder. Tomorrow, I was to present a summary of the key teachings we\u2019d studied, to help guide others in their practice. I was expected to reflect, to study, to prepare my mind and words with care. The teachings called for focus and detachment, for turning inward and cultivating understanding.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014toward my parents\u2019 silent plea for support, and toward the quiet discipline of my spiritual path. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, unsure which call to answer first."}
