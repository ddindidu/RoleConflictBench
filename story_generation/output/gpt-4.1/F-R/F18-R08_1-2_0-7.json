My heart raced at the thought\u2014I had saved for years, and this was the season I could finally go. But as I glanced across the room, I saw my younger brother hunched over his textbooks, his face pale and tense. He\u2019d barely eaten all week, and every night he confided in me about his fears of failing his final exam. I knew he needed me now more than ever, to listen, to reassure him, to be the sibling he could lean on. Yet, the call to fulfill my religious duty tugged at me just as strongly. My friends were urging me not to miss this chance, reminding me how important Hajj is in our faith. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which path to take as I watched my brother\u2019s anxious figure and reread the messages lighting up my phone."}
