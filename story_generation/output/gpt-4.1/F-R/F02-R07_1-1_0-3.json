My children will be waiting, eyes searching the crowd for me, their father, as they finish another day. I promised them I\u2019d be there, just as I always try to be. But today, I had also promised myself something: a quiet ten-minute window for meditation, a rare chance to practice mindfulness amid the chaos. The cushion is already set, the incense lit, the room silent. My mind aches for stillness, for the gentle discipline of breath and presence, the expectation I hold as a Buddhist. Yet, the image of my children\u2019s hopeful faces tugs at me, the weight of fatherhood pressing in. I feel torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions. My heart races, caught between the peace I seek and the love I owe. The minutes slip away, and I sit, wrestling with the impossible choice, the expectations of both father and Buddhist heavy on my shoulders."}
