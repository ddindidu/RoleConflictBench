Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d It\u2019s Sunday afternoon, and I promised myself I\u2019d spend these ten minutes in mindful meditation, letting go of distractions and focusing on my breath. But the gentle tug of my mother\u2019s words pulls me away from the present moment. I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I want to be a good daughter, to reassure her that I\u2019m okay. At the same time, I feel the weight of my commitment to my Buddhist practice, the need to honor this quiet space I carved out for myself. My phone vibrates again, and my mind races\u2014should I answer now, or let her wait while I try to find stillness? The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit there, torn, my heart beating a little faster as I wrestle with the urge to respond and the longing for peace."}
