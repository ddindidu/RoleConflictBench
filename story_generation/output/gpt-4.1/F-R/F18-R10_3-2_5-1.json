The quiet moments of chanting and the scent of incense always bring me peace. But today, my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re leaving for the family trip at 7! Everyone\u2019s counting on you to help with the preparations.\u201d My heart tightened. The family holiday celebration is a big deal\u2014my parents expect me to be present, cheerful, and involved, especially since we rarely get time together. But if I leave with them at dawn, I\u2019ll miss my morning rituals, the time I dedicate to my faith and inner calm. I can\u2019t help but feel torn. If I stay back to pray, I\u2019ll disappoint my family. If I rush out with them, I\u2019ll neglect my spiritual duties. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I find myself standing in the hallway, keys in one hand and prayer beads in the other, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
