Laughter and footsteps echo from the living room, where my daughter is setting up board games. The calendar on the fridge reminds me: today is our family gathering, a rare chance to have everyone under one roof. I want to be present, to listen to my grandson\u2019s stories, to help my granddaughter with her puzzle. Yet, in my pocket, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: it\u2019s almost time for my daily meditation. Just ten minutes of quiet, a promise I made to myself to nurture my Buddhist practice, to find stillness amid the noise. But how can I slip away now, when everyone expects me to be at the heart of the celebration? My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family, and the peace of my own breath. I stand in the kitchen, torn, the scent of ginger and garlic swirling around me, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
