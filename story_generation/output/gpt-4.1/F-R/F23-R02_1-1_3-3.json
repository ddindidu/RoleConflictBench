He\u2019d forgotten to say \u201cplease\u201d again, and I knew I should gently remind him\u2014teach him the small courtesies that shape character. My role as a step-parent demanded patience, consistency, and the courage to correct, even when I feared overstepping. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a parishioner, asking if I could find time to talk soon. She didn\u2019t say why, but her words hinted at something heavy. As a priest, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance, to put others\u2019 needs before my own. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my stepson\u2019s expectant eyes, the silent plea in the parishioner\u2019s message. I stood there, torn, the fork in my hand trembling slightly, wondering how I could possibly be what both of them needed at the same time."}
