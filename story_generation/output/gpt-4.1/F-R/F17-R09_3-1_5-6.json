But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the synagogue service happening at the same time. Rabbi Cohen had reminded us all about the importance of regular attendance, of being part of the community, of not letting the numbers dwindle. I wanted to be there, to feel the comfort of familiar prayers and the warmth of my friends. But I also didn\u2019t want to disappoint my family or break the chain of tradition.
