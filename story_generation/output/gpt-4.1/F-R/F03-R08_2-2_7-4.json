They\u2019ve both seemed more worn out lately, and I know they count on me to be present, to offer comfort and listen when the world feels too heavy. Today, though, my mind is split. There\u2019s an office function this afternoon\u2014one of those events where everyone dresses up, and the unspoken expectation is to blend in, to look sharp and modern. My parents, sensing my anxiety, asked if I\u2019d be home early to talk, maybe share dinner together. But as a Muslim, I\u2019m also conscious of dressing modestly, especially in mixed company. The thought of standing out at work, of being judged or questioned, makes my stomach twist. I want to be there for my parents, to reassure them, but I also can\u2019t ignore the pressure to fit in at work while staying true to my faith. The weight of these expectations presses on me, and I find myself caught between wanting to support my family and needing to navigate my identity in a world that doesn\u2019t always understand."}
