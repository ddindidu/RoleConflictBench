I know as her brother, I should talk to her, listen, and try to rebuild the trust that\u2019s been fraying between us. Our parents always said siblings should respect each other, and I feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle, and I promised myself I\u2019d attend every week. This week\u2019s verses are ones I haven\u2019t read yet, and I know I should have spent more time reflecting on them. As a Muslim, I want to honor my commitment to learning and growing in my faith, especially with Ramadan approaching. I stand in the hallway, torn. My sister\u2019s muffled sobs reach me, and guilt gnaws at me for even considering leaving. But the thought of disappointing my study group and neglecting my spiritual growth makes my chest tighten. I grip the doorknob, caught between the urge to knock and the urge to leave, my heart pulled in two directions by the roles I hold most dear."}
