The rhythmic chanting always brought me peace, a sense of order in my world. Just as I finished the first mantra, my stepmother\u2019s voice trembled from the hallway. She entered, eyes red, clutching a mug with both hands. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d she whispered, her voice barely holding together. I glanced at the clock\u2014my next prayer was due in five minutes. She sat beside me, tears spilling as she shared her fears about her job, her loneliness, her doubts about fitting into our family. I could feel her need for comfort, for someone to listen and reassure her. But my mind raced with the rituals I was about to miss, the guilt of breaking my spiritual discipline. I wanted to be the stepchild she needed, to offer her warmth and support, but the weight of my religious commitment pressed down on me. My heart pounded as I sat between her sorrow and my sacred routine, torn by the demands of both worlds, unsure which to honor in that moment."}
