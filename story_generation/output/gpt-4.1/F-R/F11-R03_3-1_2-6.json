The quiet was a rare gift, and I felt a deep longing to lose myself in prayer and reflection, to nourish my spirit as my vows required. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. It was my younger sister, her name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, knowing she wouldn\u2019t call unless she truly needed me. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, to be there in moments of crisis. My heart twisted as I imagined her alone, perhaps crying, reaching out for comfort only I could give. Yet, I also felt the weight of my commitment to this sacred time, the expectation that I devote myself fully to spiritual growth. The silence around me grew heavy, filled with the tension between my devotion as a nun and my love as a sister. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the pull of both worlds and the ache of not knowing which to choose."}
