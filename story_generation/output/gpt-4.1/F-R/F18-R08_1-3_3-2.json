You have to help us decide where to go.\u201d My parents look up, expecting me to join the lively debate about beaches versus mountains. I know how much these moments mean to them; we rarely get time together, and they count on me to be part of the family\u2019s laughter and decisions.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: the community study circle meets tonight. We\u2019re supposed to discuss verses from the Quran that I haven\u2019t had time to read yet. As a Muslim, I feel a deep responsibility to participate, to learn, and to reflect with others. The group expects me to be prepared, to contribute thoughtfully.\n\nI stand in the doorway, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of my family and the pull of my faith. Both sides expect my presence, my attention, my commitment. I can feel the weight of their hopes pressing in from both directions, and I don\u2019t know how to choose."}
