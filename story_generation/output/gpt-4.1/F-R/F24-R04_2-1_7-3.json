He was determined to land a new trick, but I could see the risk\u2014one wrong move and he could be seriously hurt. As his stepbrother, I felt a knot of worry in my stomach. I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But my phone buzzed: it was almost time for Friday prayers. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the khutbah, to guide the congregation and fulfill my duty to the community. The guest speaker was ready, but I knew people expected me to be there, to lead as I always did. My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and the mosque, torn by the weight of both roles. Should I stay and watch over my brother, or trust the guest speaker and rush to the mosque? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt paralyzed, unable to move in either direction."}
