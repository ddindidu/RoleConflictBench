My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about the emergency with my grandson\u2014he needed me, needed his grandfather, right now. I could hear the fear in her words, the unspoken plea for comfort and strength. At the same time, my other phone rang. It was the church deacon. A terrible accident had struck several families in our congregation. They needed their pastor, someone to guide them through shock and grief, to organize support and offer prayers. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected me to be present, to hold them together in this moment of crisis. My congregation looked to me for leadership and solace, especially when tragedy struck. My heart ached, torn between the love for my family and the duty to my flock. I stared at the two phones, each representing a part of who I am, and felt the impossible pull of both roles demanding all of me at once."}
