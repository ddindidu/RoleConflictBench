My daughter\u2019s shoes had holes, and my wife had quietly skipped lunch again. As a father, I felt the weight of their needs pressing down on me, the unspoken expectation that I would find a way to keep us afloat. Every dollar mattered, every expense scrutinized.\n\nThat afternoon, on my way to the grocery store, I saw an elderly man outside, shivering in the cold, holding a cardboard sign. \u201cHungry. Please help.\u201d My heart ached. As a Christian, I knew what Jesus would do\u2014offer kindness, share what little I had. But my wallet was thin, and every cent was already spoken for. I stood there, torn, the demands of my roles pulling me in opposite directions. My family needed me to be practical, to save every penny. My faith called me to be generous, to love my neighbor as myself. I gripped the grocery list in my hand, feeling the tension rise, unsure which path to take."}
