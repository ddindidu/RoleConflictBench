My stepmother\u2019s message blinked at the top: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we need you at the family holiday dinner this Saturday. It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I could already picture the table, the laughter, the awkward but earnest attempts to make me feel included. I knew how much it mattered to them, especially since I\u2019d joined their lives only a few years ago. But then, the church group chat buzzed with reminders about the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series\u2014also on Saturday. As the priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to show unwavering commitment. The parish counted on me to set the tone for the coming year\u2019s spiritual growth. My chest tightened. If I missed the meeting, I\u2019d let down my congregation and my fellow leaders. If I skipped the family dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my new family, maybe deepen the distance I still sometimes felt. I sat in my office, torn, the weight of both collars\u2014family and faith\u2014pressing on my shoulders, unsure which would demand the greater sacrifice."}
