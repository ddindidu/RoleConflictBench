She had always been more comfortable in jeans and a loose t-shirt, and today was no different. I, on the other hand, wore my abaya and scarf, ready for Friday prayer. She hesitated, tugging at her shirt, clearly aware of the stares from the other women. I remembered our parents\u2019 advice: as sisters, we should always support each other, respect our differences, and never let anyone come between us. But as a Muslim, I also felt the weight of the community\u2019s expectations\u2014modesty in dress was not just a personal choice, but a visible sign of faith, especially in the mosque. My heart pounded as I tried to balance my role as her understanding sister with my responsibility to uphold Islamic guidelines. I wanted to protect her from judgment, but I also worried about what it meant for both of us to enter the prayer hall like this. The tension between my love for her and my commitment to my faith left me frozen at the threshold, unsure of what to do next."}
