She\u2019s not well. The children are scared.\u201d My heart clenched; as a grandparent, I knew my family needed my comfort, my presence, my steady hands to hold them together. Yet, outside, the mosque courtyard filled with worshippers\u2014more than usual, gathered for a special remembrance. As the imam, I was expected to lead them, to offer guidance and solace, especially today when no one else was authorized to step in. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s anticipation, their trust in me to fulfill my duty. My mind raced between the image of my frightened grandchildren and the faithful waiting for me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be their anchor. I stood at the threshold, torn, the call of family and faith pulling me in opposite directions."}
