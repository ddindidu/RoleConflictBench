My grandson, Daniel, had just landed his first job, and she wanted the whole family to gather for a video call to celebrate. As a grandmother, I felt a warm tug in my heart\u2014I wanted to hear Daniel\u2019s stories, to offer my congratulations, to be present for this milestone. But as I hung up, the convent bell echoed through the halls, reminding me of my other life. Mother Superior approached, her eyes kind but firm, and told me I\u2019d been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral tonight. It was an honor, a responsibility I could not take lightly. The sisters were counting on me to represent our community, to guide them in devotion. Yet, my family expected me to be there, to share in their joy. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, the joy of family and the duty of faith pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the laughter of my loved ones and the solemn call to prayer."}
