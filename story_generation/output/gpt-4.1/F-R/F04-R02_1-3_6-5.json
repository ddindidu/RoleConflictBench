She\u2019d texted earlier, excited about trying the new restaurant downtown, and I knew how much these outings meant to her, especially after her rough week at work. As I reached for my keys, my phone buzzed. It was a call from the church secretary: a parishioner had arrived, sobbing and desperate, asking for me by name. She was in crisis, needing immediate spiritual guidance, and there was no one else available. I stood in the hallway, torn. My sister was waiting, expecting the brother who always showed up, who made her feel valued. But the church needed me too, the priest who offered comfort and counsel in moments of darkness. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I cared about would be left waiting."}
