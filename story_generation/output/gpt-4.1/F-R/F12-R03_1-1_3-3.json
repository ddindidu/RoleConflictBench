My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, \u201cCould you help fold these before work?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until the morning prayer service in the chapel. As a wife, I knew he counted on me to share the load, to keep our home running smoothly. But as a nun, my heart was bound to the rhythm of prayer, the sacred silence that awaited me in the chapel\u2019s cool hush. The convent\u2019s bell chimed, a gentle but insistent reminder. My hands hovered over the laundry, guilt prickling at my skin. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the prayers, breaking the discipline I\u2019d promised to uphold. If I left, the laundry would remain, a silent accusation of neglect. My husband\u2019s eyes met mine, hopeful and tired. The bell rang again. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the call of devotion, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
