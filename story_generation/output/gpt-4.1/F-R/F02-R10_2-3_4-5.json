As a father, I knew I had to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces, but he was so full of energy, and I didn\u2019t want to embarrass him by scolding him too harshly in front of others.

As a Hindu, I am taught to stand up against adharma, to act with courage and integrity when I see wrongdoing. But my son was still running wild, and I felt torn.
