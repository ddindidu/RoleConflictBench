It was bright and beautiful, just like she liked\u2014short sleeves, a little above my knees, and covered in cheerful flowers. She had insisted I wear it today, saying it would make her so happy to see me in it, especially since all the relatives would be there after Friday prayers. I could already hear her voice in my head, telling me how proud she was when I followed our family\u2019s traditions.\n\nBut as I looked at my reflection, I felt a knot in my stomach. I was about to enter the main prayer hall for Jumu\u2019ah, and I knew the Islamic guidelines for modesty. I should be wearing long sleeves, loose clothing, and a headscarf. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s joy and pride, and my own sense of responsibility as a Muslim. My heart pounded as I hesitated at the door, torn between making my grandmother happy and staying true to my faith."}
