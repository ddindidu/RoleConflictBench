This afternoon was meant for quiet reflection, a rare moment to nurture my spirit and reconnect with my vows. But my phone buzzed, shattering the silence. The school counselor\u2019s voice was urgent: my stepdaughter had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, to address the situation as her parent.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a nun, I was called to compassion, to seek understanding and forgiveness, to model patience and peace. But as a step-parent, I was expected to act, to show up, to guide and discipline, to be present at her side in moments of trouble. The school expected a parent who would take charge, not a nun lost in contemplation. Yet my community expected me to honor my spiritual commitments, to keep sacred the time set aside for prayer.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn between the world\u2019s demands and my soul\u2019s longing, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each pulling me in a different direction."}
