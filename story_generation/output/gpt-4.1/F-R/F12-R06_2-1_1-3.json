He was anxious, wrestling with a decision at work that could change everything for us. He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance, and I knew he needed me\u2014my words, my presence, my support. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and help him sort through his worries, just as a loving wife should.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the church service starting soon. I hadn\u2019t been in weeks, and I felt the weight of my faith pressing on me\u2014the expectation to worship, to be part of the community, to honor God with my time. I wanted to go, to reconnect with my spiritual family, to feel that sense of belonging and peace.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. I could see the hope in my husband\u2019s eyes, and I could feel the quiet call of my faith. I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
