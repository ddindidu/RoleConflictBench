It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come over. She was in tears, overwhelmed by a crisis at home, and she needed me\u2014her brother. I glanced at the clock. In less than an hour, I was expected at the parish hall, where a dozen children and their parents would be waiting for me to lead the weekly class. As a priest, I knew how important consistency and presence were for the families who relied on me to guide their children\u2019s faith. But as a brother, I felt the pull of our lifelong promise to support each other, especially in moments like this. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the parish counting on my leadership, my sister counting on my love. I stood frozen, torn between the collar around my neck and the bond of blood, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
