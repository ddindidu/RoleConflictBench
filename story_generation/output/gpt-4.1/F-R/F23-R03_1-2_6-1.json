He\u2019d been counting down the days, his eyes shining with hope for the Nintendo I said I\u2019d buy. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of his trust, the need to provide not just for his happiness, but for the stability of our new family. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: the family down the street had lost everything in a fire. The convent was gathering donations\u2014food, clothing, anything we could spare. As a nun, I was expected to give selflessly, to put the needs of others before my own. My heart twisted. The money I\u2019d set aside for the Nintendo could buy groceries and warm coats for the family in need. But if I broke my promise to my stepson, would he ever trust me again? I stared at my wallet, torn between the two worlds I inhabited, feeling the pressure of both expectations closing in on me."}
