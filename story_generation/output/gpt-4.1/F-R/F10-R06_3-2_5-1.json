I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them. But as she described the rituals\u2014bowing before the ancestral altar, offering food, and reciting words I\u2019d learned as a child\u2014I felt a knot form in my stomach. My faith as a Christian taught me to worship only God, to avoid rituals that felt like worshipping ancestors. The thought of disappointing my family made my chest ache, but so did the idea of betraying my beliefs. I could see the pride in my mother\u2019s face, the anticipation in my relatives\u2019 voices, and I felt torn in two, caught between honoring my family and staying true to my faith."}
