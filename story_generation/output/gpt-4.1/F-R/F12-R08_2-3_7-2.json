As his wife, I know I should sit beside him, ask about his day, and share my own worries too. We promised to always communicate openly, to never let concerns fester in silence. But tonight, the community Quran study circle meets, and I haven\u2019t read the verses we\u2019re supposed to discuss. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of my commitment to recite and reflect on the Quran, to be prepared and present with my sisters in faith. The clock ticks closer to the meeting time, and my heart pounds with indecision. Should I stay and talk with my husband, fulfilling my promise to nurture our marriage, or should I go to the study circle, honoring my spiritual responsibilities? The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit on the edge of the couch, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
