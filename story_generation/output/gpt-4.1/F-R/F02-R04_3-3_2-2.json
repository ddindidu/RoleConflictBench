My phone buzzed with a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me there immediately. My heart pounded. As a father, I knew I needed to be present, to guide my son, to show him right from wrong. But as the imam, the community was waiting for me\u2014tonight\u2019s gathering was important, and no one else could lead the prayer. I could picture the congregation, their trust in me, their need for spiritual guidance. At the same time, I imagined my son, anxious and ashamed, needing his father\u2019s support. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to fulfill my duty. I stood frozen, torn between the call of my faith and the call of my family, unsure which path to take."}
