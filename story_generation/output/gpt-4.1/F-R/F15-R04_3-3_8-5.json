The numbers on the loan statement stared back at me, a reminder that in two months, the home I promised my family would be ours could slip away. My wife\u2019s anxious glances and my children\u2019s laughter from the next room pressed on me\u2014their security depended on me. Yet, as I tried to focus on the figures, my phone buzzed with messages from the mosque committee. This Friday\u2019s Khutbah was not just any sermon; it marked the community\u2019s fiftieth year, and people were coming from distant towns, eager to hear words of guidance and hope. They expected inspiration, wisdom, and presence. But my mind was clouded with worry, torn between preparing a sermon worthy of the occasion and finding a way to secure the next loan payment. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly meet the expectations of my family and my congregation at the same time."}
