My stepdad had sent a message: \u201cIt would mean a lot if you came. We want you there.\u201d I knew how important it was to him, and to my stepsiblings, that I join in, especially since I\u2019d missed the last few gatherings. I wanted to feel like part of the family, to show them I cared.\n\nBut then my friend Avi called, his voice trembling. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan at my grandfather\u2019s funeral. Can you come?\u201d My heart clenched. As a Jew, I knew how vital it was to help form the quorum for prayers, especially for something as sacred as a funeral. It was a mitzvah, a commandment, and I could hear the desperation in Avi\u2019s voice.\n\nI felt torn in two. My stepfamily expected me to be present, to show I belonged. My faith and community needed me for a moment that couldn\u2019t be postponed. I sat on my bed, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call to answer."}
