My heart pounded as I replayed the counselor\u2019s words: my son had been caught bullying another child. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to attend the meeting, to show him that his actions had consequences but also that he was loved. I pictured his anxious face, waiting for me to walk through the school doors.\n\nBut then I glanced at my calendar. In less than an hour, a parishioner was coming to the church, desperate for guidance. She had confided in me last week about her ongoing struggle, and I had promised to be there, to listen, to help her find hope. As a priest, my calling was to serve, to offer comfort and counsel.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. My child needed me as a parent, but my community member needed me as a priest. I felt torn, guilt and worry twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
