But as I stood in the supermarket with my son, that peace felt impossibly distant. He darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my gentle reminders to stay close. Other shoppers glanced our way, some with smiles, others with frowns. I felt the weight of my role as a father\u2014responsible for teaching him discipline and respect for others. I knew I should correct his behavior, set boundaries, and guide him toward better choices. Yet, as a Buddhist, I was supposed to meet this chaos with calm, to breathe, to observe my own frustration without letting it control me. The urge to raise my voice clashed with the desire to model patience and compassion. My heart pounded, torn between the need to act as a firm parent and the wish to remain a mindful presence. The minutes ticked by, and I stood there, wrestling with the expectations pressing in from both sides, uncertain which path to take."}
