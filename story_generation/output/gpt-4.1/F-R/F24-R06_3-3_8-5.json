The church service was about to start, and I knew how important it was to be there\u2014my pastor always said our presence was a sign of faith and commitment. But then I saw my stepbrother, Ethan, darting ahead, headphones in, about to cross the busy street without even glancing up. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially since Mom always reminded me that he looked up to me. But if I stopped him, I\u2019d be late for church\u2014again. I could already hear the disappointment in my youth leader\u2019s voice, the subtle reminders about priorities and setting an example. I felt torn, rooted to the spot, watching Ethan\u2019s oblivious figure and the ticking clock, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
