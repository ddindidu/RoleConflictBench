He was struggling, and I knew I needed to be patient, to guide him with kindness and consistency\u2014just as a good step-parent should. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the parish\u2019s children would soon gather for their weekly religious education class, and as their priest, I was expected to lead them, to be present and prepared, to nurture their faith.\n\nMy wife glanced at me, sensing my distraction. \u201cHe needs you,\u201d she whispered, nodding toward her son. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to be a steady, loving presence. At church, a whole community of children and parents awaited my guidance, expecting inspiration and leadership.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked from my stepson\u2019s uncertain eyes to the clock ticking relentlessly forward. I felt torn, knowing that wherever I went, I would be letting someone down. The demands of both roles pulled at me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
