I was just about to leave my small room when I saw my granddaughter, Emma, sitting quietly on the edge of my bed, her eyes red and downcast. She had come to visit for a few days, and I could sense the weight she carried, though she hadn\u2019t spoken of it yet. As a grandmother, my heart ached to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she might need, to listen as only a grandparent can. But as a nun, the expectation was clear: I must join my sisters in the chapel, to pray and uphold the sacred rhythm of our communal life. The clock ticked louder in my mind, each second pressing me to choose. Emma looked up at me, searching my face for reassurance, while the distant sound of footsteps in the corridor reminded me of my duty. My heart pulled in two directions, torn between the love of family and the vows I had made to God."}
