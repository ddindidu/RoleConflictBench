He was struggling with a problem at school, something about a friend betraying his trust. He wanted my advice, my comfort\u2014the kind only a grandparent can give. I reached for his hand, feeling the weight of his need for reassurance and guidance.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, another worry gnawed at me. Daniel\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew words of his Torah portion. As his Jewish grandmother, I felt responsible for passing on our traditions, for making sure he understood the importance of this milestone. I wanted to encourage him, to push him to practice, to remind him of the pride and history behind every syllable.\n\nYet, as he looked at me, vulnerable and seeking help, I felt torn. Should I focus on his immediate pain, offering the comfort he craved, or should I remind him of his responsibilities, urging him to prepare for his bar mitzvah? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I sat there, heart aching, unsure which part of myself to give him first."}
