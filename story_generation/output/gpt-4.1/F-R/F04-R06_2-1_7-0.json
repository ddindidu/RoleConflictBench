He\u2019d asked me to cover for him\u2014lie to our parents about where he was going tonight. As his brother, I wanted to support him, to show patience and understanding for his choices, even if I didn\u2019t agree. We\u2019d always promised to respect each other, no matter what. But as a Christian, I was taught to be honest, to live by the values I claimed to believe in. Lying, even for family, felt like betraying something deeper inside me. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my brother\u2019s trust and our bond, or my commitment to truth and faith. I could hear his voice in my head, pleading for my help, and at the same time, I remembered the words from Sunday\u2019s sermon about integrity. The pressure built inside me, twisting my stomach into knots. I stared at the phone, torn between loyalty and conviction, not knowing which path I would choose."}
