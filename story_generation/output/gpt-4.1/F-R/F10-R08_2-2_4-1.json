My family gathered around, discussing plans for the upcoming family gathering. My mother\u2019s voice was gentle but firm as she reminded me how important it was to help prepare and participate, especially this year, when our relatives would be visiting after so long. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectations\u2014upholding our family\u2019s traditions, being present, and honoring our customs.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. I was already behind on my Quran reading for Ramadan, and tonight was the midpoint. I had promised myself to catch up, to reflect deeply as my faith asks of me. Yet, every moment spent in the kitchen or with relatives meant less time for my spiritual commitment. The voices around me grew louder, laughter and stories echoing, while inside, I wrestled with guilt and anxiety. I wanted to be the daughter my family needed, but I also longed to fulfill my role as a devoted Muslim. The two expectations pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to choose."}
