Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sister Amina, a member of our congregation. She wrote, \u201cIf you have a moment today, I\u2019d love to talk. I\u2019m struggling and could use your advice.\u201d I glanced at my son, who was now poking at his cereal, and felt the familiar tug inside me. As a mother, I knew these moments at home were precious, the foundation of his values and discipline. But as an imam, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever my community needed me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each equally important. My heart ached as I sat between the needs of my child and the call of my community, unsure which path to take in that moment."}
