My phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner at 7! Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of our bond. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to toast her success and remind her how proud I was. \n\nBut just as I was about to leave, a parishioner knocked on my door, eyes red and voice trembling. She needed guidance\u2014her marriage was crumbling, and she was desperate for counsel. As her pastor, I knew my words could shape her next steps, perhaps even her future. She looked at me, searching for hope, for answers only I could give.\n\nMy heart twisted. My sister expected her brother to show up, to celebrate her joy. My congregation needed their pastor, steady and present in crisis. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
