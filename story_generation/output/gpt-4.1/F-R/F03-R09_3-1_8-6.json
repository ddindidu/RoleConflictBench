My mother\u2019s eyes were red, searching my face for reassurance. I knew they needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be the steady presence they\u2019d always tried to be for me. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was Shabbat service at the synagogue. I\u2019d promised myself to attend regularly, to honor my faith and be part of the community. The service wasn\u2019t critical\u2014one more or less wouldn\u2019t matter\u2014but I felt the weight of my commitment, the quiet expectation that I\u2019d show up, that I\u2019d be counted. My parents\u2019 voices grew softer, more vulnerable, and I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. I wanted to be the son they needed, but I also wanted to be true to my Jewish identity. The clock ticked, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
