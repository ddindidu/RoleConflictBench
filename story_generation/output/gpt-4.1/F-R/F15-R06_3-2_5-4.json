The manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and my heart pounded with shame and worry. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable and that actions have consequences. I wanted to handle this moment with patience and firmness, to guide him toward honesty and responsibility.\n\nBut as I glanced at my watch, I realized church service was about to begin. As a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to worship and community, the expectation that I would be present, setting an example for my family and honoring my faith. I could hear the church bells in my mind, calling me to gather with others, to pray and sing and serve.\n\nTorn between staying to address my son\u2019s mistake and rushing to church, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t give myself completely to either. I stood there, wrestling with what to do next, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
