My heart pounded as I gripped his small hand, my mind racing with how to teach him right from wrong. As a mother, I knew I had to address his behavior immediately, to show him that stealing was unacceptable and to guide him toward honesty and discipline. But as we hurried toward the mosque for Friday prayers, I realized I had forgotten my scarf in the rush. The entrance to the main prayer hall loomed ahead, and I could already see the other women, all properly covered, glancing in my direction. I felt the weight of my faith pressing on me, the expectation to dress modestly and set an example for my children and my community. My son tugged at my sleeve, his eyes wide with worry, and I felt torn\u2014should I turn back to retrieve my scarf and risk missing the prayer, or should I stay and address my son\u2019s mistake right now, in front of everyone? The conflicting demands of being a good mother and a faithful Muslim swirled inside me, leaving me frozen at the threshold, unsure which role to answer first."}
