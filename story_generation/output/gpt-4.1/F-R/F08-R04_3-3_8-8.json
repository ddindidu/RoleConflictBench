As a grandmother, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectation to be present, to call, to comfort, to listen. I wanted nothing more than to wrap her in my arms and assure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. Just as I was about to dial her number, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the mosque. A young man had arrived, desperate for guidance after losing his father. As the imam, I was expected to be there, to offer words of solace, to help him find meaning in his pain. My heart pulled in two directions: my family needed me, but so did my community. I stared at the phone, torn between the voice of a grandmother and the call of an imam, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
