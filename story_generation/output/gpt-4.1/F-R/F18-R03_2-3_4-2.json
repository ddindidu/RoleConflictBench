Tonight was our family dinner, a rare moment when everyone could gather, share stories, and feel whole. My mother\u2019s eyes sparkled with anticipation\u2014she\u2019d been planning this for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to her. Just as I placed the last fork, my phone buzzed. It was the mayor, his voice urgent: the hurricane had left hundreds homeless, and he needed me to help organize the relief effort. As a nun, I was expected to serve the community, to be present for those in desperate need. My heart pounded. My family needed me here, but so did the frightened, hungry families at the shelter. I could hear my siblings calling me to join them, but the mayor\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of my family and the call to serve, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
