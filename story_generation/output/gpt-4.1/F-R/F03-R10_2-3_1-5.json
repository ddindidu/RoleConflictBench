It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle questions, my father\u2019s quiet pride. They expect honesty, warmth, and reassurance that I\u2019m doing well. Tonight, though, my mind is tangled. Earlier this week, I witnessed my manager taking bribes at work, a clear act of corruption. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and courage, even when it\u2019s difficult. My conscience screams at me to report what I saw, to stand up for what\u2019s right. But if I do, there\u2019s a real risk I\u2019ll lose my job, and my parents will worry endlessly. They\u2019ll ask questions I can\u2019t answer, sense the stress in my voice, and feel helpless from afar. I want to protect them from anxiety, to keep our calls light and loving. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore the wrong I\u2019ve witnessed. As the phone rings, my heart pounds, torn between being the dutiful son they expect and the principled person my faith demands."}
