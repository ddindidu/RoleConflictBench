Tomorrow\u2019s sermon weighed on me\u2014my congregation expected guidance on forgiveness, a topic I knew too well but still struggled to embody. My phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this week. Hope you\u2019re okay.\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I knew she wanted more than a quick text, but I\u2019d been so absorbed in church duties that I\u2019d barely managed a \u201cbusy, but fine\u201d reply last weekend. \n\nAs a pastor, I was supposed to teach compassion and connection, yet as a step-child, I barely managed the minimum. The congregation needed my wisdom, but my family needed my presence. I stared at the blinking cursor on my sermon, torn between crafting words about love and actually showing it to the woman who raised me. My heart ached with the contradiction\u2014how could I preach what I struggled to practice? The phone sat heavy in my hand, the silence between us growing with every passing minute."}
