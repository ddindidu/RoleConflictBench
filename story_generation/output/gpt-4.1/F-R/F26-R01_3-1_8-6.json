She told me that my grandson was struggling, caught in a storm of emotions after a painful breakup. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to call him immediately, to offer comfort and remind him that he was loved, to be the steady presence he needed. But just as I reached for the phone, I remembered the community gathering scheduled in an hour. As the pastor, I was expected to share a story that would inspire and guide, to teach the principles of faith that our congregation leaned on. I knew the story I planned to tell would touch on forgiveness and hope, but I also knew my family needed me now, not later. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my heart torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of my congregation. I stared at the phone, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the ache of wanting to be present for everyone, yet knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
