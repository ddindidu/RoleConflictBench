He\u2019d just told me about the trouble he was in\u2014something serious, something that could change everything for him. As his sibling, I felt the weight of his pain, the urge to comfort him, to promise I\u2019d do anything to help. That\u2019s what we always did for each other, especially when things got hard.\n\nBut then he asked me for something I wasn\u2019t prepared for. He wanted me to lie for him, to cover up what had happened so he wouldn\u2019t get into more trouble. My heart pounded. As a Christian, I\u2019d always tried to live honestly, to do what was right even when it was hard. Now, those values clashed with my loyalty to my brother. I could hear his desperation, feel his need for me to be on his side. My mind raced, torn between the love I had for him and the conviction that I shouldn\u2019t betray my beliefs. I closed my eyes, caught in the storm of what he needed from me and what I believed was right."}
