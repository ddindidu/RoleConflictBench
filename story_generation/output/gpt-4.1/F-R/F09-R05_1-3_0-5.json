It\u2019s nearly three, and my children will be waiting at the school gate, eyes searching the crowd for me. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, that I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way again. But in the next room, Miriam sits nervously, clutching her notes. Her conversion journey has been long and full of questions, and this final study session before her Beit Din is crucial. She needs my guidance, my reassurance, my presence as her rabbi. I hear my phone buzz\u2014a reminder from the school. I picture my children\u2019s faces, the disappointment if I\u2019m late, the trust I\u2019ve worked so hard to build. But I also see Miriam\u2019s hope, her vulnerability, the weight of her expectations. Both roles pull at me, demanding all of me at the same time. My chest tightens as I stand in the hallway, torn between the two doors, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
