She needed me\u2014her child\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d always been for me. I wanted nothing more than to hold her hand and promise her that everything would be alright. But my phone buzzed insistently. A congregant\u2019s daughter, her voice raw with grief, told me her father had just passed away. The family needed their rabbi\u2014me\u2014to guide them, to lead the funeral, to be the source of comfort and tradition in their darkest hour. My heart twisted as I looked at my mother, her eyes searching mine for solace, while my mind raced with the sacred responsibility waiting for me outside this home. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, my compassion, my strength."}
