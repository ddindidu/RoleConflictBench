Our teacher had asked me personally, trusting I\u2019d bring clarity to the group. I felt honored, but also the weight of responsibility\u2014these teachings weren\u2019t just words, but a path to understanding and peace. I wanted to do it right.\n\nBut the message was from my sister. She was struggling, her words shaky and raw. She needed me, not just as a sibling, but as someone who\u2019d always listened, always been there. We\u2019d promised to support each other, no matter what. I could hear her voice in my head, the way she\u2019d always turned to me in moments like this.\n\nI stared at my notes, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both sides. The temple expected my focus and preparation; my sister needed my presence and care. My heart ached, torn between the quiet call of spiritual duty and the urgent plea of family. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
