My spouse has already done the dishes and walked the dog, so it\u2019s my turn to pitch in. But as I reach for the detergent, I catch sight of the stack of books on the kitchen table\u2014our weekly study slot with the kids is about to start. We\u2019ve been reading stories from the Torah, talking about what it means to be Jewish, and I promised myself I\u2019d make this a priority, to pass on our traditions and values. I know the lesson could be shifted to another night, but I also know how easily that can become a habit, and how much I want our children to feel the rhythm of Jewish learning in their lives. My spouse expects partnership, reliability. My faith and my children\u2019s heritage expect devotion, consistency. I stand in the hallway, laundry in one hand, books in the other, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
