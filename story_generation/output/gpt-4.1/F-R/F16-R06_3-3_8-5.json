My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about our finances. We\u2019d agreed to be honest, to share everything, especially now that medical bills were piling up. I knew I needed to be fully present, to talk openly, to listen and be listened to. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder about the church service tonight, and the group meeting afterward. I was expected there, not just to worship, but to help organize the event, to show my commitment to the community. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the partner I promised to be, but if I left, I\u2019d be letting down my church family and, in a way, my faith. My heart pounded as I looked at my spouse, then at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, caught between two promises I didn\u2019t know how to keep."}
