It\u2019s Sunday evening, the time I always call my parents. They wait for my updates, my voice, the comfort of knowing I\u2019m thinking of them. I know how much it means, especially since I moved away. But tonight, my mind is split. In half an hour, I\u2019m supposed to meet with Miriam, the conversion candidate. This is her last study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019s anxious, desperate for reassurance and guidance. As her rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be present, focused, and supportive, to help her feel ready for this life-changing moment. My parents expect their child to call, to listen, to care. My community expects their rabbi to teach, to guide, to be there. I feel the weight of both, the pull of love and duty, and I can\u2019t see how to be both at once. My heart aches as I sit in the quiet, torn between the two worlds that need me."}
