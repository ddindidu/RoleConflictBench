I knew how much it meant to her, especially after all the changes in our family. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I really need some guidance,\u201d she wrote. I remembered how withdrawn she\u2019d seemed at Sunday service, and I knew she rarely reached out unless it was serious. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my stepdaughter\u2019s expectant face, Mrs. Carter\u2019s quiet plea. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My hands trembled as I stared at the clock, the minutes slipping away, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both of them."}
