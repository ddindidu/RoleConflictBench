My mind races with numbers\u2014how much we owe on the home loan, how little time remains before the next payment is due. My spouse has been anxious, and I feel the weight of their worry, the expectation that I will keep our family secure, that I will not let us falter. Yet, as I glance at my notes for the Shabbat sermon, I remember the congregation\u2019s trust in me. They look to me for guidance, for words that will uplift and inspire them each week. The service is only days away, and I have barely begun to shape my message. I know they expect my full presence, my thoughtful preparation. But every time I try to focus on the sermon, my thoughts drift back to the looming payment, the fear of letting my family down. I feel torn, pulled in two directions by love and duty, unable to give either role the attention it deserves. My heart aches as I wonder which responsibility I must set aside, even for a moment."}
