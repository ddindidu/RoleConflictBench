The Nintendo, remember?\u201d His birthday was tomorrow, and I\u2019d told him weeks ago that I\u2019d buy it\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from Miriam flashed on the screen: \u201cRabbi, are we still on for tonight? I\u2019m so nervous for the Beit Din.\u201d Tonight was her last study session before her conversion, the culmination of months of learning and soul-searching. She needed me to guide her, to answer her final questions, to reassure her.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s trust, his joy, and the promise I\u2019d made as a father. The community\u2019s trust, Miriam\u2019s journey, and my responsibility as a rabbi. The Nintendo wasn\u2019t cheap, and money was tight this month. If I bought it, I\u2019d have to skip the study session to work an extra shift. If I kept my commitment to Miriam, I\u2019d have to break my promise to my son. My heart ached as I sat there, torn between two sacred roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both tonight."}
