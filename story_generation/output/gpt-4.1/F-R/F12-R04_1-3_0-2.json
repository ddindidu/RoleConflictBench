He rarely spoke of work, so I knew this was his way of reaching out, seeking comfort. I wanted to hold his hand, to listen, to be the gentle presence he needed. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The special remembrance gathering had drawn a crowd, and I was the only authorized imam present. The prayers could not begin without me. My husband looked at me, waiting for a response, his eyes searching for reassurance. At the same time, I imagined the congregation waiting, their expectations heavy with tradition and faith. My heart pulled in two directions: the quiet intimacy of our living room, and the solemn responsibility awaiting me at the mosque. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving it.
