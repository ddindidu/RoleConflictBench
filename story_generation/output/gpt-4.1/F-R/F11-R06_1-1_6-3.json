She rarely asks me to come along, and I know she\u2019s been hoping we could spend more time together, especially since she started college. I want to show her that I care and that I value our relationship, so I promised I\u2019d try to make it. But as I looked at my calendar, I realized the brunch overlaps with the church service I usually attend. My church community expects me to be present, not just for worship but also for the fellowship afterward. I feel a deep sense of belonging there, and I know my absence would be noticed. I want to be a good sister, to build that mutual respect and closeness, but I also feel a responsibility to my faith and my church family. The thought of disappointing either side makes my stomach twist. I sit on my bed, phone in hand, torn between texting my sister back with a yes and setting my alarm for church as usual."}
