My spouse\u2019s text from work is gentle but clear: \u201cCan you please get the laundry done today? The kids need clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s field trip.\u201d I nod to myself, feeling the weight of the expectation. But as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder from Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her final study session before the Beit Din is tonight, and she\u2019s anxious, needing reassurance and guidance. As her rabbi, I know how much this moment means, how much she\u2019s counting on me to help her feel ready, to answer her last questions about Jewish law and tradition. I stand in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the sacred responsibility waiting at the synagogue. My heart aches with the knowledge that I can\u2019t be fully present for both at once. The demands of home and the call of my community pull at me, and I feel the tension rising, unsure which need should come first."}
