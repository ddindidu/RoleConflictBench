I knew how much these calls meant to her and Dad, especially since I moved away. They always asked about my week, and I\u2019d listen to their stories, feeling the warmth of home through the phone. But as I started to dial, another call came in\u2014this time from the church secretary. A family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me to organize emergency support and offer comfort, right now. My heart twisted. As a pastor, I was expected to be present in moments of crisis, to lead and care for my flock. But as a daughter, I was expected to be present for my parents, to show them they still mattered in my busy life. I stared at my phone, torn between the two calls, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
