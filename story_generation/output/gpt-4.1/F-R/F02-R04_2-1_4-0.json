My son darted between the supermarket aisles, laughter echoing as he weaved past startled shoppers. As a father, I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and teach him about respect and discipline, just as I always preached at home. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the afternoon prayer was about to begin. As the imam, the community expected me to lead, to be present, even though today the congregation would be small and another brother was ready to step in. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to guide my child in this moment, and the responsibility to my congregation, who looked to me for spiritual leadership. I could feel my frustration rising, torn between the stern voice my son needed and the calm, guiding presence my community expected. I stood frozen, the sounds of the supermarket fading as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
