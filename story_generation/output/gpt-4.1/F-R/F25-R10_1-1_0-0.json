I know she wants to feel included, to bridge the gap that still lingers between us. At the same time, my father expects me to honor my Hindu roots, to perform the daily puja with incense, flowers, and prayers. But lately, I\u2019ve only managed to whisper a mantra under my breath between classes or while waiting for the bus. I feel guilty, as if I\u2019m letting down both sides\u2014my stepmother, who wants connection, and my father, who wants tradition. The weight of their expectations presses on me, and I wonder if I can ever be enough for either of them. My phone buzzes with a new message from my stepmother just as I catch myself skipping the evening aarti again. I stare at the screen, torn, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
