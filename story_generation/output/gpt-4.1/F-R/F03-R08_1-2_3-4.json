It\u2019s a family tradition to dress up for Eid, remember?\u201d The shirt was bright, short-sleeved, and paired with fitted trousers\u2014exactly the kind of outfit my family expected me to wear for special occasions. They loved seeing me blend in, looking sharp and modern, just like my cousins. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of another expectation: to dress modestly, especially in mixed company. The office function this afternoon would be full of colleagues, men and women, and I knew the Islamic guidelines\u2014loose clothing, sleeves to the wrist, nothing flashy. My mother peeked in, her eyes hopeful, and I felt the pressure mounting. I wanted to make her proud, to honor our family\u2019s way, but I also wanted to stay true to my faith. My hands trembled as I held the shirt, torn between two worlds, each demanding a different version of me."}
