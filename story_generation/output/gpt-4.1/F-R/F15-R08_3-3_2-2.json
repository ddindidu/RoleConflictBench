He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me this evening. As a parent, I knew I had to be there for him, to understand what happened and help him make things right. But tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I\u2019d promised myself I would attend regularly, especially since we were discussing verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. My friends expected me there, and I felt a deep responsibility to keep growing in my faith. The thought of missing the study circle filled me with guilt, as if I was letting down not just my community, but my own spiritual journey. Yet, the idea of not being present for my son in this difficult moment made my chest tighten with anxiety. I sat at the kitchen table, torn between the demands of my faith and my child, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
