My grandson, eyes wide with worry, sat beside me. \u201cDadaji, I need your advice,\u201d he said, voice trembling. He told me about a friend at school, someone being bullied and treated unfairly. He wanted to help but didn\u2019t know how, and he looked to me for guidance, expecting the wisdom I was supposed to offer as his grandfather.\n\nBut inside, I felt torn. As a Hindu, I am taught to stand up for dharma, to act with courage and righteousness, to never ignore injustice. My heart burned with the urge to intervene directly, to confront those responsible and defend the boy myself. Yet, as a grandfather, I knew my role was to guide, not to act for him\u2014to let my grandson find his own strength, to offer advice rather than take over.\n\nHe waited, searching my face for answers. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My mind raced, caught between the urge to act and the duty to guide, unsure which path to choose."}
