Other shoppers glance over, some with smiles, others with frowns. As his father, I know I should step in, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that public spaces require calm behavior. But my mind is already elsewhere\u2014tonight, the temple holds a memorial service, and as a practicing Buddhist, I am expected to attend, to show respect for the departed and support my community. The ceremony is important, a time for reflection and compassion, and my absence would be noticed. Yet here I am, torn between guiding my child in this moment and fulfilling my spiritual obligations. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, the pressure to be a good father and a devoted Buddhist pulling me in opposite directions. I take a deep breath, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I must choose which expectation to meet, and which to let go\u2014at least for now."}
