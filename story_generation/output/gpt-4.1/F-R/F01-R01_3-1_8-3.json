My heart ached, knowing how much my family needed me right now, expecting me to be present, to offer comfort and guidance. I promised her I\u2019d call back soon, but as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d made it a point to check in with her, to offer the support my role as pastor demanded. She was reaching out, needing a listening ear, perhaps even a visit. I stared at the two names on my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me, but so did my flock. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
