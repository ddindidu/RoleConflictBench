My heart ached for her, and I knew she needed me\u2014my comfort, my advice, my presence. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always believed in being there for my family, keeping our bonds strong through regular calls and visits. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered that in just an hour, my grandson would arrive for our weekly study session. Every week, I teach him about our Jewish traditions, sharing stories and values passed down through generations. It\u2019s a commitment I cherish, a way to keep our heritage alive. I knew I could reschedule the lesson, but I worried about breaking the rhythm, about missing a chance to nurture his connection to our faith. My daughter\u2019s pain pulled me in one direction, my promise to my grandson in another. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
