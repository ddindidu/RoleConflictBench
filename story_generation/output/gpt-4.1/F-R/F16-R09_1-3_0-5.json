She leaned in, her voice low, telling me about her day\u2014her boss\u2019s sharp words, the project that went sideways. I could see the tension in her shoulders, the way she twisted her napkin. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to share a meal and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But as the servers placed steaming plates in front of us, my heart sank. The food looked delicious, but there was no kosher certification, and I couldn\u2019t be sure how it was prepared. My partner glanced at me, expecting me to join her, to eat and talk and be present. I felt the weight of my tradition pressing against the need to comfort her, the rules I\u2019d grown up with clashing with the love I felt for her. My hands trembled slightly as I stared at the plate, torn between honoring my faith and being the support she needed right now."}
