He grinned at me, eager to show off the new trick he\u2019d been practicing in secret. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the synagogue group: \u201cWe need one more for the minyan. Can you come now? It\u2019s urgent, for a funeral prayer.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important it was to make a minyan, especially for a funeral. It was a mitzvah, a sacred obligation, and I\u2019d been raised to never turn away from such a call. But Eli was counting on me to spot him, to be there in case he fell. I could see the nervous excitement in his eyes, and I remembered my promise to Mom to always look out for him. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of my faith and my family, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which way to turn."}
