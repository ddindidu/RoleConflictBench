My sister\u2019s message glowed on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re all meeting at Mom\u2019s for the holiday lunch. It means a lot to her.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how rarely we\u2019re all together. My heart ached with longing for the laughter and comfort of my family, the familiar rituals that made me feel like I belonged.\n\nBut as I slipped into my habit, the bell in the hallway chimed, signaling the start of our monthly food drive. The sisters were already gathering, arms full of boxes and bags, ready to serve the homeless at the shelter. Mother Superior caught my eye and smiled, her silent encouragement a reminder of my commitment to this life of service. The expectation was clear: today, my hands and heart were needed here.\n\nI stood in my small room, torn between the pull of my family and the call of my vocation. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
