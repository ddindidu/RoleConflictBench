Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s younger and still learning the neighborhood. I keep an eye on the cars, the cracks in the sidewalk, the way Eli sometimes drifts too close to the curb. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder about the adult education class at the synagogue tonight. I\u2019m supposed to lead a discussion on the weekly Torah portion, and a few regulars have already messaged to say they\u2019re looking forward to it. \n\nBut Eli\u2019s been quiet today, and I can tell something\u2019s off. He keeps glancing at his shoes, and when I ask, he shrugs, \u201cJust tired.\u201d I know he\u2019s not telling me everything. I want to press, to make sure he\u2019s okay, but the clock is ticking. If I walk him home and stay until Mom gets back, I\u2019ll be late for the class. If I leave him alone, I\u2019ll worry all evening. My mind spins between my responsibility as his sibling and my duty as a rabbi. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t see a way to fulfill them both."}
