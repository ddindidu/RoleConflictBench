My partner greeted me with a tired smile, mentioning offhandedly that work had been a bit rough. I could see the subtle slump in their shoulders, the way their eyes lingered on me, hoping for comfort. I wanted to sit beside them, listen, and offer the warmth they needed. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014a message from a church member, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. They needed me to call, to be present, to offer wisdom and prayer. I stood in the hallway, heart tugged in two directions. My partner\u2019s quiet need for support pressed against the urgent spiritual responsibility waiting on the other end of the line. Both expected my full attention, my care, my presence. I felt the weight of their hopes, the impossibility of being wholly there for both at once, and I hesitated, torn between love and duty."}
