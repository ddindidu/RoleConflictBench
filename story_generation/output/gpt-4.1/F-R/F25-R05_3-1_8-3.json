He looked at me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of comfort I\u2019d learned to offer since my mother remarried. I wanted to be present, to listen, to hold space for his vulnerability. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue was starting in twenty minutes. I was the rabbi, and even though the class was optional, I knew some congregants counted on me to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion, to answer their questions about Jewish law. My stepfather\u2019s eyes glistened with hope, and I felt the weight of his need. At the same time, I imagined the expectant faces at the synagogue, waiting for me to teach. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was most needed, torn between the family I was still learning to belong to and the community that looked to me for wisdom."}
