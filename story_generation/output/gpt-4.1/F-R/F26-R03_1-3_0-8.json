Her voice trembled as she spoke about starting college, about feeling lost and uncertain. She wanted my advice, the kind only a grandparent could give\u2014stories from my own youth, gentle encouragement, the wisdom of years. I longed to wrap her in comfort, to spend the afternoon talking her through her fears. But as she spoke, I glanced at the letter from Mother Superior on the table. She had entrusted me with leading the community\u2019s daily reflections during the retreat, a responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual preparation. The sisters were counting on me to guide them, to be present and focused. My heart pulled in two directions: toward my granddaughter\u2019s need for worldly guidance, and toward my sacred duty to the community. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure how to honor one without failing the other."}
