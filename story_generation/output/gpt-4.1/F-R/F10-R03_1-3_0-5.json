I know it\u2019s my mother\u2014her weekend text, a simple \u201cHow are you, dear?\u201d She worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly, and I can almost hear her voice, gentle but anxious, wanting to know I\u2019m safe and well. But today, I\u2019ve been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral, a rare honor for someone so new to the convent. The sisters expect me to be fully present, to guide them in devotion, to set aside all distractions. My heart aches as I glance at my phone, torn between the duty to my family and the sacred responsibility before me. I want to reassure my mother, to be the attentive daughter she raised, but the weight of my vows presses on me. The organ begins to play, signaling it\u2019s time to take my place. My hands tremble as I tuck my phone away, caught between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I cannot give fully to both."}
