We had promised each other to share the chores, and I could hear the kids upstairs, already asking about their favorite shirts for tomorrow\u2019s outing. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a message from a friend in crisis\u2014someone who desperately needed help, someone whose situation would require me to stand up for what I believe is right, even if it meant risking my own comfort. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to respond, to be present, to live out the values I profess: compassion, honesty, sacrifice. Yet, the weight of my promise to my spouse pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my family down, breaking the trust we\u2019d worked so hard to build. My heart pounded as I stood between the laundry room and the front door, torn by the demands of love and faith, unsure which call to answer first."}
