Hope you can make it this time.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the familiar tug in my chest. As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I join these family outings. She\u2019d told me before how left out she felt when I missed them, and I promised I\u2019d try harder to be present, to build that mutual respect and closeness we both wanted.\n\nBut tomorrow was Friday, and as the rabbi, I was expected to prepare my sermon for Shabbat. The congregation relied on me to deliver a thoughtful, meaningful message each week. I could already picture the expectant faces, the quiet hush as I stepped up to the bimah. There was no shortcut to inspiration; it took hours of study and reflection.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the warmth of my family and the weight of my calling. My sister\u2019s message blinked on my phone, while my open Torah and scattered notes waited for me to return. The two worlds pressed in, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
