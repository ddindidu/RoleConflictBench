The calendar on the wall stared back at me, two dates circled in red. Tomorrow was Anna\u2019s open class at school\u2014she\u2019d been practicing her lines for weeks, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mama?\u201d I could almost hear her voice, see her searching the crowd for my face. But tomorrow was also the day I\u2019d been chosen to lead the prayer vigil downtown, representing our convent. It was an honor, a responsibility I\u2019d been entrusted with by my sisters and by God. The Mother Superior\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYour presence will inspire many.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the silent pull of my daughter\u2019s need and the sacred call of my vocation. My heart ached with the knowledge that I could not be in two places at once. I closed my eyes, torn between the love of my child and the vows I had made, the expectations of motherhood and the demands of my faith."}
