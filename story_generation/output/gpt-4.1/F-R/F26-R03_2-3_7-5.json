Mother Superior had asked me to lead tonight, a great honor and responsibility. My heart should have been calm, focused on the sacred words I would soon recite. But my phone, tucked away in my drawer, buzzed with a message from my granddaughter. She had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement. I knew they expected me to join in, to share in her joy, to offer encouragement and wisdom as her grandmother. Yet, the convent expected my full presence, my spirit devoted to prayer and the community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my sisters\u2019 trust in my spiritual leadership. My hands trembled as I reached for my habit, torn between the warmth of family and the solemnity of my calling, unsure which path to follow in this moment."}
