Mom had planned a big family trip for the weekend, something we hadn\u2019t done in years. Everyone was expected to be there, and I knew how much it meant to my parents and my brothers. As a sister, I wanted to be present, to laugh and make memories with them, especially since we rarely all get together anymore.\n\nBut Sunday morning was also the only time I could join the church service, something I\u2019d been missing lately. My faith is important to me, and I felt a growing emptiness from skipping worship and not seeing my church friends. I could almost hear the pastor\u2019s voice, reminding us of the importance of gathering together, of keeping our faith at the center.\n\nThe two expectations pulled at me\u2014my family\u2019s joy and togetherness, and my own need for spiritual connection. I felt torn, guilty at the thought of disappointing either side. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both a good sister and a faithful Christian, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at the same time."}
