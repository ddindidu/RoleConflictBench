She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her excitement with me and the rest of the family. My daughter called too, asking if I could join a family video call that evening to celebrate Sarah\u2019s first week. I felt a warm tug in my chest\u2014these moments are precious, and I know how much it means to Sarah to have her family\u2019s support. \n\nBut as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. Tonight is also the weekly religious education class at the parish, and I\u2019m the one who organizes and leads it. The children and their parents count on me to be there, to guide them, to answer their questions. The parish expects consistency and dedication, especially from their priest. \n\nI sat at my desk, torn. My family needs me, and so does my parish. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself wrestling with the impossible choice between being present for my granddaughter\u2019s milestone and fulfilling my commitment to my parish community."}
