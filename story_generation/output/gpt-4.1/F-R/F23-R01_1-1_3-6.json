He\u2019d forgotten to say \u201cplease\u201d again, and I felt the familiar urge to gently remind him about manners\u2014something I promised myself I\u2019d help him with as his step-parent. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a church member, asking if I could share a story at tonight\u2019s community gathering. As a pastor, I was expected to teach religious principles, to inspire and guide with stories of faith. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need to guide my stepson and the responsibility to prepare a meaningful message for my congregation. Both roles demanded my full attention, both expected me to teach and nurture, but in such different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
