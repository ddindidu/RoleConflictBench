Every day, I was expected to update them\u2014what I ate, how I felt, every little detail. It was our routine, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially now that my health was uncertain. But here, during Hajj, I was constantly moving, surrounded by crowds, and my phone barely had a signal. The rituals demanded my full attention, and I wanted to be present, to pray and reflect, knowing this might be my only chance. Yet, every time I felt my phone vibrate, guilt twisted in my stomach. I imagined my parents waiting anxiously, wondering if I was safe, if I was thinking of them. I wanted to honor them, to reassure them, but I also wanted to honor my faith and the sacredness of this journey. The pressure pulled me in two directions, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart heavy, unsure which role to answer first."}
