The air was thick with the scent of marigolds and incense, and I felt the familiar pull to join the prayers and rituals, as I had done every year since I was a boy. Just then, my granddaughter sat beside me, her eyes searching. She asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do I know what path to take now that I\u2019m finishing school?\u201d Her voice was soft, uncertain, and I could sense she needed my full attention, my stories, my guidance.\n\nBut the temple bells rang louder, and I saw neighbors gathering, calling out for me to join the aarti. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my duty as a Hindu, to honor the festival and traditions, and toward my role as a grandfather, to be present and wise for my granddaughter in her moment of need. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, the urge to pass on faith and culture, and the need to offer comfort and advice. I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
