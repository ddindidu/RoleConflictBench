As the youngest, I\u2019m expected to be there, to help set the table, to listen to my elders, and to honor the traditions that have shaped us for generations. My parents remind me how important it is to keep our family close, especially now that everyone is growing older and busier.\n\nBut this year, something tugs at me from another part of my heart. My friends are preparing for Hajj, and I have enough savings to join them. As a Muslim, I know how significant this pilgrimage is\u2014an obligation, a spiritual journey I\u2019ve dreamed of for years. My friends are excited, already making plans, and I feel the pull to go with them, to fulfill this pillar of my faith.\n\nYet, the thought of missing the family gathering, of not being there when everyone expects me, fills me with guilt. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s disappointment, see my father\u2019s quiet sadness. I sit in my room, torn between the call of my faith and the love of my family, unsure which path to follow."}
