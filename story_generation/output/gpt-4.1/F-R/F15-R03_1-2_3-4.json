She had just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew this was a moment to teach her about patience and kindness\u2014values I hold dear as both a parent and a nun. My heart ached to guide her, to sit beside her and gently help her understand the importance of compassion, especially within our family. But as I reached for her hand, the church bell rang, signaling the start of a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community in their time of need. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my daughter\u2019s need for guidance at home, and my spiritual duty to my sisters. I felt torn, my mind racing with the expectations placed upon me, unsure which path to follow as both seemed equally urgent and important."}
