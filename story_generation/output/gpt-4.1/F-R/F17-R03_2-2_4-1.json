As a child, I knew how much these customs meant to my parents, especially after their recent reminders about honoring our ancestors and keeping our heritage alive.\n\nBut as a nun, my heart ached for the family down the street whose home had burned just last night. The convent was organizing a relief effort, and I was expected to help gather food and clothing, to be present for those in need. The sisters looked to me, trusting I would join them in this urgent act of charity.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the call to serve as a nun. If I left to help, I would miss the family ritual tonight\u2014something my parents would see as a deep disappointment. But if I stayed, I would be turning my back on the suffering neighbors who needed us now more than ever. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I truly belonged."}
