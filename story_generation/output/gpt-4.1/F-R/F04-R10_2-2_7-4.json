She was upset, her words tumbling out in angry bursts about our mutual friend, Rohan, who she felt had crossed a line. She wanted me to take her side, to support her unconditionally as her brother. I knew she expected me to listen, to be patient, and to respect her feelings, even if I didn\u2019t fully agree. But as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to follow dharma and speak out against injustice. Rohan was being treated unfairly by our group, and I felt a deep responsibility to intervene, to defend him even if it meant going against my sister. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my sister\u2019s need for loyalty and understanding, and my own moral compass urging me to act. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the brother she needed and the person my faith demanded I be."}
