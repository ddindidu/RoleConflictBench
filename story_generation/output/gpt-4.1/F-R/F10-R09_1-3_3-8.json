She called me to help set the table, reminding me how important it was to keep our family traditions alive, especially now that my grandmother was gone. I knew how much these gatherings meant to her, how she saw them as the glue holding us together. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for someone\u2019s father. I knew how vital it was in our community to help others fulfill this mitzvah, especially for a funeral prayer. My heart twisted\u2014if I left, I\u2019d disappoint my mother and break the flow of our family tradition. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community and someone in mourning. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible Jew, unsure which call to answer."}
