My wife glances at me, worry etched on her face, and I know she\u2019s thinking about the groceries we need, the rent due next week, the shoes our youngest has outgrown. As a father, I feel the weight of providing, of making sure my family never goes without. But as I look at the calendar, I see the holiday approaching\u2014one of the most important in our tradition. My children\u2019s voices echo from the next room, laughter mixing with the hum of the television. They still haven\u2019t learned the blessings for the holiday, and I promised myself I\u2019d teach them, pass on the words my own father taught me. But overtime at work is available, and the extra money would help us breathe a little easier. My heart aches with the pull in both directions\u2014between the urgent need to provide and the deep responsibility to nurture their Jewish identity. I close my eyes, feeling the pressure build, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
