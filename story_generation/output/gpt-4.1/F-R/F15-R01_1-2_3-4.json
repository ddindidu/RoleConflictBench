He\u2019d just interrupted me for the third time, ignoring my gentle reminders about table manners. I took a deep breath, ready to guide him again, to teach him patience and respect\u2014values I wanted to root deep in his heart. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in tears, her family falling apart, and she needed to talk right away. I could feel the weight of her words, the expectation that I would be there for her, offering comfort and wisdom as her pastor. But my son\u2019s wide eyes were on me, waiting for my attention, needing my guidance in this small but important moment. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my child, who needed a parent, and toward my parishioner, who needed a pastor. I sat there, torn, the demands of both roles pressing in, unsure which need should come first."}
