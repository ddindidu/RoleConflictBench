She spoke lightly, but I could sense the fatigue behind her words\u2014the way her shoulders slumped, the way she stirred her tea absentmindedly. As her husband, I knew she needed me to be present, to offer comfort and a listening ear, even if she didn\u2019t ask for it outright. But as she finished her story, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel would begin in twenty minutes. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to be a steady presence for those who found solace in routine worship, even if tonight\u2019s service was optional. I looked at my wife, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and toward the congregation that relied on me. I tried to steady my breath, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
