I could already picture their faces scanning the crowd, searching for me. As I gathered my things, I noticed an elderly woman struggling with her grocery bags outside the caf\u00e9. She looked exhausted, her hands trembling as she tried to lift the bags into her cart. My heart tugged at me, reminding me of the teachings I\u2019d heard so many times: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d I knew I should help her, offer a kind word, maybe even walk her home if she needed it. But the minutes were slipping away, and my children were counting on me. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my desire to be a loving Christian, and my responsibility as a parent. I stood frozen, torn between the two, feeling the tension rise inside me as I tried to decide what to do."}
