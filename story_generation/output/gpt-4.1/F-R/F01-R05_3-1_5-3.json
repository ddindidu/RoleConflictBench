My grandson had gotten into trouble at school, and my family needed me\u2014needed my calm, my wisdom, my presence. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to be there, to listen, to help guide him through this rough patch. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart tightened. In just an hour, I was scheduled to teach the weekly adult education class at the synagogue. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I knew several congregants looked forward to our discussions, and I\u2019d spent days preparing. They expected me to be there, to share Torah, to answer questions, to be their rabbi. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s urgent need for comfort and guidance, and my community\u2019s quiet reliance on my leadership. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the ache of wanting to be in two places at once, knowing I could not."}
