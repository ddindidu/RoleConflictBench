He was supposed to be learning table manners, and I knew I should gently correct him, remind him to sit up straight, to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d As a parent, I wanted to raise him with strong values and discipline, to guide him patiently every day. But my mind kept drifting to the envelope tucked away in my drawer\u2014the savings I\u2019d set aside for Hajj. My friends were going this year, and they kept sending messages, urging me to join them. As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, a dream I\u2019ve held for years. Yet, every time I looked at my son, I wondered if I should use that money for his needs instead\u2014his education, his future. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, unsure which path to take."}
