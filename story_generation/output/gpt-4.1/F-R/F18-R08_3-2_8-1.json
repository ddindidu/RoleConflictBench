The sun was setting, and I felt the weight of the days I\u2019d missed, the guilt of not keeping up with my daily quota pressing on my chest. I wanted to focus, to let the words sink in, to feel the peace I was supposed to find in this holy month. Just as I started a new surah, I heard my little brother\u2019s laughter. I looked up and saw him darting toward the street, not even glancing at the cars speeding by. My heart lurched. I knew I should call out, run after him, make sure he was safe\u2014after all, that\u2019s what a good sibling does. But my mind screamed at me to stay, to finish my reading, to not let another day slip by without fulfilling my religious duty. I gripped the pages tightly, torn between the urge to protect my brother and the need to honor my faith, feeling the two parts of myself pulling in opposite directions."}
