She read the message, and her face crumpled. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she clutched my arm, barely able to speak. I knew, as her sibling, I needed to be there for her, to listen and comfort her through whatever pain she was feeling. But as we turned the corner, the street was alive with the colors and sounds of a Hindu festival. The scent of incense drifted through the air, and neighbors waved, expecting me to join in the prayers and rituals. My heart twisted. I wanted to sit with my sister, to hold her hand and let her cry, but I also felt the pull of my faith and community, the expectation to participate and show respect for the traditions I grew up with. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
