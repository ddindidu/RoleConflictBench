My stepdad had planned it for weeks, hoping to bring us all closer. As a step-sibling, I knew how much it meant to him\u2014and to my mom\u2014that I show up, smile, and make an effort to bond with my stepbrother, even though we barely spoke outside these gatherings. But just as I was about to get ready, my stepbrother texted me privately, asking if I could cover for him. He wanted to sneak out with friends, planning to drink and party, and he needed me to tell the adults he was feeling sick.\n\nMy heart pounded. As a Christian, honesty and integrity are values I try to live by, even when it\u2019s hard. Lying for him felt wrong, but I also knew refusing might make things even more awkward between us, maybe even ruin the fragile peace we\u2019d built. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I felt trapped\u2014torn between being the supportive step-sibling everyone expected and staying true to my faith. I sat on my bed, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
