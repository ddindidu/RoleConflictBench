My heart dropped. As a parent, I knew I had to address this immediately\u2014teach him right from wrong, help him understand the seriousness of stealing, and guide him toward making amends. But as a rabbi, I also felt the weight of my commitment to the community. The adult education class was optional, but people counted on me to be there, to share wisdom and foster discussion. I could already imagine the disappointment if I canceled last minute. My son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes met mine, and I felt the pull in both directions\u2014my duty to him as his parent, and my responsibility to my congregation as their rabbi. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to teach my child a lesson in honesty and the expectation that I would be present for my students, ready to teach Torah."}
