My daughter had been planning it for weeks, and the grandchildren were already buzzing with excitement about baking cookies and playing board games. I could almost hear their laughter echoing through the house. Just as I was about to call my wife to discuss the menu, my phone buzzed. It was a young couple from the congregation, their voices trembling with hope as they asked if I could officiate their wedding\u2014over a year from now, but on the very same weekend as our family gathering.\n\nAs a grandparent, I felt the pull of my family\u2019s expectations, the importance of being present, of making memories. But as a rabbi, I knew how much it meant to this couple to have me guide them through such a sacred moment. My heart twisted with the weight of both roles, each demanding my presence, each equally important. I sat in silence, torn between the joy of family and the sacred duty of my calling, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
