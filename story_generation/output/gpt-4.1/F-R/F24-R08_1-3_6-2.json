Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still new to the neighborhood. He\u2019s quiet, glancing at the cracks in the sidewalk, and I know he\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll stick around until Dad gets home. But tonight, the community study circle meets at the mosque, and I\u2019m supposed to have read and reflected on the next surah. I haven\u2019t even opened my Quran this week. The thought of sitting in the circle, unprepared, makes my stomach twist. I want to be there, to show I\u2019m committed to my faith, but I can\u2019t just leave my stepbrother alone. He trusts me, and I promised Mom I\u2019d make sure he\u2019s safe. The mosque is only a few blocks away, but if I go, he\u2019ll be by himself for hours. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my steps slowing as I try to figure out what I should do."}
