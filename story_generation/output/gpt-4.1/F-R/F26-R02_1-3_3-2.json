Today is the long-awaited family gathering, circled in red on our calendar for months. My heart aches with anticipation\u2014I promised them I\u2019d be present, truly present, not just in body but in spirit. Yet, as I glance at my phone, reminders flash for the evening\u2019s service. It\u2019s the holiest day of our faith, the sanctuary already filling with congregants who look to me for guidance, comfort, and tradition. They expect my presence, my words, my prayers. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth of my family\u2019s embrace, the solemn duty to my community. My chest tightens as I stand in the hallway, torn between the laughter behind one door and the sacred silence behind another. I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decide, a part of me will be left behind."}
