Her eyes, wide with uncertainty, searched mine. \u201cGrandma, how do I know if I\u2019m making the right choices now that I\u2019m starting college?\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling with the weight of new beginnings. My heart swelled with the urge to comfort her, to share the lessons I\u2019d gathered over decades. I wanted to wrap her in my arms, to offer the wisdom she sought, as any grandmother would.\n\nBut the call to prayer echoed through the hall, and I glanced down at my own attire\u2014my scarf slightly askew, my sleeves not quite covering my wrists. I remembered the expectation to enter the prayer hall dressed with utmost modesty, as my faith required. I felt the eyes of other women nearby, their silent reminders of the standards we all upheld. My granddaughter\u2019s question hung between us, urgent and vulnerable, while the pressure to adjust my clothing and join the congregation pressed in from the other side. I stood frozen, torn between the immediate need to guide her and the sacred duty to present myself properly before God."}
