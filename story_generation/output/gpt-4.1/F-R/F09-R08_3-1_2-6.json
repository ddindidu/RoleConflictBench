My heart ached as I read the words: \u201cYour child was involved in bullying another student.\u201d As a mother, I knew I had to be there for him, to attend the meeting the school requested, to show him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake. My son needed me, and the school expected my presence and involvement.\n\nBut as a Muslim, another weight pressed on my chest. My parents called that morning, reminding me of the importance of Hajj, how every able Muslim should strive to perform the pilgrimage. They spoke of saving every spare coin, of making sacrifices, of putting this sacred duty above all else. Yet, my savings were thin, and every unexpected expense\u2014like the counseling the school now suggested\u2014pushed Hajj further away.\n\nI felt torn, the expectations of motherhood and faith pulling me in opposite directions. My son\u2019s needs were immediate and real, but so was the longing in my heart to fulfill my religious duty. I closed my eyes, caught between the demands of my love for my child and my devotion to my faith, unsure which path to take."}
