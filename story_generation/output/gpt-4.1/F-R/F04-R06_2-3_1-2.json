He\u2019d gotten into trouble, something serious, and he needed my help to cover it up. As his brother, I felt the old instinct to protect him, to stand by him no matter what. That\u2019s what we\u2019d always done: support each other, especially when things got tough. But as he explained what happened, my heart pounded. What he\u2019d done went against everything I believed as a Christian\u2014honesty, accountability, doing what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s hard. He begged me, desperate, and I could hear the fear in his voice. I wanted to shield him from the consequences, to be the brother he needed. But the weight of my faith pressed on me, reminding me of the values I\u2019d promised to uphold. I sat there, torn, the phone still warm in my hand, wrestling with the impossible choice between loyalty to my brother and loyalty to my faith."}
