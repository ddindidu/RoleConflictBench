Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call, just like every evening. It was our routine\u2014her way of making sure I felt included, her way of showing care. But tonight, my mind was tangled in the notes for tomorrow\u2019s workshop. As a pastor, I was responsible for guiding our community leaders through a maze of theological ideas, making sure they understood not just the words, but the spirit behind them. The pressure to prepare was immense; everyone expected clarity and inspiration from me. Yet, as I tried to focus, the guilt gnawed at me. If I ignored my stepmother, I\u2019d disappoint her, maybe even make her feel like an outsider again. If I put her first, I\u2019d risk letting down my congregation, who looked to me for wisdom. My phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
