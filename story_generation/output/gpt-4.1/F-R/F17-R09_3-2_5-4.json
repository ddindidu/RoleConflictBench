My parents had asked me to lead the blessing at our family\u2019s Shabbat dinner tonight\u2014a big deal, since it was the first time all the cousins and grandparents would be together in years. I knew how important it was to them, to keep our traditions alive, to show that I was learning and growing into my role in the family. But my stomach rumbled, and I remembered that we hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. My mom pointed out the small vendor by the roadside, the only kosher-certified place for miles. The line was long, and we were already running late. My dad hesitated, glancing at his watch, then at me. If we stopped, we\u2019d risk being late for the ceremony, and I might not have time to prepare. If we didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be hungry and distracted, maybe even too weak to lead the prayers properly. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope that I\u2019d honor our traditions, and my own commitment to keeping kosher, even when it wasn\u2019t easy."}
