She sat beside me, her voice trembling as she asked for advice about a painful friendship that had turned sour. She needed my wisdom, my comfort\u2014the kind only a grandmother can give. I reached for her hand, my heart aching to be fully present for her. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They needed an answer soon, as their families were eager to set the date. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to honor such requests promptly, to be there for my community in their moments of joy. But Miriam\u2019s eyes pleaded for my undivided attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for my love and wisdom, and my congregation\u2019s trust in my leadership. My mind raced, torn between the sacred callings of my heart."}
