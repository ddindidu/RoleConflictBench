My spouse\u2019s voice from earlier still rang in my ears, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for school tomorrow and that the laundry had piled up again. I knew how much it meant to my family that I shared these responsibilities, that I was present and dependable at home. Yet, in my other hand, I clutched the letter from the travel agency\u2014my Hajj visa had finally been approved. The doctor\u2019s words replayed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to go, this year is your best chance. Your health may not allow it later.\u201d The weight of both roles pressed on me. My faith called me to fulfill a lifelong dream, a religious duty, but my family needed me here, now, in the small, everyday ways that mattered so much. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
