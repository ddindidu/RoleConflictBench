My son\u2019s eyes had sparkled for weeks, counting down to the day I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo. He\u2019d saved pictures, talked about games, and I\u2019d assured him I\u2019d make it happen. But the cost gnawed at me\u2014money was tight, and every purchase had to be justified. As a parent, I wanted to keep my promise, to see his joy, to prove I could provide.\n\nBut today was also the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for everyone. The church would be full, people seeking comfort and tradition, and my absence would be noticed, even criticized. My congregation needed me, and I felt the sacred responsibility to serve.\n\nI stood in the kitchen, the Nintendo catalog in one hand, my prayer book in the other, heart pounding. Both roles demanded my presence, my commitment, and I could not see how to honor both. The clock ticked, and I felt the impossible pull, torn between my child\u2019s happiness and my community\u2019s faith."}
