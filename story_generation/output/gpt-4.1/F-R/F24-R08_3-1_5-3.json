My stepmom\u2019s voice echoed from downstairs, reminding me to bring something comfortable for the family beach trip. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be swimming and relaxing together!\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes bright with excitement. As her stepchild, I felt the pressure to join in, to be part of the family, to not seem distant or ungrateful. But as a Muslim, I knew I couldn\u2019t wear the swimsuits or shorts everyone else would be wearing. I always dressed modestly, even at home, and the thought of explaining why I\u2019d be covered up at the beach made my stomach twist. I imagined the questions, the stares, the awkwardness. I wanted to belong, to make my stepmom happy, but I also wanted to stay true to my beliefs. The two expectations pulled at me from opposite sides, and I sat on the edge of my bed, caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself I could let down."}
