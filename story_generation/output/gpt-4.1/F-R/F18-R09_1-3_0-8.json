I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d I could hear the anxiety in his words, and I knew how much he needed me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. I grabbed my keys, ready to head out, when my phone rang again. It was Mr. Goldstein from the synagogue. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan to say Kaddish at the funeral. Can you come right now?\u201d My heart pounded. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help form the minyan, especially for a funeral prayer. It was a mitzvah, a sacred duty, and I could hear the urgency in his voice. But my brother was counting on me, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting him down when he was so vulnerable. I stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of family and faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
