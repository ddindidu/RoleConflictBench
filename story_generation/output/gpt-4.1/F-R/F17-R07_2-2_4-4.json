I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I participate fully, honoring our traditions just as my grandparents had. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The weekly group meditation at the temple was starting soon\u2014a practice that had become my anchor, a space where I could breathe and find peace. My teacher always said mindfulness was about being present, about letting go of attachments, even to rituals. Yet here I was, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet call of my Buddhist path. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each promising a different kind of belonging. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I truly belonged tonight."}
