I knew something was weighing on her, and as her husband, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask her about her day, to share my own worries and listen to hers. We had always promised to communicate openly, to never let concerns fester in silence. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my daily ten-minute meditation, a practice I\u2019d committed to as part of my Buddhist path. I could feel the tension rising inside me\u2014my mind tugged in two directions. If I sat down to meditate, I might seem distant or uncaring, but if I stayed and talked, I\u2019d be breaking my promise to myself to practice mindfulness every day. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, torn between being the attentive husband she needed and the mindful practitioner I aspired to be."}
