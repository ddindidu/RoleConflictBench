My husband calls from the living room, asking if I\u2019ve seen the good tablecloth for the relatives\u2019 visit. I remind myself that as a wife, I\u2019m expected to help make our home welcoming, every detail perfect for our guests. But as I dry my hands, my eyes drift to the stack of books and notes on the dining table\u2014my other world. As a rabbi, I\u2019m expected to prepare thoughtful, inspiring sermons, and the time to brainstorm for Shabbat is slipping away. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the home must be spotless, the message must be meaningful. My husband\u2019s voice blends with the echo of my congregation\u2019s expectations. I want to be present for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. I stand frozen, torn between the broom and the books, my heart pounding with the impossibility of being enough for everyone."}
