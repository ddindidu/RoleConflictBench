They\u2019d both been so insistent lately, wanting to preserve every custom, every ritual, as if our family\u2019s identity depended on it. I wanted to honor them, to be the daughter they expected\u2014present, attentive, upholding what they cherished.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate I\u2019d been guiding for months. Her final study session before the Beit Din was set for tonight, the only time she could meet before her big day. As her rabbi, I knew how much she depended on me, how crucial this session was for her confidence and understanding. My community expected me to be there for her, to teach, to support, to lead.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached with the impossibility of being fully present for both my family and my student."}
