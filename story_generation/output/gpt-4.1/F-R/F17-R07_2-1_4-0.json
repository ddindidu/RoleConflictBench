They\u2019ve been talking all week about the importance of our family\u2019s traditions, especially now that my grandparents are visiting. My mother expects me to help prepare the ancestral altar and join the family dinner, just as we always have. But tonight is also the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I\u2019ve grown to cherish since I became more involved in the Buddhist community. The monks say our presence strengthens the sangha, and I feel a deep sense of peace when I\u2019m there, chanting with everyone. My parents don\u2019t understand why I want to go; they say family comes first, especially when we\u2019re honoring our ancestors. I feel torn, pulled between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet calling of the temple. My heart aches as I try to decide where I belong tonight, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
