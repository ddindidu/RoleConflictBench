My sister had been planning it for weeks, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories at the table. But tonight was also the slot I\u2019d set aside to teach my kids about Shabbat\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let slide, even if the lessons could technically be moved. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, \u201cFamily comes first,\u201d echoing in my mind, but I also felt the weight of my own commitment to pass on our Jewish traditions, to make sure my children understood where they came from. The guilt pressed in from both sides: if I skipped the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my siblings; if I postponed the lesson, I\u2019d be letting down my kids and my own values. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, the expectations of being a good sibling and a good Jewish parent pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down tonight."}
