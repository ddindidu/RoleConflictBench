My husband\u2019s shirt, stained from yesterday\u2019s work, lay on top\u2014he needed it clean for tomorrow\u2019s meeting. The kids\u2019 uniforms were buried underneath, and I knew if I didn\u2019t get the laundry done tonight, tomorrow morning would be a scramble of complaints and mismatched socks. As I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church council: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014right now\u2014to organize support, offer comfort, and pray with them. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed clean clothes and a calm evening; my congregation needed their pastor\u2019s presence and guidance. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between folding shirts and holding hands, between being the wife my family counted on and the pastor my community depended on."}
