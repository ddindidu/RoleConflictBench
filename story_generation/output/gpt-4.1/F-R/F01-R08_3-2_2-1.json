I sat with the Quran open before me, my finger tracing the lines I needed to catch up on. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. I felt the weight of my promise to myself\u2014to finish the Quran this month, to reflect and grow closer to Allah. Just then, my grandson shuffled into the room, his eyes red and uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you?\u201d he asked, voice trembling. He sat beside me, clutching his phone, and whispered about a problem at school, something serious that he didn\u2019t want to share with anyone else. I saw the hope in his eyes, the trust he placed in me to guide him. But my mind tugged at the unfinished pages, the spiritual duty I owed to my faith. I felt torn, the expectations of being a wise, present grandfather pulling me one way, and the sacred commitment of Ramadan pulling me another. My heart ached as I sat between the two, unsure which role to answer first."}
