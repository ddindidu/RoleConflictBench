It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014my weekly call to my parents. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, waiting for my update, her questions about my health, her stories about the neighbors. I know how much these calls mean to them, especially since I moved to this city. But tonight, the mosque is fuller than usual, and the regular backup imam is away. The congregation\u2019s eyes are on me, expecting me to lead the prayer, to be present and focused. I feel the weight of their trust, their need for guidance and comfort. My phone vibrates again, insistent. I glance at the screen, torn. My parents\u2019 expectation of connection and care tugs at me, while the community\u2019s need for spiritual leadership anchors me to the spot. My heart pounds as I stand between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each deserving it."}
