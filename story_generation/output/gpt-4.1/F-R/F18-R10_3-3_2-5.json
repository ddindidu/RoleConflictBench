He needed me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my promise that things would be okay. I wanted to wrap him in reassurance, to be the strong sibling he could lean on. But as I held his hand, my phone buzzed with a message from a friend: evidence of our uncle\u2019s involvement in a corrupt deal at work, one that would harm many innocent people. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and protect others from harm. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014my brother\u2019s desperate need for support, and my own conscience urging me to expose the wrongdoing. I felt torn, my mind racing between the comfort of family and the call of my moral duty, unsure which path to follow."}
