He\u2019s starting college soon, and he asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do I know if I\u2019m making the right choices?\u201d I felt the familiar tug to share stories from my own youth, to offer the practical wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over the years. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019s been struggling lately, and she asked if I could call her for some spiritual comfort.\n\nI looked at my grandson, eager and vulnerable, and then at the phone, knowing Mrs. Carter was waiting for words of faith and reassurance. My heart ached with the weight of both roles. As a grandfather, I wanted to be fully present, to guide him with patience and honesty. As a pastor, I felt the pull to offer spiritual solace, to be the shepherd my flock expects. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
