As his grandfather, I wanted to share stories of my own winding journey, to offer gentle advice shaped by years of living. I could see he needed comfort, not just answers\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him that confusion is part of growing up.\n\nBut the clock on the wall ticked closer to four. In fifteen minutes, I was expected at the synagogue, where a roomful of children waited for their weekly Torah lesson. As their rabbi, I was responsible for guiding them in faith, teaching them the laws and stories that form the backbone of our community. The parents trusted me to be there, to nurture their children\u2019s Jewish identity.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. My grandson\u2019s question lingered in the air, fragile and urgent, while the obligation to my students tugged at my conscience. I wanted to be fully present for both, but time and duty pulled me in opposite directions. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide what to do next."}
