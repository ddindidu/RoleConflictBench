My younger sister excitedly suggests a movie marathon for the weekend, and my parents look to me, expecting my usual enthusiasm. I know how much these moments mean to them; being present, joining in, and sharing in the fun is what\u2019s expected of me as a sibling. But in the back of my mind, I remember my commitment to my Buddhist practice\u2014especially the ten-minute window I\u2019ve set aside for mindfulness and meditation each evening. The family\u2019s plan overlaps with that quiet time, and I feel a knot tightening in my stomach. I want to be the supportive sibling, fully engaged and present, but I also feel the pull of my spiritual path, the need for stillness and self-reflection. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the thought of disappointing either my family or myself, caught between laughter and silence, belonging and solitude."}
