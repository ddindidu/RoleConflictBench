I kept an eye on the traffic, making sure he stayed close to the curb. That was my job as his older sibling\u2014always looking out for him, making sure he was safe. Later that evening, during a small community gathering at our house, someone brought up a story from scripture. Instinctively, I slipped into my role as pastor, sharing the lesson behind the story, emphasizing honesty and forgiveness. My brother, sitting quietly in the corner, looked uncomfortable. I remembered the secret he\u2019d confided in me earlier\u2014a mistake he\u2019d made at school, one he wasn\u2019t ready to share. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the sibling who promised to protect his trust, and the pastor expected to teach by example, even if it meant encouraging confession. My heart pounded as I realized whatever I said next could betray one role for the sake of the other."}
