My spouse sighs as they pass by, and I know it\u2019s my turn to fold. We promised to share the chores, to keep our home running smoothly together. Tonight, for once, there\u2019s nothing else on the calendar\u2014no work emails, no errands, just a quiet evening. I glance at the Quran on the shelf, its cover inviting me to open it, to recite and reflect as I\u2019ve been meaning to all week. My heart aches with longing for that peaceful connection, the spiritual nourishment I crave. But the laundry sits there, a silent reminder of my promise as a partner. I feel torn, pulled between the comfort of fulfilling my faith and the responsibility of supporting my spouse. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand in the hallway, unable to move, caught between the two worlds that define me."}
