The repayment deadline loomed, and I knew I needed to find extra work or cut back on expenses to keep my family secure. My wife\u2019s anxious glances and my children\u2019s laughter from the next room reminded me of what was at stake. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Patel, a longtime member of our congregation. She was desperate to meet, her text heavy with words like \u201clost\u201d and \u201chopeless.\u201d As a priest, I was expected to offer her my time, my ear, my heart. But every hour spent counseling was an hour not spent finding ways to provide for my family. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent needs of my home and the spiritual needs of my flock, my heart aching with the impossibility of being enough for both."}
