She wanted to meet tonight, desperate for spiritual guidance. I glanced across the table at my father, who looked tired, his hands wrapped around a mug of tea. My mother was unusually quiet, her eyes fixed on the window. I knew I should ask them if everything was alright, offer the support they always expected from me as their son. But the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s request pressed on me\u2014I was her pastor, and she needed me, too. My parents had always counted on me to check in, to be present, especially when things felt off at home. Yet, as a pastor, I was expected to be available, to guide my congregation through their darkest moments. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, my care. I felt torn, my heart heavy with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that no matter what I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
