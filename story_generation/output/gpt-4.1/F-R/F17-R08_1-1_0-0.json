I finally have time to myself, and I\u2019ve been looking forward to reading the Quran, something I promised myself I\u2019d do more often. I set my phone aside, open the holy book, and begin to recite softly, letting the words settle in my heart. But then my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I can almost hear her voice in my head, reminding me to stay connected. I want to reply right away, to reassure her, to be the caring child she expects. But I also feel the pull of my faith, the need to focus, to reflect without distraction. My hands hover over my phone, torn between the comfort my parents seek and the spiritual peace I crave. The two roles tug at me, each demanding my attention, and I sit there, caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
