My father\u2019s voice, usually steady, now trembled when he spoke about work. I felt the weight of their exhaustion, the silent plea for comfort in their eyes. As their child, I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer the reassurance they needed. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the parish office. The Martinez family\u2019s child was receiving a sacrament tomorrow, and they needed me to lead a final, crucial preparation session tonight. As a priest, I was expected to be present, organized, and spiritually supportive for the families in my care. My mind raced between the two worlds: the home that needed my gentle presence, and the church that demanded my guidance. My heart ached, torn by the impossible pull of both roles, each expecting me to be fully there, fully present, at the same time."}
