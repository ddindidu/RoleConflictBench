My father, usually so strong, looked to me with tired eyes, silently pleading for reassurance. I knew they needed me\u2014my words, my presence, my comfort. I wanted to be the son they could lean on, the one who would listen and hold them together when things felt like they were falling apart. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the church service would begin soon. I\u2019d promised myself, and God, that I would be there every week, not just for worship but to serve and connect with my church family. The thought of missing it filled me with guilt, as if I was letting down my faith and the community that counted on me. My heart ached, torn between the quiet desperation in my parents\u2019 eyes and the call to honor my commitment as a Christian. I sat there, paralyzed, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
