My daughter calls from the kitchen, asking if I can help set the table, and I feel the warmth of family, the pull of tradition. This is our time to reconnect, to share stories and memories, and I know how much my presence means to them. Yet, my phone vibrates with a message from the mosque: a large gathering has assembled for a special remembrance, and I am the only one authorized to lead the prayers. The community expects me to be there, to guide them in worship, especially on such an important occasion. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the laughter of my family and the solemn duty awaiting me at the mosque. I can feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to let go."}
