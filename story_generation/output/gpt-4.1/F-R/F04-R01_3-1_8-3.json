She was upset\u2014again\u2014about something I\u2019d said last week, and she wanted to talk it through. As her brother, I knew I needed to listen, to be patient, to help us build the respect we\u2019d promised each other after our last big argument. But just as I was about to call her, my phone buzzed with another message. This one was from Mrs. Evans, a member of my congregation. Her husband had lost his job, and she was feeling overwhelmed. As her pastor, I was expected to check in, offer comfort, and remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me\u2014my sister needed my honesty and attention, but Mrs. Evans needed my compassion and support. I could feel my chest tighten, torn between the demands of family and faith, knowing that whoever I called first, I\u2019d be letting someone else down."}
