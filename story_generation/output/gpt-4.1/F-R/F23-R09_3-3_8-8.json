The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow. As a step-parent, I promised stability, a safe home for my partner and their child. Every dollar counts, and I\u2019ve been picking up extra shifts, skipping anything that isn\u2019t essential. My phone buzzes\u2014a message from the synagogue. There\u2019s a funeral prayer this afternoon, and they\u2019re short one person for the minyan. Without me, the prayer can\u2019t happen. My Jewish faith tugs at me, the obligation to honor the dead and support my community. But if I leave work early, I\u2019ll lose precious hours, maybe even risk my job. My family needs me to be responsible, to keep us afloat. My community needs me to show up, to be counted. I stare at the numbers, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart caught between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer."}
