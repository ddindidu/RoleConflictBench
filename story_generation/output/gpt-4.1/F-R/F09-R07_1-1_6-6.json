He\u2019d been saving up, but the final purchase depended on me, and I knew how much he wanted it. As a mother, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s finances stayed stable, especially with bills piling up this month. The cost of the Nintendo would set us back, but I didn\u2019t want to break my promise or disappoint him.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was Mei, my friend from the temple, asking if I could join her for tea to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last weekend. She said she was struggling to understand the teachings and needed someone to reflect with. I knew how important it was, as a Buddhist, to support others in their spiritual journey and to nurture my own practice through study and reflection.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. My heart ached with the pressure of being a good mother and a devoted Buddhist. Both roles demanded my time, energy, and resources, but I couldn\u2019t see how to fulfill both expectations at once."}
