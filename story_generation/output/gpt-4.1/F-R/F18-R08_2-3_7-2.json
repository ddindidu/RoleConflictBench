He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, but this ramp was dangerous, and I knew he needed someone to look out for him. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community Quran study circle was meeting tonight, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we were supposed to discuss. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of expectation to be prepared, to show respect for the Quran and the group by reflecting deeply on its meaning. My brother called out, asking if I\u2019d watch him, and I could see the hope in his face. My heart twisted, torn between staying to make sure he was safe and leaving to fulfill my religious commitment. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that mattered deeply to me."}
