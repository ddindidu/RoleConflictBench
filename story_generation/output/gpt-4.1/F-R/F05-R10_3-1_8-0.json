She wanted to talk about our finances, about the medical bills piling up, and she expected me to be completely honest, to share every worry and plan. As her husband, I owed her that openness, that trust. But as she spoke, my mind drifted to the morning\u2019s rushed prayer\u2014just a whispered mantra in the car, not the full puja my faith asked of me. I felt guilty, as if I\u2019d cheated both her and my beliefs. My heart pounded with the urge to confess everything, to be the transparent partner she needed, but I also felt the sting of not honoring my daily ritual, of letting my spiritual practice slip for the sake of our busy lives. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself I was betraying more."}
