The call had come suddenly\u2014my daughter-in-law was in the hospital, and the family needed me. I felt the weight of my role as grandfather, the expectation to be present, to comfort, to hold the family together. As we drove through the unfamiliar town, my stomach reminded me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. My son pulled over at a roadside vendor, the only one for miles, and I recognized the sign: kosher-certified. Relief washed over me; I could eat here and still honor my Jewish commitment to kosher laws. But as we approached, my son\u2019s phone rang. He turned to me, urgency in his eyes. \u201cDad, can you stay with the kids in the car? I need to go inside and talk to the doctor.\u201d I looked at my hungry grandchildren, the vendor just steps away, and felt the pull of both worlds\u2014my duty to my family, and my duty to my faith\u2014colliding inside me."}
