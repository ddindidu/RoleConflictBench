She sounds upset, her words scattered and anxious. She wants to talk, says she needs me. I know she\u2019s been struggling lately, and as her brother, I feel the weight of being her support, the one she can lean on when things get tough. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle, and I promised myself I\u2019d attend. We\u2019re discussing verses I haven\u2019t read yet, and I feel the pressure to be prepared, to show my commitment as a Muslim and not let the group down. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the urge to call my sister and the responsibility to my faith. The clock ticks closer to the study circle\u2019s start, and I can feel the expectations from both sides pressing in on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. I sit there, wrestling with the choice, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
