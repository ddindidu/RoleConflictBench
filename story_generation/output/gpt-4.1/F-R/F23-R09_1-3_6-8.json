My stepson\u2019s eyes had lit up when I promised him this gift, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014how much it meant to keep my word, to show him I could be counted on. But the price tag still gnawed at me, a reminder of the tight budget I was supposed to protect for our family. \n\nJust as I was about to wrap the box, my phone buzzed. It was the rabbi. There was a funeral prayer at the synagogue, and they needed one more person for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I felt the weight of my Jewish identity, the responsibility to my community, the sacredness of being present for the mourners. \n\nI looked at the Nintendo, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both sides. My stepson\u2019s trust, my family\u2019s finances, my community\u2019s need, my faith. The expectations pressed in, and I stood there, torn, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
