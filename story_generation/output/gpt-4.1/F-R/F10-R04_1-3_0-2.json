I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed calls from my mother, and a text: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you.\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I\u2019d promised to check in every weekend, but the mosque was overflowing tonight for the special remembrance, and I was the only imam present. The congregation waited, eyes on me, expecting guidance and calm. My heart pounded with the weight of their trust. But my mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, her worry palpable through the screen. I knew she\u2019d be sitting by the window, phone in hand, waiting for a sign that I was safe and well. I wanted to call her, to reassure her, but the community needed me now. My hands trembled as I held my phone, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my congregation, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
