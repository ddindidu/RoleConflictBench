Mom always said to look out for him, especially after what happened last year. I kept glancing at him, making sure he stayed close, my mind replaying her words: \u201cYou\u2019re his big sister. He needs you.\u201d But today was Wednesday, and the church youth group was meeting in less than an hour. Pastor Lee had reminded us all on Sunday\u2014attendance was important, not just for worship, but to show commitment to our faith and community. I could already picture the empty seat if I didn\u2019t show up, the questions, the disappointment. But my brother\u2019s face was pale, and he kept coughing, slower than usual. I knew he wasn\u2019t feeling well, and I didn\u2019t want to leave him alone at home. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the church group chat. I felt torn, my heart pounding, caught between the duty to care for my brother and the expectation to be present at church. I slowed my steps, wrestling with what I should do next."}
