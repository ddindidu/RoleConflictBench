My phone buzzed with a message from the school: \u201cReminder, early dismissal today.\u201d I pictured my children waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. At the same moment, Sister Amina\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014her call just an hour ago, her words trembling with urgency. \u201cPlease, Imam, I need to talk. Today, if possible. I don\u2019t know where else to turn.\u201d As a mother, I felt the pull to be there for my children, to hear about their day, to offer the comfort of my presence. As an imam, I knew the weight of spiritual responsibility, the trust placed in me to guide and support. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, both were sacred. My chest tightened as I stared at my calendar, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my community, wishing I could split myself in two."}
