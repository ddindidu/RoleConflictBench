His final exam was tomorrow, and the anxiety in the room was thick enough to taste. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him that he was more than a grade, that I believed in him. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and now she was reaching out, asking if I had a moment to talk. As a pastor, I knew how much she needed spiritual comfort, someone to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone in her pain. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my brother, who needed my presence and understanding, and toward Mrs. Carter, who needed my words and prayers. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each deserving it. I stared at my phone, torn, wishing I could be enough for both."}
