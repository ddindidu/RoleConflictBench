The street is familiar, lined with budding trees and the scent of fresh bread from the corner bakery. I glance at my watch\u2014services at the synagogue start in twenty minutes. Mom always says it\u2019s important to show up, to be part of the community, even if it\u2019s just a routine weekday service. I know she expects me to go, and honestly, I want to. But my brother\u2019s been quiet today, dragging his feet, and I remember he mentioned not feeling well this morning. \n\nHe looks up at me, eyes tired. \u201cCan we just go home?\u201d he asks softly. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the sibling who should make sure he\u2019s okay, and the Jewish teen who should be at synagogue, fulfilling a responsibility to my faith and family. I slow my steps, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of my brother\u2019s hand in mine and the pull of the synagogue\u2019s open doors waiting for me."}
