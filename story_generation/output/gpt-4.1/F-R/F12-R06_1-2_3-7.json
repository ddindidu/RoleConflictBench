The expectation was clear\u2014share the household responsibilities, make sure things run smoothly, and don\u2019t let chores pile up. But as I reached for a towel to fold, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a friend from church. She was struggling, her words heavy with sadness and need. As a Christian, I knew what was expected of me: to show love and kindness, to be there for others as Jesus taught. My heart ached for her, and I wanted to drop everything and go to her, to listen and comfort. But the laundry was still there, a silent reminder of my duties at home. I stood in the living room, torn between the demands of being a good wife and the call to be a caring Christian, feeling the tension rise inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
