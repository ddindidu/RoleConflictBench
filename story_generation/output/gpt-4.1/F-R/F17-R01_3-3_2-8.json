I glance at the clock\u2014just five minutes until the workshop begins. The community leaders are already gathering, their faces expectant, waiting for me to guide them through the intricate layers of doctrine I\u2019ve spent weeks preparing. I know how much this matters; they look to me for clarity, for answers, for inspiration. But my mother\u2019s messages are insistent, each one a gentle reminder of our daily ritual: sharing the small details of my day, responding quickly, making her feel close even when I\u2019m far away. I feel the weight of her expectation, the comfort she finds in our conversations, and the guilt that creeps in when I delay. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the family that raised me and the flock that depends on me. The phone vibrates again, and I stare at it, torn, the words of my lesson blurring in my mind as I wrestle with which part of myself to answer first."}
