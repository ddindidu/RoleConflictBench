I knew she wanted me there, helping set the table, sharing stories, laughing with my step-siblings. But Sunday afternoons were also when I\u2019d promised to teach my little brother about Shabbat, Hebrew letters, and the stories of our ancestors. My dad had asked me to take this on, to help keep our Jewish heritage alive, especially since we were the only ones in the house who practiced. The family dinner and the study session overlapped, and I could feel the tension building inside me. If I skipped dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmother and risk feeling even more like an outsider. If I moved the study session, I worried my brother would lose interest, and I\u2019d be letting down my dad and our tradition. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds, both asking me to prove I belonged."}
