She needed me\u2014her daughter\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be present in this moment of vulnerability. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her expectation, the silent plea in her eyes for comfort and strength. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help form the quorum, to allow someone to honor their loved one\u2019s memory. My heart twisted. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my mother when she needed me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community and the grieving family. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent, each sacred. I sat frozen, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the Jew my community expected me to be, the clock ticking as I wrestled with what to do."}
