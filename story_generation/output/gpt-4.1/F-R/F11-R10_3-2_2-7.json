She needed me\u2014her voice shaky, asking if I could come over. She was having a rough day, and we always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded. Today was the puja at our family temple, a ceremony my parents had been preparing for all week. As a Hindu, I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best, to honor our traditions and pray with everyone. My mother had already laid out my saree, reminding me how important it was to be present, to show respect to our deities and elders. I felt torn, the weight of my sister\u2019s need pulling me one way, and the duty to my faith and family pulling me the other. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
