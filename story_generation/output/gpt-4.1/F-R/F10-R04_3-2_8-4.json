My mother\u2019s eyes were red, searching my face for reassurance. I could feel the weight of their vulnerability, the unspoken hope that I would be their anchor. I wanted to stay, to listen, to hold their hands and promise that everything would be alright. But my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014the Friday sermon was in less than an hour. The community had been looking forward to my khutbah all week, and as the only imam scheduled, I knew they were counting on me to guide them, to offer wisdom and strength. My heart twisted as I looked from my parents to the clock, torn between the daughter they needed and the imam my community expected. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to give fully to either."}
