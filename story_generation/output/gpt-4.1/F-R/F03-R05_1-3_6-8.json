She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I knew she\u2019d been struggling since Dad\u2019s surgery. I reached for her hand, asking softly, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d She hesitated, then started to open up, her voice trembling. Just then, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was the synagogue president. A beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral service as soon as possible. My mother\u2019s hand tightened in mine, her need for comfort clear. But the congregation expected me to be present, to guide them through their grief. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014my mother\u2019s silent plea for support, and my duty to my community in their moment of loss. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unable to move, caught between the son my mother needed and the rabbi my congregation expected."}
