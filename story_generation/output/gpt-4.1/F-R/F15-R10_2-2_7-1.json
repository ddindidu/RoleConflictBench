As a parent, I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on me\u2014rent is due soon, groceries are running low, and my job has asked me to come in early for extra shifts. The money is needed, desperately, to keep our family afloat. Yet, as a Hindu, I have always set aside this sacred time to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar. My mother taught me that these rituals bring peace and blessings to the household, and I want to pass that on to my children. Today, my phone buzzes with a message from my boss: \u201cCan you come in right now? We need you.\u201d I glance at the clock. If I leave immediately, I\u2019ll make it on time, but I\u2019ll have to skip my morning prayers. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the urgent need to provide for my family and the deep pull of my faith, both demanding my presence at the same moment."}
