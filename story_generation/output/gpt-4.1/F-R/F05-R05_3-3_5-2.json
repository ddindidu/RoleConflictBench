My wife darted past, arms full of linens, her eyes silently pleading for help. Relatives would arrive in hours, and every surface needed to shine. As a husband, I knew I should be folding laundry, vacuuming, making sure our home reflected the warmth and order we wanted to show our family. But my mind kept drifting to the half-written sermon on my desk upstairs. The High Holiday service was tomorrow, and the congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and wisdom. I could almost hear the echo of their anticipation, the weight of their hopes pressing on my shoulders. My wife called for help with the guest room, and at the same moment, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cFinalize sermon.\u201d I felt torn, heart pounding, as I stared at the suds on my hands, caught between the demands of my home and the sacred responsibility waiting above."}
