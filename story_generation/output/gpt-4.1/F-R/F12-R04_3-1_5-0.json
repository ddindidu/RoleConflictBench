My husband was vacuuming the living room, and the children were dusting shelves, all of us working together to prepare for the arrival of my in-laws. The house needed to be spotless\u2014my mother-in-law\u2019s standards were high, and as a wife, I felt the weight of making everything perfect. Yet, as I scrubbed, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was nearly time for Maghrib prayer at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to lead, to be present for the congregation, even if tonight the group would be small and another brother was available to step in. My heart pounded with the pressure of both roles\u2014my family needed me here, but my community expected my presence at the mosque. I could feel the tension rising, torn between the duty to my home and the responsibility to my congregation, each pulling at me with equal urgency."}
