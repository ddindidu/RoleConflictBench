My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014needed their son to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort and reassurance. But as I reached for my phone to silence it, a message popped up from a parishioner: \u201cFather, could we talk sometime soon? I\u2019ve been struggling.\u201d I could sense the weight behind those words, the silent plea for guidance. My role as a priest called me to be present for my flock, to offer counsel and hope. Yet, my heart ached for my parents, who needed their son now more than ever. I stood in the hallway, torn between the living room and the church office, feeling the pull of both worlds and the impossibility of being fully present in either."}
