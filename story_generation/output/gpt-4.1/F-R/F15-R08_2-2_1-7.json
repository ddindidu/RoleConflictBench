The school had just sent a reminder about the open class next week\u2014my daughter\u2019s first time performing in front of everyone. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for days, her eyes shining with excitement every time she asked if I\u2019d be there. I knew how much it meant to her, and as her parent, I wanted nothing more than to sit in the front row, cheering her on.\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed with a message from my friends: \u201cWe\u2019re booking our Hajj trip this year. Are you in?\u201d I\u2019d been saving for years, setting aside every spare coin, dreaming of the day I could fulfill this pillar of my faith. The group was going this season, and if I missed it, I might not get another chance for a long time. The money I\u2019d saved was just enough for the pilgrimage, but if I used it for the trip, I wouldn\u2019t be able to take time off work for the open class or cover the extra expenses.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My daughter\u2019s hopeful face and the sacred call of Hajj pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
