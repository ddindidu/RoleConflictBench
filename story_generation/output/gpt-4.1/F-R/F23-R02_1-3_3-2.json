My stepdaughter, Emma, was supposed to be setting the table, but instead, she was tossing napkins in the air, ignoring my gentle reminders. As her step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility to teach her respect and discipline, to guide her in the small rituals of daily life. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders from the church\u2014today was the most significant religious holiday of the year. The congregation expected me to lead the prayers, to be present for every member seeking comfort and guidance. My vestments hung ready in the closet, but my heart was torn. Should I stay and patiently teach Emma the importance of manners, or leave for the church, fulfilling my sacred duty to the community? The clock ticked louder, echoing the tension inside me. I closed my eyes, feeling the pull of both worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
