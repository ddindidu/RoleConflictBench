I\u2019ll order pizza and snacks. You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I smiled, thinking of how we\u2019d promised to include each other in more things, to build that mutual respect we sometimes let slip away. But then I glanced at the pantry, lined with kosher snacks and ingredients I\u2019d carefully chosen. My sister\u2019s place was always stocked with regular food\u2014definitely not kosher. I knew she\u2019d be hurt if I brought my own snacks or declined the pizza, but I also knew how important it was for me to observe kosher dietary laws. I could already hear her voice, teasing but a little wounded: \u201cCan\u2019t you just relax for one night?\u201d My heart twisted, caught between wanting to be the sister she needed and the Jewish woman I promised myself I\u2019d be. I stared at my phone, the cursor blinking, waiting for my reply."}
