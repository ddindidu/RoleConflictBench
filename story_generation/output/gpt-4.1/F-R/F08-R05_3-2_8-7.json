My grandson, Ethan, is struggling\u2014he\u2019s withdrawn, his grades slipping, and she\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end. As a grandmother, I ache to be there, to hold him, to listen, to remind him he\u2019s not alone. My family expects me to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom, especially now. But as I hang up, my phone buzzes again: a reminder about the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah. Months of preparation, a sanctuary full of expectant faces, a young boy ready to step into Jewish adulthood. As their rabbi, I am the anchor, the guide, the one who must show up, steady and joyful.
