My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to lead the family ceremony this year, to honor our ancestors and keep our traditions alive. I could see her hopeful eyes, the pride she would feel if I stood at the front, guiding prayers and rituals as my father once did. Yet, the convent bell chimed softly, a reminder of my other life. Sister Agnes had just told me that Mrs. Ramirez, a devoted parishioner, was waiting for me in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer spiritual guidance and comfort. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s expectations and the needs of my spiritual community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, the fear of disappointing those I loved, and the guilt of neglecting my calling. I closed my eyes, torn, unsure which path to take."}
