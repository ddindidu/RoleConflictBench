I know I should stop him, teach him about respect and discipline, especially in public. That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014guides, corrects, shapes. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a reminder of the Shabbat service just hours away. I haven\u2019t finished my sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, wisdom, a message that will carry them through the week. My mind races with unfinished thoughts, half-formed ideas, and the pressure to deliver something meaningful. Yet here I am, torn between chasing after my son and the sacred duty waiting for me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my child\u2019s need for guidance, my community\u2019s need for leadership. My heart aches with the knowledge that, in this moment, I cannot fully be both."}
