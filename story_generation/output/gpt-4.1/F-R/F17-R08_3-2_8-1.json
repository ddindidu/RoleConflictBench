Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. I could hear the clock ticking, each second reminding me of the promise I made to myself to finish the Quran this month. Just as I was about to start reciting, my mother sat down beside me, her eyes red and tired. She began to talk, her voice trembling as she shared her worries about Dad\u2019s job and the bills piling up. I could feel her need for comfort, for me to listen and reassure her. But my mind kept drifting to the pages in front of me, the verses I hadn\u2019t read, the spiritual commitment I was falling short on. I wanted to be the child she needed, to hold her hand and tell her everything would be okay. At the same time, I felt the weight of my faith, the expectation to honor this sacred month and not let my reading slip further behind. My heart pulled in two directions, I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
