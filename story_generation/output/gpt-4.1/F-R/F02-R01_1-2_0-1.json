My children\u2019s school day was ending soon, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like I always tried to be. They\u2019d been looking forward to telling me about their day, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially with the school year almost over. \n\nJust as I reached for my car keys, Mrs. Evans appeared at my door, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014right now\u2014about a decision that could change her family\u2019s life. As her pastor, I knew how much she depended on my guidance, and I could see the desperation in her face. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between the door and my desk, torn by the pull of two worlds. My children\u2019s expectant faces flashed in my mind, but so did Mrs. Evans\u2019s pain. I felt the pressure of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
