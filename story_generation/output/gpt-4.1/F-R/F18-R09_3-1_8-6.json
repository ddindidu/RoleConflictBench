The synagogue service was about to start, and I knew my parents expected me to be there, just as I expected it of myself. It was part of who I was\u2014showing up, being counted, honoring tradition. But then I saw my little brother, distracted by his phone, stepping off the curb without looking. My heart leapt into my throat. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, just like he\u2019d do for me. But if I ran to stop him, I\u2019d be late for the service, maybe miss it entirely. I could already hear my rabbi\u2019s gentle disappointment, feel the weight of my own guilt. My brother\u2019s safety or my commitment to my faith\u2014both mattered deeply, and in that split second, I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
