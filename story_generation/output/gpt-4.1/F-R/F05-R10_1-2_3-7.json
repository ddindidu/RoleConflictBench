My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but firm: \u201cCan you please help fold these before we leave?\u201d I know she\u2019s been juggling work and chores all week, and I promised I\u2019d do my part. But today is also the day of the family puja\u2014my parents have called twice already, reminding me to be on time, to wear my kurta, to bring sweets for the offering. The ceremony is important, a tradition that binds us, and I can\u2019t be late. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stay to help, we\u2019ll be late for the puja and my family will be disappointed. If I leave now, the laundry will sit, another broken promise to my wife. I stand frozen, torn between the expectations of a good husband and a dutiful son, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
