I knew something had happened at school\u2014she always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As her sibling, I felt the urge to sit beside her, listen, and offer comfort, just like I always had. But my mind kept drifting back to what happened earlier that day: I\u2019d seen one of my classmates being unfairly accused of cheating, and I knew the truth. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to follow dharma and speak out against injustice. The guilt gnawed at me; I hadn\u2019t said anything yet, and now, seeing my sister in pain, I felt torn. Should I stay and support her, or should I reach out to my classmate and try to set things right? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
