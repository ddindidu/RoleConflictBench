The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. As a father, I felt the weight of providing for my family, making sure there was enough for groceries, rent, and the kids\u2019 school supplies. Every dollar mattered. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple in the community, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They wanted to secure the date, but they couldn\u2019t commit to a deposit yet. As their rabbi, I knew how important it was to be present for these milestones, to guide and support them. But I also knew that if I held the date without a deposit, I might have to turn down another event that could help pay our bills. My heart twisted, torn between my duty to my family and my calling to serve my congregation. I stared at the screen, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
