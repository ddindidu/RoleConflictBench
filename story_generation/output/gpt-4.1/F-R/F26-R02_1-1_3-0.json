The family gathering was something I\u2019d promised not to miss\u2014an afternoon of laughter, stories, and the warmth of being surrounded by those I love most. Yet, as I poured my morning coffee, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel, a tradition I\u2019d upheld for years, awaited me. The congregation, though small, looked to me for guidance and comfort, even on days when attendance was sparse. I could almost hear Mrs. Patel\u2019s soft voice, \u201cFather, your prayers bring us peace.\u201d My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the joyful chaos of my grandchildren and the quiet sanctuary of my calling. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, the desire to be present for my family and the responsibility to serve my community. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the clock ticking steadily toward both appointments, unsure which path to take."}
