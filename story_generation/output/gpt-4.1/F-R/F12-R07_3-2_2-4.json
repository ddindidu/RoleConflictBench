He\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and tonight he finally asks, \u201cCan you just stay with me for a while?\u201d I feel the weight of his need, the silent plea for comfort and reassurance. I want to hold his hand, listen, and be the steady presence he\u2019s always counted on. But tonight is also the weekly group meditation at the temple\u2014a time I\u2019ve promised myself to nurture my own peace, to practice mindfulness and reconnect with my Buddhist community. The thought of missing it fills me with guilt; I know how much I need that hour of stillness to keep myself grounded. My heart aches, torn between the urge to be the supportive wife he needs and the longing to honor my spiritual practice. I sit beside him, my mind racing, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as I wrestle with what to do."}
