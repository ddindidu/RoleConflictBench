As her husband, I knew I should reach out, ask her what was weighing on her mind, and share my own worries from the week. We had always promised to communicate openly, to never let silence grow between us. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the main weekly service I was expected to lead in less than an hour. As the community\u2019s priest, my presence was not just requested, it was required. They depended on me for guidance, for the comfort of tradition and prayer. My wife glanced at the clock, her lips pressed into a thin line. I could feel the tension in the room, the unspoken plea for me to stay and listen, to be her partner first. But the weight of my priestly duties pressed just as hard, reminding me of the congregation waiting for me. My heart pounded as I sat between these two worlds, torn by the demands of love and faith, unsure which path to take."}
