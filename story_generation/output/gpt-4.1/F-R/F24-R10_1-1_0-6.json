He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014how much he needed someone to sit with him, to reassure him that he could do it. I wanted to be that person, to fulfill the promise we made to always support each other, especially when things got tough. But as I glanced out the window, the vibrant colors of the festival caught my eye. The familiar sounds of the aarti and the scent of incense drifted in, reminding me of my duty as a Hindu to participate in the rituals, to honor my faith and my family\u2019s expectations. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my anxious stepbrother who needed me, and toward the festival that called to my spirit. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
