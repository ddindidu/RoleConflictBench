The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with firmness and care. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I was due at synagogue in less than an hour. Tonight, I was scheduled to chant Torah, something I\u2019d prepared for weeks, and the community expected my presence.\n\nMy heart pounded as I knelt beside him, torn between the need to address his mistake with patience and the obligation to fulfill my religious commitment. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning him in a moment that demanded guidance. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my congregation and my own sense of Jewish duty. The conflicting expectations pressed in on me, and I felt the sting of helplessness as I tried to figure out how to be both the parent he needed and the Jew I aspired to be."}
