My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my mother. She wanted to know how my day was, if I\u2019d eaten, if I could call her before she went to bed. We spoke every day, sometimes twice, and I knew she waited for my updates, my voice, the reassurance that I was okay. But tonight, I was preparing for the final study session with Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her Beit Din was tomorrow, and she was anxious, needing my full attention and guidance. As a rabbi, I was expected to be present, focused, and supportive, especially at such a pivotal moment in someone\u2019s spiritual journey. My mother\u2019s messages blinked insistently on the screen, each one a gentle tug at my heart, while Miriam\u2019s nervous questions echoed in my mind. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the impossible pull between being a devoted son and a responsible rabbi. My hands hovered over the phone, torn between answering my mother and turning it off to give Miriam my undivided attention."}
