He looked tired, lines of worry etched deep on his face. \u201cThey want me to take the promotion, but it means moving to another city,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper. I reached out, wanting to comfort him, to be the supportive wife he needed. He needed me to listen, to help him weigh his options, to reassure him that whatever he chose, I\u2019d stand by him.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the envelope tucked away in our bedroom drawer\u2014the savings we\u2019d set aside for Hajj. This year, our friends were going, and I felt the pull of my faith stronger than ever. The thought of finally fulfilling this pillar of Islam filled me with longing and guilt. If he took the promotion, our plans\u2014and our savings\u2014would change. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions: the wife who wanted to be his anchor, and the Muslim who yearned to answer the call to pilgrimage. I listened to him speak, nodding, but inside, I was wrestling with a storm of conflicting loyalties, unsure which path I could bear to let go."}
