My cousins and I had spent the whole day at the temple, our hands stained with turmeric and sandalwood, the air thick with incense and the sound of chanting. As a Hindu, I knew how important it was to be present, to honor the gods and my family\u2019s traditions, especially during this festival. Yet, as the evening wore on, a knot of guilt tightened in my stomach. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cHope you\u2019re safe. Let us know how you are.\u201d I realized I hadn\u2019t checked in all day. As their child, I was expected to communicate, to reassure them, especially when I was far from home. But every time I tried to sneak away for a call, another ritual began, another relative pulled me back. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
