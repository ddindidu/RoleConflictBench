Mom had left early for work, and the silence between us felt heavy. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his step-child, I felt I should ask if he was okay, offer some comfort, maybe even just listen. That\u2019s what Mom always hoped I\u2019d do\u2014help keep the family together, be the bridge. But last night, I overheard him on the phone, saying things about someone at work that went against everything I\u2019d learned in church\u2014gossip, harsh words, even a hint of dishonesty. As a Christian, I felt a responsibility to speak up, to gently remind him of the values we\u2019re supposed to live by. But how could I do that and still be the supportive step-child he needed? If I said something, would I be betraying his trust? If I stayed silent, would I be betraying my faith? My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, torn between the two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
