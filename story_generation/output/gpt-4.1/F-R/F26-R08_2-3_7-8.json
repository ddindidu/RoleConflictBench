She wanted to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, offered advice, and celebrated her achievements. As a grandparent, I felt the weight of being present, of keeping our family close, especially now when everyone seemed so busy and scattered. But in the quiet moments, my thoughts drifted to the letter from the doctor, the one that said my health might not allow me to travel much longer. The pilgrimage to Mecca, a duty I had always hoped to fulfill, suddenly felt urgent. My heart ached with longing and fear\u2014if I went, I might miss precious time with my family, especially when they needed me. If I stayed, I might lose my only chance to complete my faith\u2019s sacred journey. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself torn, unable to silence the voice of either role."}
