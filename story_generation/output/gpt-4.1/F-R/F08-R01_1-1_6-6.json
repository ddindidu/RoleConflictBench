My daughter called, reminding me how much the grandchildren looked forward to our annual gathering, the laughter, the stories, the warmth of being together. I knew how much it meant to them, and to me, to keep our family close, to be the grandmother who listens, who remembers birthdays, who makes everyone feel cherished.\n\nBut at the same time, as pastor, I was invited to a community gathering that same weekend. During the event, I found myself sharing a story from scripture, weaving in lessons of kindness and forgiveness. The faces around me were attentive, some nodding, others quietly reflecting. I could sense how much they needed guidance, how my words might offer comfort or direction.\n\nYet, as I spoke, my mind drifted to my family. Would they feel neglected if I missed our tradition? Was I failing them by prioritizing my pastoral duties? Or was I letting down my congregation if I chose family over ministry? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, my heart aching with the weight of choosing between two worlds that both needed me."}
