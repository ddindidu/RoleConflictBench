The theme was forgiveness\u2014how to let go of anger and choose compassion, even when it\u2019s hard. I wanted to guide my congregation, to give them something real to hold onto. Just as I was finding the right words, I heard the front door slam. My younger brother trudged in, eyes red, backpack dragging. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew something had happened at school\u2014he\u2019d been having trouble with his friends lately. As his sibling, I felt the pull to go to him, to listen, to be the shoulder he needed. But the sermon deadline pressed on me, and I wondered if I could pause my work. Was it right to set aside my pastoral duty, even for family? Or was this moment with my brother exactly what I was supposed to be living out, not just preaching? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, torn, not sure which role needed me more."}
