As a rabbi, I knew I needed to start preparing my sermon for Shabbat, to find words that would inspire and guide my congregation. The expectation weighed on me\u2014my community looked to me for wisdom, and I couldn\u2019t let them down. But my phone buzzed with a message from my younger brother, Avi. He wanted to talk, to clear the air after our recent argument. As his brother, I owed him honesty and respect, a chance to rebuild the trust between us. I stared at the phone, torn. If I called Avi now, I\u2019d lose precious time for my sermon, but if I waited, the distance between us might grow. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way. My heart ached with the tension, caught between the needs of my family and my congregation, unsure which voice to answer first."}
