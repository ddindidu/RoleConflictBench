The school wanted me to come in that afternoon to discuss what happened. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the church was in an hour. Even though it was optional, many in the congregation looked to me for comfort and guidance, especially during these uncertain times. I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I didn\u2019t show up. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my child and my responsibility to my community. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to lead, to care. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which path to take."}
