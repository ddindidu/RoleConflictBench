As a mother, I knew I should call him back, teach him to respect public spaces, to be calm and considerate. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the convent. Sister Agnes was gravely ill, and the sisters were gathering for a special healing service, one that required my presence and prayers. My heart twisted. The expectation to guide my child clashed with the sacred duty to my community. I could see the disapproving glances from other shoppers, feel the weight of my habit reminding me of my vows. My son\u2019s eyes met mine, full of mischief and innocence, while my mind raced with the urgency of the call to prayer. I stood frozen, torn between the world of motherhood and the sanctuary of my faith, each demanding my presence, each expecting my devotion."}
