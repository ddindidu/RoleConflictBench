My older sister\u2019s text was warm and insistent: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised to be here for dinner. Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the spices, hear the laughter, and feel the comfort of being with my family. But as I was about to reply, the mosque\u2019s caretaker called, his voice urgent. \u201cImam, there\u2019s a large crowd for the remembrance tonight. No one else can lead the prayer. We\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be a brother. But my congregation needed me as their imam, to guide them in prayer, to offer solace and leadership. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each tugging in a different direction. I could picture my mother\u2019s disappointed face if I didn\u2019t show up, and I could feel the congregation\u2019s anticipation, their trust in me. Torn between love and duty, I hesitated at the door, caught in the silent storm of my own conflicting roles."}
