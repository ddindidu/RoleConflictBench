My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that we promised to keep up with the chores together, especially with the kids\u2019 soccer game tomorrow and everyone needing clean uniforms. I know how much it means to them that I pull my weight at home, that I\u2019m present and dependable.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: tonight is the service at synagogue, and I\u2019m scheduled to chant a portion. It\u2019s not just any service\u2014it\u2019s one I\u2019ve been preparing for, practicing the Hebrew late into the night. My community expects me to be there, to honor my commitment and my faith. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred and the everyday, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait.\n\nMy heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the laundry room and the front door, wrestling with the impossible choice between my family\u2019s needs and my religious obligations."}
