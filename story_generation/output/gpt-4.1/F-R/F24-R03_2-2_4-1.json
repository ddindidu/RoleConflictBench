My stepmother\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt means a lot to your father if you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were, especially since I\u2019d joined the family only a few years ago. They wanted me to be present, to laugh, to share stories, to belong. But as I set the phone down, Sister Maria rushed into the convent kitchen, her face pale. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down. They need help\u2014food, clothes, anything we can give. We\u2019re going over now.\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I\u2019d taken vows to serve, to be there for those in need, especially in moments like this. I could already see the Johnson children\u2019s faces, frightened and lost. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my community\u2019s call for compassion. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of my new family and the urgent need just beyond our walls, my hands trembling as I tried to decide where I truly belonged."}
