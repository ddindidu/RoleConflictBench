My granddaughter, Mai, slumped beside me, her eyes clouded with worry. I could sense her struggle, the way she twisted her fingers and avoided my gaze. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to draw her close, to share stories of my own hardships and reassure her that she would find her way. I knew she needed my presence, my words, my comfort.\n\nBut the bell rang again, a gentle reminder of my commitment to the temple. Tonight was the evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join the community, to offer my voice and presence in the shared practice. The teachings spoke of compassion and detachment, of being present for all beings, not just my family.\n\nI looked at Mai, torn between the warmth of her need and the pull of my spiritual duty. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, each calling me in a different direction. The sun dipped lower, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the choice that lay before me."}
