The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. My wife\u2019s hours had been cut, and the grocery list was growing longer. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of their expectations: to keep the lights on, to make sure there was enough for school supplies, to be the steady hand they could rely on. My phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. \u201cImam, can you meet tonight? I really need your guidance. My family is falling apart.\u201d I could hear the desperation in his voice. As an imam, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and counsel, especially in times of crisis. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to pick up an extra shift at the store\u2014a shift we needed. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my community, both expecting me to be present, both needing me now."}
