As a father, I knew I should step in\u2014teach him respect for others, remind him of discipline, set boundaries. But just an hour ago, at the church\u2019s community gathering, I\u2019d shared the story of the prodigal son, emphasizing forgiveness and understanding, urging everyone to see the heart behind the action, not just the rule broken. Now, as I watched my son\u2019s carefree joy, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I correct him sternly, as a father ought, or show the gentle patience I\u2019d just preached as a pastor? The eyes of other shoppers lingered, expecting a parent\u2019s firm hand, while my own words about grace echoed in my mind. My heart wrestled with the tension\u2014discipline or compassion, rule or relationship\u2014caught between the expectations of fatherhood and the calling of a pastor."}
