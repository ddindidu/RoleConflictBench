The school had sent a reminder: open class at 10 a.m. today. My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there in the front row. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But then, just as I was about to leave, my phone rang. It was the synagogue president. One of our oldest congregants had passed away early this morning. The family was devastated, and they needed me to officiate the funeral\u2014today, as soon as possible. I could hear the grief in their voices, the expectation that I would be there to guide them, to offer comfort and tradition in their darkest hour. My heart twisted. My daughter\u2019s face, my congregant\u2019s family, both needing me at the same time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the impossible pull of being a mother and a rabbi, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, not knowing which door to walk through."}
