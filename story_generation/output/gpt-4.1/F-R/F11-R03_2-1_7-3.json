I rose from my bed, habit already pressed and ready, but my phone buzzed with a message from my younger sister. She was upset, her words spilling out in anxious fragments\u2014she needed to talk, to feel heard, to know I respected her choices even if they differed from mine. I glanced at the clock. If I stayed to call her, I\u2019d miss the prayer service, breaking the sacred rhythm of our communal devotion. But if I left her message unanswered, I risked wounding the fragile trust we\u2019d been rebuilding, the mutual respect I\u2019d promised to nurture. My heart tugged in two directions: the quiet sanctuary of the chapel, and the urgent, messy love of family. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both vows pressing in on me, unsure which call to answer first."}
