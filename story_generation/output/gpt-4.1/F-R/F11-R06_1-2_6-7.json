My sister had just texted, inviting me to join her and her friends for dinner. She sounded excited, and I knew she wanted me there\u2014not just as her sibling, but as someone she could count on to be part of her world. We\u2019d promised each other to make more time, to include each other in our lives, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But earlier that day, I\u2019d noticed Sarah, a quiet girl from church, sitting alone in the park, her eyes red from crying. I felt a tug in my heart, remembering the teachings of Jesus about loving others, especially those who are hurting. I knew I should reach out to Sarah, maybe invite her for coffee, show her she\u2019s not alone. But if I did, I\u2019d have to cancel on my sister\u2014again. The weight of both expectations pressed on me: the desire to be a good sister, building trust and respect, and the call to be a caring Christian, reaching out in kindness. My fingers hovered over the screen, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
