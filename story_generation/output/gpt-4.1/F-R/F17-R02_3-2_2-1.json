Did you eat?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the main weekly service began. As a priest, I was expected to be present, calm, and focused, ready to lead the congregation in prayer. The sanctuary was already filling with people, their voices a low hum of anticipation. But my parents expected daily updates, and if I didn\u2019t reply soon, they\u2019d worry, maybe even call. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents had always wanted to know every detail of my day, and I\u2019d promised to keep in touch, especially since moving away. But now, as I stood in my vestments, the community\u2019s eyes turning toward me, I felt torn. Should I step aside and quickly text my parents, risking being late and seeming unprepared? Or should I silence my phone, focus on my duty, and let my parents wait, knowing they\u2019d feel neglected? My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, caught between the expectations of a devoted child and a responsible priest."}
