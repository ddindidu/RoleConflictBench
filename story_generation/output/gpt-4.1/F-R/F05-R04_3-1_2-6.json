She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I could see the weight she carried, and I wanted nothing more than to be her anchor, to reassure her that I was here, fully, for her. But my phone buzzed again. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a gentle reminder that he hoped to talk soon about his own struggles. As imam, I knew how much people depended on me for guidance, how a single conversation could mean so much. My heart pulled in two directions: the man my wife needed, and the leader my community expected. I felt the pressure mounting, the fear of letting someone down\u2014either the woman I love or the people who trust me. I stared at the phone, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
