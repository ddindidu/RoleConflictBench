We chatted about our days, and I mentioned, almost in passing, that some friends were preparing for Hajj this year. My heart ached with longing; we had been saving for years, and the time felt right. But as I glanced at my spouse, I saw the tiredness in their eyes, the unspoken worries about our finances, the house repairs, and the children\u2019s needs. I knew they expected me to share everything openly, to talk about my hopes and fears. Yet, I hesitated. If I brought up my desire to go on Hajj now, would it seem selfish? Would it add to their stress? The weight of my faith pressed on me, urging me to fulfill this sacred duty, while the bond of our marriage demanded honesty and consideration. I felt torn, caught between the call of my religion and the needs of my partner, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
