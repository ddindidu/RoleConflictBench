My sister\u2019s voice, raw and trembling, echoed in my mind from our earlier call\u2014she\u2019d just learned her partner was seriously ill. She needed me, she\u2019d said, just to talk, to cry, to not be alone. I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to listen and hold her pain with mine, as we always had since childhood.\n\nBut tonight, Mother Superior had called for a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. Attendance was expected, not just as a duty, but as a sign of our unity and faith. I could already hear the soft shuffle of habits in the hallway, the gentle summons of the chapel bell. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my sister\u2019s grief and the sacred call of my community. I pressed my phone to my chest, torn between the world I\u2019d promised to serve and the family I could never leave behind."}
