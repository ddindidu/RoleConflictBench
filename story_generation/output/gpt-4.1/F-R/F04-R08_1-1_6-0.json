My younger sister pokes her head into my room, her eyes bright. \u201cLet\u2019s go out for ice cream, just us,\u201d she says, grinning. I know she\u2019s been hoping for more time together, and I remember our parents\u2019 advice: siblings should make an effort to include each other, to build respect and closeness. I want to say yes, to be the brother she can count on.\n\nBut as she waits for my answer, I glance at the Quran on my desk. I promised myself I\u2019d spend this evening reciting and reflecting, something I\u2019ve neglected all week. As a Muslim, I know how important it is to connect with the Quran, especially when I have the time and peace to do so. The expectation weighs on me\u2014my faith calls for devotion, my family for togetherness.\n\nI feel torn, caught between the warmth of my sister\u2019s invitation and the quiet pull of my spiritual commitment. My heart aches with the pressure of choosing, knowing that either way, I\u2019ll be letting down a part of myself."}
