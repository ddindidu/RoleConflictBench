The High Holiday sermon weighed on my mind; the congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and wisdom. I could already picture the sanctuary filled with familiar faces, all waiting for my words. But just as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed. It was my stepbrother, his message short but heavy: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about finals.\u201d I knew how much this exam meant to him, how hard he\u2019d worked, and how much he needed someone to listen, to reassure him. As his step-sibling, I wanted to be there, to offer comfort and support, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But the clock ticked on, and the sermon remained unfinished. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the pulpit and toward my brother\u2019s anxiety. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of my family and my community pressing in, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
