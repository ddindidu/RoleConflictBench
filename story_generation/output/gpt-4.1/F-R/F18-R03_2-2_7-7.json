He grinned at me, eyes shining with excitement and nerves. \u201cWatch this, okay?\u201d he called. As his older sister, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014he\u2019d fallen before, and the ramp looked even rougher after last week\u2019s storm. I wanted to be there, to make sure he was safe, to cheer him on or catch him if he fell.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office: Mrs. Alvarez was waiting for me in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. The weight of her need pressed on me; I knew how much she was struggling.\n\nI stood in the doorway, torn. My brother\u2019s hopeful face, the battered ramp, the echo of Mrs. Alvarez\u2019s pain\u2014all pulling me in different directions. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the impossible stretch between the sister I\u2019d always been and the nun I\u2019d promised to become."}
