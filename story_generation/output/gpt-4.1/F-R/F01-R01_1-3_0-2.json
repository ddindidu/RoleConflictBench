I wanted to share stories, to offer the comfort of knowing that uncertainty is part of growing. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member in deep distress, asking if I could talk. Their choices weighed heavy, tangled in questions of right and wrong, and they needed my spiritual guidance now.\n\nI felt the pull in my chest. My grandson needed me to be present, to listen and reassure him with the wisdom of a grandfather. At the same time, my calling as a pastor demanded I offer counsel rooted in faith, to help someone wrestling with consequences that could change their life. Both needed me, both expected my full attention, and I could not give it to both at once. I looked at my grandson, then at my phone, my heart torn between the two worlds I was meant to hold together."}
