My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me at the school tomorrow morning. As a step-parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show him I cared, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. But just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He was desperate for a meeting, his family falling apart, and he needed my guidance as his imam. He asked if I could see him tomorrow morning, the only time he could get away from work. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My stepson needed me to be a parent, to guide him through this mistake. My community needed me to be their imam, to offer comfort and wisdom. I stared at my phone, torn, the expectations of both roles swirling in my mind, unsure how I could possibly be enough for both."}
