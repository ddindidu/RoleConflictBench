The community leaders were gathering inside, waiting for me to guide them through the intricacies of faith and scripture. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cBe present, be wise, be patient.\u201d I took a deep breath, ready to step into my role as pastor.\n\nJust then, I saw my younger brother across the street, headphones in, eyes glued to his phone, about to step off the curb. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was always the one to look out for him, to keep him safe. But inside, the church was filling with people who expected me to lead, to teach, to be the calm center of their spiritual journey. I felt torn\u2014my brother\u2019s safety or my congregation\u2019s trust. The seconds stretched, my feet rooted to the spot, my mind pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me at once."}
