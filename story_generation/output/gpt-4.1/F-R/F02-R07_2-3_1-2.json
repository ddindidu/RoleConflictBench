Today was the open class at my daughter\u2019s school\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But today was also the monastery\u2019s annual festival, the one day each year when the whole community gathered before dawn. As a committed Buddhist, I was expected to help with the preparations, to be present, to serve. The abbot had asked for volunteers, and I\u2019d agreed, knowing how important it was for the sangha. Now, as I sat at the kitchen table, I felt the weight of both promises. My daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, the trust in her voice. The gentle but firm expectation from my spiritual community. I wanted to be the father she could count on, the Buddhist who lived his values. But the clock was ticking, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to let down."}
