The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and strength from me. I was supposed to help them navigate right and wrong, to be a steady voice in their lives. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan we talk tonight?\u201d Lately, she and Dad seemed distant, and I\u2019d been checking in, asking if everything was okay at home. They never said much, but I could feel the weight in their silences. As their child, I wanted to be there, to listen, to offer comfort. But as a pastor, I was supposed to set aside my personal worries and focus on the needs of others. My mind spun between the sermon I needed to finish and the ache in my chest for my parents. I wondered if I could be both the child they needed and the pastor my congregation expected. The clock ticked, and I stared at my unfinished sermon, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which to answer first."}
