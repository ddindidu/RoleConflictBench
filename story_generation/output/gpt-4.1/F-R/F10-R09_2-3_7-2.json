My mother shuffles past, her eyes shadowed and her shoulders slumped in a way I\u2019ve never seen before. Dad sighs heavily from the living room, the weight of his day pressing down on the whole house. I know I should go to them, offer comfort, listen, be the daughter they need right now. But upstairs, my son\u2019s voice drifts down, stumbling over the Hebrew words of his Torah portion. His bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he\u2019s nowhere near ready. As a Jewish mother, I feel the pressure to guide him, to make sure he understands not just the words, but the meaning behind them\u2014the history, the values, the pride. My heart aches with the pull in both directions. I want to be present for my parents, to ease their burdens, but my son needs me too, and I can\u2019t let him down. The demands press in, and I sit frozen, torn between the roles that define me, unsure which need is greater, or how to choose."}
