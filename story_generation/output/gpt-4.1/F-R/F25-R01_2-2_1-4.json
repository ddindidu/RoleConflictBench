They expect to hear about my week, and I know it means a lot to them\u2014especially since I\u2019m not their biological child. Tonight, as I dial their number, my phone buzzes with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019s in tears, desperate for someone to talk to about her crumbling marriage. As a pastor, I\u2019m supposed to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever my community needs me. But my parents are waiting, and I can already imagine the disappointment in my mother\u2019s voice if I cancel again. My heart pounds as I stare at the two names on my screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the reliable step-child my parents hope for, but I also can\u2019t ignore the pain in Sarah\u2019s message. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I sit frozen, torn between the family I chose and the family I serve."}
