The doorbell rang, and I was surprised to see the school counselor standing outside. She explained that my stepdaughter had been caught bullying a classmate, and she needed to speak with a parent immediately. My husband was out running errands, so the responsibility fell to me. I knew as a step-parent, I was expected to attend school events and handle situations like this, to show my support and involvement. But I was dressed in loose pajamas and a t-shirt, not in the modest attire I always wore in public as a Muslim woman. I felt a wave of anxiety\u2014if I took the time to change, I might seem uncaring or unresponsive to the school\u2019s urgent request. If I went as I was, I would be compromising my religious values. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of my family role and my faith, unsure which demand to answer first."}
