My partner greeted me with a tired smile, mentioning offhandedly that work had been rough\u2014nothing major, just one of those days. I could see the fatigue in their eyes, the subtle slump in their posture. I wanted to sit beside them, listen, and offer the comfort they deserved. But my phone buzzed insistently. A message from the church council: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014right now\u2014to organize support, offer prayers, and be present for them in their crisis. My partner\u2019s voice faded into the background as I stared at the phone, torn. I felt the pull of two worlds: the quiet, steady need of the person I love, and the urgent, desperate cries of my community. My heart ached, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting for me."}
