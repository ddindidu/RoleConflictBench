Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, and I had promised to help with the preparations. As a practicing Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to support my community, especially on such an important day. But as I quietly moved around the kitchen, my mother called out, reminding me that our family\u2019s holiday breakfast was about to begin. It was a tradition\u2014one I\u2019d never missed. My parents expected me to be there, to help set the table, to laugh and share stories, to honor our family\u2019s customs. I could hear my little brother already asking where I was. My heart pounded as I looked at the clock, knowing the monks would soon be waiting for me at the monastery. I felt torn, pulled between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the spiritual commitment I\u2019d made to my Buddhist community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, unable to move toward either door."}
