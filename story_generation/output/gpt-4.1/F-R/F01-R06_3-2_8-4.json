She told me that my grandson was struggling, caught in a storm of emotions after losing his closest friend. As a grandfather, I felt the weight of responsibility to reach out, to be there for him, to offer comfort and guidance. My family expects me to keep our bonds strong, to check in, to listen. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was nearly time for Sunday service. As a Christian, I know how important it is to gather with my church family, to worship, to serve, to show my commitment to God and the community. The pastor often reminds us that our presence matters, that we are all part of the body. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my hurting grandson and toward my church. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
