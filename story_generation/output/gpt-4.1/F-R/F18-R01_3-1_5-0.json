Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, and I knew how much it meant to everyone that I be there, laughing and sharing stories like we always did. But as I scrolled, another message popped up\u2014this one from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She asked if I had time to talk, her words heavy with unspoken pain. As a pastor, I knew she needed comfort, someone to listen and offer hope. My heart twisted. My family expected me to be present, to be a sibling first, but Sarah needed her pastor. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be there for everyone, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the laughter of my family and the quiet, urgent need of someone seeking solace."}
