We had always promised to be honest about our finances, to talk through every big decision. Tonight, the air was heavy with the weight of what I needed to say. My friends were preparing for Hajj this year, and the money we\u2019d set aside was finally enough. As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj felt urgent, almost sacred\u2014an obligation I\u2019d waited years to fulfill. But my spouse\u2019s eyes were tired, worried. We\u2019d talked about using these savings for a medical procedure they needed, something that couldn\u2019t wait much longer. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides: the trust and openness my spouse deserved, and the religious duty I felt in my bones. My heart pounded as I tried to find the words, torn between the promise I made to my partner and the promise I felt to my faith."}
