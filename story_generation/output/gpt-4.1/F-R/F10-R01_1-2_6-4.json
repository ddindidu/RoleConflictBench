She wrote that her marriage was falling apart and she needed to talk\u2014tonight, if possible. I glanced across the table at my mother, who looked tired, her eyes lingering on the window. I remembered how, just last week, she\u2019d brushed off my question about how things were at home, insisting everything was fine. But I could sense something was wrong. As a daughter, I felt I should press her, offer comfort, and be present. Yet, as a pastor, I knew Mrs. Lee was waiting for me to be her anchor, to listen and guide her through her pain. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each urgent in its own way. My heart ached, torn between the quiet needs of my family and the loud cries of my community. I stared at my phone, then at my mother, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
