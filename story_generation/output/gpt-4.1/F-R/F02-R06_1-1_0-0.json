My kids would be finishing school soon, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up today. It was important to me, as their father, to be present for them, to show up when I said I would. But as I gathered my things, my phone buzzed with a message from a colleague\u2014he\u2019d made a serious mistake on a project, and if I didn\u2019t help fix it now, he could lose his job. I knew what I should do as a Christian: help someone in need, show compassion, and not turn away when someone is struggling. But if I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to my children, and I could see their disappointed faces already. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. My heart raced as I stood in the doorway, keys in hand, torn between being the father my children needed and the Christian my faith called me to be."}
