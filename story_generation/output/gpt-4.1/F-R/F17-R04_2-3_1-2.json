It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014my mother\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I promised her I\u2019d call every week, no matter what, to share how I\u2019m doing and to hear her voice. She worries if I miss even one call. But tonight, the mosque is full; a special remembrance has drawn a crowd, and everyone\u2019s eyes are on me. I\u2019m the only imam here, the only one who can lead the prayer. The congregation expects me to guide them, to be present and focused. My heart pounds as I glance at my phone, then at the waiting faces. I feel the weight of my mother\u2019s gentle expectation, her hope for a few minutes of connection, and the community\u2019s silent demand for leadership. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure from both sides squeezes my chest. I close my eyes, torn, the call still ringing in my hand."}
