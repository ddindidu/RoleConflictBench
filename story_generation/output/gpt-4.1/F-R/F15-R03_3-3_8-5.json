My daughter\u2019s laughter drifts in from the next room, a reminder of why I work so hard to keep this roof over our heads. The repayment is due in two months, and I know I need to pick up extra shifts at the clinic to make ends meet. But my phone buzzes with a message from Mother Superior: I\u2019ve been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral, a rare honor for our convent. It means days of preparation, hours spent in prayer and rehearsal, and my presence at every service. My heart swells with pride and duty, yet anxiety gnaws at me. How can I be the spiritual guide my sisters expect, when my family needs me to be present and financially secure? The weight of both worlds presses down, and I close my eyes, torn between the sacred and the everyday, between the needs of my child and the call of my faith."}
