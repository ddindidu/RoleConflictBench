My husband\u2019s work shirts are buried somewhere in there, and the kids need clean clothes for their activities tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d keep up with the laundry this week, and I know how much it means to my family when the house runs smoothly. But as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the synagogue. I\u2019m scheduled to chant Torah this morning, something I\u2019ve been preparing for weeks. It\u2019s not just a personal commitment; it\u2019s a mitzvah, a responsibility to my community and my faith. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, reminding me how important it is to show up, to honor my role as a Jewish woman. My heart pounds as I stand in the laundry room, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the call of the sanctuary. Both roles pull at me, each with its own weight of expectation, and I feel myself caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
