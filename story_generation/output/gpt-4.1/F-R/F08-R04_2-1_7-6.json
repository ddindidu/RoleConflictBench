She was so excited, and I knew she expected me to call, to listen, to celebrate with her. As a grandmother, I always tried to be present, to keep our family close, especially during these important moments. But just as I was about to dial her number, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from a community member. He wanted to talk, said he needed advice, and hoped I could spare a moment soon. As the imam, I felt the weight of his request; people relied on me for guidance, and I never wanted to let them down. My heart tugged in two directions: my family\u2019s joy and my community\u2019s needs. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in, unsure which call to make first."}
