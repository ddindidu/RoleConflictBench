My husband was bustling around, vacuuming the living room, and the scent of brisket filled the air. His parents and siblings would arrive in just a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. As a wife, I felt the weight of making our home welcoming, of sharing the load so we could both greet our guests with pride. But the clock\u2019s ticking reminded me that the synagogue service would begin soon. As a Jewish woman, I was raised to honor Shabbat by attending services, to be present in the community, even if my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed this time. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of tradition and the comfort of home. I could see my husband\u2019s tired eyes, and I knew he was counting on me. Yet, I also felt the quiet pull of the sanctuary, the familiar prayers waiting for my voice. I dried my hands, the towel heavy in my grip, and stood in the hallway, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
