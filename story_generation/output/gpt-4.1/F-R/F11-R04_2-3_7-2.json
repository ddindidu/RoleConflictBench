He was upset, frustrated over a misunderstanding with our parents, and he needed me to listen, to be the patient sister who always tried to understand and bridge our differences. I could hear the pain in his words, the expectation that I would be there for him, calm and supportive, helping him feel heard and respected.\n\nBut as I tried to comfort him, my other phone buzzed insistently. The mosque committee was calling\u2014reminding me that the congregation was waiting. Tonight was a special remembrance, and the mosque was filled with people who had come from far and wide. No one else present was authorized to lead the prayer. As the imam, I was expected to be composed, to guide the community in worship, to be present and focused.\n\nMy brother\u2019s voice wavered, \u201cCan you stay with me a little longer?\u201d At the same time, the committee\u2019s messages grew more urgent. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, torn by the weight of both expectations, feeling the pressure mount with every passing second."}
