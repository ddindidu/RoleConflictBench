She looks up and gives me a tired smile. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she says, her voice light, but I can see the tension in her shoulders. I know she doesn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, but I also know she appreciates when I sit with her, listen, and help her unwind. I want to be there for her, to show her she\u2019s not alone in the little struggles.\n\nBut tonight is also the regular Thursday service at synagogue. I\u2019ve always tried to be consistent, to honor my commitment to the community and my faith. Even though the minyan will go on without me, I feel a tug of responsibility\u2014my presence is a sign of respect, a thread in the fabric of our tradition.\n\nI stand in the hallway, coat in hand, heart pulled in two directions. Rachel\u2019s eyes meet mine, searching for reassurance, while the clock ticks closer to the start of the service. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each asking for a part of me I can\u2019t give to both at once."}
