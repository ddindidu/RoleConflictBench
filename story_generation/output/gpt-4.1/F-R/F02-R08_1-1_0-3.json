The house was filled with laughter and the smell of fresh tea. I had planned to spend the whole day like this, relaxed and at ease, since we weren\u2019t expecting any guests. Suddenly, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the kids would be finishing school early today, and I had promised to pick them up. \n\nAs a father, I knew how much it meant to them to see me waiting at the school gate, just like the other parents. But as a Muslim, I was also aware of the importance of dressing modestly in public, something I hadn\u2019t prepared for today. My mind raced: should I quickly change into more appropriate attire, risking being late and disappointing my children? Or should I rush out as I was, feeling uncomfortable and exposed, but making it on time? The conflicting demands pressed on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between my roles as a father and a Muslim."}
