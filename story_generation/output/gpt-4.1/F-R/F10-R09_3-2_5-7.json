But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was also scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue that same evening, something I had committed to weeks ago. The rabbi had emphasized the importance of showing up, of being present for the community and honoring my Jewish identity.

The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each role pulling me in a different direction. I stared at the flickering candle on the table, feeling the tension build inside me, unsure which part of myself I would have to let down."}
