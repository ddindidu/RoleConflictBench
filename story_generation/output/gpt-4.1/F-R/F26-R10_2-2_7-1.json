She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear the hope in her words, the way she wanted me to be proud. As a grandparent, I know how important it is to listen, to be present, to show her that her joys matter to me.

My faith teaches me that these rituals are not just habits, but a sacred duty, a way to honor the divine and keep peace in my home.
