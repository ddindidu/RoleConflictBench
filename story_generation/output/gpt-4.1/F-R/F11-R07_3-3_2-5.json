It was my younger brother, his voice trembling, asking if I could come over. He\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend and needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I\u2019ve always promised to be there for him, especially in moments like this. But tonight, I\u2019m also the leader of our weekly Buddhist meditation group, and everyone is counting on me to guide the session. I know how important it is to practice mindfulness and be present for the community, especially as their leader. Yet, my brother\u2019s pain pulls at me, reminding me of the bond we share and the support we\u2019ve always given each other. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the quiet sanctuary of the meditation hall and the urgent need in my brother\u2019s voice."}
