I knew I should reach out, ask what was wrong, and share my own burdens from the day. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or distracted we felt. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a church member, desperate for help. Their family was falling apart, and they needed me to listen, to guide, to be present for them right now. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the spouse who listened, who cared, who didn\u2019t let work come first. But as a pastor, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and wisdom whenever someone reached out. I looked at my spouse, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need should come first."}
