Today was Aarav\u2019s open class at school, and he had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes shining with excitement every time he mentioned showing me his art project. As a mother, I knew how important it was to be there, to sit in the front row and cheer him on. But as I prepared breakfast, my mind kept drifting to the small altar in the corner of our living room. My daily puja was more than a habit\u2014it was a promise to myself and my faith, a way to keep my heart anchored. Lately, I had been rushing through it, sometimes only whispering a mantra under my breath as I hurried out the door. Today, with the open class scheduled right after my usual prayer time, I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me. If I stayed for the full ritual, I might be late for Aarav. If I left early, I would break the rhythm of my devotion. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I stood in the kitchen, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
