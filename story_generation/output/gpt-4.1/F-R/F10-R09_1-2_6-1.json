Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. I glanced at the stack of books on the counter, the ones I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d use to teach my kids the blessings for the upcoming holiday. The festival was only days away, and I could already hear my grandmother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to pass on our traditions. My children were waiting in the living room, crayons in hand, ready for our lesson. But my parents needed me too, and I felt the weight of their unspoken worries. I wanted to be the daughter who checked in, who made sure home was a safe place. At the same time, I wanted to be the Jewish mother who kept our heritage alive. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, phone in one hand, prayer book in the other, unsure which role to answer first."}
