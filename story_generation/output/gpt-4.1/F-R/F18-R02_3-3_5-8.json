My sister\u2019s excitement about our family\u2019s holiday trip was infectious\u2014she\u2019d planned every detail, and everyone was counting on me to be there. It had been so long since we\u2019d all gathered, and I knew how much it meant to my parents, especially after the year we\u2019d had. But then, just as I was about to reply, another message came in: a parish family, desperate and apologetic, asking if I could lead a final preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament. The ceremony was in two days, and this was the only time they could manage. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be a sibling first. My parish needed me to guide, to teach, to be a priest. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed. My heart ached as I sat in silence, caught between the love of my family and the call of my vocation, unsure which path to follow."}
