My teacher had asked me to summarize the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s session, and I knew I needed to focus. The words blurred as I tried to organize my thoughts, but then I heard the front door open. My husband walked in, dropped his bag, and sighed. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he said, his voice light but tired. I looked up, seeing the faint lines of stress on his face. He didn\u2019t ask for anything, but I knew he wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just sit with him for a while. At the same time, I felt the weight of my commitment to my Buddhist practice, the responsibility to my teacher and the community. I wanted to be present for my husband, to be the supportive partner he deserved, but I also felt the pull to honor my spiritual path. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
