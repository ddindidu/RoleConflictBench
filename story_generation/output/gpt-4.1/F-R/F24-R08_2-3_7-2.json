He was determined to master a new skateboard trick, but I could see the cracks in the concrete and the way his hands trembled just a little. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014Mom always said we had to look out for each other, especially since we were still learning to be a family. I wanted to stay, to make sure he was safe, to be there if he fell.\n\nBut tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we\u2019d be discussing. As a Muslim, I was expected to come prepared, to recite and reflect thoughtfully. Missing the session or showing up unprepared would feel like letting down my faith and my community. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the study circle would start in twenty minutes. I glanced at my stepbrother, who was already rolling toward the ramp, and felt my heart twist, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
