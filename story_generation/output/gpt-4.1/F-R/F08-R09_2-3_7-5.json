My granddaughter, Sarah, beamed as she recounted her first week at her new job, her voice bright with pride. I knew how important it was to be present, to listen, to share in these moments\u2014my family expected me to be the glue that held us together, always available, always supportive. But as the platters of food were passed down the table, my heart tightened. None of the dishes had kosher certification, and I could see there would be no easy substitutions tonight. My Jewish faith was woven into every meal, every blessing, every choice I made. I felt the weight of my ancestors in the silence between bites, the expectation that I would honor our traditions, even when it was hard. I wanted to celebrate with Sarah, to show her how proud I was, but I also wanted to remain true to my beliefs. The laughter around me faded as I wrestled with the impossible choice between my family\u2019s joy and my faith\u2019s demands."}
