She wanted to share every detail, and I knew how important it was for her to feel heard and supported. As her grandmother, I always tried to be present, to offer encouragement and warmth, especially during these milestones. Just as she began telling me about her new colleagues, my other phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had arrived, devastated by a sudden loss, and was asking for me. As the imam, I was expected to provide comfort and spiritual guidance, especially in moments of crisis. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my joy and attention, and toward my community, who needed my compassion and counsel. I could hear my granddaughter\u2019s laughter in one ear, and in my mind, I pictured the tearful face waiting for me at the mosque. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the love of my family and the duty to my community."}
