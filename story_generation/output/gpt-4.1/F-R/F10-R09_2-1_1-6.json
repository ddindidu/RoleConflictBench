It\u2019s our ritual\u2014me curled up on my bed, phone pressed to my ear, listening to my mother\u2019s stories and my father\u2019s gentle reminders to eat well. They live far away, and these calls are their way of staying close, of making sure I\u2019m okay. Tonight, though, the synagogue is holding its regular service at the same time. I know my absence won\u2019t be noticed; the community is large, and one less person won\u2019t matter. But I also know what it means to be present, to show up for my faith, to be counted among those who keep tradition alive. My parents expect my call, and I can already hear the disappointment in my mother\u2019s voice if I miss it. At the same time, I feel the quiet pull of my Jewish identity, the sense of belonging that comes from standing with others in prayer. I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, heart tugged in two directions, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
