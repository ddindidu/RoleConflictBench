My stepdaughter\u2019s voice drifted in from the living room, asking if we\u2019d have enough for groceries this week. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down\u2014my family needed me to provide, to keep the lights on and food on the table. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was expected at the church to lead the daily prayer service. It was a routine gathering, not mandatory, but the congregation looked to me for spiritual guidance and consistency. I could feel the pull from both sides: my family\u2019s immediate needs, the expectation to be present and supportive at home, and my calling as a priest, to serve and shepherd my community. The demands clashed inside me, each one urgent in its own way. I closed my eyes, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
