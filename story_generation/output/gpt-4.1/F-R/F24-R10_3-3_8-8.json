My stepbrother, Raj, was beside me, his excitement barely contained as he talked about the temple rituals we\u2019d come so far to attend. I knew how important it was for me, as a Hindu, to participate fully in the ceremonies\u2014my family expected me to show devotion, to be present for every offering and prayer. But as the crowd surged forward, Raj darted ahead, not noticing the cars speeding past. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, especially since our parents trusted me to watch over him in this unfamiliar city. But if I left the festival line now, I might miss the start of the puja, disappointing my family and disrespecting the rituals. I felt torn, my feet rooted to the spot, caught between the pull of my faith and the responsibility I owed to Raj."}
