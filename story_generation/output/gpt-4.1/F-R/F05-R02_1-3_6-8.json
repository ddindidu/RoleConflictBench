I wanted to tell her everything\u2014how tired I felt, how the weight of the congregation pressed on me\u2014but I hesitated, not wanting to burden her. She expected honesty, open communication, and I could see she needed it tonight. Just as I started to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church: the Martinez family needed me to organize a last-minute, crucial preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament tomorrow. As a priest, I knew how important this was, how much the family relied on me to guide them. But as a husband, I saw the disappointment flicker in my wife\u2019s eyes as I glanced at my phone. I felt torn, the demands of my calling and my marriage pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to honor in this moment."}
