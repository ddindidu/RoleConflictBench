It was a rare chance for all of us to be together, something my parents had been hoping for. They wanted me there, laughing and sharing stories, making memories before life pulled us in different directions. But as I listened to their excitement, my mind kept drifting to something else\u2014my doctor\u2019s words echoing in my head. If I wanted to perform Hajj, this year might be my last chance. My health was unpredictable, and the journey would be demanding, but it was a pillar of my faith, something I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. My family expected me to be present, to put them first, but my heart ached with the weight of my religious duty. I felt torn, caught between the love for my family and the call of my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
