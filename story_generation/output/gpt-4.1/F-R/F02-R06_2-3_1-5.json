He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing his lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Dad?\u201d he\u2019d said, eyes wide with hope. I promised I would. But as I checked my phone, a reminder popped up: Sunday service at church, the same morning. Pastor had asked me to help with the youth group, and I knew how much the church community valued commitment. Missing a service, especially when I had a role, felt like letting them down\u2014and, in a way, letting God down too. My heart twisted as I imagined my son scanning the crowd for me, and then the church members noticing my empty seat. I wanted to be the father my son needed, present and proud. I wanted to be the Christian my faith called me to be, steadfast and involved. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both meant everything to me."}
