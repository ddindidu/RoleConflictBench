He grinned at me, confident, but I could see the nervous flicker in his eyes. As his step-sibling, I knew I should stay, watch over him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. That\u2019s what Mom would expect, and honestly, what I wanted too. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the daily prayer service at the chapel. As the priest, I was expected to be there, to lead the community in prayer, even if it was just the optional midday service. People counted on me for guidance and presence, and I\u2019d never missed one before. My heart pounded as I looked from my brother, poised to launch himself into danger, to the chapel down the street, where a handful of faithful would soon be waiting. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
