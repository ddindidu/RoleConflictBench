He told me about his fears of losing his job, his voice trembling, and I could feel the weight of his need for comfort. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him, to be the support he was asking for. But in the back of my mind, I kept glancing at the clock, thinking about the upcoming holiday\u2014Shavuot was only days away, and I still hadn\u2019t taught my little siblings the blessings or the story behind it. My mom always said it was my responsibility to pass on our Jewish traditions, to make sure the kids understood who we are and where we come from. I could see the coloring books and candles waiting on the counter, untouched. My stepdad\u2019s pain pulled at me, but so did the urgency of my family\u2019s heritage. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need was greater or how to be enough for both."}
