My father expects me to help serve food and join the prayers, just as I have every year. He believes these traditions keep our family close, and I know how much it means to him. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t read yet\u2014one that\u2019s central to understanding the teachings I\u2019ve been trying to follow. My teacher always says that true practice requires commitment and presence, not just attendance. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the warmth and duty of family, the quiet pull of spiritual growth. My heart aches as I hear my mother call my name, while my phone buzzes with a reminder from the study group. I stand in the hallway, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I choose, I will disappoint someone\u2014or perhaps, myself."}
