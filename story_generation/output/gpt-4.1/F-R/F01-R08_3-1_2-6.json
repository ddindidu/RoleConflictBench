He had come to me, voice trembling, asking for advice about a decision that could shape his future. As his grandfather, I felt the weight of his trust, the expectation to offer wisdom drawn from my years. I wanted to give him my full attention, to guide him as my own grandfather once guided me. But in the back of my mind, another weight pressed down: the unfulfilled duty of Hajj. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of this pillar, the expectation that I should strive to perform the pilgrimage as soon as I am able. Yet, my savings were meager, and every bit I set aside seemed to vanish with family needs. My heart twisted\u2014should I encourage my grandson to pursue his dreams, knowing I had not yet fulfilled my own religious obligation? Could I truly offer guidance when I myself felt incomplete? The room was silent except for his hopeful breathing, and I sat there, torn between the wisdom I owed him and the duty I owed my faith, unsure which voice to follow."}
