My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cPlease share your understanding of the teachings tomorrow. It will help everyone.\u201d I wanted to do it well, to honor the Sangha and deepen my own practice. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014school would end in twenty minutes. My children would be waiting, eyes searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like always. I pictured their faces, the way they\u2019d light up when they saw me, and the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there.

I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am. I stared at the clock, torn, the minutes slipping away as I wrestled with what to do."}
