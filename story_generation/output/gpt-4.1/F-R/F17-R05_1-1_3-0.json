My father looks at me expectantly, waiting for me to lead the blessing, a tradition passed down for generations. I feel the weight of their eyes, the unspoken hope that I will honor our family\u2019s ways. Yet, in the back of my mind, the responsibilities of my other life press in. As a rabbi, I know I should be using this quiet moment to brainstorm ideas for my upcoming Shabbat sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, and wisdom\u2014something fresh and meaningful. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at my conscience. My family expects me to be present, to uphold our traditions, but my community expects me to be prepared, to lead. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
