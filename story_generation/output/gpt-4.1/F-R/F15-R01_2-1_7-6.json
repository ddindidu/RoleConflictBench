My children\u2019s laughter echoed from the living room, a bittersweet reminder of why I worked so hard. As a parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability pressing down on me. Groceries, rent, school supplies\u2014every dollar mattered, and lately, there just hadn\u2019t been enough. \n\nLater that evening, I attended a community gathering, wearing my other hat: pastor. The room buzzed with conversation, and I found myself drawn into a discussion about honesty and trust. Instinctively, I shared a story from scripture, hoping to guide and inspire. But as I spoke, I caught sight of a few parishioners exchanging glances, perhaps expecting more from me than a casual mention. Was I doing enough to teach and uphold our faith? \n\nInside, I wrestled with the tension. My family needed me to be practical, to focus on providing. My congregation needed me to be spiritual, to lead by example. The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt torn, unsure which role to prioritize as the evening wore on."}
