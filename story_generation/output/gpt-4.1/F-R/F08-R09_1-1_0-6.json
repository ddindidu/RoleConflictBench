Her voice trembled with uncertainty as she asked, \u201cBubbe, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d She was about to start college, and she wanted my advice on how to handle the pressures she felt\u2014new friends, new responsibilities, the fear of not fitting in. I could hear the hope in her voice, the expectation that I would offer the wisdom she needed, just as my mother and grandmother had done for me.\n\nBut tonight was Shabbat, and I had promised myself, and my community, that I would attend services regularly. It was a commitment I took seriously, a way to honor my faith and stay connected to my roots. I knew the congregation would manage without me, but I also knew how much it meant to be present, to uphold tradition, to show my devotion.\n\nAs I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, I felt torn. My heart ached to be the grandmother my granddaughter needed in this moment, but my soul pulled me toward the sanctuary, to the prayers and rituals that shaped my identity. I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which path to follow."}
