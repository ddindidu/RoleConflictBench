My granddaughter, eyes red and voice trembling, reached for my hand. \u201cGrandma, I need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She poured out her heart, her words heavy with fear and confusion. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over a lifetime, to be the steady presence she needed right now.\n\nBut as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service was about to begin. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be there for my congregation, who looked to me for spiritual guidance and comfort. They would be waiting, counting on my presence and my words.\n\nMy granddaughter\u2019s grip tightened, her need for me clear and urgent. Yet, the weight of my priestly duties pressed just as hard. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me at the same moment. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
