My son, my little boy, had been caught bullying another child. The principal wanted me to come in, to talk about what happened, to show my son the right path. As a father, I knew I had to be there, to guide him, to make sure he understood kindness and responsibility. But as I stared at the calendar, I saw the reminder I\u2019d set for myself: start saving for Hajj. As a Muslim, performing the pilgrimage is a duty I\u2019ve carried in my heart since I was young. But money is tight, and every unexpected expense\u2014like missing work to attend school meetings\u2014pushes that dream further away. I felt torn, the weight of my roles pressing down on me. My son needed me now, but so did my faith. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the expectations of being a good father and a devoted Muslim, unsure which path to take first."}
