I send her a short text, promising to call soon, but the day slips away between errands and work. At the same time, I feel the weight of my faith. As a Hindu, I\u2019m expected to perform my daily puja, to light the lamp and offer prayers with devotion. But in my small apartment, I only manage to whisper a mantra under my breath, skipping the rituals that once anchored my mornings. Guilt tugs at me from both sides: my parents\u2019 longing for connection, and my own sense of spiritual neglect. I wonder if I\u2019m failing them, or myself, or both, as I stare at my phone and the unlit diya on my shelf, caught between the roles I\u2019m supposed to fulfill."}
