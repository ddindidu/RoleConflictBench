The kids miss you.\u201d I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, and I felt the familiar warmth of anticipation. But as I sat at my desk, my Bible open and notes scattered, the weight of Sunday\u2019s sermon pressed on me. The congregation was facing a difficult issue, and they needed guidance\u2014clear, thoughtful words rooted in faith. I knew they expected me to be present, to offer wisdom and comfort. Yet, my family expected me to be present in a different way: to listen, to laugh, to simply be there. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the tension growing.
