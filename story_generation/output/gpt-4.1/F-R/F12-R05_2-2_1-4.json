He\u2019s been offered a promotion, but it means uprooting everything\u2014he\u2019s anxious, vulnerable, and needs me to listen, to help him weigh the options. I want to be fully present, to hold his worries and offer the comfort he\u2019s always found in me. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class starts in twenty minutes. As the rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be there, to guide the kids through this week\u2019s parsha, to answer their questions, to be a steady source of wisdom and tradition. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my husband\u2019s hope for my support, my community\u2019s reliance on my leadership. My heart aches as I glance between him and the clock, torn by the impossible choice between being the wife he needs and the rabbi they expect."}
