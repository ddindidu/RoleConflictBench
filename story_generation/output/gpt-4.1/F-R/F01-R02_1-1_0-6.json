Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when you started something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014she needed my guidance, the kind only a grandfather could give, shaped by years of mistakes and small victories. But the clock on the wall ticked louder, reminding me that in fifteen minutes, I was expected at the parish hall to lead the planning meeting for the adult faith series. The committee relied on my presence and direction; the church expected me to shepherd the community\u2019s spiritual growth. My granddaughter\u2019s question hung in the air, fragile and urgent, while my phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached as I sat between them, torn by love and duty, unsure which path to take."}
