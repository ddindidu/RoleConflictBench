She had misunderstood something I said about her friend, and now she barely looked at me. As her brother, I knew I should talk to her, clear things up, and rebuild the respect between us. That\u2019s what our parents always taught us\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let things fester. But then, there was my friend, Raj, who was being treated unfairly by some classmates. As a Hindu, I felt a deep responsibility to stand up for what was right, to follow dharma and not turn away from injustice. The problem was, my sister was close to those classmates, and if I spoke up for Raj, it would make things even worse between us. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my duty as a brother to heal things at home, and my duty as a Hindu to act with integrity. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which path to take, torn between the expectations that seemed impossible to meet at the same time."}
