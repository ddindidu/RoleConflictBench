I knew I needed to teach her about respect and discipline, to gently but firmly correct her behavior. Just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue president: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart clenched. As a rabbi, I am expected to be present for my community in their moments of deepest need, to offer comfort and guidance. But right now, my daughter needed me to be her parent, to teach her right from wrong, to be patient and attentive. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectations of my congregation and my family colliding in this ordinary, fluorescent-lit aisle. I stood there, torn, my daughter tugging at my sleeve, my phone vibrating insistently in my pocket, unsure which call to answer first."}
