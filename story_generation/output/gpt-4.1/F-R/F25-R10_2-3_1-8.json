It\u2019s our ritual\u2014one I\u2019ve come to rely on, a thread that keeps me connected to them, even though I sometimes feel like an outsider in their home. This week, though, I\u2019m hundreds of miles away, surrounded by the vibrant chaos of the temple, the air thick with incense and the sound of bells. It\u2019s Navratri, and my relatives expect me to be present for every aarti, every offering, every meal. My phone buzzes in my pocket, the time for my weekly call slipping by as I stand in line for darshan. I know my parents will worry if I don\u2019t call, maybe even feel hurt, but stepping away now would be disrespectful to the rituals and to my extended family\u2019s expectations. My heart pounds with guilt and anxiety, torn between the duty to my parents and the sacred obligations of my faith. I clutch my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019ll disappoint tonight."}
