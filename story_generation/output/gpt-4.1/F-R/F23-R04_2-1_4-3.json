As his step-parent, I knew I should step in\u2014teach him respect for public spaces, guide him with gentle discipline, show him the values I promised his mother I\u2019d uphold. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder that I was scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in less than an hour. As the imam, the community expected me to be calm, prepared, and present, to offer wisdom and guidance from the pulpit. I knew the guest speaker could step in, but I also knew how much the congregation valued my words, especially today. My heart pounded as I watched my stepson nearly knock over a display. Should I take the time to correct him, risking being late and unprepared for the sermon? Or should I rush him along, letting this moment of teaching slip by for the sake of my other duty? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
