My younger sister, Anna, trudged in, her shoulders slumped and eyes red. She tried to slip past me, but I caught her arm gently. \u201cAnna, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, concern tightening my chest. She hesitated, then burst into tears, burying her face in my shoulder. I held her, feeling her pain, knowing she needed me to listen, to comfort her as I always had. But the chapel bell began to ring, its sound echoing down the hall\u2014a reminder of my duty as a nun to join the sisters in prayer, to uphold the discipline and devotion expected of me. My heart pulled in two directions: Anna\u2019s trembling form in my arms, and the sacred call to prayer. I stood there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which path to follow."}
