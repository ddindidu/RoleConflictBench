I promised them I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially with the school year ending soon. As I hurried down the street, I heard raised voices from a nearby shop. I saw my friend Rajesh being accused of theft by the shopkeeper, his face flushed with humiliation. I knew Rajesh well; he would never steal. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak out against injustice, and to help those in need. My heart pounded as I realized the conflict\u2014I could not be in two places at once. If I stopped to defend Rajesh, I might be late for my children, letting them down. If I walked away, I would betray my values and my friend. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of a father and the moral duty of my faith."}
