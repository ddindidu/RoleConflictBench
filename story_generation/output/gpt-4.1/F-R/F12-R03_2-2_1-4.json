He needed me\u2014my comfort, my advice, my presence. I could see the worry in his eyes, the way he searched my face for reassurance. I wanted nothing more than to hold his hand, to listen, to be the wife he needed in this moment. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the special healing service at the convent was about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to pray for the sick, to support my sisters in faith. The weight of both worlds pressed on me. My heart ached, torn between the vows I had made to God and the promises I had made to my husband. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations of both roles felt impossibly heavy. I looked at the clock, then back at my husband, feeling the storm of guilt and longing swirl inside me."}
