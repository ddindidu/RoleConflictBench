She was nervous, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her rabbi, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide her, to ensure she was ready for this life-changing step. But the message on my phone was from my brother, David: \u201cCan you come? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, to support him no matter what. But Miriam was waiting, counting on me to help her fulfill her dream. I stared at my phone, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the unspoken bond of family. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
