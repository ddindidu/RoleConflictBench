He darted away, weaving between carts, giggling as he ignored my calls. As a father, I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to correct his behavior right there, to show him respect for others and the rules. But my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from a parishioner. Their family needed me to lead a final preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament, a session I had promised to organize as their priest. The sacrament was tomorrow; this was their only chance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: my son\u2019s need for guidance, the family\u2019s need for spiritual leadership. My heart pounded as I watched my son disappear behind a display, torn between the father who must teach and the priest who must serve."}
