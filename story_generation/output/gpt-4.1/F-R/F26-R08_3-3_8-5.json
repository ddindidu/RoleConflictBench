It was my daughter, her name lighting up the screen, and I knew she was struggling. My heart ached to answer, to be the comforting presence my family expects, especially now that I know she\u2019s facing something serious. As a grandparent, I\u2019ve always tried to be there, to keep the lines of communication open, to offer advice and warmth whenever needed.\n\nBut the call came just as I was about to enter the main prayer hall for Jumu\u2019ah. I glanced down at my clothes, making sure my scarf was secure and my sleeves covered my wrists. The imam\u2019s voice echoed, reminding us of the importance of modesty and focus during prayer. I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations pressing on me: to be present, to dress and act with humility, to give my full attention to worship.\n\nMy hand hovered over my phone, torn between stepping outside to call my daughter or joining the congregation as I should. The pull between my roles\u2014my family\u2019s need for me and my duty to my faith\u2014tightened in my chest, leaving me suspended in indecision."}
