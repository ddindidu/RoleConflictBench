My younger brother nudged me, eager for my opinion on a hiking trip. I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, knowing how much my family valued these moments together. Just as I was about to share my thoughts, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I knew my presence was urgently needed. My heart tightened. My family expected me to be present, to share in our rare, joyful planning. But my community needed me too, someone was waiting, broken and seeking comfort only I could offer. I looked at my siblings, their faces bright with anticipation, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mind raced, torn between the love of my family and the duty to my community, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions."}
