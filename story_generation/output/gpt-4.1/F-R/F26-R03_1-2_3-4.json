The family gathering had been planned for weeks\u2014my daughter\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see you, Mom. The kids miss you.\u201d I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces, the warmth of their hugs, the laughter around the table. Yet, just this morning, Mother Superior announced a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. Attendance was not mandatory, but the expectation was clear: as a nun, I was to be present, to pray, to support my community in their time of need.\n\nThe weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. My family needed me, but so did my sisters. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s giggle, feel her small hand in mine, but I could also sense the solemn hush of the chapel, the collective hope in our prayers. I closed my eyes, torn between the love that bound me to my family and the devotion that anchored me to my faith. The clock ticked on, and I sat in silence, caught between two homes, two hearts, and the impossible choice before me."}
