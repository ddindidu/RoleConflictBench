He wants us to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about our finances and my recent health scare. He expects honesty, openness, and for me to be fully present, to share my fears and hopes without holding back. I know how much this matters to him, to us. But my phone buzzes with a message from my Buddhist teacher, reminding me that I promised to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I haven\u2019t started. I\u2019m supposed to spend the evening in quiet study and reflection, to prepare my mind and heart so I can share the Dharma with others. My chest tightens. I want to be the wife who listens and speaks openly, but I also want to honor my commitment to my spiritual path. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, unable to give myself fully to either role."}
