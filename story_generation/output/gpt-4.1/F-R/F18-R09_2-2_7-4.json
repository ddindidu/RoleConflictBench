He begged me to film his new trick, promising he\u2019d be careful, but I could see the nerves in his hands. As his older sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if he got hurt, it would be on me for not stopping him. But he wanted my support, my trust. My phone buzzed: Mom\u2019s reminder to eat soon, and I remembered the kosher vendor a few blocks away\u2014the only place I could eat without breaking our family\u2019s Jewish dietary rules. If I left now, I\u2019d make it before they closed, but I\u2019d have to leave my brother alone with his risky stunt. If I stayed, I\u2019d be there for him, but I\u2019d miss my chance for a kosher meal and go hungry, or worse, be forced to eat something non-kosher. My stomach twisted as I weighed my brother\u2019s safety against my commitment to our faith, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
