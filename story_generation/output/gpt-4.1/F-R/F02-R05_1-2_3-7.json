He was supposed to be learning to eat properly, to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d to listen when spoken to. As his father, I felt the weight of shaping his character, of teaching him the small lessons that would one day become the foundation of his values. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder of the bar mitzvah I was to officiate in less than an hour. The family had planned this day for months, and as their rabbi, I was expected to be present, composed, and spiritually supportive. My son looked up at me, eyes wide, waiting for my gentle correction. At the same time, I could picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to lead. My heart twisted, torn between the quiet, persistent needs of my child and the sacred responsibility awaiting me at the synagogue. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
