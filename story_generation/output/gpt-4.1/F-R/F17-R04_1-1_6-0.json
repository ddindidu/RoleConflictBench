My mother\u2019s voice from earlier echoed in my mind, her words heavy with unspoken worries. As their child, I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014always checking in, making sure they were okay, being the emotional anchor they needed. Tonight, I could sense something was off at home, and I wanted to call again, to ask if everything was truly alright.\n\nBut the clock ticked closer to prayer time. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even if it was just a handful of people tonight. Another worshipper was there, fully capable of stepping in, but tradition and duty pressed on my shoulders. The community looked to me for guidance, for consistency, for presence.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my parents, who might need me, and toward the mosque, where my absence would be noticed. I sat frozen, torn between the quiet plea of my family and the silent expectations of my congregation, unsure which call to answer first."}
