The words blurred: \u201cbullying incident.\u201d As a mother, I felt a surge of worry and shame. I was expected to meet with the principal, to show up for my child, to guide her through this mistake with love and discipline. But as I glanced at my open laptop, the half-written sermon for Shabbat stared back at me. The congregation expected wisdom, calm, and presence from their rabbi, especially this week, when so many were seeking comfort and guidance. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds: a message from the school counselor, a text from the synagogue president. I felt pulled apart, my heart heavy with the fear of failing my daughter if I focused on my duties as a rabbi, or letting down my community if I turned my attention to my family. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the mother my child needed and the rabbi my congregation expected."}
