The school wanted me to come in that afternoon for a meeting. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office. The Martinez family\u2019s child was scheduled for their first communion this weekend, and they needed me to lead a final, mandatory preparation session\u2014today, at the exact same time as the school meeting. As a priest, I was expected to guide families through these sacred milestones, to be present, reliable, and compassionate. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectations of my congregation and my family colliding. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my child and my responsibility to my parishioners, each demanding my presence, each deserving my care. I sat in my office, hands trembling, caught in the impossible space between two callings."}
