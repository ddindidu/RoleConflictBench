As a nun, I was honored to be chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral tonight\u2014a responsibility that filled me with both pride and humility. The sisters expected me to be present, to guide them in devotion, to put God\u2019s work above all else. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my younger sister, Anna. She was waiting for me at the caf\u00e9 across town, hoping we could finally talk after our last argument. She needed me to listen, to be patient, to show her that our differences didn\u2019t have to divide us. I could hear her voice in my mind, pleading for understanding, for the kind of respect only a sister could give. My heart ached as I weighed the convent\u2019s expectations against Anna\u2019s need for me. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between the sacred call of my vocation and the quiet, desperate hope of my family."}
