My younger brother\u2019s message glowed on the screen: \u201cCan we talk tonight? I think we need to clear the air.\u201d We\u2019d argued earlier, voices raised over something small that had grown into something big. As his brother, I knew I owed him honesty and patience, a chance to rebuild the trust that had frayed between us. \n\nBut just as I was about to reply, another message arrived. Sister Amina, a long-time congregant, pleaded for a private meeting. \u201cImam, I need your guidance. My family is falling apart. Please, can you see me tonight?\u201d As an imam, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and wisdom when my community needed it most. \n\nI stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother needed me to be present, to listen and heal our bond. My community needed me to guide and support them through their struggles. My heart ached, torn between the demands of family and faith, unsure which path to take first."}
