She hesitated, then began sharing her concerns about her job, her voice trembling. I listened, feeling the weight of her words, knowing she needed me to be present, to offer comfort and understanding. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I was scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in less than an hour. The guest speaker was ready and willing to step in, but I knew the congregation expected me to lead, to offer guidance and stability, especially after a difficult week in our community. My wife\u2019s hand reached for mine, her need for reassurance clear. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my congregation and the responsibility to my marriage. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, my heart caught between the pulpit and the person I loved most."}
