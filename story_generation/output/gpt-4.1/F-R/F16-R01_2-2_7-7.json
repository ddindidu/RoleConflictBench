The words blurred as I glanced at my spouse, who sat across from me, quietly stirring their tea. I could see the worry lines etched deeper than usual, and I knew I should reach out, ask what was wrong, and share my own burdens from the day. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or busy we were. But the sermon deadline loomed, and I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders. They looked to me for guidance, for clarity on how to live with integrity, and I needed to be prepared. My spouse\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for connection, while my mind raced with scripture and sermon points. I felt torn, pulled between the sacred duty to teach and the sacred trust of my marriage. The silence between us grew heavy, and I wrestled with which role needed me most in this moment, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
