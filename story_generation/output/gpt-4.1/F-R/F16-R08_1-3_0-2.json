I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way their fingers fidgeted with the hem of their shirt. I knew they needed me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe even just to sit quietly together until the stress faded. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community Quran study circle was starting in half an hour. I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we were supposed to discuss, and I felt a pang of guilt. As a Muslim, I wanted to be prepared, to contribute thoughtfully, to honor the commitment I\u2019d made to deepen my understanding of the Quran. My partner\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for reassurance, while my mind raced with the verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
