He was upset about something I\u2019d said last week, and he wanted to talk it out, to clear the air. As his sister, I knew how important it was to communicate openly, to resolve misunderstandings and rebuild the respect we\u2019d always shared. But as I looked out the window of the train, the landscape rushing by, I felt the weight of my other role pressing down on me. I was on my way to the temple, hours from home, to take part in a festival that meant everything to my family and my faith. My parents expected me to be fully present, to join every ritual and offering, to honor our traditions without distraction. My phone buzzed again, my brother\u2019s words tinged with hurt. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the duty of being a good sister, and the responsibility of being a devoted Hindu. The train rattled on, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between the people I loved and the faith that shaped me."}
