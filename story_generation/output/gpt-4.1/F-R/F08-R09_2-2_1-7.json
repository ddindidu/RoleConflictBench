I could sense the heaviness in her silence, the way she barely looked up when I called her name. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she might need, to listen and help her find her way through whatever was troubling her. But today is also the day I am scheduled to chant Torah at the synagogue\u2014a responsibility I accepted weeks ago, one that carries weight in my Jewish community. I know how important it is to be present, to honor my commitment and uphold our traditions. Yet, as I watch my granddaughter\u2019s quiet struggle, I feel torn. My heart aches to be two places at once, to fulfill both the expectations of my faith and my family. The clock ticks closer to the service, and I find myself standing in the hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
