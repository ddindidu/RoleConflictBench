Other shoppers glanced over, some with smiles, others with frowns. As a mother, I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to correct his behavior right there and then. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of another expectation\u2014responding with patience, gentleness, and love, even when I was frustrated. My mind raced with verses about kindness and self-control, but my heart pounded with embarrassment and the urge to raise my voice. I wanted to guide him, to show him right from wrong, but I also wanted to model the grace and compassion my faith calls for. The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the mother who must set boundaries and the Christian who must embody forgiveness and understanding."}
