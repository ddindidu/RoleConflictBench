The congregation expected something meaningful, something that would resonate and guide them. I felt the weight of their anticipation, the responsibility to inspire. My phone buzzed with reminders\u2014sermon topics, scriptural references, deadlines. I tried to focus, but my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of my younger brother\u2019s laughter. He darted ahead, oblivious, and stepped off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was supposed to protect him, to make sure he was safe. But my mind was still tangled in sermon ideas, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the immediate, primal urge to shout his name, to pull him back. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014one demanding spiritual leadership, the other demanding familial vigilance. I felt frozen, caught in the split second between roles, unsure which voice to heed first."}
