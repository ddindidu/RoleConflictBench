She\u2019d barely slept in days, her eyes red from crying, her voice small as she whispered her fears. I knew she needed me here, to hold her, to listen, to be the steady presence she could lean on. That was what I promised her when we married\u2014to be her support, especially now, when her world felt like it was falling apart.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. There was a funeral prayer, and they needed one more for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and the grieving family would be left without the comfort of tradition. My faith teaches me the importance of community, of being there for others in their time of need. But my wife\u2019s grip tightened, her eyes searching mine, silently pleading for me not to leave her alone.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My heart ached with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
