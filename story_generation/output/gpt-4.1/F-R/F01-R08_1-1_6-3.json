As a grandfather, I know how much it means to my children and grandchildren that I\u2019m present, warm, and approachable, sharing stories and making everyone feel at ease. They expect me to join in, to relax in the living room, maybe even wear the matching pajamas my granddaughter picked out for everyone this year. But as a Muslim, I feel the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. The pajamas are short-sleeved and a bit too snug, not quite in line with the modesty I strive to uphold. I want to honor my family\u2019s wishes, to be the loving grandfather they look up to, but I also feel the pull of my religious identity, the quiet voice reminding me of my values. The thought of disappointing either side tugs at me, and as the day approaches, I find myself torn, unsure how to reconcile these two parts of myself."}
