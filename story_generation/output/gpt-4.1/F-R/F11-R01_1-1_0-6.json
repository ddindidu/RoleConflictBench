As his sister, I felt a surge of pride and wanted nothing more than to celebrate him, to cheer the loudest and make this moment unforgettable. But as the pastor of our small community, I was also expected to guide, to gently remind everyone of the values we hold dear. When someone asked how my brother achieved so much, I instinctively began to share a parable about humility and gratitude, hoping to inspire the younger kids listening. My brother\u2019s smile faltered, and I caught the flicker of disappointment in his eyes\u2014he wanted this moment to be about him, not a lesson. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the urge to support my brother warring with the responsibility to teach. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between celebrating as a sister and guiding as a pastor, unsure which voice to let speak."}
