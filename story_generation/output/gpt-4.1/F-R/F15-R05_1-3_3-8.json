She had just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew this was a teaching moment\u2014one of those times when I needed to guide her, to help her understand kindness and patience. I took a deep breath, ready to talk her through it, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue president: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart tightened. As a rabbi, I knew how much comfort my presence and words could bring to a grieving family. But as a parent, I saw my daughter\u2019s anxious eyes, waiting for my attention and guidance. Both roles demanded my presence, my wisdom, my care\u2014right now. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, torn between my child\u2019s need for moral guidance and my community\u2019s need for spiritual leadership. I stood there, phone in hand, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
