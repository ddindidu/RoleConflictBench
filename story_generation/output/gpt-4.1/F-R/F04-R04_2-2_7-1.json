My phone buzzed with a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there for him, to listen without judgment, to show patience and understanding even when we disagreed. But just as I was about to reply, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer. I could almost feel the weight of their anticipation, the trust they placed in me to guide them in worship. My heart pounded as I stared at the two messages, torn between the duty to my brother and the responsibility to my community. Both needed me, both expected me to fulfill my role. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure build, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
