He asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the small argument I\u2019d had with my mother over the phone about attending the puja tonight. As a wife, I knew he expected me to share openly, to let him in on my worries and joys. But as a Hindu, I felt the pull of the festival outside, the sense of duty to participate, to honor my family\u2019s traditions, even if it meant stepping out alone. I glanced at the flickering lights outside, the sound of bells and laughter mingling with my husband\u2019s gentle questions. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of our home and the sacredness of the rituals. I wanted to be present for him, to talk honestly, but I also felt the weight of my heritage, the expectation to join the celebration. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
