She wanted the whole family there tonight, and I could see how much it meant to her. My daughter caught my eye, silently reminding me how rarely we all gathered like this. But my phone buzzed, and I saw a message from a church member\u2014someone in deep crisis, asking if I could meet right away. Their words hinted at despair, and I knew my guidance could make a difference in their life. My heart twisted. As a grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to be present, to cheer and laugh and make memories. As a pastor, I felt the weight of responsibility, the call to serve and support someone in need. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations, and I sat there, torn, feeling the pressure mount as the clock ticked closer to evening."}
