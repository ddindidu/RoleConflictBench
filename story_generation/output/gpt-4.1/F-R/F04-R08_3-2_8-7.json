For years, I had been saving for this moment, setting aside every spare ringgit, dreaming of standing in the holy city. This year, I finally had enough, and my friends were urging me to join them. But as I scrolled through the messages, I heard my younger sister\u2019s voice from the living room\u2014she sounded upset, again. We\u2019d been arguing a lot lately, and I knew she wanted to talk, to clear the air. As her brother, I felt responsible for building trust and respect between us, to sit down and communicate openly, just like our parents always taught us. But if I used my savings to help her with her university fees, I\u2019d have to postpone Hajj, maybe for years. My heart ached with the weight of both roles\u2014my duty as a brother, and my longing as a Muslim. I stared at the closed door, torn between answering her call and answering the call of my faith."}
