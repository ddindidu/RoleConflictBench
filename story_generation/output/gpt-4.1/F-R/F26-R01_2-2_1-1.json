I could sense her heaviness, the way she avoided my eyes. As her grandmother, I wanted to reach out, to share stories from my own youth, to offer the comfort of experience and the gentle assurance that things would get better. But before I could speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member, desperate for counsel about a life-altering decision. As their pastor, I was expected to respond with spiritual wisdom, to be present and prayerful, to guide them toward faith and hope.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My granddaughter needed my undivided attention, my warmth and understanding. Yet my congregation looked to me for spiritual leadership, especially in moments of crisis. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, the fear of failing one by choosing the other. I sat there, heart aching, caught between the needs of my family and my calling, unsure which path to take first."}
