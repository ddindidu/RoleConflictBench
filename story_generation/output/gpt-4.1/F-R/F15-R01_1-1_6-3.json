My son\u2019s hopeful eyes lingered in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been talking about that Nintendo for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it soon. Money was tight, but I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy. Just as I was about to check my bank account, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I knew she needed someone to talk to, maybe even a small gift or a visit to lift her spirits. As a pastor, I felt the weight of her loneliness, the expectation that I would be there for her, offering comfort and support. But as a parent, I felt the pull of my own family\u2019s needs, the promise I\u2019d made to my son. My heart ached as I stared at the screen, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
