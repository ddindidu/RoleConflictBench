She leaned in, her voice low, telling me about her day\u2014her boss\u2019s sharp words, the project that went sideways. I could see the tension in her shoulders, the way she twisted her napkin. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to offer comfort, to share a meal and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But as the first course arrived, my heart sank. The food looked delicious, but there was no kosher certification, and I couldn\u2019t be sure how it was prepared. My wife glanced at me, expecting me to join her, to eat and talk and be present. I felt the weight of my tradition pressing against the need to support her, the rules I\u2019d followed since childhood clashing with the simple act of sharing a meal. My stomach tightened as I tried to find the right words, torn between honoring my faith and being the partner she needed in that moment."}
