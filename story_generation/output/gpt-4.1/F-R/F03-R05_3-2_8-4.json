He spoke of his fears about retirement, the loneliness that crept in since my mother\u2019s illness worsened. I could see the vulnerability in his eyes, the unspoken plea for reassurance and comfort. As his son, I wanted nothing more than to stay, to listen, to hold his hand and remind him he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin at the synagogue. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s parsha, to answer their questions and nurture their curiosity about our faith. The parents trusted me to be present, to teach, to lead.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My father needed me now, in a way he rarely had before. Yet my students and their families depended on my presence and guidance. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the son my father needed and the rabbi my community expected."}
