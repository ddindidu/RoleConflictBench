She wants to know everything\u2014every detail, every worry, every plan. As her husband, I owe her that openness, that full transparency. But tonight is also Shabbat, and the synagogue expects my presence. I\u2019ve missed a few services lately, and though the minyan will likely be fine without me, I know my absence is noticed. My father always said, \u201cCommunity is built on showing up.\u201d I feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me, the sense of duty to my faith and my people. My wife\u2019s hand reaches for mine, her voice gentle but insistent, \u201cPlease, just talk to me.\u201d I glance at the clock, knowing the service is about to begin. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the pull between being the honest, present husband she needs and the committed Jew my community expects. The silence stretches, heavy with the choice I have yet to make."}
