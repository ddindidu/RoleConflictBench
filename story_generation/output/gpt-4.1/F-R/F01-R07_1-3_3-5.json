I feel a warm anticipation, remembering the laughter and the way my youngest clings to my hand.\n\nBut then my phone buzzes with a reminder: the weekly meditation group meets tonight. As the leader, I am expected to guide the session, set the tone, and help others find peace. The group relies on me, and I know how much these evenings mean to everyone, especially those struggling with stress.\n\nI feel a knot tighten in my chest. My family expects my full presence, my stories, my attention. My Buddhist community expects my guidance, my calm, my commitment. Both are important, both are part of who I am. I sit quietly, torn between the joy of being a grandfather and the responsibility of being a Buddhist leader, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
