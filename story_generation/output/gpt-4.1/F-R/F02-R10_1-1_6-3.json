He\u2019d worked hard all semester, and I\u2019d promised him this reward. But as I checked my bank account, I felt the familiar anxiety of stretching our budget. I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up, but I also knew I needed to be careful with our finances.\n\nAt work, I watched as a colleague quietly cut in line for a coveted project bonus. It was a small act, but it gnawed at me. As a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to speak up when I saw something wrong. Yet, if I reported him, it might create tension in the office, and I worried about risking my own position\u2014especially now, when every bit of stability mattered for my family.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of my son\u2019s hopes and my own ethical standards pressing in from both sides. My mind raced, caught between the urge to protect my family\u2019s future and the call to do what I knew was right."}
