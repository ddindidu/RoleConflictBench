She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple, asking if I had time to talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard that morning. He wanted to reflect on impermanence, to share insights and deepen our understanding together. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mother\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, her need for comfort unmistakable. But my heart also longed for the quiet space of spiritual reflection, the chance to nurture my own growth and support my friend\u2019s journey. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the son my parents needed and the Buddhist companion my friend hoped for. My mind raced, searching for a way to honor both, but the demands felt impossibly at odds."}
