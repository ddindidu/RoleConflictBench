I slipped my phone into my pocket, unfinished message to my stepmother blinking on the screen. She expected daily updates\u2014little details about my life, reassurance that I was thinking of her and my father, that I hadn\u2019t forgotten them in this new world. I knew she waited for my replies, her own messages always warm, sometimes anxious. But the convent\u2019s rules were clear: no distractions during prayer, no personal devices in the chapel. My sisters in faith expected my full presence, my voice joining theirs in song and silence. I stood in the corridor, torn. If I left my stepmother waiting, she\u2019d worry, maybe feel shut out. If I brought my phone, I\u2019d betray the trust of my community. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds, each demanding a piece of me, neither willing to let go. The bell rang again, and I stood frozen, caught between the family I was born into and the family I had chosen."}
