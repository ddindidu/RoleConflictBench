You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I know how much these evenings mean to her. She\u2019s been trying to pull me out of my shell, hoping we\u2019ll share more than just a roof. I want to be the brother she can count on, the one who shows up, laughs, and makes memories. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle. They\u2019re discussing verses I haven\u2019t read yet, and I promised myself I\u2019d be more committed\u2014reciting, reflecting, and growing in my faith.

I stare at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of me should take the lead tonight."}
