The principal\u2019s voice was tense\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate. My heart sank. As a father, I knew I needed to be there, to listen, to guide him through this mistake, and to show the school I took it seriously. I promised I\u2019d come right away.\n\nBut as I grabbed my keys, a knock sounded at the door. It was Mrs. Carter from the congregation, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As her pastor, I was expected to offer comfort, wisdom, and a listening ear, especially in moments like this.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, Bible in the other, torn between my son who needed his father and a parishioner who needed her pastor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my whole self to both at once."}
