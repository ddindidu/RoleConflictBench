She had just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew this was a moment to teach her about patience and kindness. I took a deep breath, ready to guide her through the lesson, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had just arrived, devastated by a sudden loss, and was asking for me. As an imam, I knew how much people depended on me for comfort and spiritual support in their darkest moments. But as a parent, I saw the confusion and frustration in my daughter\u2019s eyes, waiting for me to help her understand right from wrong. My heart pounded as I stood between the hallway and the kitchen, torn by the weight of both responsibilities. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides\u2014my child needing my presence and guidance, my community needing my compassion and wisdom. I hesitated, caught in the silent storm of choosing who needed me more in that moment."}
