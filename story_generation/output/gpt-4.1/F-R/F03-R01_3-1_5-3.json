I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them. As a son, I felt the weight of our family\u2019s history pressing on my shoulders, the need to honor our ancestors and not let anyone down.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, a member of my congregation. Her husband had passed away last month, and she\u2019d been struggling. She wrote, \u201cIf you have a moment, I\u2019d appreciate a call.\u201d As her pastor, I knew how much a simple check-in could mean, how my words might offer her comfort. Yet, the ceremony was about to begin, and my family was waiting for me to take my place at the front.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn between the expectations of my family and my calling to support those in need. My heart ached as I wrestled with which role to honor in this moment."}
