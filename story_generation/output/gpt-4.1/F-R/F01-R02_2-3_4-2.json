Jacob\u2019s graduation\u2014he\u2019s so proud. We\u2019re all gathering for dinner. He wants you to say a few words.\u201d My heart swelled; I\u2019ve missed too many moments already. But as I hung up, the church secretary reminded me: tonight is the Vigil, the holiest night of the year. The sanctuary will be full, the community looking to me for guidance, for tradition, for comfort. I can already picture the pews packed, the candles flickering, the expectant faces. My grandson\u2019s eyes, too, waiting for his grandfather\u2019s blessing. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s joy, my congregation\u2019s faith. Both need me, both expect me to be present, to give of myself fully. I pace the study, torn, the clock ticking toward evening, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call I can answer."}
