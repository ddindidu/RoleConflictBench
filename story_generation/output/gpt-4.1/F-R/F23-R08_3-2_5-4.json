As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and firmness. My heart pounded with the weight of responsibility\u2014how to discipline him without shaming him, how to show him that honesty matters. But as I tried to gather my thoughts, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the office function was in two hours. I remembered the dress code my boss had hinted at\u2014something \u201cfun and casual,\u201d which usually meant short sleeves and no headscarf. As a Muslim, I felt the pressure to dress modestly, to represent my faith with dignity, even if it meant standing out among my colleagues. The two worlds collided inside me: the urgent need to address my stepson\u2019s mistake, and the anxiety of facing my coworkers, possibly being judged for my appearance. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my family and my faith, and the demands of my workplace. I took a deep breath, feeling the conflict tighten in my chest, unsure which role to answer first."}
