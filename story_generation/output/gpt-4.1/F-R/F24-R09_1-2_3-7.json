My stepbrother\u2019s eyes lit up, and my mom smiled, nudging me to join in. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for all of us,\u201d she said, her voice hopeful. I wanted to say yes, to be part of this new family, to not be the odd one out. But my mind kept drifting to the Torah portion I\u2019d been practicing for weeks. This Saturday, I was supposed to chant it at synagogue\u2014a big deal for me and my community. My rabbi had reminded me how important it was to show up, to honor my commitment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to belong with my stepfamily, and the responsibility to my faith. My heart pounded as everyone looked at me, waiting for my answer, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down."}
