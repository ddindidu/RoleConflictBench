It was my sister, her voice trembling, telling me she needed me\u2014right now. She didn\u2019t say much, but I could hear the tears she was trying to hide. As her brother, I knew I should drop everything and go to her, be the shoulder she\u2019s always counted on. But in less than fifteen minutes, a member of my congregation would arrive, seeking guidance for a struggle they\u2019d finally found the courage to share. As a priest, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be the anchor in a storm. My heart ached for my sister, but my duty to my parishioner was just as real. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
