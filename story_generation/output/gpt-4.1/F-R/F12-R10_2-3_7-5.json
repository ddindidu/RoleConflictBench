He looked tired, distracted, and I knew something was weighing on him. As his wife, I wanted to reach out, to ask him about his day, to share my own worries and listen to his. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no secrets. But my mind kept circling back to what I had witnessed at work earlier: a senior colleague accepting a bribe, an act that could harm many innocent people. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and courage, no matter the cost. I felt a burning urge to report what I saw, to do what was right. But if I told my husband, I would drag him into this storm, risking his peace and maybe even his safety. My heart ached with the weight of both roles\u2014wanting to be an honest wife, wanting to be a righteous person. I stared at my plate, torn between the urge to speak and the fear of what my words might bring."}
