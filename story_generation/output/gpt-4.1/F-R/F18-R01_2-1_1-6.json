I could tell she\u2019d had a rough day, and as her sibling, I felt the urge to drop everything and just listen, to be the comforting presence she needed. But tonight was also the community gathering at church, and as the pastor, I was expected to share a story that would inspire and guide everyone, including her. I caught her eye, silently asking if she wanted to talk, but she just shook her head and disappeared into her room. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the gathering, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I stay and be the supportive sibling she needed, or fulfill my duty as pastor and teach the lesson I\u2019d prepared? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood in the hallway, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
