My father shuffled in, his eyes shadowed with fatigue. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. I wanted to ask about their day, to lighten their burden, but my phone buzzed with an email from a young couple. They were planning their wedding, asking if I could officiate next summer. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to respond promptly, to show care and commitment to my congregation. But as a step-child, I felt the pull to stay, to be the support my parents so clearly needed. My heart twisted, caught between the sacred duty to my community and the quiet, aching responsibility to my family. I stared at the screen, then at my parents, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
