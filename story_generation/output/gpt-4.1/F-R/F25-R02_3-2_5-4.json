Your father would have wanted it.\u201d The weight of family tradition pressed on my shoulders, the expectation to honor the past and show unity as a step-child in a blended family. I knew how much it meant to her, to everyone, that I step up and help preserve what little thread of tradition we still had.\n\nBut as I glanced at my phone, a message from a parishioner blinked on the screen. She had finally gathered the courage to reach out, asking for guidance with a struggle she\u2019d been carrying alone for months. As a priest, I knew my role was to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and counsel when it was needed most. Her appointment was set for the same evening as the family ceremony.\n\nMy heart pounded with the impossible choice. Family or flock? Tradition or compassion? Both sides demanded my presence, my care, my leadership. I felt torn, the expectations of step-child and priest pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
