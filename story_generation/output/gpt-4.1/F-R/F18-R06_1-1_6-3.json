I kept glancing at my phone, checking the time. Mom always said to look out for him, especially on this busy street, and I took that seriously. But today, my mind was somewhere else\u2014Sunday worship was coming up, and I hadn\u2019t been in weeks. I felt guilty, knowing how important it was to gather with others, to worship and reconnect with my faith. \n\nMy brother tugged at my sleeve, asking if we could stop for ice cream. I hesitated, thinking about how long it would take and how I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go to church this Sunday, even if it meant leaving him at home. But he was only ten, and I knew he counted on me. The thought of letting him walk alone made my stomach twist, but so did the idea of missing another service. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me as we reached the corner, unsure which path I should take."}
