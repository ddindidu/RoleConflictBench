She smiled, but I could see the strain in her eyes. I wanted to stay, to listen, to be the daughter she needed\u2014her confidant, her comfort.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. Another message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe mayor needs us at the shelter. We\u2019re short on volunteers.\u201d The hurricane had torn through our town, leaving so many with nothing. As a nun, I was expected to lead, to serve, to put the needs of the suffering first. The community was counting on me.\n\nI looked at my mother, then at the message. My chest tightened. How could I leave her when she needed me most? But how could I turn away from those desperate for help? The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the call of family and the call of faith."}
