Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the heaviness in her heart. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer gentle words, and share stories of my own struggles and how I found hope. She needed me, right now, to be her comfort and guide. But my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for Maghrib. They were counting on me to lead the prayer, to be present for the community in their spiritual need. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the quiet pain of my granddaughter and the waiting faith of my congregation. I could not be in both places at once, and the weight of both expectations pressed down on me, leaving me torn and uncertain, wishing I could split myself in two."}
