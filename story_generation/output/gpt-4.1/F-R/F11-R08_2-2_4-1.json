My mother calls me to help set the table, and my younger brother tugs at my sleeve, eager for me to join the family game after dinner. As a sister, I know how much these moments mean\u2014my presence is expected, and I want to be there, to share stories and laughter, to be part of the warmth that fills our home.\n\nBut it\u2019s Ramadan, and I\u2019m painfully aware that I\u2019ve fallen behind on my Quran reading. The midpoint has arrived, and I promised myself I\u2019d keep up, to use this month for reflection and spiritual growth. The quiet of my room calls to me, the Quran on my desk waiting for me to catch up, to recite and ponder its verses in peace.\n\nI feel torn, the weight of both expectations pressing on my chest. If I slip away to read, I\u2019ll miss the togetherness my family cherishes. If I stay, I\u2019ll fall further behind on a commitment that feels deeply personal and sacred. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, caught between the laughter from the living room and the silent call of my faith."}
