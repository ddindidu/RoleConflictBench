We had traveled for hours to reach the temple for the festival, and my family expected me to be present for every ritual, every offering. The air was thick with the scent of incense, and the sound of bells echoed from the courtyard below. My heart swelled with pride and devotion, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the small voice inside me\u2014my son\u2019s, asking if he could skip the early morning prayers to rest. As a parent, I wanted to teach him discipline, to show him the importance of respect and participation, especially in our faith. But I also saw his tired eyes, the way he struggled to keep up with the unfamiliar customs. My relatives expected me to set an example, to ensure my child followed every tradition without question. Yet, as his parent, I wondered if pushing him too hard would make him resentful, or if letting him rest would mean failing in my duty to guide him. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself torn, unsure which expectation to honor."}
