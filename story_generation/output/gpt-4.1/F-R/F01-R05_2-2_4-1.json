It\u2019s this Friday night. Everyone will be there.\u201d His words filled me with warmth and pride. I wanted nothing more than to be in the front row, cheering him on, sharing in his excitement with the rest of the family. But as he spoke, my mind drifted to the stack of notes on my desk, the unfinished sermon for Shabbat. The congregation would gather, as they always did, expecting guidance, comfort, and inspiration. They counted on me to be present, to lead them in prayer and reflection. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s joy, my community\u2019s needs. I nodded and smiled at my grandson, but inside, I felt the tension growing, torn between the love of my family and the duty to my congregation, unsure how I could possibly honor both."}
