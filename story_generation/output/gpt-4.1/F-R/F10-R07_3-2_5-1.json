I saw the hope in her eyes, the unspoken expectation that I would not let our lineage down. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the temple\u2019s memorial service was tonight, a gathering where my presence as a practicing Buddhist was not just expected, but needed. The abbot had asked me to help guide the chanting, to support grieving families. My heart pounded as I pictured my family gathered around the altar at home, waiting for me, and at the same time, the temple hall filling with people seeking comfort. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. I wanted to honor my ancestors, to be the daughter my parents raised me to be, but I also wanted to live my faith, to be there for my Buddhist community. The clock ticked on, and I stood frozen, caught between two paths, each demanding a part of me I could not give to both."}
