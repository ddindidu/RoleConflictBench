My father barely spoke at dinner, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. As their daughter, I felt the weight of their unspoken worries pressing on me, the expectation that I should be their comfort, their support, especially now when they seemed so fragile. But my phone buzzed with a message from my friend, desperate and hurt\u2014she was being blamed for something she hadn\u2019t done, and I knew it was wrong. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and defend what is right, even if it means facing uncomfortable truths. My heart twisted, torn between sitting with my parents, offering them the reassurance they needed, and rushing to my friend\u2019s side to speak out against the injustice she faced. The demands of both roles pulled at me, each urgent in its own way, and I sat frozen, caught in the storm of my own indecision."}
