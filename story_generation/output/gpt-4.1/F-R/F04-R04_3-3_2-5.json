The mosque was already filling; people had come from neighboring towns, eager to hear my words on this special occasion. As imam, I knew the community expected inspiration, guidance, and a flawless delivery. My phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, his voice trembling. He was in trouble\u2014real trouble\u2014and he needed me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. I could hear the desperation in his voice, the unspoken plea for support only a brother could give. My mind raced. If I left, I\u2019d let down hundreds who had come for the sermon. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray the bond I\u2019d always shared with my brother. The expectations of my roles pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in a storm of loyalty and duty, unable to see a way forward."}
