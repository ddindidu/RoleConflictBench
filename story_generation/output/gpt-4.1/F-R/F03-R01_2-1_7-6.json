My father barely spoke, his shoulders slumped in a way I hadn\u2019t seen before. As their son, I felt the weight of their exhaustion, the silent plea for comfort in their eyes. I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer the reassurance they needed. But just as I reached for my mother\u2019s hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the community gathering I was expected to lead as pastor. \n\nAt the gathering, I found myself sharing a story from scripture, hoping to inspire and guide those who looked to me for spiritual direction. Yet, as I spoke, my mind drifted back to my parents, alone at home, needing me not as their pastor, but as their son. The expectations pressed in from both sides: the congregation needing my guidance, my parents needing my presence. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to fulfill in this moment."}
