The incense curls in the air as I chant, my mind tracing the ancient words. As a Hindu, these rituals are my anchor, a sacred duty I have never neglected. But lately, my thoughts keep drifting. The home loan repayment is looming\u2014just two months away. I run the numbers in my head, calculating how much overtime I need to work, what expenses I can cut, how I can ensure my children never feel the weight of my worry. \n\nBut the extra hours at work mean less time for my rituals. Yesterday, I rushed through my prayers, guilt gnawing at me for not giving them the devotion they deserve. Today, I wonder if I should skip the evening offering to take on a late shift. My heart aches with the pressure: to be a good mother, to provide security, and to be a good Hindu, to honor my faith. The expectations pull me in opposite directions, and I sit in the quiet, torn, unsure which part of myself I must let down."}
