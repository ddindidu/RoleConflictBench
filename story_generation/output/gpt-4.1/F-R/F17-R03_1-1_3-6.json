The quiet was a balm, and I had been looking forward to this afternoon of spiritual reading and reflection all week. Just as I began to lose myself in prayer, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re all gathering for the family holiday dinner tonight. It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d\n\nA familiar ache settled in my chest. As a child, I was always expected to be present, to help set the table, to laugh and share stories, to honor our family\u2019s traditions. My parents and siblings counted on me, especially during these special times. But as a nun, my life was now shaped by different rhythms\u2014silence, study, and spiritual devotion. I felt torn, pulled between the warmth and noise of my family and the peace and solitude of my calling. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, heart heavy, unsure which part of myself I could honor without betraying the other."}
