My parents expect me to help set the table and join the family prayer, just as we do every holiday. It\u2019s important to them that I honor our traditions, and I know how much it means to my mother when I sing the old songs with her. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t read yet. My teacher always says that true understanding comes from regular study and reflection, and I promised myself I\u2019d be more committed. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s warmth and expectations on one side, and my own longing for spiritual growth on the other. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the voices calling me to the living room and the quiet space where my Buddhist books wait."}
