She mentioned feeling distant lately, wishing we could talk more openly, really share what was on our minds. I nodded, feeling the weight of her words, knowing how much she valued honest communication between us. But my mind kept drifting to tomorrow\u2019s Friday prayer. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, to guide the congregation with wisdom and clarity. Yet, this week, a guest speaker was ready and willing to step in if I needed. I could use that time to be present with my wife, to finally have the deep conversation she craved. But would stepping aside disappoint the community, who looked to me for leadership? My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and the people who depended on me. I stared at my hands, feeling the tension coil inside me, uncertain which role I should honor first."}
