The convent\u2019s bell would soon ring, calling all sisters to the chapel. My heart fluttered with the familiar sense of duty, the sacred rhythm of our days. But here I was, in the supermarket, with my son darting between aisles, giggling as he weaved past startled shoppers. I felt the eyes of strangers on me, expecting a parent to step in, to teach discipline and respect for others. I knew I should kneel beside him, speak softly but firmly about kindness and order, as I always tried to do. Yet, the weight of my habit on my shoulders reminded me of my other calling\u2014the expectation that I would be present, serene, and punctual for prayer, a model of devotion for my sisters. My mind raced, torn between the sacred silence of the chapel and the urgent need to guide my child. The minutes slipped away, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of motherhood and the vows I had made, my heart aching with the impossibility of being wholly present in both worlds at once."}
