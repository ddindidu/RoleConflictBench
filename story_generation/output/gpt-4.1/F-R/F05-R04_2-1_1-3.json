She was facing a difficult decision at work\u2014her boss had asked her to lead a project that could mean more time away from home. She needed me, not just as her husband, but as her confidant, her anchor. I could see the hope in her eyes, waiting for my advice, my reassurance. But as the clock ticked closer to noon, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque. I was scheduled to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. The congregation expected guidance, inspiration, and presence from their imam. Yet, today, a guest speaker was ready and willing to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved, who needed me now, and toward my community, who looked to me for spiritual leadership. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which path to take."}
