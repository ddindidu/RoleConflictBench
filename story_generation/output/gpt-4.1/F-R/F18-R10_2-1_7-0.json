He was determined to master a new skateboard trick, but I couldn\u2019t shake the worry gnawing at me. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe. I wanted to tell him to stop, to wait until the ramp was fixed, but I knew how much this meant to him.\n\nAt the same time, I felt the weight of my own expectations. As a Hindu, I was supposed to perform my daily rituals with devotion, but lately, I\u2019d only managed to quietly repeat a short mantra under my breath, skipping the full puja. Guilt pressed on me from both sides\u2014my brother\u2019s hopeful glance, the memory of my mother\u2019s gentle reminders about our faith. I stood there, torn, feeling the pressure of being a good sibling and a good Hindu, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
