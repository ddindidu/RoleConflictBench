My sister excitedly suggested a weekend trip to the amusement park, and everyone looked to me for my thoughts. I knew how much these moments meant to my family, especially to my younger brother, who always wanted me to join in. Just as I was about to agree, my phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: someone at work had cut in line for a coveted project, bypassing the fair process. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness and fairness\u2014even in small matters. I felt a tug inside, knowing I should speak up about the incident at work, but doing so might mean missing out on the family outing or bringing stress into our plans. The expectation to be a present, supportive brother clashed with my inner urge to act ethically. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s anticipation and the quiet voice of conscience urging me to do what was right."}
