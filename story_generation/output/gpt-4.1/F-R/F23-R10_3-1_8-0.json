The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow. As a step-parent, I know I must keep this family secure, make sure my partner\u2019s child never feels the uncertainty I once did. Every rupee counts, every decision matters. Yet, as the clock ticks toward dawn, I realize I haven\u2019t performed my daily puja. I whisper a short mantra under my breath, hoping it\u2019s enough, but guilt gnaws at me. My faith asks for more\u2014a full ritual, incense, water, the gentle ring of the bell. But time slips away, and the weight of financial responsibility presses harder. I want to honor my beliefs, to show my stepchild the strength of tradition, but I can\u2019t ignore the practical demands. My heart aches, torn between the need to provide and the longing to connect with the divine, unsure which duty should come first."}
