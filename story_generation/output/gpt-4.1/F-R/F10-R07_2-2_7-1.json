My parents have been quieter than usual, their faces drawn and voices heavy with fatigue. As their daughter, I know I should stay home, listen to them, maybe make tea and offer comfort. They rarely ask for help, but tonight their need is clear in the way my mother sighs and my father rubs his temples. At the same time, the temple is holding a memorial service, and as a practicing Buddhist, I am expected to attend. The community relies on everyone\u2019s presence, especially for such important ceremonies. I know my absence will be noticed, and I feel a responsibility to support the sangha, to honor the rituals that have shaped my beliefs. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the quiet suffering of my parents and the collective spirit of my Buddhist community. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
