This Saturday, my children and grandchildren would fill my home with laughter and stories\u2014a rare family gathering I had promised not to miss. My daughter had already texted, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see you, Mom!\u201d I could almost hear my youngest grandchild\u2019s giggle, feel her small hand in mine. Yet, as I set the table, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Shabbat service preparation. As the rabbi, my congregation depended on me for guidance, for a sermon that would uplift and inspire. I knew several members were struggling this week, and my words could offer comfort. The expectation was clear: I must be present, prepared, and fully engaged. But how could I be in two places at once? My family needed me, but so did my community. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest, and I found myself standing in the kitchen, torn, unable to move, wrestling with the impossible choice between the people I love and the people who look to me for spiritual leadership."}
