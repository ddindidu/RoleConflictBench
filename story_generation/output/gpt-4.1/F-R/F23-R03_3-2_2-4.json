My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in and discuss it, and Ethan needed me\u2014he needed guidance, compassion, and maybe even forgiveness. As his stepmother, I was expected to show up, to be present at school events, to help him learn from his mistakes. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the special healing service at the convent tonight. Sister Agnes was gravely ill, and the Mother Superior had asked all of us to attend, to pray together for her recovery. It was a rare, urgent call\u2014one that I, as a nun, was expected to honor without question. My mind raced, torn between the child who needed me and the community that depended on my devotion. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, my care, my faith. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decided, a part of me would be left behind."}
