My teacher had asked me to summarize the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, and I wanted to do it justice. But as I tried to focus, I heard my stepmother\u2019s voice from the living room\u2014soft, but with that familiar edge of worry. I knew my dad had been working late again, and things felt tense at home. I remembered how I promised myself to check in on them, to be the kind of step-child who offered support, not distance. I wanted to ask if everything was okay, to listen if they needed to talk. But the words of the Buddha swirled in my mind, and I felt the weight of my teacher\u2019s trust. If I left my studies now, I might not finish in time. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring the people who needed me most. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat frozen, torn between the quiet call of the Dharma and the unspoken needs of my family."}
