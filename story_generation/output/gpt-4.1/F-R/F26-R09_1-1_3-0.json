My daughter has been reminding me all week how much the kids are looking forward to baking challah together and hearing my stories. I know how important these moments are; I want to be the grandparent who is present, who makes memories, who listens and laughs and hugs.\n\nBut then I remember that Sunday is also the time I set aside for our weekly Jewish study with my grandchildren. It\u2019s the one hour we dedicate to learning about our traditions, our history, the values that have shaped our family for generations. I promised myself I\u2019d be the one to pass these lessons on, to make sure they know where they come from.\n\nI feel the tension rising in my chest. If I move the study, will it lose its rhythm, its importance? If I skip the gathering, will I miss a moment I can\u2019t get back? Both roles pull at me, each with its own weight of love and responsibility. I sit at the kitchen table, torn, the calendar open in front of me, unsure which promise to keep."}
