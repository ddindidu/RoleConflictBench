The grandchildren have been looking forward to it all week, and I know how much it means to them when I\u2019m there\u2014listening to their stories, sharing laughter, and simply being present. Yet, as I glance at the calendar, my heart tightens. Tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and this week\u2019s chapter is one I have not yet explored. The group relies on each member\u2019s presence and insight, and I feel a deep responsibility to my own spiritual growth and to the community that supports it.\n\nI sit quietly, torn. My family expects warmth, attention, and togetherness, especially from me as their grandparent. At the same time, my Buddhist path calls for commitment, reflection, and the discipline of regular study. The two worlds pull at me, each with its own gentle but insistent hand. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, uncertain which path to follow tonight."}
