As a step-parent, I felt the weight of every rupee spent, every meal planned, every school fee looming. My partner trusted me to keep our family afloat, and the children\u2014though not my own by blood\u2014looked to me for stability. Today, the grocery list in my pocket felt like a test I might fail.\n\nAs I passed the temple, the air shimmered with the colors of the festival. Marigold garlands, the scent of incense, the sound of bells\u2014my heart ached with longing. As a Hindu, these festivals were more than tradition; they were a lifeline to my roots, a way to honor my ancestors and the gods. I paused, watching families gather, their faces lit with joy and devotion. I wanted to join, to offer sweets and prayers, to feel the warmth of community.\n\nBut I knew the cost. Even a small offering or a box of sweets would mean less for groceries, less for the children. My roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood on the street, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
