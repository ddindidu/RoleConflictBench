My spouse sits across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about the future we keep promising each other. I know I owe honesty, vulnerability, and the courage to admit my fears. But my phone vibrates again. It\u2019s a message from a church member, desperate for guidance. Their crisis is urgent, their choices heavy with consequence, and I am their pastor\u2014the one they trust to listen, to offer wisdom, to be present in their darkest hour.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My spouse\u2019s expectation for openness tugs at my heart, demanding my full attention and truth. At the same time, the call to shepherd someone through spiritual turmoil feels just as immediate, just as sacred. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give both the depth they deserve. My chest tightens as I sit between these two lives, torn by love and duty, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left waiting."}
