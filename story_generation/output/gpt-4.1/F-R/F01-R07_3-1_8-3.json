My phone buzzed on the table, a sharp interruption to the silence I had carved out for my daily meditation. I had promised myself these ten minutes\u2014just ten minutes\u2014to practice mindfulness, to let go of the world\u2019s noise and be present. But the message on my phone was from my daughter. She rarely called this early. My heart tightened as I read her words: my grandson was struggling, and she needed to talk.\n\nAs a grandfather, I felt the pull to respond immediately, to be the steady presence my family expected, especially in times of crisis. Yet, as a Buddhist, I knew the importance of honoring my commitment to meditation, to cultivate the calm and clarity I so often tried to share with them. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way. I stared at the phone, torn between the quiet I sought and the comfort I was expected to give, my mind wrestling with the weight of both expectations."}
