My sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, her excitement about the family\u2019s holiday trip next weekend. \u201cYou have to come,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I wanted to be there, to laugh with them, to be the sibling who shows up, who cares. But as I looked at my notes for the High Holiday sermon, anxiety twisted inside me. The congregation was counting on me to deliver a message that would guide and inspire them. The service was scheduled for the same weekend as the family trip. I could already hear the disappointment in my sister\u2019s voice if I said no, and I could feel the weight of my community\u2019s expectations if I didn\u2019t prepare and deliver the sermon. Both sides needed me, both sides expected me to be present, to give my all. I sat at my desk, torn, the demands of family and faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I could bear to let down."}
