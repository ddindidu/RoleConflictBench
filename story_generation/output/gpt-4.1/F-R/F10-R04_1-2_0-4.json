My mother\u2019s message blinked at me: \u201cAre you coming home this weekend?\u201d I hadn\u2019t replied to her last text, and guilt pricked at me. She always said, \u201cJust let us know you\u2019re okay.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her, especially since I moved out. But my mind was already tangled with the sermon I had to deliver tomorrow. The community had been waiting for this topic\u2014my name was on the flyers, and people had told me how much they were looking forward to it. I was the only imam scheduled, and there was no one to cover for me. I felt the weight of their expectations, the responsibility to guide and inspire. Yet, my parents\u2019 quiet hope for a call or a visit pressed on me just as hard. I wanted to be a good daughter, to reassure them, but I also couldn\u2019t let my congregation down. My heart twisted as I sat between the two worlds, phone in hand, unable to move."}
