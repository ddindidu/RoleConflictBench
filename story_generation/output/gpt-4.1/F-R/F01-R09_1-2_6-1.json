As a grandfather, I know how important it is to keep the family close, to call my grandchildren, to listen to their stories, and to make sure everyone feels connected. But this year, the holiday is also one of our most significant Jewish celebrations, and I realize with a pang of guilt that my grandchildren still haven\u2019t learned the blessings they\u2019ll need to recite. I feel the weight of my responsibility\u2014not just to be present and loving, but to pass on our traditions, to teach them the words and meanings that have shaped our family for generations. I worry that if I push too hard, I\u2019ll spoil the joy of our reunion, but if I let it go, I\u2019ll be failing in my duty as a Jewish elder. The expectations pull at me from both sides, and I sit at my kitchen table, phone in hand, heart heavy, unsure which role I must honor first."}
