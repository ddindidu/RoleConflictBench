My parents have been planning a small celebration at home, and she\u2019s been texting me all week, asking if I\u2019ll be there to take photos and cheer her on. As her brother, I know how much this means to her\u2014she\u2019s worked so hard, and I promised I\u2019d be there to celebrate her achievement.\n\nBut earlier today, the abbot at our temple reminded me that tonight is the annual community memorial service. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to attend, help set up, and chant with the sangha. The service is important, honoring those who have passed, and the community relies on everyone\u2019s participation, especially those of us who are regulars.\n\nI sit in my room, my phone buzzing with messages from my family and a reminder from the temple group chat. My heart feels pulled in two directions\u2014toward my sister, who needs her brother\u2019s support, and toward my Buddhist community, who expects my presence and commitment. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which path to take tonight."}
