She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear my grandson giggling in the background. As a grandmother, I know how much it means to be present, to listen, to celebrate these milestones with my family. They expect me to be there, to offer encouragement and love, especially now when everything feels new and uncertain for her.\n\nBut just as I was about to call her back, Sister Maria knocked on my door. The neighboring family\u2019s house had burned down last night, and our convent was organizing immediate relief\u2014sorting clothes, preparing meals, comforting the children. As a nun, my community expects me to put service first, to be a source of compassion and help in times of crisis.\n\nI stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, habit in the other, torn between the warmth of my family and the urgent needs of my neighbors. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds, each calling me in a different direction, each expecting me to be fully present."}
