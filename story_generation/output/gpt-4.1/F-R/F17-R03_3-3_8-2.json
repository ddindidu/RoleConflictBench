She looked at me, her eyes pleading for comfort, for the steady presence I\u2019d always tried to be. I wanted to hold her, to promise I\u2019d stay by her side, to listen for as long as she needed. But my phone buzzed again. The mayor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind from earlier: \u201cSister, we need you. The hurricane\u2019s left so many with nothing. You\u2019re the only one who can organize the relief.\u201d The convent was already bustling with preparations, and I knew my sisters were counting on me. My heart ached, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the nun my community depended on. I could see the exhaustion in my mother\u2019s face, feel the weight of her hope resting on my shoulders, even as the cries of the homeless outside pressed in on my conscience. I closed my eyes, caught between the warmth of home and the call to serve, not knowing which need was greater or how to choose."}
