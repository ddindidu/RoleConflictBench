My wife\u2019s voice floated in, reminding me that her parents would arrive in a few hours, and the house still needed dusting, the guest room sheets changed, and the table set. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation\u2014this was our home, our shared responsibility, and she counted on me to help make it welcoming.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again, a message from my Buddhist teacher: \u201cPlease prepare a summary of the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s session.\u201d I had promised to reflect deeply, to offer something meaningful to the sangha. The teachings deserved my full attention, quiet contemplation, and careful words. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized there was no way to do both well. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the peace of spiritual study and the warmth of partnership. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the calm I sought and the support I owed. I stood there, mop in hand, unable to move, caught between these two worlds."}
