Dad misses you.\u201d I knew what she meant\u2014she wanted me to check in, to be present, to show I cared. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d do better, that I\u2019d be the kind of stepchild who didn\u2019t let weeks slip by in silence. But this weekend was different. The church was already buzzing with preparations for the most significant holiday of the year. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be the calm center for hundreds of people seeking comfort and meaning. My congregation needed me, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down. I wanted to be there for my family, to send that text, maybe even call, but every moment away from the church felt like a betrayal of my calling. My heart twisted as I tried to reconcile the two worlds, each demanding a piece of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
