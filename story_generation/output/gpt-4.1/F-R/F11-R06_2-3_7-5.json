He looked up, eyes tired, and asked if I could stay home with him. He\u2019d had a rough week at school, and I knew he needed someone to talk to, someone to just be there. As his sister, I wanted to show him patience, to listen and help him feel understood, like our parents always hoped we would for each other.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service in an hour. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, not just to worship but to help with the youth group and join the community lunch afterward. Missing a service felt like letting down my church family and my own faith commitments.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My brother\u2019s quiet plea for support clashed with the call to be present at church. I wanted to honor both, but I could already feel the disappointment that would come from whichever choice I made. My heart ached as I sat there, caught between being the sister he needed and the Christian I was called to be."}
