He clung to my arm, his steps uncertain, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014my promise to our parents to keep him safe, to be the steady hand he needed. My phone buzzed again. Another message from Sister Agnes: \u201cWe need you at the shelter. The mayor is counting on us. Please come as soon as you can.\u201d I could picture the gymnasium crowded with frightened faces, the cots lined up, the desperate need for food and comfort. My heart ached to be there, to serve as I\u2019d vowed when I took my habit. But my brother\u2019s hand tightened in mine, and I saw the fear in his eyes as we passed a downed power line. I was torn\u2014my duty to my family pulling me one way, my calling to serve the suffering pulling me another. Each step home felt heavier, the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
