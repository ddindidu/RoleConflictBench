She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to share, to be open as a good husband should, but my mind was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, as I was locking up the mosque, a young man burst in, his face streaked with tears. He needed me\u2014not as a friend, but as his imam. He spoke of a loss so deep it shook me, and I could see he was desperate for guidance, for someone to help him find meaning in his pain. My wife\u2019s gentle voice pulled me back to our kitchen. She deserved my honesty, my presence, but the weight of the young man\u2019s sorrow pressed on me. I felt torn, caught between the duty to my community and the promise I made to my wife to always be open with her. The words caught in my throat, and I sat there, wrestling with which role needed me more in that moment."}
