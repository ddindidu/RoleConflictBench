Her eyes sparkled with excitement, and I promised I\u2019d be there. As a mother, I know how much these moments mean to her, how she looks for me in the crowd, hoping to see my smile and encouragement. But as I ironed my abaya, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the office function is this afternoon. It\u2019s a big event, with colleagues and managers from all departments, and the dress code is business formal. I know from past experience that my modest attire stands out, and I\u2019ve overheard whispers and seen the glances. There\u2019s an unspoken pressure to blend in, to wear a suit or a dress that fits their expectations. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my daughter\u2019s need for my presence, and my responsibility to represent myself and my faith with dignity at work. My heart aches as I stand in front of my closet, torn between the two roles that define me, unsure how to honor both without letting one down."}
