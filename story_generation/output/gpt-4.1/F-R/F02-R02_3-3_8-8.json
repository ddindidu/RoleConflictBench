The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow. As a father, I knew I had to find a way to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. Every spare hour should be spent planning, maybe picking up extra work, tightening our budget, anything to keep us secure. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the parish council. The Martinez family needed me to organize a final, mandatory preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament, and it had to be this week. As a priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present, to lead the children and adults in their faith. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me to focus on our future, but my parishioners needed me now. My heart ached as I stared at the calendar, the two commitments colliding, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
