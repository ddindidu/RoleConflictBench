I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every Friday, to hear about their week and share a treat on the walk home. As I gathered my things, a gentle knock sounded at my door. It was Mrs. Evans, her eyes red-rimmed and voice trembling. She needed to talk, she said, about her son\u2019s troubles and the weight she\u2019d been carrying alone. I saw the desperation in her face, the silent plea for comfort and guidance. My heart pulled in two directions: my children\u2019s eager faces at the school gate, and this woman\u2019s need for a listening ear and pastoral care. I felt the pressure of both roles\u2014my children\u2019s expectation of a present, loving mother, and my congregation\u2019s need for a compassionate, available pastor. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my children and the duty I felt to support Mrs. Evans in her moment of vulnerability."}
