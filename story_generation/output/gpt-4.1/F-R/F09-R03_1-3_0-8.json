My children will be waiting, eyes searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019ll be there to walk them home and hear about their day. I promised them I would be. But this morning, Mother Superior called me aside, her voice gentle but firm. She needs me to lead the daily reflections for the retreat\u2014starting today. The sisters are counting on me to guide them, to be present, focused, and spiritually prepared. I feel the weight of their expectations, the sacredness of the task. Yet, my heart aches for my children, for the simple joy of holding their hands and listening to their laughter. I stand in the quiet corridor, torn between the chapel and the school gates, between the call of my faith and the call of my children. My hands tremble as I clutch my rosary, praying for guidance, feeling the pull of both worlds, knowing I cannot be in two places at once."}
