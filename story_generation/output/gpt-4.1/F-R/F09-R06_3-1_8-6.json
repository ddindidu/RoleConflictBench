As a mother, I knew I had to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. Every dollar counted, and I\u2019d been cutting corners wherever I could\u2014no more takeout, fewer treats for the kids, and even skipping my own morning coffee. The anxiety gnawed at me, especially as the due date crept closer.\n\nBut today, as I left the grocery store, I saw an elderly woman struggling with her bags. My heart, shaped by my faith, urged me to help. I remembered Jesus\u2019 teachings\u2014show love and kindness, even in small ways. I wanted to offer her a ride home, maybe even buy her a few extra groceries. But the thought of spending even a little more money made my stomach twist. Could I really afford to be generous right now? The expectations of being a good Christian and a responsible mother clashed inside me, leaving me frozen on the sidewalk, torn between compassion and caution."}
