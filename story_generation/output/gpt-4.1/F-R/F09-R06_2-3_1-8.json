She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I would be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. That morning, as I was getting ready, my phone buzzed with a message from the church group: Mrs. Evans, an elderly neighbor, had fallen and was alone at the hospital. They needed someone to sit with her, to show her the love and kindness we\u2019re called to as Christians. My heart twisted. I could picture my daughter\u2019s hopeful face, scanning the crowd for me, and I could also imagine Mrs. Evans, frightened and alone, needing comfort. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my child\u2019s need for her mother\u2019s presence, and my faith\u2019s call to serve others in their time of need. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
