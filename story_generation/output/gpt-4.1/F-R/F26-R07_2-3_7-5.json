She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear my grandson giggling in the background. As a grandparent, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, to celebrate these moments with my family. They expect me to be there, to offer encouragement and warmth, especially now when everything feels new and uncertain for her.\n\nBut today is also the day I lead the weekly meditation group at the temple. As a Buddhist, I am committed to guiding others in mindfulness, helping them find peace and clarity. The group relies on me to be calm, centered, and fully present. The session starts in just a few minutes, and I am supposed to set an example, to embody the very teachings I share.\n\nMy phone buzzes again\u2014my daughter wants to video call so I can see her new office. My heart tugs in two directions. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be wholly theirs. I close my eyes, feeling the tension rise, unsure which path to take."}
