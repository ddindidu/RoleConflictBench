It was our first holiday together as a blended family, and she wanted it to be perfect. My stepbrother nudged me, grinning, and I tried to match his enthusiasm, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation, flashed on the screen: \u201cCan you talk? I really need some guidance.\u201d I glanced at my father, who was carving the turkey, and at my step-siblings, laughing and sharing stories. I knew how much this day meant to them, how much they wanted me to be present, to belong. But I also knew Mrs. Carter was struggling, and as her pastor, I felt responsible for her well-being. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my new family and the quiet plea for help from someone who trusted me. The laughter around me faded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
