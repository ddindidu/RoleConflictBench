My step-sister, Anna, trudged in, her shoulders slumped and eyes red. I could see she\u2019d been crying. Instinctively, I wanted to go to her, to sit beside her on the worn couch and listen, as I always had since our families blended. She needed me\u2014she always said I was the only one who understood her when things got rough at school. But the chapel bell tolled, echoing through the halls, a reminder of my commitment as a nun. The community expected me to be present, to join in the sacred rhythm of prayer that shaped our days. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of Anna\u2019s need and the solemn call of my vocation. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in opposite directions."}
