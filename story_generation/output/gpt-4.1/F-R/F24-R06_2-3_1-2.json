He barely looked up as I sat beside him. I knew something was wrong\u2014he never let his guard down like this unless he was really hurting. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of expectation: I should be there for him, listen, and support him no matter what. He finally spoke, voice trembling, and told me about a fight at school. He\u2019d lied to the principal to protect a friend, but now someone else was being blamed.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a Christian, I was taught to value honesty and integrity, to do what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s hard. But as his sibling, I wanted to shield him, to comfort him and help him feel safe. He looked at me, searching for advice, and I could see the fear in his eyes. I felt torn\u2014should I encourage him to confess, risking his trust and our bond, or help him keep the secret, betraying my own values? The silence between us grew heavy as I wrestled with what to say."}
