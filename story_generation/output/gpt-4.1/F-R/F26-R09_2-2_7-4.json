My granddaughter had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her updates\u2014her excitement was contagious, and I knew everyone expected me to call and share in her joy. I wanted to, more than anything. But my stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. The only food vendor nearby was the little kosher stand, and the line was already long. If I waited, I\u2019d miss the window to call before she went into her next meeting. If I called now, I\u2019d lose my place and might not get a meal that fit my dietary needs for hours. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the loving grandparent, always present and supportive, and the observant Jew, committed to keeping kosher no matter where I was. My fingers hovered over my phone, my heart torn between the warmth of family connection and the quiet strength of tradition."}
