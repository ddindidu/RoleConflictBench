My father smiled, eager for me to join the family in our annual tradition of reciting stories and prayers together. This was a moment they cherished, a thread tying us to our roots. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque: the regular imam was unwell, and though another worshipper could lead, the congregation hoped I would step in for the evening prayer. I could hear my younger siblings laughing in the next room, waiting for me to start the family recitation. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014my parents\u2019 eyes full of hope, the community\u2019s quiet expectation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am. I closed my eyes, torn between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and fulfilling my duty as an imam, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
