My children would be finishing school in half an hour, and I had promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like every other day. Their faces always lit up when they spotted me, and I cherished those moments. But today was also the day of my cousin\u2019s puja, a family ceremony that everyone expected me to attend. My mother-in-law had called twice already, reminding me to wear my saree and arrive early to help with the preparations. The thought of disappointing my family weighed heavily on me, but so did the idea of my children waiting, scanning the crowd for me, only to find I wasn\u2019t there. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the sacred rituals of my faith and the everyday rituals of motherhood, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
