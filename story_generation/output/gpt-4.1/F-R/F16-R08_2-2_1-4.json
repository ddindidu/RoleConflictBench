They told me about a difficult choice at work, their voice trembling as they asked for my advice. I wanted to be there for them, to listen and offer the comfort they needed. But my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It\u2019s a big event, and my colleagues\u2014men and women\u2014will all be there. I know the expectation: to dress up, to blend in, to look professional. But as a Muslim, I feel the weight of my faith\u2019s guidelines, the need to dress modestly, to represent my beliefs with integrity. My partner needs my full attention, my support, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about what I\u2019ll wear, how I\u2019ll be seen, and whether I\u2019ll be judged for my choices. The pressure from both sides presses in, and I feel torn, caught between being the supportive spouse my partner needs and staying true to my religious values."}
