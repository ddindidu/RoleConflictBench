She expects it, and I know she waits for my updates, especially now that I live far from home. My phone buzzed with her reply, full of questions about my day and reminders to eat well. I started typing a response, but my mind was already drifting to the preparations for the festival. As a priest, today is the most important day of the year\u2014our temple will be overflowing, and everyone expects me to lead the prayers, to be present, calm, and focused.\n\nMy phone vibrated again. Another message from my mother, asking if I could call her before the ceremony. I glanced at the clock. The community was already gathering, and I needed to be in the sanctuary, setting the altar, greeting elders, reciting the opening prayers. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the attentive child my parents cherished, but the weight of my priestly duties pressed down on me. I stared at my phone, torn between the gentle pull of family and the solemn call of my faith, feeling the tension tighten inside me as the minutes slipped away."}
