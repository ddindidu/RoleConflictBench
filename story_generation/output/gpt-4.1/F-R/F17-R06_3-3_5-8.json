But as I nodded, my mind drifted to my friend Sam, who had just lost his father. He wasn\u2019t part of our faith, and he\u2019d asked if I could be with him that same evening, saying he needed someone to talk to. I remembered the words from church: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d My heart ached, torn between honoring my family\u2019s expectations and being there for Sam in his pain.

I stared at the floor, feeling the conflict twist inside me, unsure which path I should take."}
