We\u2019re all gathering for lunch to celebrate. He wants you there.\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014my grandson\u2019s first big achievement, and he wanted his grandfather by his side. I promised I\u2019d try my best. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. The mosque committee reminded me of my duty: the Friday Khutbah. The congregation expects guidance, and I know how much they look forward to my words. Yet, this week, we have a guest scholar visiting, ready to step in if needed. \n\nI sat at my desk, torn. My family\u2019s joy, my grandson\u2019s shining eyes, the warmth of togetherness\u2014how could I miss that? But the community, too, relies on me for spiritual leadership. If I step aside, will they feel let down? Will my absence at home leave a shadow on Ahmed\u2019s special day? The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I found myself caught between the pulpit and the family table, unsure which path to take."}
