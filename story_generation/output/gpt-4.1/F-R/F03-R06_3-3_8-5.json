My father sat beside her, silent but clearly weighed down. They looked to me, their only child, for comfort and understanding. I could see the hope in their eyes, the silent plea for me to stay and help them through this difficult time. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the church service, and I was expected to be there, not just to worship but to help set up and lead the youth group. My pastor had emphasized the importance of commitment, and I knew the community counted on me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my parents needing their son, my church needing a devoted Christian. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
