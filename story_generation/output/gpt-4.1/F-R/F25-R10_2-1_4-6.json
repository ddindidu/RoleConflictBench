The festival of Holi was in full swing, and I paused, drawn to the vibrant colors and laughter. As a Hindu, I felt a pull to join in, to smear colors on my cheeks and chant with the others. But I remembered my stepmother\u2019s words that morning\u2014how important it was to respect our family\u2019s traditions, which didn\u2019t include public celebrations or mixing with crowds. She wanted us to keep to ourselves, to honor the quiet customs she\u2019d grown up with. I stood at the edge of the festivities, torn. My heart ached to be part of the joy, to feel connected to my faith, but I also wanted to prove to my new family that I respected their wishes. The music grew louder, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
