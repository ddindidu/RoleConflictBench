He had just confided in me about his fears of losing his job, his voice trembling in a way I\u2019d never heard before. I knew he needed me to be there for him, to offer comfort and reassurance, to be the supportive step-child he hoped for. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a girl from my church group. She was struggling with her mental health again, reaching out for someone to talk to. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to show her love and kindness, to be present for her as Jesus would be. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my stepdad\u2019s anxious eyes searching mine for solace, and Sarah\u2019s desperate words lighting up my screen. I wanted to be everything for both of them, but the weight of their needs pressed down on me, leaving me paralyzed, unsure which call to answer first."}
