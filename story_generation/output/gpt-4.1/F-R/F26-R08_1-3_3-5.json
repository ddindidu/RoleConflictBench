Today was our long-awaited family gathering, a day I had promised to spend with them, playing games and sharing stories. I could already picture their eager faces, the way they would tug at my sleeve, asking for my attention. But as the clock ticked closer to noon, I remembered the time for Friday prayer was near. I needed to prepare, to change into my modest attire and make my way to the mosque\u2019s main prayer hall, as my faith required. \n\nYet, I glanced down at my clothes\u2014comfortable, casual, not quite suitable for the mosque. If I left now to change and attend the prayer, I would miss the first part of the gathering, disappointing my family. If I stayed, I would neglect my religious duty and the sense of peace it brought me. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, standing in the hallway, caught between the warmth of my family and the call of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
