It\u2019s a ritual, almost sacred in its own way\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle questions, my father\u2019s quiet pride. They expect these calls, and I know how much they mean, especially since I moved out of state. This week, though, my synagogue asked me to chant a Torah portion during the Saturday morning service. It\u2019s an honor, and as a Jew, I feel the weight of that responsibility. But the rehearsal is scheduled for the same time as my weekly call home. My parents don\u2019t know about the conflict yet. I can already hear my mother\u2019s disappointment if I miss our call, her voice tinged with worry. At the same time, I imagine the rabbi\u2019s encouraging smile, the congregation\u2019s expectation. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s need for connection, and my community\u2019s call to faith. My chest tightens as I stare at my phone, torn between dialing home and preparing for the service, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
