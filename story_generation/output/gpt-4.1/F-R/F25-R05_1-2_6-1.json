The Shabbat service was only two days away, and I still hadn\u2019t found the right words for my sermon. My mind kept drifting, though, to the quiet tension at home. My stepmother had been withdrawn lately, and my father\u2019s silences grew longer each evening. As their step-child, I felt responsible for checking in, for asking if everything was alright, for being the bridge that held our fragile family together. But every time I tried, I was met with vague reassurances or a change of subject. \n\nNow, as a rabbi, my congregation expected inspiration and guidance, especially during these uncertain times. They needed me to be present, to offer wisdom and hope. But how could I pour myself into a sermon when my heart was heavy with worry for my family? I stared at the blank page, torn between the pulpit and the living room, between the needs of my community and the silent pleas of my parents. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for either."}
