They expect me to be there, to laugh and share stories, to keep our tradition alive. I know how much it means to them, especially since we haven\u2019t all been together in so long. At the same time, I glance at the church bulletin on my kitchen table, reminding me of the special service this Sunday. My pastor has asked for volunteers, and I\u2019ve always believed in being present, not just for worship but for the community that has become my second family. My heart aches as I think about missing either gathering. I want to be the grandmother who never misses a moment, but I also want to be the Christian who honors her commitments. The weight of these expectations presses on me, and I find myself torn, wondering how I can possibly choose between them."}
