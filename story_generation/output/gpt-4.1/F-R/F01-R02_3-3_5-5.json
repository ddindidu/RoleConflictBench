Something serious had happened\u2014she needed me, the family needed me. I could see the worry in my grandson\u2019s eyes, and I knew my presence would bring comfort. Just as I was about to gather my things, the church door creaked open. A young woman, eyes red and swollen, stumbled in. \u201cFather, please, I need you,\u201d she whispered, her voice breaking. She was desperate, clinging to hope, and I could not ignore the sacred duty I had to guide her through her pain. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my family\u2019s crisis on one side, the urgent spiritual need on the other. Both expected my full attention, my compassion, my strength. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of my family and the solemn call of my faith, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
