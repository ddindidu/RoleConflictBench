I always keep an eye on him, just like Mom asked. He\u2019s only twelve, and I know he trusts me to keep him safe. As we pass the corner store, he tugs my sleeve, asking if we can stop for a snack. I check my wallet, counting the few bills I have left. I hesitate, thinking about the money I\u2019ve been saving for Hajj. Every spare coin is supposed to go into that envelope under my mattress. It\u2019s what I promised myself, and what my faith expects of me. But my brother\u2019s hopeful eyes remind me of my other promise\u2014to look out for him, to make sure he\u2019s happy and cared for. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I feel torn. I want to be a good sibling, but I also want to fulfill my religious duty. My heart pounds as I stand there, caught between the two expectations, unsure which path to choose."}
