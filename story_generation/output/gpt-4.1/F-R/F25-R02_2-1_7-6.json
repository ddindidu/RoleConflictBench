My father\u2019s voice, usually so steady, trembled as he asked me if I\u2019d be home for dinner. They\u2019d both been working longer hours, and the house felt heavier with their exhaustion. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to help keep the family together. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was in an hour. As a priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for my parishioners and guide the next season\u2019s classes. I could already picture the committee waiting for me, counting on my ideas and direction. My heart twisted, torn between the silent plea in my parents\u2019 eyes and the responsibility I felt to my congregation. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door I should walk through."}
