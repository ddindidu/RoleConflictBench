She confided in me about her recent health scare, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her vulnerability, and tried to offer the comfort she needed. My father, usually stoic, looked at me with a silent plea for strength. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They needed an answer soon, eager to secure the date. As a rabbi, I knew how important these milestones were, how much my presence meant to my community. But as a son, my parents needed me now, my attention undivided, my support unwavering. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer first."}
