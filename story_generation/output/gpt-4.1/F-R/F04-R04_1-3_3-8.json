My siblings animatedly discussed possible weekend plans\u2014hiking, a movie, maybe a picnic. My younger sister looked at me, eyes bright, \u201cYou\u2019ll come this time, right?\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, the unspoken expectation that I would be there, not just as their brother, but as a participant in our family\u2019s life. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had arrived, shaken and in tears, needing immediate spiritual counsel after a devastating loss. As the imam, I knew my presence was expected, my guidance crucial. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s hopeful faces to the glowing screen. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s desire for togetherness, and my community\u2019s need for comfort. I felt torn, the demands of brotherhood and spiritual leadership pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
