My son had been caught bullying a classmate. As a father, I knew I had to attend the meeting at school, face the teachers, and help my son understand the seriousness of his actions. I wanted to be there for him, to guide him, to show him that kindness matters. But as I glanced at the calendar, I saw that Passover was only days away. I hadn\u2019t yet taught my children the blessings or the story behind the Seder. My father always made sure I knew our traditions, and I felt the weight of passing that on. I could hear my son in the next room, his voice uncertain as he practiced the Four Questions. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on correcting his behavior at school, or should I spend these precious evenings teaching him about our heritage? Both roles demanded my full attention, but I only had so much to give. The pressure built inside me, and I wondered how I could possibly be the father and the teacher my children needed right now."}
