The whole family was gathering for a weekend trip to the lake, something we hadn\u2019t done in years. As a brother, I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially to my sister, who had been planning this for months. I could already hear my mother\u2019s voice, warm and expectant, asking if I\u2019d be there, and I felt the familiar tug of wanting to be the dependable brother, the one who shows up.\n\nBut then I remembered the last trip, the way my cousins joked about things I found uncomfortable, the drinking, the gossip, the casual disregard for the values I tried to live by as a Christian. I wanted to be present, to laugh and belong, but I also wanted to stay true to my beliefs\u2014kindness, honesty, respect. The thought of being caught between laughter and silent disapproval twisted in my chest. I could already feel the tension: if I went, would I compromise my values? If I didn\u2019t, would I let my family down? My phone buzzed with a message from my sister, and I just stared at it, torn."}
