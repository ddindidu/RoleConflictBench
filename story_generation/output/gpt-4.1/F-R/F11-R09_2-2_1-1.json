I really need to talk.\u201d I know she\u2019s been struggling lately, and as her sister, I want to be there for her, to listen and support her like we always promised we would. But as I glance at the calendar, my heart sinks. Passover is just days away, and I still haven\u2019t taught my kids the Four Questions or the blessings they\u2019ll need to recite at the Seder. My mother always said it was my responsibility to pass on our traditions, to make sure our children know who they are and where they come from. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my sister\u2019s need for comfort, my children\u2019s need for guidance. I pace the kitchen, torn between the pull of family and faith, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
