My father had spent the week preparing the offerings, and my grandmother had told me stories of how important it was to be present, to show respect, and to never let the old ways fade. But as I dressed, my phone buzzed with a message from the temple: the main weekly service was about to begin, and as the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and guide the community. I could already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to open the ceremony, their faith resting on my presence. My heart pounded as I looked at my family, bustling in the kitchen, and then at my priestly robes laid out for the service. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope that I would honor our lineage, and my community\u2019s trust in my spiritual leadership. I stood frozen, torn between the two, feeling the impossible pull of both expectations."}
