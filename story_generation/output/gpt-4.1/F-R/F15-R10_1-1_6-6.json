I knew how much he wanted it, and as a parent, I felt the weight of ensuring his happiness while also keeping our finances in check. The price tag of the console echoed in my mind, a reminder of our tight budget and the bills waiting at home.\n\nAs we passed the temple, the air was thick with the scent of incense and marigolds. The local festival was in full swing, and I felt a familiar tug in my heart. As a Hindu, participating in these ceremonies was more than tradition\u2014it was a way to honor my faith and connect with my community. I wanted to join, to offer prayers and be part of the rituals, but I also knew that donations and offerings were expected, another expense to consider.\n\nCaught between my son\u2019s hopeful gaze and the call of the temple bells, I felt the pressure mounting. Both roles demanded something of me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which expectation to fulfill."}
