I smiled, feeling the warmth of family expectation, the gentle tug of my role as a grandparent. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to evening, my mind drifted to the temple. Tonight was the full moon chant, a monthly ceremony I had never missed, a time when my sangha gathered to recite sutras and meditate together. My teacher often reminded us of the importance of consistency and presence in our practice. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest\u2014my grandson\u2019s eager anticipation, my community\u2019s silent expectation. I wanted to be everywhere at once, to honor both love and devotion, but the hours overlapped, and I could not split myself in two. My heart ached as I sat in the quiet, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
