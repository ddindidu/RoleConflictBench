My daughter calls, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson has won a school award, and they\u2019re hosting a small celebration at noon. She wants the whole family there, especially me. I feel a warm tug in my heart; I know how much these moments mean, how my presence matters to them. But as I hang up, I glance at the clock and remember the church service I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019d attend more regularly. My faith is my anchor, and I miss the comfort of worship, the sense of belonging in the congregation. I want to be there, to sing and pray, to reconnect with my church friends. Yet, I also want to see my grandson\u2019s proud smile, to be the grandmother he remembers cheering him on. The two worlds pull at me, each with its own love and duty. I sit at the table, hands wrapped around my coffee mug, heart heavy with the weight of choosing between them."}
