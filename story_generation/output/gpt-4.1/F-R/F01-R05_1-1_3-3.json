My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the children were looking forward to my stories and the warmth of our Shabbat table. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the gentle chaos of three generations under one roof. \n\nBut as I set the phone down, my mind drifted to the synagogue bulletin: tonight was also the monthly adult education class. It was optional, yes, but I knew several congregants counted on these evenings for guidance and connection. Some had even emailed questions in advance, hoping I\u2019d address them. As their rabbi, I felt a responsibility to nurture their curiosity and support their spiritual growth.\n\nThe clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing my family, yet I couldn\u2019t ignore the quiet expectation from my community. I stood in the hallway, torn, the sounds of my family\u2019s laughter echoing from the living room as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
