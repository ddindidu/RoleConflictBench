My younger brother\u2019s eyes sparkled as he suggested a hiking trip, and my mother chimed in about a picnic she\u2019d love to organize. I felt their excitement, the warmth of being included, the unspoken expectation that I would be there, laughing and sharing stories as their sister. But my phone buzzed, a reminder flashing across the screen: the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah, a ceremony I\u2019d been preparing for with their son for months, was set for Saturday morning. As their rabbi, I was expected to lead, to guide, to be present for this milestone in their lives. My heart twisted, caught between the joy of being a sister and the responsibility of being a rabbi. I could hear my brother\u2019s hopeful voice, see the trust in the Cohen family\u2019s eyes, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I could give."}
