My partner\u2019s daughter needed new shoes, and the fridge was nearly empty. I knew I had to pick up an extra shift at the caf\u00e9 tonight if we were going to make it through the week. But my phone buzzed with a message from my Buddhist teacher, reminding me about tomorrow\u2019s temple session. He asked if I could summarize the key teachings for the group\u2014a task that would require hours of quiet study and reflection tonight. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a step-parent, I was expected to keep the family afloat, to provide and protect. As a Buddhist, I was called to deepen my understanding, to serve the sangha with clarity and presence. My heart ached with the tension, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the quiet call of the Dharma. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, unsure which path to follow."}
