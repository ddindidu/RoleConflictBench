It\u2019s my mother, sending her usual midday message: \u201cHow\u2019s your day? Did you eat lunch?\u201d I know she expects a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my meal, and a few lines about my morning. We talk every day, and I can hear her voice in my head, worried if I don\u2019t answer soon. But tonight, I\u2019m leading an adult education class\u2014nothing mandatory, but I promised myself I\u2019d be fully present for anyone who comes, even if it\u2019s just one person. The first students are already arriving, smiling and eager. My phone vibrates again. I feel the pull\u2014my mother\u2019s need for connection, my own sense of duty as a daughter. At the same time, I feel the weight of my rabbinic role, the expectation to be attentive, prepared, and welcoming. I stand in the doorway, phone in hand, heart tugged in two directions, unsure which voice to answer first."}
