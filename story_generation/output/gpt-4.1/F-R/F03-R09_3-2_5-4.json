This ceremony was important to my family, a tradition passed down for generations. I wanted to make them proud, to show I could carry on what mattered most to them. But my stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. We were hours from home, and the only kosher vendor in the area was a tiny stand at the edge of the highway. My mother insisted we wait and eat with everyone at the ceremony, as was our custom. But I knew the food at the gathering wouldn\u2019t be kosher, and I\u2019d have to choose between eating with my family or keeping kosher as my faith demanded. My father\u2019s eyes met mine in the rearview mirror, full of hope. My heart twisted, caught between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and staying true to my Jewish values. I stared out the window, the landscape blurring, as I wrestled with what to do."}
