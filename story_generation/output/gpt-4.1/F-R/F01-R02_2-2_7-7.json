She wanted the whole family to gather for dinner, to celebrate and hear his stories. I felt a surge of pride, picturing his shy smile as he shared his first steps into adulthood. As a grandfather, I knew how much these moments mattered, how important it was to be present, to listen, to show him that his achievements were cherished.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes fell on the church calendar. Tonight was the weekly religious education class, a commitment I\u2019d made to the children and their parents. They counted on me to guide them, to answer their questions, to nurture their faith. Canceling would mean letting them down, disrupting the rhythm and trust we\u2019d built.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my pride. My parish expected my leadership, my constancy, my care. I sat in my study, torn between the laughter of my family and the quiet responsibility of my calling, unsure which path to take."}
