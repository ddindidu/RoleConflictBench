My grandson clutched a homemade trophy, his eyes shining as he waited for everyone to gather. Today was his big moment\u2014he\u2019d won the school science fair, and the family was here to celebrate. I could see how much it meant to him that I was there, that I would listen to his speech and clap the loudest. \n\nJust as he began, my phone vibrated. It was a message from the synagogue: a funeral prayer was about to begin, but they were one short for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t proceed, and the grieving family would be left waiting, unable to say Kaddish for their loved one. My heart twisted. My faith teaches me the importance of supporting the community, especially in times of mourning. But my family, my grandson\u2014he needed me here, now. \n\nI looked at my grandson\u2019s hopeful face, then at the message on my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
