Ever since Dad remarried, I\u2019d tried to fit in, to show I respected their ways, even if they felt foreign. But now, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for someone\u2019s father. I knew how much that mattered in our community\u2014how being there was a mitzvah, a sacred duty. My stepfamily expected me at the table, to honor their customs, but my Jewish heart pulled me toward the synagogue, to help a mourner say goodbye. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the family I was trying to belong to and the faith that had always been my home."}
