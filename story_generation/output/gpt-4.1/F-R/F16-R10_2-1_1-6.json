She\u2019d been struggling with a tough decision at work, and I could see the worry in her eyes. She needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my support, my words to help her sort through the mess in her mind. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her, to be the spouse she deserved.\n\nBut as we turned the corner, the sound of drums and laughter drifted over from the temple. It was the start of a festival, one I\u2019d grown up celebrating, one that always filled me with a sense of belonging and peace. The colors, the chanting, the familiar faces\u2014my heart tugged me toward the rituals, the prayers, the community. I felt the pull of my faith, the expectation to join in, to honor my heritage.\n\nMy partner\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, soft and uncertain. I stood there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
