Our family traditions are sacred, and I know how much it means to everyone that I take an active role, especially now that I\u2019m old enough.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I\u2019m supposed to guide the weekly meditation at the temple. As the group leader, people rely on me to create a calm, mindful space. I\u2019ve always found peace in those sessions, and I know how much the community values our time together.\n\nI sat in my room, incense smoke curling in the air, torn between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and fulfilling my commitment to the sangha. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I closed my eyes, searching for clarity, feeling the tension between the son I am and the Buddhist I strive to be."}
