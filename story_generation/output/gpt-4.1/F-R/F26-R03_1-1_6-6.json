My worn Bible rests in my lap, and I close my eyes, ready to lose myself in prayer. But my phone, tucked discreetly in my pocket for emergencies, vibrates with a message from my daughter: \u201cWill you join our family video call this afternoon? The kids miss you. It\u2019s almost the holiday.\u201d My heart aches. As a grandmother, I know how much these moments mean\u2014my family expects me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to keep our bond alive, especially as the holiday draws near. Yet, as a nun, I am called to quiet reflection, to set aside worldly distractions and deepen my spiritual life. The two worlds tug at me, each with its own sacred claim. I stare at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s voices and the silent promise of God\u2019s presence, feeling the weight of both loves pressing in on my heart."}
