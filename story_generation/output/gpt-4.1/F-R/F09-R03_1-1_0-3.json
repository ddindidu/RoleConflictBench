My children will be waiting at the gate, eyes searching for me among the other parents. I promised them I\u2019d be there, just as I always have, to hear about their day and hold their hands on the walk home. But as I glance at the clock, the convent\u2019s bell tolls, calling all sisters to the main chapel for morning prayers. The Mother Superior\u2019s words echo in my memory: \u201cOur devotion must be unwavering, our presence at prayer a testament to our faith.\u201d I feel the weight of my habit on my shoulders, the rosary beads cool in my palm, and yet my heart aches for the warmth of my children\u2019s embrace. The expectation to be a devoted mother clashes with the sacred duty of my vocation. I stand in the corridor, torn between the chapel\u2019s solemn silence and the distant laughter of children, my own included, waiting for me. My feet refuse to move, caught between two worlds, as I wrestle with the impossible choice before me."}
