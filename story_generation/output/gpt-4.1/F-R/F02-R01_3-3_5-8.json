My son stood by the manager\u2019s office, eyes red, clutching a half-eaten candy bar. As a father, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences\u2014he needed to understand that stealing was wrong, and discipline was part of love. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder about the workshop I was leading in less than an hour. As a pastor, I was expected to guide our community leaders through a challenging session on forgiveness, grace, and the complexities of sin. Both roles demanded my full presence\u2014my son needed me to be his father, to correct and comfort him, while my congregation expected me to be their spiritual guide, prepared and composed. My heart twisted as I looked at my son\u2019s trembling hands and thought of the waiting church hall. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
