The house was unusually quiet, and I felt the gentle pull of mindfulness, the promise of peace. Just as I closed my eyes, my younger brother\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, sharp and frustrated. He knocked on my door, his words tumbling out about a misunderstanding with our parents. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew he expected me to listen, to help him navigate the tension. As his sister, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014to be present, to communicate openly, to build the respect we\u2019d worked so hard for. But as a Buddhist, I also felt the pull of my own commitment, the need to honor this quiet window I\u2019d carved out for myself. My heart pounded with the pressure of both roles, torn between the urge to open the door and the longing to stay in stillness, wrestling with the incompatible expectations pressing in from both sides."}
