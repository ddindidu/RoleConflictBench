She needed me to be present, to share my worries and hopes, to be her partner in this moment of uncertainty. My phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was in less than two hours. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with wisdom and calm. But today, a guest speaker was ready to step in if I needed. My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she asked if we could really afford the new treatment. I wanted to reassure her, to stay and talk until we found some peace. Yet, I could already picture the mosque filling up, the community waiting for my words, expecting my presence. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman who needed my honesty, and toward the congregation that relied on my leadership. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
