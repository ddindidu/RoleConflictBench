He was supposed to be learning table manners, and as his father, I knew I should gently correct him, guide him toward the discipline and respect I wanted him to carry into the world. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the parish office. The Martinez family needed me to lead a last-minute, crucial preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament. It was the only time they could manage before the ceremony, and as their priest, I was expected to be there, to shepherd them through this important step in their faith.\n\nI looked at my son, then at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to teach him, to be present in this small but meaningful moment. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a family counting on my spiritual guidance. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full devotion. My heart ached as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to set aside, if only for tonight."}
