Lately, the house felt heavy, like everyone was carrying something too big to talk about. I knew I should go in, offer to help with dinner or just sit with them, let them know I cared. That\u2019s what a good step-child does\u2014be there, especially when things are rough. But tonight was also the night I was supposed to chant my Torah portion at synagogue. I\u2019d practiced for weeks, and Rabbi Cohen said it was important to show up, to be part of the community, especially now, during these difficult times. My stepmom always said family comes first, but my Jewish side told me that faith and tradition matter too. I stood in the hallway, my heart pounding, torn between the kitchen and the front door, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
