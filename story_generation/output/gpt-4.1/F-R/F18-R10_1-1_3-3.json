My parents looked at me, expecting me to join in the planning, to be the supportive sibling who always makes family time special. I smiled and nodded, but my mind kept drifting back to what happened at work earlier. I\u2019d seen a coworker cut in line at the cafeteria, ignoring the others who had been waiting patiently. As a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to stand up for what\u2019s right, even in small matters. The urge to say something had gnawed at me all afternoon, but I\u2019d stayed silent, not wanting to cause a scene. Now, as my family laughed and made plans, I felt torn. Should I bring up what happened and risk dampening the mood, or keep quiet and focus on being the cheerful sibling everyone expects? The weight of these conflicting roles pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the desire to uphold my values and the need to be present for my family."}
