Today was his big day\u2014he wanted the whole family to see his volcano erupt, and I knew how much it meant to him. My heart swelled with pride and love, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\n\nBut just as I was about to follow him, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Linda, a woman from my church group. She\u2019d been struggling since her husband passed, and today she sounded desperate, asking if I could come over. I remembered the words of Jesus about loving our neighbors, about being there for those in need. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s joy and my faith\u2019s call to compassion. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, torn between the laughter in the living room and the silent plea on my phone, unsure which path to take."}
