My father\u2019s eyes, usually so steady, were clouded with worry. They looked to me, their only child, for comfort\u2014something I\u2019d always tried to give, even before I entered the convent. I wanted to reach out, to hold their hands, to reassure them that everything would be alright. But as the clock chimed, I felt a familiar tug in my chest. It was time for morning prayers, and the bell from the chapel echoed softly through the house, a reminder of my commitment as a nun. The sisters would be gathering now, expecting my presence, my devotion, my discipline. I could not be late, not again. My parents\u2019 eyes pleaded for me to stay, to be their daughter in this moment. My heart ached, torn between the warmth of family and the solemn call of faith. I sat frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which path to follow as the seconds slipped away."}
