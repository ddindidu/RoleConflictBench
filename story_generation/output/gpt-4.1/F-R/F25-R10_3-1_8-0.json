She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be the supportive step-child she hoped for. But as she spoke, I felt the weight of the day pressing on me. I hadn\u2019t done my full morning puja, only whispered a quick mantra under my breath before school. Guilt gnawed at me; my faith taught me to honor the rituals, to set aside time for prayer and reflection, not just rush through them. Now, as my stepmother poured out her heart, I felt torn\u2014should I excuse myself to complete my prayers, or stay and be the child she needed? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
