He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew he was barely holding it together. As his step-sibling, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for him, to offer comfort and maybe even help him revise. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for my evening puja. My family expects me to follow our Hindu rituals without fail\u2014lighting the lamp, chanting mantras, making offerings. Missing even one step feels like a betrayal of my faith and my parents\u2019 trust. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to sit beside my brother, to reassure him, and the weight of my spiritual duties, which I\u2019ve never skipped. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the soft glow of the prayer room and the anxious voice calling out for help. The pressure of both roles pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations tonight."}
