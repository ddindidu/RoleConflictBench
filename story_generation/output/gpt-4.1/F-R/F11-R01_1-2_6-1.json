My younger brother had texted, \u201cAre you coming to the movie tonight? Haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken wish that I\u2019d be there, laughing and sharing popcorn, like we used to. I knew how much it meant to him that I made time for family, that I showed I cared by being present, not just in spirit but in person.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my phone rang. It was Sarah from church, her voice trembling. \u201cPastor, I really need to talk. I\u2019m facing a huge decision, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I heard the desperation, the trust she placed in me to offer guidance, to be the steady hand she needed right now.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. My brother needed his sister, someone who included him, who made him feel valued. Sarah needed her pastor, someone who listened and offered wisdom. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations, and I felt the weight of choosing between them pressing down on my heart."}
