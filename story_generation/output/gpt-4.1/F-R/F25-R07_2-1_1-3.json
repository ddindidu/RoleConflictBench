As a practicing Buddhist, this time is sacred\u2014a chance to breathe, to let go, to be present. Tonight, just as I settle onto my cushion and close my eyes, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my stepmother, calling for our weekly check-in. She expects me to answer, to share updates, to ask about her and Dad. I know how much these calls mean to her, how they help us bridge the awkward gaps of our blended family. But my mind is torn. If I answer, I\u2019ll miss my meditation, breaking the promise I made to myself to nurture my spiritual practice. If I ignore the call, I risk hurting her feelings, maybe even reopening old wounds of distance and misunderstanding. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, caught between the duty of connection and the need for inner peace, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
