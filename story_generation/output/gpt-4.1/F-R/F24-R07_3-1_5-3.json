My stepmom called out, \u201cCome help us set the table! We\u2019re all doing this together.\u201d I knew how important these moments were\u2014blending into this new family, showing up, being present. But I glanced at the clock. In five minutes, I had planned a quiet ten-minute meditation, a practice I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t skip, especially on stressful days like this. My Buddhist teacher always said mindfulness was most needed when life felt chaotic. Yet, here I was, torn. If I slipped away for meditation, I\u2019d miss the laughter, the chance to bond, maybe even seem distant or ungrateful. But if I stayed, I\u2019d break my commitment to myself, letting the noise and rush sweep away my calm. My heart thudded with guilt and longing, caught between the warmth of family and the quiet I craved."}
