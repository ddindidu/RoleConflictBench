As a mother, I feel the weight of our home loan pressing on my chest, the repayment looming just two months away. I know I must find extra work, maybe take on a few more shifts, to ensure we don\u2019t fall behind. But as a Hindu, I am expected to begin each day by lighting the lamp and offering prayers at our home altar, a ritual that brings peace and blessings to our family.\n\nToday, my phone buzzes with a message from my manager\u2014an early shift is available, but it starts before sunrise. If I accept, I\u2019ll have to skip my morning prayers, breaking a promise I made to myself and my faith. My heart aches as I stand in the kitchen, torn between the need to provide for my children and the spiritual duty that grounds me. The aroma of incense lingers from yesterday\u2019s prayers, mingling with the sharp scent of coffee, as I wrestle with the impossible choice before me."}
