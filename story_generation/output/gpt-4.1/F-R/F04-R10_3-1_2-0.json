She needed me\u2014her big brother\u2014to come over, to just be there as she faced a painful breakup. I knew she counted on me, and I\u2019d always promised to support her, no matter what. But tonight was also the night of an important Hindu ritual at home, one that I\u2019d promised my parents I would perform. It wasn\u2019t just about the prayers; it was about honoring our traditions, keeping the faith alive in our family. I tried to compromise, quietly repeating a short mantra as I paced my room, but guilt gnawed at me. Was it enough? My parents expected me to uphold our rituals, to be a good Hindu, especially during tough times. My sister needed her brother, someone to lean on. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by love and duty, by the weight of family and faith. My heart raced as I stood by the door, keys in hand, unsure which path to take."}
