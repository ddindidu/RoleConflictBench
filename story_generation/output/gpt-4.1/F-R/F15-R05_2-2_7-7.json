My wife glanced at me, her eyes tired, and I knew she was waiting for reassurance that I could cover the rent this month. As a parent, I felt the weight of their needs\u2014groceries, school supplies, the electricity bill. My phone buzzed, and I saw a reminder: the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah was in two hours. Months of preparation, their son\u2019s big day, and my role as their rabbi was to guide, to celebrate, to be fully present. But the check from the synagogue wouldn\u2019t come until next week, and I\u2019d been offered a one-time job today that would pay enough to get us through the month\u2014if I took it now. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between my family\u2019s immediate needs and my sacred commitment to my congregation. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in a storm of responsibility, love, and duty, unsure which path to take."}
