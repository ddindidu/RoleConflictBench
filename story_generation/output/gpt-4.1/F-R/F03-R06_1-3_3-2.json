My family laughed and shared stories, the way we always did during these gatherings. As the eldest son, I was expected to lead the family in our traditional toast, a ritual that had been passed down for generations. But this year, the toast included a joke that made light of something I knew, as a Christian, I shouldn\u2019t condone. My faith taught me to speak with kindness and respect, to avoid words that could hurt or belittle others. Yet, my father\u2019s expectant gaze and the eager faces around me reminded me of my duty to honor our family\u2019s customs. My heart pounded as I held the glass, torn between the warmth of belonging and the quiet voice inside urging me to stand by my beliefs. The room grew silent, everyone waiting for me to begin, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
