My younger sister, Anna, had called earlier, her voice tight with frustration. She wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the argument we\u2019d had last week. She said she needed me to listen, to help us find our way back to the trust we\u2019d always shared. I knew I owed her that, as her sister. But just as I was about to call her back, Mother Superior knocked on my door. She asked me to lead the daily reflections for the upcoming retreat, a responsibility that would require hours of preparation and deep spiritual focus. I could feel the weight of her expectation, the trust she placed in me as a nun. My heart ached, torn between Anna\u2019s need for open, honest conversation and the community\u2019s need for spiritual guidance. I wanted to be present for both, but the demands pressed in from both sides, leaving me suspended in a silent, anxious struggle."}
