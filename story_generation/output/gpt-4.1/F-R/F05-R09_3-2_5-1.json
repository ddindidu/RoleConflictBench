The windows need cleaning, the guest room sheets must be changed, and the table set just so. As her husband, I know she expects me to share the load, to be her partner in making our home shine for her family. But as I glance at the clock, I remember the holiday approaching\u2014just days away\u2014and the children\u2019s blank faces when I asked them about the blessings. I promised myself I\u2019d teach them, pass on the words my father taught me, the melodies that connect us to generations past. My heart aches with the weight of both roles. I want to be the husband who eases her stress, but I also feel the pull of my Jewish identity, the responsibility to guide my children. The broom feels heavy in my hand as I stand between the kitchen and the living room, torn by the demands of love and tradition, unsure which path to take first."}
