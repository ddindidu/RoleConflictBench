The house felt heavy tonight, and I could sense something was off. As her step-child, I knew I should ask if everything was okay, offer her the support she always said meant so much. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the temple. The evening chant was about to begin, and as a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, joining the community in ritual and reflection. My heart tugged in two directions. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to check in on my stepmother, to be the caring presence my family needed. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my sangha, neglecting the spiritual practice that grounds me. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer."}
