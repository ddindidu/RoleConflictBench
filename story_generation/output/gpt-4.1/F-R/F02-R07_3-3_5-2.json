The manager\u2019s words echoed in my ears\u2014caught stealing snacks, a moment of childish impulse, but a serious mistake.

Today was the annual festival, the one day the whole community gathered before sunrise. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to help prepare offerings and chant with the others.
