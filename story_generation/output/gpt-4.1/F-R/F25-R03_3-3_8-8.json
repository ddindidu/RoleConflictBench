Her eyes searched mine, desperate for comfort, for the kind of support a daughter should give. I wanted to reach out, to hold her hand and reassure her, but my mind kept drifting to the convent, to the letter from Mother Superior waiting in my room. She had entrusted me with leading the daily reflections for our retreat\u2014a sacred responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual preparation. I could almost hear her gentle voice reminding me that the community was counting on me to guide them closer to God. My stepmother\u2019s pain pulled me one way, the weight of my spiritual duty pulled me another. I felt torn, my heart aching with the knowledge that I could not be fully present for both. The expectations pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, unsure which path to take, feeling the impossible stretch between the family I was born into and the one I had chosen."}
