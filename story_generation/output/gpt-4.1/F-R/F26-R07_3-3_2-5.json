She needed advice, she said, about something serious\u2014her words heavy with the kind of worry that only youth can carry. As her grandmother, I felt the familiar pull to open my arms, to listen, to offer the wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over decades. But today, I am also the leader of our weekly Buddhist meditation group, a role I cherish and take seriously. The group relies on me to guide them in mindfulness, to create a space of calm and presence. The session begins in less than an hour, and I know they expect me to be there, centered and prepared. My heart aches with the weight of both responsibilities. I want to be the steady presence my granddaughter needs, but I also feel the duty to my sangha, to the practice that sustains me. The clock ticks on, and I sit in the quiet, torn between the call of family and the call of the Dharma, unsure which path to follow."}
