It was my younger brother, his voice trembling, asking if I could come over. He\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend and needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I\u2019ve always promised to be there for him, especially in moments like this. But tonight is the annual memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I\u2019ve helped organize for weeks. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, to chant and support the community, especially with so many people attending. I could hear the pain in my brother\u2019s voice, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to the sangha. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed me, and toward my spiritual community, who counted on my presence. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that defined me, unsure which door to walk through."}
