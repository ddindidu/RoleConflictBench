The house was finally quiet, and I had set aside these ten minutes for my daily meditation, a small promise I made to myself as a Buddhist. Just as I began to settle into the rhythm of my breathing, I heard my sister\u2019s muffled sobs from the next room. She had just received terrible news about her job, and I knew she was struggling. As her sibling, I felt a deep pull to go to her, to offer comfort and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But I also felt the weight of my commitment to mindfulness, the need to cultivate inner peace so I could be strong for both of us. My heart pounded with the tension between these two roles\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other asking for stillness. I sat there, torn, the sound of her crying growing louder, my breath growing shallower, caught between the urge to help and the need to honor my practice."}
