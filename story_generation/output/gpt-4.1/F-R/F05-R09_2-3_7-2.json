I knew I should ask her what was wrong, open up about my own worries at work, and be the supportive husband she needed. But my mind kept drifting upstairs, where my son was struggling with his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. As a Jewish father, I felt the weight of tradition pressing on me\u2014I was supposed to guide him, teach him, make sure he was ready to step into our community with confidence. Yet, every evening, when I should be helping him practice, I found myself torn, wanting to sit with my wife and talk, to be present for her. The expectations pulled at me from both sides: to be the open, communicative partner she deserved, and the devoted Jewish father my son needed. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my all to both at the same time. I stood in the hallway, caught between the kitchen and the stairs, unsure which way to turn."}
