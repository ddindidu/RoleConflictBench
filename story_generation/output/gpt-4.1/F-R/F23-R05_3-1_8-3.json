The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow over every purchase and plan. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014my partner and stepchild depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure the roof over our heads stayed ours. I\u2019d been cutting corners, skipping little luxuries, but the deadline was coming fast, and I needed every spare hour to find extra work or overtime.\n\nThen my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the adult education class at the synagogue. As rabbi, I was expected to be there, to teach Torah, to answer questions, to be present for anyone who might drop in. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but people valued these sessions, and I knew how much it meant to the community. I could almost hear the voices of my congregants, eager for learning, for connection.\n\nMy heart twisted. If I went to the class, I\u2019d lose precious hours I could use to pick up a shift or work on a side project. If I skipped it, I\u2019d be letting down those who looked to me for guidance. I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure build as the clock ticked on."}
