My younger brother\u2019s name flashed on the screen, his message unread but urgent. We\u2019d argued last night\u2014harsh words, old wounds reopened. As his brother, I knew I should reach out, apologize, and talk things through. Our parents always said we had to respect each other, to never let anger fester. But today was Friday, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. The congregation looked to me for guidance, and I\u2019d spent the week preparing my sermon. Yet, the guest speaker I\u2019d invited was ready and willing to step in if needed. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my duty to my brother, to heal our rift, and my duty to my community, to lead them in prayer. I stared at the pulpit, then at my phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which path to take."}
