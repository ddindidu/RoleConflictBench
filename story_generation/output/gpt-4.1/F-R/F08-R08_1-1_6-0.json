I sit in my favorite chair, the Quran open on my lap, the soft lamplight casting gentle shadows on the pages. My heart feels at peace as I begin to recite, letting the familiar words wash over me. But then my phone buzzes, a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, are you free to video call? The kids want to see you before the holiday.\u201d I glance at the clock. It\u2019s the perfect time for reflection, a rare evening with no other demands. Yet, I know the family expects me to be present, to share stories and laughter, especially with the holiday so near. I feel the tug in my chest\u2014my faith calls me to immerse myself in the Quran, but my love for my family urges me to answer, to be the grandmother they need. The two roles pull at me, each with its own weight, and I sit there, torn, the phone glowing softly beside the holy book in my lap."}
