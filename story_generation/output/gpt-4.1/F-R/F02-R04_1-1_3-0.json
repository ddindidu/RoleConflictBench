He was supposed to be learning to eat properly, and I knew this was one of those moments when a father\u2019s gentle correction could shape his manners for life. My wife glanced at me, her eyes asking for help, expecting me to step in and guide him. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Maghrib prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even though tonight, the group would be small and another capable brother was present to take my place if needed. Still, the community looked to me for consistency and leadership. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the father my son needed at home, and the imam my community expected at the mosque. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the quiet lesson at the dinner table and the call to prayer echoing in my mind."}
