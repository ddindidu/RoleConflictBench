My younger brother suggested a road trip to the lake, and everyone cheered. I felt the familiar warmth of belonging, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d join in, just as I always did. But then my older sister mentioned that her friend would bring alcohol, and the plan quickly shifted to include a party by the water. My parents didn\u2019t seem to mind, but I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a Christian, I\u2019d promised myself to avoid situations where I might be pressured into drinking or compromising my values. Yet, as a sister, I knew how much it meant to my siblings for me to be there, to laugh and make memories together. The room buzzed with excitement, but inside, I was torn\u2014caught between the joy of being a supportive sister and the quiet, persistent voice of my faith urging me to stand firm. I stared at my plate, wrestling with the weight of both expectations, unsure which path to take."}
