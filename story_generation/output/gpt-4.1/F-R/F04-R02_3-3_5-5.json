This trip had been planned for months, and my parents had made it clear how much it meant to them that I join. As their brother, I knew my presence mattered, especially to my sister, who had been looking forward to our time together. Just as I zipped up my suitcase, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church secretary: a parishioner was waiting in the chapel, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As a priest, I was expected to be there for those in crisis, to offer comfort and counsel when it was needed most. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s anticipation, their hope for togetherness, and the silent plea of someone in pain, seeking solace from their priest. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between the warmth of my family and the solemn duty of my calling, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
