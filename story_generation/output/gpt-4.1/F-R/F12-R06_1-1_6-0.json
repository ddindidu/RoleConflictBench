He asked about my day, and I hesitated, remembering the awkward moment at work when a colleague made an inappropriate joke. As a wife, I knew I should communicate openly, share my thoughts and feelings, and let him into my world. But as a Christian, I felt a strong urge to guard my words, to avoid gossip or speaking ill of others, even if it was just recounting what happened. The expectation to be honest with my husband pressed against the expectation to uphold kindness and integrity in my speech. My mind raced, torn between wanting to be transparent and wanting to live by the values I hold dear. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
