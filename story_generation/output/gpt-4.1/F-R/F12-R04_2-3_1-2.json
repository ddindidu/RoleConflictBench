He needed me\u2014his wife\u2014to listen, to reassure him, to help him find clarity. I could see the worry in his eyes, the way he searched my face for comfort. My phone buzzed. A message from the mosque: the congregation was waiting, the remembrance gathering had begun, and no other imam was present. They needed me to lead the prayers, to guide them in faith, to fulfill my duty as their spiritual leader. My heart pounded. I wanted to stay, to hold my husband\u2019s hand, to be the support he so desperately sought. But I also felt the weight of the community\u2019s expectations, the responsibility to stand before them and lead. Torn between the two worlds, I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
