The house was a whirlwind of chores\u2014dusting, cooking, arranging the guest room. As a husband, I felt the weight of her expectation: to share the load, to make our home shine for her family. I could see the stress in her eyes, and I wanted to ease it, to be the partner she needed.\n\nBut as I took out the trash, I saw our neighbor, Mr. Sharma, quietly slipping an envelope to the municipal officer at the gate. I overheard enough to know it was a bribe, a clear act of corruption. As a Hindu, I was raised to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and courage, to never turn away from wrongdoing. My conscience screamed at me to intervene, to speak up, to do what was right.\n\nYet, inside, my wife called for help with the kitchen. The clock ticked closer to the relatives\u2019 arrival. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my principles, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing my heart."}
