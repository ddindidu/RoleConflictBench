It was Sunday evening, our usual time for the weekly call. She always waited for my updates, eager to hear about my week, and I knew how much it meant to her. But tonight, my mind was elsewhere. The bar mitzvah I was to officiate was only an hour away, and my thoughts raced with prayers, speeches, and the family\u2019s expectations. As a rabbi, I was the anchor for this young boy and his family, guiding them through a sacred milestone. Yet, as a step-child, I was expected to be present, attentive, and loving, especially since my father\u2019s passing. The phone kept ringing. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my stepmother\u2019s gentle need for connection, and the congregation\u2019s anticipation for spiritual leadership. My heart pounded as I wondered which role I would let down tonight, and the guilt of even having to choose gnawed at me."}
