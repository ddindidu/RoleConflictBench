My sister\u2019s text was warm, reminding me about tonight\u2019s family dinner\u2014Mom\u2019s birthday, everyone coming together, laughter and stories. I could almost taste the kugel and hear the teasing. But then, the call from the synagogue: Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s son, his voice trembling, asking if I could come right away. His mother had just passed, and the family needed me to lead the funeral service, to offer comfort and tradition in their grief.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a sibling, I knew how much my presence meant to my family, especially tonight. As a rabbi, I felt the weight of my duty to my congregants, to be there in their darkest moments. Both needed me, both expected me to show up, fully present. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, wishing I could split myself in two. I sat in my car, keys in hand, staring at the dashboard, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
