I knew I should gently correct him, teach him the importance of respect and discipline\u2014after all, as his mother, it was my responsibility to guide him in these small but meaningful ways. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She sounded distraught, asking if I had a moment to talk. As a pastor, I felt the weight of her need for spiritual comfort, the expectation that I would be there to listen and offer guidance. My son looked up at me, waiting for my attention, while my phone vibrated insistently in my hand. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my child who needed my presence and teaching, and toward my parishioner who needed my compassion and counsel. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, caught between the needs of my family and my calling."}
