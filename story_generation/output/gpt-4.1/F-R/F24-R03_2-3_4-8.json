It would mean a lot if you could come.\u201d I could almost hear her hopeful tone, the way she always tried to make me feel included, even though I still sometimes felt like an outsider at the table. My stepbrother had already texted, \u201cYou better not bail this time.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings mattered to them, how much they wanted me to be part of their world.\n\nBut in my other world, the convent halls were quiet, filled with the scent of old wood and candle wax. Mother Superior had just asked me to lead the daily reflections for our upcoming retreat\u2014a responsibility I\u2019d never held before. She\u2019d looked at me with such trust, expecting me to guide the sisters in prayer and contemplation, to be present in spirit and mind.\n\nThe two expectations pressed in on me, heavy and unyielding. I wanted to be there for my family, to show them I cared. But I also wanted to honor my commitment to my sisters, to serve as I\u2019d promised. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present in both places at once."}
