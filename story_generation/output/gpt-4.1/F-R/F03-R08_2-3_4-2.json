My relatives have traveled from far, and everyone expects me to join in the stories, laughter, and prayers that have defined our family for generations. Yet, as I nod, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the community Quran study circle meets in an hour. They\u2019ll be discussing verses I haven\u2019t yet read, and I know my presence is expected\u2014not just to listen, but to contribute thoughtfully, as a practicing Muslim should. My heart pounds with the weight of both worlds. I want to be the son my parents are proud of, upholding our cherished customs, but I also feel the pull of my faith, the need to deepen my understanding and connection with the Quran. The clock ticks, and I sit in my room, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet call of my faith, unsure which path to follow tonight."}
