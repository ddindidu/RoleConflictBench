My spouse moved around me, listing the chores still left before my relatives arrived tomorrow\u2014vacuuming, setting up the guest room, polishing the silverware. The house had to be perfect; it was expected, and I wanted to share the load, to be present and supportive. But my mind kept drifting to the half-written sermon on my desk upstairs. The High Holiday service was just days away, and the congregation would be looking to me for guidance, inspiration, and comfort. I could almost hear their voices, see their expectant faces. The weight of both worlds pressed on my shoulders. If I stayed here, I\u2019d be the partner I promised to be, but the words for my sermon would remain unwritten. If I left for my study, I\u2019d be the rabbi my community needed, but I\u2019d leave my spouse to carry the burden alone. My heart pounded as I dried my hands, torn between the two rooms, two roles, and the impossible choice that waited for me."}
