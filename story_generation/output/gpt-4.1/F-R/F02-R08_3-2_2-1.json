Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. Guilt pressed on me; this was the month I was supposed to be closest to Allah, to reflect and improve. Just as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in and discuss it immediately.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a father, I knew I needed to be there for my son, to guide him, to show him right from wrong. The school expected me to respond quickly, to take responsibility. But I also felt the weight of my spiritual commitment, the promise I\u2019d made to myself and to God. I stared at the Quran, then at my phone, feeling torn between the urgent needs of my child and the sacred duties of my faith. The clock ticked, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
