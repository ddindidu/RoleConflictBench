My stepbrother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something at school had gone wrong. As his step-sibling, I felt the pull to sit with him, to listen, to be the support he needed. But just as I reached for a glass of water to bring him, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had arrived, devastated by a sudden loss, and was asking for me. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, guidance, and a listening ear in moments like this. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds\u2014my brother\u2019s silent plea for comfort at home, and the community\u2019s desperate need for spiritual support. My heart ached, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
