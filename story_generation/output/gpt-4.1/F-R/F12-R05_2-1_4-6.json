My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, \u201cDid you remember to wash the kids\u2019 uniforms for tomorrow?\u201d I glanced at the overflowing laundry basket, guilt prickling at my conscience. I\u2019d promised to keep up with the chores this week, especially with the kids\u2019 schedules so packed. As I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed again\u2014an email from a young couple in the congregation. They wanted to meet, to talk about their wedding, and they were hoping I could officiate. The date was more than a year away, but they wanted to meet tonight, since they were only in town for the weekend. I could hear the kids arguing upstairs, the laundry still waiting, and my husband\u2019s footsteps coming closer. My mind raced, torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of my community. I stood in the laundry room, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
