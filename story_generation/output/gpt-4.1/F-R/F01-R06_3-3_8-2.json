My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about my grandson\u2019s trouble\u2014something serious, something that could change the course of his life. As a grandfather, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectation: to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. They needed me to be a steady presence, to keep the lines of communication open, especially now.\n\nBut as a Christian, I was torn. The crisis involved a moral failing, one that my faith taught me to address with honesty and integrity. I knew what the church would expect of me: to uphold the truth, to encourage repentance, to avoid enabling wrongdoing. Yet, my heart ached at the thought of causing more pain or shame to my grandson. I wrestled with the urge to protect him, to shield him from consequences, even as my conscience whispered about the importance of truth and accountability. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself caught between love and principle, unsure which path to take."}
