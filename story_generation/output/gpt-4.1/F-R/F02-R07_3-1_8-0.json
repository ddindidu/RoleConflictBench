The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a father, I know I must ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. Every rupee counts, and overtime at work is the only way I can make up the shortfall. My phone buzzes\u2014a gentle reminder from the temple. Tonight is the routine evening chant, a ceremony I have never missed. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to support the community, to nurture my own spiritual growth. My wife glances at me, sensing my tension. I feel torn. If I go to the temple, I lose precious hours I could spend working extra shifts. If I stay home or go to work, I neglect my spiritual duties and the community that relies on my presence. My heart aches with the pull of both worlds, each demanding more than I feel I can give. I close my eyes, the chanting from the temple echoing in my memory, the numbers on the bills whispering their own urgent song."}
