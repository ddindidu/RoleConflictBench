My daughter calls every day, reminding me how much the grandchildren are looking forward to our time together. As a grandparent, I know how important it is to be present, to listen to their stories, and to keep our family bonds strong. But this year, something weighs heavily on my mind. A close friend from our temple community is being treated unfairly by others, and I feel a deep responsibility, as a Hindu, to stand up for what is right. Dharma teaches me to act with courage and compassion, to not turn away from injustice. Yet, if I intervene, I risk upsetting the delicate peace in our community, and I may be distracted or even absent during the holiday. My heart aches as I wrestle with these demands\u2014my family expects my warmth and presence, but my conscience urges me to act. I sit quietly, torn between the love I owe my family and the duty I feel to my friend, unsure which path to take."}
