For years, I\u2019d been saving for this moment, setting aside every spare dollar, dreaming of standing in the holy city, fulfilling a pillar of my faith. But as I scrolled through the group chat, my sister\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me of the family trip we\u2019d planned for months. She\u2019d been looking forward to it, hoping it would bring us closer, especially after the arguments we\u2019d had lately. Including her in my life, making her feel valued, was something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d do better. Yet, the money I\u2019d saved for Hajj was exactly what we needed for the trip. My heart twisted, torn between the sacred journey I\u2019d longed for and the bond I was trying to rebuild with my sister. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each pulling me in a different direction, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
