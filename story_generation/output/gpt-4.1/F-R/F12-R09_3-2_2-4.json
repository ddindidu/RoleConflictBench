He needs me, now more than ever, and I can see the fear in his eyes. We\u2019re in a small town, far from home, and he asks if we can just sit together and eat, maybe find some comfort in a warm meal. I want to be there for him, to hold his hand and reassure him, to show him he\u2019s not alone. But as I scan the street, I realize the only kosher vendor is a tiny stand at the end of the block, and it\u2019s closing soon. If I insist on walking there, it means leaving him alone in his pain, even for a little while. If I stay, I\u2019ll have to break kosher, something I\u2019ve never done, something that feels like letting go of a piece of myself. My heart aches as I weigh his need for me against my need to honor my faith, both demands pressing in, neither willing to let go."}
