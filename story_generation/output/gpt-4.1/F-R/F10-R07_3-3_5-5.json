I know how much this means to her, to all of us\u2014honoring our ancestors, keeping our family\u2019s rituals alive. But as I looked at the clock, my heart tightened. In just an hour, I\u2019m supposed to guide the weekly meditation at the temple. As the group leader, everyone relies on me to create a space of calm and mindfulness, to help them find peace in their busy lives. I can\u2019t imagine letting them down, but I also can\u2019t bear the thought of disappointing my family. My mind races, torn between the quiet sanctuary of the temple and the warmth of my family\u2019s traditions. The incense in my hand feels heavier with every passing minute, and I can\u2019t escape the feeling that, no matter what I choose, a part of me will be left behind."}
