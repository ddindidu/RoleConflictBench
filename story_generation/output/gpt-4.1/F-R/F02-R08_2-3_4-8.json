Other shoppers glanced over, some with smiles, others with frowns. As a father, I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that we must be considerate of others. But my mind was elsewhere, heavy with the weight of another responsibility. My doctor\u2019s words echoed in my ears: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, you should go this year. Your health may not allow it later.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a pillar of my faith, and this might be my only chance. Yet, here I was, torn between correcting my son and planning for a journey that could change my life. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my son\u2019s need for guidance, my faith\u2019s call to fulfill a lifelong obligation. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, wrestling with the demands of being a good father and a devoted Muslim, unsure which voice to answer first."}
