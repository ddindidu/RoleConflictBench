Today was the day of our family\u2019s annual puja, and my parents had asked me to lead the rituals this year\u2014a sign that I was finally being trusted to uphold our traditions. As a son, I felt the weight of their expectations, the pride in their eyes when they handed me the sacred thread. But as a practicing Hindu, I also knew that the ceremony was supposed to start at the exact muhurat, the auspicious time, and I needed to be fully prepared, both spiritually and physically.\n\nAs I dressed in my kurta, my phone buzzed. My boss had scheduled an urgent virtual meeting at the same time as the ceremony. My parents expected me to honor our family\u2019s legacy, while my faith demanded my presence at the ritual. But my job, which helped support my family, was also on the line. My heart pounded as I stared at my reflection, torn between the son my parents wanted me to be and the Hindu I aspired to become. The clock ticked closer to the muhurat, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
