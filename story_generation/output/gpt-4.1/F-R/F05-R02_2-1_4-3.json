My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the kids need their uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of the laundry basket in my arms. The pile of clothes still waiting to be washed seemed to grow larger every time I glanced at it. I knew how much my wife counted on me to help keep the house running smoothly, especially on busy weeks like this.\n\nAs I set the basket down, I checked my phone. A message from Mark, a parishioner, blinked on the screen: \u201cHi, Father, I\u2019ve been struggling lately. Could we talk sometime soon?\u201d I could sense the heaviness behind his words, the kind of pain that doesn\u2019t wait for a convenient moment. As a priest, I\u2019m expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever someone reaches out.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. The washing machine hummed, a reminder of my family\u2019s needs, while Mark\u2019s message tugged at my conscience. Both roles demanded my presence, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
