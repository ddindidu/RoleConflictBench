My son darts away from me, weaving between displays, his laughter echoing down the aisle. I feel the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to rein him in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. I call his name, but he giggles and runs farther. I know I should stop, kneel down, and talk to him about proper behavior, about kindness and consideration\u2014values I want him to carry always.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: the study circle is in two hours. I haven\u2019t finished the assigned verses, let alone reflected on their meaning. As a Muslim, I want to honor my commitment to the community and to Allah, to come prepared and engaged. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my duty as a mother to guide my child, and my responsibility as a Muslim to deepen my faith. My heart pounds as I stand in the cereal aisle, torn between chasing after my son and the verses waiting for me at home."}
