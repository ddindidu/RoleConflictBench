My heart swelled with the urge to offer her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades, to sit with her and help untangle her worries. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for Maghrib. They needed me to lead the prayer, as I had so many times before. I looked at my granddaughter, her hopefulness so fragile, and then at the message, knowing the community was counting on me. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014my family needing my presence and guidance, my community expecting my leadership and devotion. I felt torn, caught between the love of a grandparent and the duty of an imam, unsure which call to answer first."}
