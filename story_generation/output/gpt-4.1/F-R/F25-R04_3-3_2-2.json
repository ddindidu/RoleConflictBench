My stepmother\u2019s name flashed on the screen, her messages piling up\u2014questions about my day, reminders to eat, a gentle nudge to call my father. Ever since I moved in, she\u2019s made it clear how much it means to her that I keep in touch, that I share the details of my life, that I answer quickly. It\u2019s her way of building trust, of making me feel part of the family. \n\nBut outside, the mosque was filling up. The air hummed with anticipation; tonight\u2019s remembrance was important, and the community expected me to lead. No one else was authorized, and the congregation was waiting. I could hear the shuffle of feet, the low murmur of voices, the weight of their expectation pressing through the walls. \n\nMy phone vibrated again. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me to be present, to respond, to show I cared. My community needed me to lead, to guide, to be unwavering. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same moment."}
