As his step-sibling, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoing in my mind: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d I wanted to tell him to stop, to wait until the ramp was fixed, but I knew how much he hated being told what to do.

My upbringing as a Hindu pressed on me\u2014the importance of dharma, of standing up for what\u2019s right, even in small ways. I felt torn, my attention split.
