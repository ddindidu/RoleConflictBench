My heart pounded. As a step-parent, I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him with fairness and love. But as a pastor, I was also preparing a sermon on forgiveness and redemption, urging my congregation to show compassion and understanding when others falter. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014should I be stern and enforce consequences, or should I embody the grace I preached every Sunday? My mind raced with the expectations of my spouse, the congregation, and my own conscience. I could feel the tension between justice and mercy twisting inside me, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the parent he needed and the spiritual guide I was called to be."}
