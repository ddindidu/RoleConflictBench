I\u2019d promised him, after all\u2014told him that if he did well in school, I\u2019d buy it for him. As a father, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy, to give him the childhood I never had. But as I glanced at the savings account on my phone, my heart tightened. The money I\u2019d set aside was barely enough for both the Nintendo and something far more important to me as a Muslim: Hajj. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014my health was failing, and this year might be my last chance to fulfill the sacred pilgrimage. My faith demanded I go, but my son\u2019s happiness tugged at me just as fiercely. I felt torn, caught between the duty to my family and the obligation to my faith, the weight of both pressing down on me as I tried to decide what to do."}
