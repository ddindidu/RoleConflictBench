My husband sits across from me, his eyes searching mine as he brings up the medical bills piling on the table. He wants us to talk honestly, to lay everything bare\u2014our fears, our plans, our hopes. As his wife, I know he expects me to be present, to listen, to share my thoughts openly. But my mind keeps drifting to the Quran on the shelf. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my daily readings. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, to reflect and reconnect with Allah, to not let worldly matters distract me from my faith. The weight of both expectations presses on my chest. I want to be the supportive wife he needs, but I also feel the pull of my spiritual duties, the guilt of falling short. My heart aches as I sit between him and the Quran, torn by the demands of love and devotion, unsure which voice to answer first."}
