The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and my son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable and that actions have consequences. My mind raced with the lessons I wanted to impart\u2014honesty, responsibility, discipline. But as I knelt beside him, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly meditation group was about to begin, and I was supposed to lead. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be calm, present, and compassionate, to guide others in mindfulness and not let anger or frustration cloud my actions. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me. Should I stay and address my son\u2019s mistake, risking the disappointment of my meditation group? Or should I rush to fulfill my commitment as a Buddhist leader, leaving this teachable moment unresolved? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the weight of both expectations, feeling the pull of duty in two directions at once."}
