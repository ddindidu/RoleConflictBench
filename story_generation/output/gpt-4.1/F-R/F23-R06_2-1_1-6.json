Tomorrow was Mia\u2019s open class at school, and she\u2019d asked if I could come. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me,\u201d she\u2019d whispered last night, her eyes hopeful. As her step-parent, I knew how much these moments mattered, how much she needed to feel seen and supported. But tomorrow was also the day I\u2019d promised to help at the church\u2019s soup kitchen, a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago. The pastor had reminded us just last Sunday: \u201cLet us love not with words or speech but with actions and in truth.\u201d I wanted to live out my faith, to show kindness to those who needed it most, just as Jesus taught. But how could I be in two places at once? If I missed Mia\u2019s class, would she feel abandoned again? If I skipped the soup kitchen, would I be turning my back on the very heart of my beliefs? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the child who needed me and the call to serve others. I sat in silence, wrestling with what love and responsibility truly meant."}
