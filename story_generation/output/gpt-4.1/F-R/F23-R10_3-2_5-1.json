The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a step-parent, I knew I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with firm but gentle discipline. My mind raced with the right words to say, the right example to set, but my heart pounded with anxiety\u2014would he see me as just another adult scolding him, or as someone who truly cared?\n\nAt the same time, I glanced at my watch. It was nearly sunset, the time I always reserved for my evening puja. Lighting the lamp, offering flowers, and chanting mantras brought me peace and reminded me of my values\u2014honesty, compassion, forgiveness. But now, I was torn. If I left the store quickly to keep my ritual, would I be neglecting my duty as a parent? If I stayed to address the situation, would I miss the sacred moment that anchored my day? The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I felt my breath catch, caught between two worlds, unsure which to honor first."}
