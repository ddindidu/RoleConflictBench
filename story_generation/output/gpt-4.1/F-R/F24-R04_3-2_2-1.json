His voice had cracked as he told me about the news\u2014his mother, my stepmother, was in the hospital, and things didn\u2019t look good. He needed me, he said, just to sit with him, to listen, to be there. I could hear the pain in his words, and I felt it too, a heavy ache in my chest. But as I stood to leave, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was out of town, and everyone was counting on me to lead Maghrib prayer. The congregation would be gathering soon, expecting guidance, calm, and presence. I stared at the wall, torn between the pull of family and the weight of my responsibility to the community. My heart raced as I tried to imagine being in two places at once, knowing I could not. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of both worlds pressing in on me, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t ready to give."}
