The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised the kids I\u2019d be there to pick them up. It was their last day, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014how much it meant to me, too, to show I was there for them, even if I wasn\u2019t their biological parent. Just as I reached for my car keys, Mrs. Carter appeared at my door, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed to talk, she said, about her marriage, about her faith, about feeling lost. As her pastor, I knew my presence and words could make a difference. But as a step-parent, I also knew the disappointment in my children\u2019s eyes if I wasn\u2019t there, again. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, to care, to show up. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, and for a moment, I just stood there, torn, unsure which promise to keep."}
