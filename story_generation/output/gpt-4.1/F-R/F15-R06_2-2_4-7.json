As a parent, I knew I had to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces, but my patience was wearing thin. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on us, expecting me to correct his behavior. At the same time, I noticed Mrs. Evans, a woman from our church, standing by the produce section, her face drawn with worry. I remembered the sermon about showing love and kindness, especially to those in need. I wanted to go to her, offer a listening ear, maybe even a prayer. But my son\u2019s laughter echoed, and I felt torn\u2014should I focus on guiding my child, or should I reach out to Mrs. Evans as my faith teaches? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good parent and a faithful Christian."}
