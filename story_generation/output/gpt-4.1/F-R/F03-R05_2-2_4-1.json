As a rabbi, I was expected to prepare a meaningful sermon for the upcoming Shabbat service\u2014something that would inspire and guide my congregation. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my family\u2019s recent insistence on upholding our old traditions. My mother had called earlier, her voice gentle but firm, reminding me that this week marked the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s passing, a time when our family always gathered for a special meal and prayers at home. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My congregation relied on me to be present, to lead them in worship and reflection. My family, on the other hand, needed me to honor our heritage, to be the son who kept our customs alive. The expectations clashed within me, each tugging at my sense of duty and belonging. I stared at the blank page, heart pounding, torn between the pulpit and the family table, unsure which path to choose."}
