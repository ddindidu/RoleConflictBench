She was facing a tough decision at work, torn between two job offers, and she needed me\u2014my advice, my encouragement, my presence. I could hear the strain in her words, the way she paused, waiting for me to fill the silence with reassurance. But outside my window, the temple bells rang, calling me to join my family for the festival rituals. As a Hindu, I was expected to be fully present, to participate in every ceremony, to honor my faith and ancestors. My relatives had traveled far, and my absence would be noticed, perhaps even judged. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my heart aching for my wife, my spirit bound by tradition. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be the husband she needed and the Hindu my family expected. The festival drums grew louder, and my wife\u2019s voice grew softer, and I sat there, torn, unable to move."}
