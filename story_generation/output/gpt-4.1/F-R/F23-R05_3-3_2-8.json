The principal\u2019s voice was tense: my stepson had been caught bullying another child, and they needed me to come in immediately. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up for him, to be present and supportive, especially in moments like this. I promised I\u2019d be there as soon as I could. But as I hung up, another call came through\u2014this time from the synagogue. Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s son, his voice trembling, told me his mother had passed away. The family needed me to officiate the funeral, and they wanted to hold the service as soon as possible, in accordance with Jewish tradition. My mind raced. My stepson needed me at the school, but my congregation needed me at the funeral home. Both expected my presence, my guidance, my compassion. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two families who needed me in different ways."}
