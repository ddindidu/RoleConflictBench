I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the heaviness in his words, the kind that only comes when he\u2019s truly struggling. As his sister, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, especially when he\u2019s hurting. But just as I was grabbing my keys, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was the synagogue coordinator. They needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and the grieving family would be left without the comfort of tradition. My heart twisted. My brother needed me, but so did my community. I stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of family and the call of faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
