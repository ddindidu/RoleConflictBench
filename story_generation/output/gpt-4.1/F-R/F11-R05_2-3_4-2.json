Everyone\u2019s coming.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family dinners were sacred, a rare chance for all of us to be together, to laugh and share stories. As a sister, I knew how much my presence meant, especially to my younger brother, who always looked for me at the table.\n\nBut on my desk, the open Torah and scattered notes reminded me of my other calling. The High Holiday sermon wasn\u2019t finished, and the congregation would be expecting something meaningful, something that would guide them through the year ahead. As their rabbi, I felt the weight of their trust, the responsibility to inspire and comfort.\n\nThe clock ticked louder. I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I missed dinner, the empty chair at the table. At the same time, I pictured the expectant faces in the sanctuary, waiting for words I hadn\u2019t yet found. My chest tightened as I tried to reconcile the two worlds, both demanding, both dear. I sat frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the call of the bimah, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
