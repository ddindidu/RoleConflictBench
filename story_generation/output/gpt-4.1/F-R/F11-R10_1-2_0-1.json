He\u2019d just been promoted at work, and he wanted the whole family to join him for a spontaneous dinner celebration. As his sister, I knew how much this meant to him. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, to cheer each other on at every milestone. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. It was almost dusk\u2014the time I set aside every day to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar, a ritual that grounds me in my faith as a Hindu. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever skip your evening prayers, no matter what.\u201d I felt torn, caught between the joy of being a supportive sister and the quiet pull of my spiritual duties. My phone buzzed again with my brother\u2019s message, and I stared at the flickering lamp on the altar, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
