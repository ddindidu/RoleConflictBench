Things have been heavy lately.\u201d As the imam, I knew my role was to be available, to offer guidance and a listening ear. But just as I started to reply, my mother entered the room, her face drawn and tired. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked about your father in days,\u201d she said quietly. Guilt pricked at me. I was supposed to check in, to be the daughter who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home. My parents needed me to be present, to ask, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d and truly listen. Yet, the community expected me to be available too, to offer comfort and wisdom whenever needed. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart aching with the weight of both responsibilities. I looked at my mother, then at my phone, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my community, unsure which call to answer first."}
