It\u2019s my mother, calling for our usual Sunday check-in. I know she\u2019s waiting to hear about my week, to share her stories, to feel that I\u2019m still close even though I live miles away. I promised her I\u2019d call at this time, every week, no matter what. But inside, the rabbi is searching the street, his eyes landing on me. They need one more for the minyan, just one more to say Kaddish for a grieving family. I can see the mourners, their faces drawn with sorrow, waiting for the prayer that can only happen if I step inside. My mother\u2019s ringtone keeps playing, insistent and familiar, tugging me toward my family\u2019s expectations. But my community needs me too, just for a few minutes, to fulfill a sacred obligation. I stand frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the voice of my mother and the call of my faith."}
