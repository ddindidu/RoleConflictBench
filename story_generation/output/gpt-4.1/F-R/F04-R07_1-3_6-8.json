You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I smiled, remembering how we\u2019d promised to include each other more, to build the kind of mutual respect that comes from simply showing up. But as I typed my reply, another message appeared\u2014this one from my Buddhist teacher, reminding me that I\u2019d agreed to present a summary of the Heart Sutra at tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I was supposed to spend the evening in quiet study and reflection, preparing my thoughts with care.\n\nI stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My sister expected me to be there, to laugh and share popcorn, to prove that family mattered. My teacher and my own spiritual path demanded solitude, focus, and reverence for the teachings. The two expectations pulled at me, each one valid, each one urgent. My heart raced as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, torn between the warmth of family and the peace of spiritual commitment. I sat in silence, phone in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
