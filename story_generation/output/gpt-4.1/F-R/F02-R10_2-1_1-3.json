My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in half an hour, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks. She wanted me there, front row, cheering her on. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. As I gathered my things, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the queue for the copier, bypassing others who\u2019d been waiting. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014right conduct\u2014even in minor matters. My conscience tugged at me, urging me to speak up, to gently remind him of fairness. But if I did, I\u2019d risk being late for my daughter\u2019s big moment. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the father who keeps his word, the Hindu who upholds righteousness. My mind raced, torn between the expectant eyes of my child and the quiet call of my principles."}
