His eyes, red from sleepless nights, searched my face for comfort. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my presence, my unwavering support as he faced the storm of his personal crisis. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to hold him, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But the bell from the chapel echoed through the halls, a reminder of my other life. Tonight, a special healing service was being held for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. The community expected my presence, my prayers, my devotion. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my vows as a nun, my promises as a spouse. My heart ached as I looked from the door to my partner\u2019s pleading eyes, torn between the sacred call of my faith and the desperate need of the person I loved most."}
