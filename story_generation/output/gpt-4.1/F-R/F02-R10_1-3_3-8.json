We had traveled for hours to reach the temple for the festival, and my family expected me to lead the rituals, to show devotion and respect for our traditions. The air was thick with the scent of incense, and the sound of bells echoed from the courtyard below. Yet, as I glanced at my son, I noticed his shirt was untucked, his hands sticky from sweets, and he was about to run outside without greeting the elders. As a father, I knew I should stop him, teach him to bow, to speak politely, to show respect\u2014these were the values I wanted to instill. But the priest was already calling for us, and my relatives waited, expecting me to join the ceremony without delay. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my faith against my responsibility to guide my child. I felt torn, caught between the pull of tradition and the quiet, persistent voice urging me to be the father my son needed in that moment."}
