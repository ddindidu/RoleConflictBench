As a grandmother, I know how much they look forward to our calls, especially during this season. My daughter has already sent a message, asking if I\u2019ll join the video call to see the little ones open their gifts. But as a nun, my life is woven into the rhythm of prayer and service. Today, Mother Superior announced a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who has grown so frail. It\u2019s at the same time as the family call\u2014outside our usual schedule, but deeply important to our community. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to be present for my family, to nurture those bonds, and the call to stand with my sisters in faith, offering prayers for healing. My heart aches, torn between the warmth of family and the solemn duty of prayer. I sit in my small room, phone in hand, rosary on the table, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
