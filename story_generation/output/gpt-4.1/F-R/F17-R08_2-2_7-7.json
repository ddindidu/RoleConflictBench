Lately, their faces seem more lined, their voices softer, weighed down by something I can\u2019t quite name. I know they count on me to be present, to listen, to help lighten their burdens with small acts of kindness and words of comfort. I want to be the child they need, the one who stays close and offers support, especially now.\n\nBut my heart aches with another longing. This year, my friends are going to Hajj, and I have enough savings set aside. It\u2019s a dream I\u2019ve carried for so long\u2014to fulfill this pillar of my faith, to stand in the holy places and feel the closeness to Allah. The opportunity may not come again soon. Yet, if I go, I\u2019ll leave my parents alone when they seem to need me most. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the chance to answer a sacred call. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I find myself torn, unable to see a path that doesn\u2019t leave something important behind."}
