She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the weight I carried, but my mind was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, Brother Ahmed had called, his voice trembling as he asked if I could meet him tonight. He said he couldn\u2019t wait\u2014his family was falling apart, and he needed guidance. As an imam, I felt the pull of duty, the expectation to be present for my community, to offer counsel and comfort. But here, at home, my wife needed me too, needed my honesty and attention. I could see the disappointment flicker across her face as I hesitated, torn between the urge to confide in her and the responsibility to answer Ahmed\u2019s plea. My heart ached, caught between the demands of my faith and the quiet plea for connection from the person I loved most."}
