He wanted to share every detail, and I could hear in his tone how much it meant to him that I listened. As his grandfather, I know how important it is to be present, to show him that his joys matter to me, to keep our bond strong through regular conversations. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the synagogue service would begin soon. As a Jew, I\u2019ve always felt a deep responsibility to attend, to be part of the community, to honor our traditions. Even though the minyan would be complete without me, I know my presence is valued, and I feel the weight of that expectation. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my grandson\u2019s happiness and toward my commitment to my faith. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of family and the pull of tradition, unsure which path to follow."}
