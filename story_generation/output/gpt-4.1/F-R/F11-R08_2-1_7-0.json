The house was peaceful, and I felt a sense of calm settle over me as I opened the holy book. Just then, my younger sister burst into my room, her face flushed with frustration. She wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about something that had been bothering her, something we\u2019d disagreed on before. I could see she needed me to listen, to be patient and understanding, to show her the respect she deserved as my sister, even though our views clashed.\n\nBut as she started to speak, I felt a tug inside me. I wanted to be there for her, to build that mutual respect, but I also felt the pull of my faith, the quiet call to spend this precious time with the Quran. The expectations of being a good sister and a devoted Muslim pressed in on me from both sides, and I sat there, torn, my heart wrestling with the weight of both roles."}
