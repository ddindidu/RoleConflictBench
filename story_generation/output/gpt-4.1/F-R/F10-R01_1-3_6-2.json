She was in crisis, her words trembling on the screen: \u201cCan you talk? I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As her pastor, I knew she needed spiritual guidance, someone to help her navigate the storm she was facing. But just as I was about to call her, my mother walked in, her face drawn and tired. \u201cIs everything okay at work, Mom?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but I could see the worry in her eyes. She hesitated, then shook her head, brushing it off. I knew she needed me to listen, to be her daughter, to offer comfort and support. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my mother\u2019s silent plea for reassurance, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s urgent need for counsel. I stared at my phone, torn between the roles I was expected to fill, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing in on me."}
