My son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me during the same time as our church\u2019s weekly service\u2014a service I rarely missed, where I was expected to help lead the youth group. As a father, I knew I needed to be there for my son, to show him that his actions had consequences but also that he was loved and supported. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to the church community, the expectation that I would be present, setting an example for others. I could already imagine the disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes if I didn\u2019t show up, and the questions from other parents. My mind raced, torn between the needs of my child and the responsibilities I felt to my faith and community. I stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure build, unsure which path to take."}
