My grandson, Daniel, just landed his first job, and the whole family is gathering for lunch to celebrate. As a grandmother, I know how much it means to be present, to listen to Daniel\u2019s stories, to share in his joy. My daughter\u2019s words linger in my mind: \u201cIt would mean so much to him if you could come, Mom.\u201d\n\nBut as I hang up, the convent bell tolls, reminding me of my other life. Today is the monthly food drive, and I am expected to help prepare meals and distribute them at the shelter. The sisters rely on me; the people we serve look for my familiar face. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds\u2014my family\u2019s happiness, my community\u2019s need. I pace my small room, torn between the laughter waiting at my daughter\u2019s table and the quiet, urgent work of service. The clock ticks, and I feel the pressure mounting, knowing I cannot be in two places at once."}
