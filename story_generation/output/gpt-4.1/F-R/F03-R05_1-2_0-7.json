Dad isn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d Guilt pricks at me; it\u2019s been a week since I last checked in, and I know how much my parents value our regular conversations, especially now that they\u2019re getting older. But as I start to type a reply, my mind is already racing ahead to tomorrow\u2019s bar mitzvah. Months of preparation have led to this moment for the family, and as their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be fully present\u2014guiding, supporting, and celebrating with them. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. My parents need reassurance and connection, but the congregation expects my undivided attention. I stare at my phone, torn between the son who wants to comfort his parents and the rabbi who must honor his commitment. My heart aches with the impossibility of being in two places at once, and I wonder how I can possibly choose."}
