It was Sunday, the day I usually sent her a message to check in, to let her know I was thinking of her and Dad. She always said it meant a lot, especially since I wasn\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d child, and I knew how much she valued these small gestures. But as I started to type, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a call from the synagogue. One of our oldest congregants had passed away unexpectedly, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My mind raced with the logistics: preparing the eulogy, comforting the mourners, arranging the service. I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, but at the same time, the guilt of neglecting my stepmother tugged at my heart. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both needed me now. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between duty and family, as the minutes slipped by."}
