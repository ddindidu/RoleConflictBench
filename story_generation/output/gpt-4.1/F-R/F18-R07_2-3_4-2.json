My older sister\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late. Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, pulling me into the comfort of our family rituals. But my mind kept drifting to the monastery, where the annual festival preparations would begin before sunrise. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019d promised to help set up the altar and greet the monks\u2014an honor, but also a responsibility I cherished. The festival only happened once a year, and the community counted on dedicated volunteers like me. Yet, my family expected me at the table, laughing and sharing stories, just as I always had.
