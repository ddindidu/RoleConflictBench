It was a message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. My stepmother called from the kitchen, reminding me how important it was for me to be present this year, to help the family feel whole. I could hear the hope in her voice, the unspoken plea to bridge the awkward gaps that still lingered between us. But as the imam, I knew the community expected me to be available, especially in moments of crisis. The thought of someone sitting alone in the prayer hall, waiting for comfort, tugged at me. My heart twisted, caught between the warmth of family and the weight of spiritual duty. I stood in the hallway, suitcase in hand, torn by the impossible choice between being the brother my family needed and the imam my community depended on."}
