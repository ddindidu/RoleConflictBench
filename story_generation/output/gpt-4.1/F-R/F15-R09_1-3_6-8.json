I\u2019d promised him the game console if I got my bonus, and now that the money was in my account, I knew how much it meant to him. He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, and I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up. But as I was about to click \u201cbuy,\u201d my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the synagogue. There was a funeral prayer, and they needed one more for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and I knew how important it was in our community to honor the dead. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d have to dip into the Nintendo money for a cab, and I might not have enough left. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community. I felt torn, the weight of my son\u2019s trust and my faith pressing on me from both sides, and I sat frozen, unable to move."}
