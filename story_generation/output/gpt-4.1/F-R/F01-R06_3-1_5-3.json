She sounded worried\u2014my grandson had a fever, and she needed help watching the other kids. As a grandfather, I knew my family counted on me, especially in moments like this. I could already picture the little ones\u2019 faces lighting up when I walked through the door, the comfort my presence would bring.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the church bell would soon ring. Sunday worship was more than a routine; it was a cornerstone of my faith, a time to gather with my Christian community, to pray, sing, and serve. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s urgent need and my commitment to God and the church. My heart ached, torn between the warmth of my grandchildren\u2019s embrace and the peace I found in worship. I sat there, hands trembling slightly, wrestling with the expectations of both roles, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
