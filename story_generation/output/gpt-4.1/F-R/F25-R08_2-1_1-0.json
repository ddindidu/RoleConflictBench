I settle onto my bed, the Quran resting on my lap, its familiar pages inviting me to recite and reflect. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week\u2014a rare evening with no schoolwork, no chores, just time for myself and my faith. As I begin to read, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder: \u201cCall Mom and Dad.\u201d My step-parents expect me to check in every week, to share updates and ask about their health. They say it\u2019s important to keep the family close, especially since I\u2019m not their biological child. I know how much it means to them, and I don\u2019t want to disappoint. But tonight, I crave the peace of my own company, the comfort of my faith. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the duty of family, and the spiritual nourishment I desperately need. I stare at the phone, torn, the words of the Quran blurring as I wrestle with what to do next."}
