She wanted me there, to see her read aloud and show me her artwork. I knew how much it meant to her, and as her mother, I wanted nothing more than to be present, to cheer her on and make her feel proud.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a time I cherished for quiet reflection and learning. We were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been waiting for, one that promised insight into letting go of attachment and finding inner peace. My friends would expect me there, and I felt a responsibility to contribute to the discussion.\n\nThe two events overlapped perfectly, forcing me to choose. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest no matter which way I leaned. Was I a better mother if I went to the school, or a better Buddhist if I honored my commitment to the sangha? I closed my eyes, wishing for clarity, but the conflict only grew sharper as the clock ticked closer to evening."}
