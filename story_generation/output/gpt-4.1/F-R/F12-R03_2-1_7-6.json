This was my sacred hour, a rare moment of stillness for spiritual reading and reflection. As a nun, I cherished these times, feeling closest to God in the quiet. But today, my husband lingered in the doorway, his brow furrowed, eyes distant. I knew that look\u2014he was carrying something heavy. As his wife, I was expected to reach out, to ask, to listen, to share my own worries and invite his. We had promised each other openness, to never let silence grow between us. Yet, the pull of my spiritual commitment was strong; I longed for solitude, for the peace that came only in prayer. My heart ached with the tension\u2014should I close the book and open my arms, or remain in the sanctuary of my faith? The weight of both vows pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each deserving it. I looked at him, then at the words before me, torn between two worlds that both claimed my soul."}
