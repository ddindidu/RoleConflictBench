Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much these gatherings mean to everyone. As the oldest sister, I\u2019ve always been the one to rally everyone together, to make sure laughter fills the room and old stories are retold.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and tonight she wanted to talk. As her pastor, I knew how much she depended on me for comfort and guidance, especially during these hard times. My heart ached, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s expectations and the needs of someone who looked to me for spiritual support. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
