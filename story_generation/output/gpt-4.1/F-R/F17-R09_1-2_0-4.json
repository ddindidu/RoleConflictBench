It\u2019s my mom, sending her usual weekend text: \u201cHow are you? Did you eat?\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t answer quickly, and I want to reassure her, to be the good child who checks in. But I\u2019m also hungry, and the only food nearby is from a tiny vendor with a faded kosher certificate in the window. I want to trust it, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still valid. My stomach growls, and I feel the weight of my Jewish upbringing\u2014how important it is to keep kosher, to honor my family\u2019s traditions. I stare at my phone, torn between texting my mom back right away, like she expects, and taking the time to double-check the vendor\u2019s kosher status, which might mean not replying for a while. The pressure builds inside me, the need to be a good child and a good Jew pulling me in different directions, and I can\u2019t decide which expectation matters more in this moment."}
