Today was my daughter\u2019s open class at school, and she had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she mentioned showing me her artwork. As a parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. \n\nBut as I hurried down the street, I caught sight of the vibrant colors and heard the familiar chants of a Hindu festival unfolding nearby. The air was thick with the scent of incense and marigolds, and I felt a pull in my chest. My community expected me to participate, to join in the prayers and rituals that connected us all. I paused, torn between the joyful chaos of the festival and the quiet anticipation of my daughter waiting at school. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, feeling the expectations of both worlds pressing in on me, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am."}
