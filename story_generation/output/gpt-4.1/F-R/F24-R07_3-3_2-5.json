He\u2019d just found out his biological father was moving overseas, and the pain in his words was raw. As his step-sibling, I knew I should be there for him, offer comfort, maybe even just sit in silence together. But my eyes kept darting to the clock. In twenty minutes, I was supposed to lead the weekly meditation group at the temple\u2014a responsibility I took seriously as a practicing Buddhist. The group relied on me to guide them in mindfulness, to help them find peace in their own lives. My mind raced, torn between the urge to stay and support my stepbrother and the commitment I\u2019d made to my sangha. I could hear the expectation in his voice, the silent plea not to be left alone, and at the same time, I felt the weight of my spiritual duty. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my breath, caught between two worlds, both needing me in different ways."}
