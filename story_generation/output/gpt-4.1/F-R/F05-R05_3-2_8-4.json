She needed me to be present, to talk openly about our options, to share my fears and hopes. I could see the worry in her face, the way she twisted her wedding ring, waiting for me to say something real. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin at the synagogue. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s parsha, to answer their questions with patience and wisdom. The community counted on me to show up, to teach, to lead by example. My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she asked, \u201cCan we finish this now?\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the husband she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my students down. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which part of myself I could set aside, even for just an hour."}
