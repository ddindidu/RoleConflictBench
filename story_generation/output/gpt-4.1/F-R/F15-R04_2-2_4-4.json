The supermarket was crowded, and my son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him discipline, to guide him gently but firmly, especially in public. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that I was the only imam scheduled for today\u2019s Friday sermon. The community had been looking forward to my khutbah, and I knew how much they valued punctuality and preparation. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the mosque on time, but my son\u2019s behavior needed immediate attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my duty to my child, to shape his character, and my responsibility to my congregation, who expected spiritual guidance and leadership. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation I could afford to disappoint, feeling torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
