The exam\u2019s tomorrow and I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d I could almost hear his voice trembling, and I knew he needed me\u2014just to listen, to reassure him, to remind him he\u2019s not alone. That\u2019s what siblings do, especially when the world feels overwhelming. But as I reached for my coat, Sister Maria appeared in the hallway, her face grave. \u201cThe mayor just called. The hurricane\u2019s left so many without homes. We\u2019re needed at the shelter\u2014now. They want me to help organize the relief effort, and I need you by my side.\u201d My heart twisted. The community expected me, as a nun, to serve selflessly, to put others\u2019 needs first, especially in a crisis. But my brother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, raw and vulnerable. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of family and the call of duty, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, right now."}
