The rent is due next week, and the grocery list on the fridge grows longer every day. My boss just called\u2014there\u2019s an extra shift available at the store, but it\u2019s on Saturday morning. I know we need the money; my children\u2019s shoes are worn thin, and the fridge is nearly empty. But this Saturday isn\u2019t just any Saturday. I\u2019ve been asked to chant Torah at synagogue, something I haven\u2019t done in years. The rabbi called me personally, saying how meaningful it would be for the community. My mother would be so proud. I can already picture my children watching me from the pews, their eyes wide. But if I don\u2019t take the shift, how will I pay for what they need? I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my duty as a mother to provide, and my commitment as a Jew to honor Shabbat and my community. My hands tremble as I try to decide which expectation I can bear to disappoint."}
