I glanced at the clock\u2014already past noon. I hadn\u2019t replied to her morning check-in yet, and guilt pricked at me. She and Dad expected daily updates, little details about my life, and quick responses. It was our way of staying close, especially after the awkwardness of blending families. But as I started typing a reply, a knock sounded at my office door. Mrs. Carter, eyes red and voice trembling, stepped in. She needed to talk\u2014her son was in trouble again, and she was desperate for guidance. As her pastor, I knew she needed my full attention, my patience, my prayers. My phone vibrated again, another message from home. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be present for my family, to reassure them I cared, and the call to shepherd my congregation, to be the steady support they counted on. My hands shook as I tried to decide which message to answer first, heart torn between two families who needed me in different ways."}
