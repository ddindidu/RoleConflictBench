She looked up and smiled, but I could sense something was off. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, sitting beside her. She shrugged, \u201cJust the usual office drama. Nothing big.\u201d I knew she wanted me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. As her husband, I felt the pull to set aside everything else and give her my full attention, to be the support she needed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from a church friend\u2014urgent, asking for help with a situation that challenged my faith and morals. It was a call to stand up for what I believed in, to act according to my Christian values, even though it might mean stepping away from my wife when she needed me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me. I wanted to be the husband she deserved, but I also felt the responsibility to live out my faith. My heart ached as I sat there, torn between comforting the woman I loved and answering a call that tested my commitment to my beliefs."}
