I could see the anxiety in her eyes, the way she bit her lip and blinked back tears. As her sibling, I knew she needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to just be there in the quiet of our shared room. But tonight was also the memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I had promised to attend as part of my Buddhist practice. The community expected my presence, and I felt a deep responsibility to honor the rituals, to support others in their grief, and to uphold the teachings I valued. My heart pulled in two directions: the warmth of my sister\u2019s need and the solemn call of my spiritual community. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which path to follow."}
