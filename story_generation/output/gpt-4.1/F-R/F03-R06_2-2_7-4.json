At dinner, my mom barely touched her food, and my dad kept sighing, lost in thought. I know they need me now, maybe more than ever, to sit with them, listen, and just be present. But this Sunday, like every week, my church expects me to be there\u2014worshipping, volunteering, connecting with my faith community. I believe in the importance of being part of the church, not just for myself but as a way to serve God. Yet, as I watch my parents, I feel torn. If I stay home, I can comfort them, maybe ease their burden a little. If I go to church, I honor my commitment to my faith and my community. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I find myself caught in the middle, heart aching, unsure which path to take."}
