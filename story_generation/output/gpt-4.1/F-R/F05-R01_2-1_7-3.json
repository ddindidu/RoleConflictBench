I knew I should ask her what was wrong, open up about my own worries, and be the husband she needed\u2014someone who listens, who shares, who is present. But my phone buzzed again, a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of our congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to check in, to offer comfort and a listening ear. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife needed me here, fully, to talk and to share, but Mrs. Carter was waiting for a word of encouragement, a reminder that she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my attention, each expectation valid and urgent. I stared at my phone, then at my wife, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, unsure which call to answer first."}
