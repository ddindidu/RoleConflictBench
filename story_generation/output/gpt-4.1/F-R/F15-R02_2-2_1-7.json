My daughter\u2019s open class at school was scheduled for the same afternoon as the parish\u2019s weekly religious education class. As a parent, I knew how much it meant to her for me to be there, to watch her read aloud and see her proud smile when she spotted me in the crowd. She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I would come. But as a priest, I was responsible for leading the children\u2019s class at church, a commitment I had made to the families who trusted me to guide their children\u2019s faith. Parents had already called to confirm, and the lesson I\u2019d planned was important. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I missed the school event, I\u2019d disappoint my daughter. If I canceled the class, I\u2019d let down the parish families. My mind raced, searching for a solution, but the clock kept ticking, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
