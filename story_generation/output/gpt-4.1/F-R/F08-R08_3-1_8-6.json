My daughter had just confided in me about her struggles\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she needed me. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of my duty: to be present, to offer comfort, to keep our family close through regular calls and visits. But as I listened to her voice tremble, my mind wandered to the savings jar on my dresser. I had been putting away every spare coin, hoping to fulfill my dream of performing Hajj, a pillar of my faith. The cost was steep, and I was still early in my career, barely making ends meet. If I sent money to help my daughter now, it would set me back years. Yet, how could I turn away from her in her time of need? The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s reliance on me, and my own longing to answer Allah\u2019s call. I closed my eyes, torn between the love for my family and the devotion to my faith, unsure which path to choose."}
