She smiled, reminding me how our family always wore bright, comfortable clothes at home, especially when we spent the day together. \u201cIt\u2019s our tradition,\u201d she said, her voice warm but firm. I knew how much it meant to her, especially now that she\u2019d been talking more about keeping our customs alive. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of my own beliefs pressing in. Even at home, I wanted to dress modestly, to cover my arms and legs as I always did. The thought of wearing something that didn\u2019t align with my faith made my heart race. I could see my mother\u2019s hope in her eyes, and I could feel my own need to stay true to my values. The two expectations pulled at me, each one heavy and important. I stared at the dress, torn between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and following what I believed was right."}
