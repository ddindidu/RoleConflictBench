Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, but my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cCall Mom and Dad.\u201d Every week, I call my step-parents to check in, share updates, and ask about their health. They look forward to these calls, especially since I moved out. I know how much it means to them, and I don\u2019t want to disappoint.\n\nBut as I glance at the clock, I realize that if I call now, I\u2019ll lose the quiet time I set aside for the Quran. Guilt tugs at me from both sides\u2014my step-parents\u2019 voices in my head, hoping for connection, and my own heart, longing to reconnect with my faith during this sacred month. I stare at the phone, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
