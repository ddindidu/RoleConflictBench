We needed to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up and the choices we\u2019d have to make. As his wife, I knew I owed him honesty, openness, and my full attention. He needed to know everything, even the things I was ashamed to admit: the credit card I\u2019d used for groceries, the late payment I\u2019d hidden. I wanted to be the partner he could trust, to communicate openly, just as we\u2019d promised each other.\n\nBut as he spoke, my mind drifted to Sunday. I hadn\u2019t been to church in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when things calmed down. My faith taught me to gather with others, to worship, to serve. I felt the weight of that expectation, the gentle but persistent tug of my Christian community. I wanted to be present for them, too.\n\nThe two roles pressed in on me\u2014my husband\u2019s need for honesty, my faith\u2019s call to worship. I felt torn, wondering how to be both the wife he needed and the Christian I longed to be, unsure which voice to answer first."}
