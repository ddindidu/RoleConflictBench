The local temple was alive with celebration\u2014today was a festival day, and I felt a pull to join in, to be part of the rituals and the joy that comes with being Hindu. I lingered at the edge of the crowd, watching women in colorful saris light lamps and children my age laughing as they circled the temple. My heart ached to be among them, to feel the warmth of the community and the comfort of tradition.\n\nBut then I remembered my parents waiting at home. Lately, they seemed quieter, more tired, and I\u2019d promised myself to check in on them, to ask if everything was okay. They counted on me to notice, to care, to be the child who offered support when things felt heavy. I stood there, torn between the call of my faith and the needs of my family, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
