I knew I should ask him if everything was alright, offer the support he always said meant so much to him. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. He needed to meet with me soon, he said, his family was falling apart and he didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As an imam, I was expected to be there for my community, to listen, to guide, to help them find peace. But as a step-child, I was supposed to be present for my parents, to check in, to show I cared. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my time, my empathy, my presence. I looked at my stepfather, then at my phone, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me. I wanted to be there for both, but I could already sense that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
