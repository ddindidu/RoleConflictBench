My daughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d sent a photo of her first day, beaming with pride. I knew she expected me to call, to share in her excitement, to be the supportive grandparent who always keeps in touch. At the same time, I\u2019d just received a text from Mrs. Evans, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to check in on her. She needed a listening ear, a gentle word from her pastor, someone to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. My family needed my presence, my encouragement, my joy. My congregation needed my compassion, my guidance, my time. I wanted to be there for both, but the clock ticked on, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart tugged in both directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to make first."}
