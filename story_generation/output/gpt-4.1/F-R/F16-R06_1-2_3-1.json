We\u2019d agreed, after a few tense conversations, that I\u2019d take care of folding this week. But as I reached for a towel, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a friend in crisis, asking for help. She\u2019d made a mistake, one that went against everything I\u2019d been taught as a Christian, and she was desperate for support, not judgment. I knew what my faith asked of me: compassion, forgiveness, and time to listen. But I also knew my spouse was counting on me to keep my word, to show that I valued our partnership by doing my part at home. The laundry wasn\u2019t just laundry; it was a symbol of trust between us. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the friend who needed grace, and the spouse who needed reliability. I stood there, laundry in hand, torn between the call to serve my faith and the promise I\u2019d made at home, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
