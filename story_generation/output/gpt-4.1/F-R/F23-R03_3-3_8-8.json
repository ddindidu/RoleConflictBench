My husband\u2019s children were upstairs, their laughter echoing through the house\u2014a reminder of the family I was now responsible for. The repayment deadline loomed, and I knew I needed to pick up extra shifts at the school to ensure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent: Mother Superior wanted me to lead daily reflections for the upcoming retreat. It was an honor, a sacred duty, and I felt the weight of her trust. But the retreat would mean days away from work, away from the income we desperately needed. My heart twisted as I imagined disappointing the children, failing to provide the stability they craved, or letting down my sisters in faith. I closed my eyes, torn between the demands of my family and my calling, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
