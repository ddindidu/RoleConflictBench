He was determined to master a new skateboard trick, but I could see the risk in every jagged edge and loose board. As his older sibling, I felt a knot of worry twist in my stomach\u2014my parents always said I was responsible for his safety when they weren\u2019t home. But today was Friday, and I was also the imam at our local mosque. The congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. \n\nAn invited guest speaker was ready and willing to step in, but I knew some community members would be disappointed if I wasn\u2019t there. My phone buzzed with a reminder: only thirty minutes until the sermon. I glanced at my brother, who was already rolling toward the ramp, and then at the clock. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own consequences. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the pulpit and the ramp, unable to move."}
