You promised!\u201d My heart sank. I had promised, and I knew how much it meant to her that I include her in my life, that we build the kind of mutual respect and closeness we\u2019d always talked about. But as I looked at the clock, I remembered the family ceremony tonight\u2014an important Hindu puja that my parents had been preparing for all week. They expected me to be there, dressed in traditional clothes, on time, to participate fully in the rituals. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions, especially during festivals. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my sister\u2019s anticipation and the weight of my family\u2019s expectations. I wanted to be a good brother, to make her feel included, but I also felt the pull of my faith and the responsibility to my family. The two worlds pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, unable to decide which promise to keep."}
