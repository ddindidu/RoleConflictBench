The supermarket was crowded, and my son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior. But my phone buzzed again\u2014reminders from the mosque committee.

I imagined the congregation waiting, the anticipation in their eyes, the trust they placed in me as their imam. Yet here I was, torn, watching my son\u2019s small figure disappear behind a display.
