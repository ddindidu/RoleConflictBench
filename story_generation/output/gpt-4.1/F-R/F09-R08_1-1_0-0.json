My children would be finishing school soon, and I always made it a point to be there, waiting at the gate with a smile, ready to hear about their day. It was a promise I made to myself as a mother\u2014to be present, to show up, to make them feel seen. But today, as the house settled into a rare hush and the sun cast a warm glow through the window, my heart yearned for something else. The Quran sat on the table, its pages inviting me to recite and reflect, to nourish my soul in the quiet I so seldom found. As a Muslim, I felt the pull of spiritual duty, the longing to connect with Allah in these precious, undisturbed moments. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each important, each deserving. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of my children\u2019s embrace and the peace I found in my faith. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart heavy, caught between two worlds that meant everything to me."}
