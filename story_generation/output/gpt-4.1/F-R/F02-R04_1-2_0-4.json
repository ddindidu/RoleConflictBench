At the same time, my notes for the Friday sermon lay open before me, the topic\u2014\u201cMercy in Our Lives\u201d\u2014already announced to the congregation. As the only imam scheduled, I knew the community expected me to stand on the minbar, guiding them with words I\u2019d spent days preparing. My heart tugged in two directions: the proud father wanting to be there for his children\u2019s milestone, and the imam, bound by duty to his community. I could picture the disappointment in my children\u2019s eyes if I wasn\u2019t there, and the confusion among the worshippers if the sermon was left undelivered. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each deserving it. I sat in my office, torn, the call to prayer echoing faintly in the background, as I wrestled with which part of myself I would have to let down."}
