She wants to know everything\u2014what I ate, who I met, how I\u2019m feeling. I know it\u2019s her way of showing love, and as her child, I want to honor that. Tonight, though, I\u2019m struggling. Earlier, I witnessed a classmate being bullied, and I didn\u2019t step in. I feel guilty, knowing that as a Christian, I should have acted with courage and compassion. My conscience nags at me to confess this to my mom, to seek her advice and maybe even pray together. But I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be disappointed, or worse, worried about the kind of person I\u2019m becoming. I stare at my phone, her message blinking: \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I want to be honest, to live by my faith\u2019s values, but I also want to protect her from worry and keep our conversation light, as she prefers. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the child who wants to reassure her and the Christian who feels compelled to tell the truth."}
