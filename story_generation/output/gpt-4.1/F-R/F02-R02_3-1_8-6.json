The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a father, I knew I had to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. My wife glanced at me, concern in her eyes, and I forced a reassuring smile. But my phone buzzed, a reminder flashing: \u201cFaith Formation Planning Meeting \u2013 7:00 PM.\u201d As the parish priest, everyone expected me to lead the new season\u2019s adult classes, to inspire and organize, to be present and prepared. I could already picture the committee waiting for me, eager for guidance. But I also knew I needed this evening to review our finances, to figure out how to keep our home secure. My mind raced, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my parish. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
