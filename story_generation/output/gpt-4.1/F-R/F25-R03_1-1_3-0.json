My stepmother had spent days preparing, reminding me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s traditions, especially now that I was part of them. I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for me to belong, to help set the table and light the candles as we always did.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the monthly food drive at the convent. As a nun, I was expected to be there, serving the community, offering comfort and sustenance to those who had nothing. The sisters counted on me, and I knew how much the shelter relied on our help.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet call of my vows. My stepmother\u2019s voice floated from the kitchen, asking if I\u2019d join them soon. At the same time, I pictured the faces at the shelter, waiting for us. My heart ached, pulled in two directions, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
