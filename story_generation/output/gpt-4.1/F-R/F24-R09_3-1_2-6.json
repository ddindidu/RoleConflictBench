He\u2019d just found out his mom was seriously ill, and I could hear the fear in every word. I wanted to be there for him, to sit with him, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d have each other\u2019s backs. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart twisted. It was almost time for Friday night services at synagogue. My family expects me to go, and I know how important it is to keep that tradition, to show up and be counted, especially as a sign of respect for our faith. I could hear my mom downstairs, already calling for me to get ready. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to comfort my stepbrother, the other pulled by the weight of my Jewish identity and the expectations that come with it. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out what to do, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
