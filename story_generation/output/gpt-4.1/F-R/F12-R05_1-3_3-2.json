My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cDid you get a chance to fold the clothes?\u201d I nod, though I haven\u2019t. I promised I\u2019d help more, that we\u2019d share the load, but my laptop is open on the dining table, pages of notes scattered around it. The High Holiday sermon is only days away, and the congregation expects something meaningful, something that will touch their hearts and guide them into the new year. I feel the weight of their anticipation, the sacred responsibility of my role as rabbi. But here, in my own home, I am a wife, expected to be present, to keep our lives running smoothly. My mind races between the spiritual needs of my community and the practical needs of my family. I clutch a wrinkled shirt, guilt prickling at my skin, torn between the sermon that must be written and the laundry that must be folded, wondering how I can possibly be enough for both."}
