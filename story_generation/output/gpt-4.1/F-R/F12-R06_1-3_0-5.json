My husband slumped onto the couch, sighing as he recounted his day\u2014nothing dramatic, just the usual office frustrations. I could see the tiredness in his eyes, the subtle plea for comfort. As his wife, I wanted to sit beside him, listen, and offer the warmth he needed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the church\u2019s weekly service, and I was expected not just to attend, but to help with the community dinner afterward. As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present, to serve, to worship with my church family. Yet, as a wife, I felt the pull to stay home, to be the support my husband quietly asked for. My heart twisted, caught between the gentle call of faith and the immediate need of the person I loved most. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn by the weight of both expectations, unsure which path to take."}
