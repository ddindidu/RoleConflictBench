My daughter called out, her voice tight with worry\u2014my presence was needed. Something serious had happened, and as the grandmother, I was expected to comfort, to guide, to be the steady hand in the storm. Yet, as I stood, I felt the weight of another expectation pressing on me. As a Hindu, my daily rituals are not just habits; they are my anchor, my way of connecting with the divine. Today, I had only managed to quietly repeat a short mantra, unable to perform the full puja with incense and offerings. Guilt gnawed at me. My family needed me, but so did my faith. I could feel the pull from both sides, each demanding my time, my heart. I lingered in the hallway, torn between the sacred and the familial, unsure which path to take next."}
