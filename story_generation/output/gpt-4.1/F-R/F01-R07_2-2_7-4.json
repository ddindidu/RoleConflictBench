She wanted to share every detail, and I listened, feeling the warmth of our connection. As a grandfather, I know how important it is to be present, to encourage her, to show that I care about her happiness and success. She asked if I could join the family video call this evening, so everyone could celebrate together.\n\nBut today is also the day of my weekly group meditation. As a Buddhist, I have committed to this hour of mindfulness, a time to cultivate inner peace and clarity. The group relies on my presence, and I rely on this practice to keep my mind steady and compassionate. The meditation session overlaps with the family call. I feel the tension rising in my chest\u2014my heart pulled toward my family, my mind yearning for the stillness of meditation. I sit quietly, wrestling with the weight of both expectations, uncertain which path to follow."}
