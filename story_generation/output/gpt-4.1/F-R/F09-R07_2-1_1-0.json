My daughter\u2019s open class was tomorrow evening, the same time as the monthly chanting ceremony at the temple. She had been practicing her lines for days, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d I could almost hear the gentle voice of my teacher at the temple, reminding us of the importance of community and presence, especially during the evening chant. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations\u2014my daughter\u2019s need for support, my sangha\u2019s trust in my commitment. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. If I missed the open class, would my daughter feel abandoned? If I skipped the chant, would I be letting down my spiritual community and my own practice? I sat in the quiet kitchen, hands wrapped around a cup of tea, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
