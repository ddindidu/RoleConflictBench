As a parent, I knew my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure we never missed a payment. The thought of failing them filled me with dread. But then, just yesterday at work, I witnessed something I couldn\u2019t ignore\u2014a colleague accepting a bribe, a clear act of corruption that could harm many. As a Hindu, I was raised to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and courage, even when it\u2019s difficult. My conscience screamed at me to report what I saw, to stand up for what\u2019s right. But the fear gnawed at me: what if speaking out cost me my job? What if I couldn\u2019t pay the loan, and my family suffered? The expectations of being a good parent and a good Hindu pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt trapped, torn between my duty to my family and my duty to my principles."}
