Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the roast and hear the laughter that always filled our family gatherings. As a brother, I knew how much these moments meant, especially to Mom, who cherished every chance to have us all together. But just as I was about to leave my office, my phone rang again. It was Mark, a member of my congregation, his voice trembling. He was facing a crisis, desperate for guidance, and he asked if I could meet him tonight. As his pastor, I knew how much he needed someone to listen, to help him find his way through a decision that could change his life. My heart twisted, torn between the warmth of my family and the weight of my calling. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, and I sat there, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
