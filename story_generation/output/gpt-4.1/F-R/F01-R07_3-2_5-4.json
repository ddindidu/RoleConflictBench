My daughter\u2019s voice trembles as she calls me into the kitchen\u2014something serious has happened, and the family needs me. I feel the weight of their expectation, the unspoken hope that I will offer comfort, wisdom, and stability. Yet, as I glance at the clock, I realize it is nearly time for my weekly group meditation. That hour of mindfulness is sacred to me, a time when I reconnect with my breath and let go of worldly concerns. My Buddhist practice teaches me to be present, to nurture inner peace, and not to cling to attachments. But now, my family\u2019s need tugs at me, pulling me away from the quiet sanctuary I have built for myself. My heart aches with the tension\u2014should I honor my commitment to the sangha and my own spiritual growth, or should I set it aside to be the grandfather my family expects? The voices in the kitchen grow louder, and I close my eyes, caught between two worlds, uncertain which path to follow."}
