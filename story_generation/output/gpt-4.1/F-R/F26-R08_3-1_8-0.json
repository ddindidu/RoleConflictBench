I had been looking forward to this moment all day\u2014a rare stretch of time to sit with the Quran, to recite and reflect, as my heart yearned for the peace it always brought me. Just as I reached for the holy book, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my daughter: my grandson was struggling, and she needed someone to talk to. As a grandparent, I knew I should call her, offer comfort, and keep the family close, especially in times of crisis. But as a Muslim, I felt the pull of my faith, the promise I had made to myself to deepen my connection with Allah tonight. My hands trembled slightly, torn between the duty to my family and the devotion to my faith, each expectation heavy on my heart. I sat there, phone in one hand, Quran in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
