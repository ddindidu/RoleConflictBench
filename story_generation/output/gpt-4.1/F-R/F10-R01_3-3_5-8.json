My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was for me to lead the family\u2019s annual blessing ceremony this year. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with pride and expectation. Our traditions meant everything to her, and I knew how much it would mean for me to step up, to honor our ancestors and keep our family\u2019s legacy alive.\n\nBut as I looked at the dates, my stomach twisted. The same weekend, I was scheduled to lead an intensive workshop for our church\u2019s community leaders\u2014a workshop I\u2019d spent months preparing. The congregation was counting on me to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to help them grow in faith and understanding. I could already picture the eager faces, the questions, the trust they placed in me as their pastor.\n\nI felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family needed me to uphold our traditions; my church needed me to teach and inspire. I closed my eyes, feeling the ache of impossible expectations, wondering how I could possibly choose between them."}
