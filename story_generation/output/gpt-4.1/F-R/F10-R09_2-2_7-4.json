We\u2019ve been traveling for hours, and I can see the exhaustion in the way my mother rubs her temples and my father sighs as he checks his phone. I want to help, to be the daughter they can lean on, to find something comforting for us to eat and lift their spirits. But here, in this unfamiliar city, the only place I know is kosher is a tiny vendor a few blocks away, and my parents are too tired to walk that far. They glance at the nearby caf\u00e9, its menu full of non-kosher options, and I feel their silent hope that I\u2019ll agree to eat there, just this once, so we can all rest. My heart aches with the pull between my commitment to keeping kosher and my need to care for my parents. I want to be the daughter they need, but I also want to honor my faith. The weight of both expectations presses on me as I stand there, torn, searching for the right words."}
