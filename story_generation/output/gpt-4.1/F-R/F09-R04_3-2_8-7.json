The numbers on the loan statement glared up at me, a reminder that in two months, the bank would expect a payment I wasn\u2019t sure I could make. My children\u2019s laughter drifted in from the living room, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as their mother\u2014provider, protector, the one who must keep our home safe and secure. \n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from Sister Amina, a congregant who had been with our mosque for years. \u201cPlease, Imam, can we meet soon? I\u2019m struggling at home and need your guidance.\u201d I knew her situation was urgent; as imam, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and counsel. But every hour spent with her would be an hour not spent searching for extra work or planning how to stretch our finances. \n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s future, my community\u2019s needs. I closed my eyes, torn between the two worlds that depended on me, unsure how to choose."}
