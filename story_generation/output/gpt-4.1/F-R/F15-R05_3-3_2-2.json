The principal\u2019s voice from earlier echoed in my mind: \u201cYour son was involved in a bullying incident. We need you to come in.\u201d As a parent, I felt a knot of worry and responsibility tighten in my chest. My child needed me\u2014needed guidance, support, and maybe even discipline. But as a rabbi, the High Holiday sermon loomed over me. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, and presence. Hundreds would gather, waiting for my words to help them reflect and renew. Both roles demanded my full attention, my heart, my time. I could not be in two places at once, and the weight of letting someone down\u2014my child or my community\u2014pressed on me. I stared at the clock, torn, my mind racing through possible solutions, but none seemed right."}
