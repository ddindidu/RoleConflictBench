My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement, insisting that everyone be present for this special moment. As a grandparent, I felt the pull to be fully present, to savor these fleeting milestones and offer my love and attention. Yet, in the back of my mind, the responsibilities of my other role pressed in. Shabbat was approaching, and I had promised myself to begin outlining my next sermon\u2014something meaningful, something that would resonate with the congregation weeks from now. The expectation to provide spiritual guidance weighed heavily, and I knew that inspiration often struck in quiet, uninterrupted moments. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family togetherness and the solitude required for thoughtful preparation. I glanced at the clock, feeling the tension rise, uncertain which call I would answer first."}
