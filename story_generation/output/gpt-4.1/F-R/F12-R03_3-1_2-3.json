He had barely slept, haunted by the weight of his crisis, and I could feel his need for me\u2014my words, my touch, my unwavering presence. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to hold him together as he unraveled. But the chapel bell tolled, its sound echoing through the halls, a sacred summons I could not ignore. As a nun, my place was among my sisters, kneeling in prayer, my voice rising in devotion. The convent expected my discipline, my commitment to the daily rhythm of worship. Yet here, in this quiet room, my heart was torn. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, silently pleading for comfort, while the call to prayer grew louder, insistent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full self, each unwilling to yield. My breath caught as I stood at the threshold, caught between the vows I had made and the love I could not abandon, uncertain which path to follow."}
