My father barely touched his coffee, lost in thought. I wanted to reach out, to offer comfort, to be the child they needed\u2014someone who could listen, reassure, and help shoulder their burdens. But my phone buzzed, and I saw a message from a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her words frantic, desperate for guidance. As her pastor, I knew she was looking to me for spiritual direction, for wisdom that could shape the course of her life. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to sit with my parents, to be present for them, and the responsibility to answer the call for help from someone who trusted me with her soul. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt the ache of not knowing how to be enough for everyone at once."}
