I could sense her sadness, the way only a grandmother can. I wanted to reach out, to share stories from my own youth, to offer gentle advice and comfort, to remind her that storms do pass. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member, desperate for counsel about a life-altering decision. As their pastor, I knew they expected spiritual wisdom, words rooted in faith and scripture, guidance that could shape their path.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. My granddaughter needed me to be her grandmother, to listen and nurture. My congregation needed me to be their pastor, to offer spiritual clarity. Both roles demanded my full presence, my compassion, my wisdom. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me, the fear of failing one if I chose the other. I looked at my granddaughter, then at my phone, torn by love and duty, unsure which call to answer first."}
