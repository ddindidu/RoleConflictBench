Sunday was circled in red\u2014church service and the monthly community lunch. My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind, his voice echoing, \u201cYou promised, Mom. The Nintendo, remember?\u201d I had saved for weeks, pinching pennies from groceries and skipping my own little treats, just to make it happen. But the church expected me to be present, not just in body but in spirit, helping with the lunch, joining the prayer circle, being a pillar for others. The Nintendo would mean missing the offering I usually gave, maybe even skipping the lunch fee. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014was I failing as a mother if I broke my promise, or as a Christian if I let my commitment to the community slip? My heart ached, torn between the joy I wanted to give my child and the faith that shaped our lives. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
