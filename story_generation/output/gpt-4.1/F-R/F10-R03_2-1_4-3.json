We need you here for the family ritual. It\u2019s your turn to light the incense.\u201d My heart clenched. This tradition, passed down for generations, was sacred to my family. They had reminded me all week how important it was to uphold our customs, especially now, when everyone was watching.\n\nBut as I hung up, the convent bell tolled, echoing through the halls. Morning prayer was about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling in the chapel with my sisters, reciting psalms in unison. The Mother Superior had spoken just yesterday about the importance of discipline and unity in our spiritual life.\n\nI stood in my small room, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the vows I had taken here. My hands shook as I held my rosary, the incense lighter from home still tucked in my drawer. The voices of my family and my sisters seemed to pull me in opposite directions, and I felt the pressure mounting, unsure which path I could follow without betraying the other."}
