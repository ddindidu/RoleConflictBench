I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d She\u2019d just been promoted, and our family was gathering at her favorite restaurant. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, front and center, cheering her on. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. The initial planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was scheduled for the same evening. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead the session, set the tone, and inspire the team for the coming year.
