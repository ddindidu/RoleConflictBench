My mother\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cIt\u2019s been too long since we all sat together.\u201d I know how much these gatherings mean to her, especially now that we\u2019re all so busy. At the same time, I can picture the congregation waiting, expecting me to lead the evening prayer. They rely on me, especially when there\u2019s no one else. My heart pounds as I imagine my family\u2019s disappointment if I don\u2019t show up, and the letdown in the eyes of the elders at the mosque if I\u2019m absent. I feel torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. I want to be a good brother, present and supportive, but I also feel the sacred trust of guiding my community in prayer. The clock ticks closer to both events, and I sit in my car, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
