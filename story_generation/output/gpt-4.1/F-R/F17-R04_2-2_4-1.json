Tonight was the annual family gathering, a night when every member was expected to be present, honoring customs passed down for generations. My father had reminded me just this morning, \u201cYou must be here, it\u2019s your duty as our child.\u201d But as I glanced at my phone, a message from the mosque committee blinked on the screen. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was counting on me to lead the evening prayer. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I didn\u2019t show up. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my family\u2019s hope that I would uphold our traditions, and my community\u2019s trust in me as their imam. The clock ticked closer to both events, and I felt torn, anxiety tightening in my chest. I wanted to be the devoted child my parents expected, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility I held at the mosque. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, unsure which path to take."}
