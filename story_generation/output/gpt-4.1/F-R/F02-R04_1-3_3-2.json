He looked up, eyes searching mine for approval, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as his father\u2014to guide him, to teach him the values and discipline that would shape his character. Just then, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a message from the mosque committee: the congregation had gathered early for the special remembrance, and I was needed to lead the prayer. No one else was authorized; they were waiting for me. My heart pounded. At home, my son needed my steady presence and gentle correction. At the mosque, a community awaited my leadership and spiritual guidance. I glanced at my son, then at the clock, feeling the expectations of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided attention. My mind raced, torn between the sacred trust of fatherhood and the solemn duty of imam, uncertain which call to answer first."}
