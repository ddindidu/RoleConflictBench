My children and grandchildren would soon gather, filling the house with laughter and stories. As a grandmother, I was expected to be present, to listen, to share, and to make sure everyone felt connected. My daughter called, reminding me how much the little ones missed my bedtime stories and how important it was for us all to spend time together during this special week.\n\nBut as a devout Hindu, my daily rituals were non-negotiable. Each morning and evening, I performed puja, chanted mantras, and made offerings. The schedule was strict, and every step felt essential to my spiritual well-being. The rituals brought me peace, but they also demanded time and focus\u2014time that would overlap with family meals, outings, and late-night conversations.\n\nI could already sense the tension building inside me. How could I be fully present for my family, as they expected, while also honoring my spiritual commitments? The thought of disappointing either side weighed heavily on my heart, and I found myself torn, unsure how to balance these two worlds that meant everything to me."}
