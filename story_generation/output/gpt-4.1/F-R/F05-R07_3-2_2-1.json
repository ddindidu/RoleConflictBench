She\u2019s been quiet all day, her eyes red from crying, her voice barely above a whisper. She needs me\u2014she\u2019s said so, and I can feel it in the way she clings to my arm, searching for comfort, for the steady reassurance I\u2019ve always tried to give. But my phone buzzes again: a reminder from the temple. The memorial service is tonight, and as a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to chant, to support the grieving families, to show my commitment to the community. I know how important these rituals are, not just for the departed, but for the living. My teacher always says our presence is a form of compassion. Yet, here, in this room, my wife\u2019s pain feels immediate and raw. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart aches as I weigh the silent plea in her eyes against the quiet call of the temple bell echoing in my mind."}
