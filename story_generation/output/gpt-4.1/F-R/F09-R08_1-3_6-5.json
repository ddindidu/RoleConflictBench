He had been waiting for this day, saving up his allowance, and I had promised him I would cover the rest. As a mother, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy, but the price tag made my heart sink. Our finances were tight this month, and I knew buying it would mean cutting back on essentials.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was about to begin. I glanced at my reflection in the glass, realizing I had rushed out in jeans and a t-shirt, not in the modest attire I usually wore to the mosque. The main prayer hall was just across the street, and I could already see worshippers gathering. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of expectation to dress appropriately, to show respect in the house of God.\n\nTorn between my promise to my son and my religious obligations, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. Both roles demanded something of me, and I stood frozen, unsure which expectation to fulfill."}
