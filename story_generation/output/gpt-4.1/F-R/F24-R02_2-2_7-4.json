He grinned at me, excitement and nerves flickering in his eyes. \u201cJust watch, okay? I\u2019ve got this.\u201d My heart thudded with worry\u2014he\u2019d never tried anything this risky before, and the ramp was full of cracks and splinters. As his step-sibling, I knew I should stay, keep an eye on him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: Mrs. Alvarez was waiting at the church, desperate for guidance about her failing marriage. As her priest, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and counsel. I felt torn in two, guilt pressing on my chest. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my brother when he needed me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down someone who trusted me with her pain. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
