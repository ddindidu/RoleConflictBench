She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I would be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. Just as I was about to confirm, my phone buzzed with an email from a young couple in the community. They wanted to meet with me to discuss officiating their wedding\u2014over a year away, but they were eager to secure a date and start planning. The only time they could meet was the same afternoon as the open class. As a rabbi, I know how important it is to be present for these milestones, to guide and support families at the start of their new lives together. But as a parent, my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes and the trust she places in my promises weigh heavily on me. I feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between my congregation\u2019s needs and my own child\u2019s expectations, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
