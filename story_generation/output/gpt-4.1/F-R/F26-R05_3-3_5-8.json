As a grandmother, my heart ached to rush to their side, to hold my daughter and comfort my grandson, to be the steady presence my family has always counted on. But before I could grab my coat, my other phone buzzed. It was the synagogue president. One of our oldest congregants, Mr. Feldman, had passed away unexpectedly. His family was distraught, and they needed me to officiate the funeral service as soon as possible. I could hear the pain in their voices, the expectation that I would guide them through this sacred moment. I stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of my family and the call of my congregation, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, each demanding my presence, my comfort, my leadership. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone I loved would be left waiting."}
