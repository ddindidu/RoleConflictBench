My little brother wanted to go hiking, my sister suggested a movie night, and my parents smiled, happy to see us all together. I felt the warmth of belonging, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d be there, joining in, making memories. Then my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the synagogue. They needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral service. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. My family\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my input, hoping I\u2019d say yes to our plans. But I knew the weight of the request from my community, the importance of being present for someone\u2019s mourning. I felt torn, the pull of my family\u2019s love on one side and my responsibility as a Jew on the other. My mind raced, caught between the comfort of home and the call of tradition, not knowing which path to choose."}
