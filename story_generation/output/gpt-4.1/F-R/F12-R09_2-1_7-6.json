As his wife, I know I should ask him about his day, encourage him to share what\u2019s weighing on him. We\u2019ve always promised to communicate openly, especially when something\u2019s wrong. But tonight is also Thursday, and as a committed Jew, I\u2019m expected at synagogue for the evening service. It\u2019s not a holiday, and the minyan will go on without me, but I know how important regular attendance is to my community and to my own sense of faith. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I stay, I can be the supportive partner David needs, but I\u2019ll be missing a part of my spiritual routine and letting down my community. If I go, I\u2019ll honor my religious commitment, but I\u2019ll leave David alone with his worries. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the two worlds that define me, unsure which door to walk through."}
