The kids can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d My heart swelled at the thought of laughter and stories around the dinner table, the rare chance to be simply a grandfather, not the imam everyone turns to for guidance. Yet, as Friday neared, I felt the weight of my other role. The congregation expected my presence, my words, my leadership. Even though the guest speaker was ready to step in, some in the community would quietly question my absence. Was I neglecting my duty? My phone buzzed with messages from both sides\u2014family confirming plans, mosque committee reminding me of the Khutbah. I sat in my study, torn between the joy of family and the responsibility of faith, feeling the tension coil in my chest. Both roles called to me, each with its own set of expectations, and I wondered how I could possibly honor them both."}
