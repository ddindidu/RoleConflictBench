My husband called from the hallway, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. The laundry basket overflowed, a silent testament to my role as a spouse\u2014keeper of the home, partner in daily life. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the convent: today was the monthly food drive, and my presence was expected. As a nun, I was committed to serving the community, to being a source of comfort and aid for those in need. The weight of both worlds pressed on me. My family needed me here, folding shirts and matching socks, ensuring our little world ran smoothly. But my sisters at the convent, and the hungry souls waiting at the shelter, needed my hands and heart as well. I stared at the laundry, then at my habit hanging by the door, torn between the demands of love and duty, unsure which path to take."}
