I glanced at the clock\u20148:00 a.m. My heart tightened. At this very moment, my children would be gathering their things, waiting for me at the school gate. As a parent, I promised them I\u2019d be there, a steady presence at the end of their school day. But as a nun, the expectation was clear: I must be present in the chapel, joining my sisters in prayer, honoring the sacred rhythm of our communal life.\n\nI could almost hear my children\u2019s laughter, see their hopeful faces scanning the crowd for me. Yet, I also felt the weight of my vows, the silent gaze of my sisters as they filed into the chapel, trusting I would be there too. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my children\u2019s embrace and the peace of the chapel\u2019s candlelit silence. The demands of both worlds pressed in, each calling me with love and duty. I stood in the corridor, heart pounding, unable to move, caught between two lives that asked everything of me."}
