Today was supposed to be a day of rest, just us at home, and I had planned to wear my most comfortable pajamas\u2014short sleeves and loose pants, nothing fancy, just comfort. But as I reached for them, I hesitated. Even though it was just my immediate family, I remembered the teachings about modesty, about always dressing in a way that reflects my faith, even in private settings. \n\nAt the same time, my mind kept drifting to the promise I made to my child last month: a Nintendo for their birthday. Money was tight, and I knew buying it would mean cutting back on groceries or skipping a bill. But the look of hope in my child\u2019s eyes haunted me. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to fulfill my promise as a parent, to see my child\u2019s joy, and wanting to honor my faith, to be a good Muslim in every aspect of my life. The weight of these expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to honor first."}
