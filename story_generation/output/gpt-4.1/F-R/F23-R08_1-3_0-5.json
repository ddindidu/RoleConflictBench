It was almost time for Friday prayers, and I was standing in the mosque\u2019s foyer, adjusting my scarf and making sure my sleeves covered my wrists. The imam\u2019s voice echoed from the main hall, calling everyone to line up. I knew I should be inside, joining the congregation, fulfilling my duty as a Muslim and setting an example for my stepchildren about the importance of faith.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that school was ending soon. My stepchildren would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. Their mother was working late, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there, just like any parent. I imagined their disappointment if I was late, the questions from teachers, the awkward explanations. I wanted to be reliable, to show them I cared, to be the parent they could count on.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the pull of my faith and the needs of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
