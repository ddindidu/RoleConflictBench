He had been quieter than usual, and I knew he needed me to listen, to share openly as we always promised. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the parish. Sister Maria, can you meet tonight? I\u2019m struggling and need your guidance. The words pressed on my heart. As a nun, I was expected to be present for those in spiritual need, to offer wisdom and comfort, especially when someone\u2019s faith was faltering. But here, at home, my husband\u2019s voice trembled as he began to talk about his worries at work, his fears about the future. I felt the weight of both worlds pulling at me\u2014one asking for my spiritual presence, the other for my emotional intimacy. My mind raced, torn between the sacred duty to my parishioner and the promise I made to my husband to always be there. I wanted to be fully present for both, but the clock ticked on, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
