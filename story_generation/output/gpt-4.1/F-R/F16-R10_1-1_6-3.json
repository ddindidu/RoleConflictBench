She asked about my day, her eyes warm and expectant. I hesitated, thinking about the incident at work\u2014a colleague had cut in line at the cafeteria, ignoring the quiet order we all followed. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma, to stand up for what is right, even in small matters. But I hadn\u2019t said anything. Now, as my spouse waited for me to share, I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in. She expected honesty, open communication, a window into my thoughts and feelings. But if I told her, would she see me as weak for not speaking up? Or would she understand the conflict I felt, the struggle between keeping peace and upholding my values? My fork hovered above my plate, my mind tangled in the expectations of being a good partner and a good Hindu, unsure which truth to reveal."}
