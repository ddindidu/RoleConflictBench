She needed me to listen, to be present, to reassure her that we could face her anxieties together. I reached for her hand, trying to offer comfort, but my phone buzzed insistently. A message from the mosque committee flashed on the screen: the imam scheduled for tonight\u2019s special remembrance had fallen ill, and the congregation was waiting for me to lead the prayers. No one else could step in. My wife\u2019s words faded into the background as my mind raced. She needed me here, now, to be her partner, her confidant. But my community needed me too, to guide them in worship, to fulfill my duty as their imam. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my heart torn between the warmth of my home and the call of the mosque. I looked at my wife, her vulnerability laid bare, and then at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
