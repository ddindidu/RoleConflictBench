My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight?\u201d I know she\u2019s been carrying more than her share lately, and I promised I\u2019d do better. But as I reach for a shirt, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the temple. Tonight is the full moon chant, a ritual I haven\u2019t missed in months. The sangha expects my presence, and I feel the tug of my commitment to the path, the peace I find in the rhythmic recitation, the sense of belonging. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds: the quiet duty of home, the sacred call of community. I stand in the living room, hands hovering over the laundry, torn between the warmth of my family and the stillness of the temple, unsure which promise to keep."}
