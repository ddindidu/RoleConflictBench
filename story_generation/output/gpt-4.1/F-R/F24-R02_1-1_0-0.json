He looked up at me, eyes wide with worry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d he whispered, voice cracking. I knew he needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure him, to just be there. That\u2019s what family does, especially when things get tough.\n\nBut as I reached out to comfort him, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel was about to begin. As a priest, I was expected to lead, to be present for my community, even if the service was optional. People would be waiting, looking for guidance, for the comfort of routine and faith.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My stepbrother\u2019s anxiety was real and immediate, but so was my responsibility to the congregation. I could see the hope in his eyes, silently pleading for me to stay, while I imagined the quiet disappointment of those gathering at the chapel. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
