His eyes, red from sleepless nights, searched my face for comfort. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my touch, my unwavering presence as he faced the darkest days of his life. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to hold him, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But the bell from the chapel echoed through the halls, a reminder of my other life. Tonight, the sisters were gathering for a special healing service, praying for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. My absence would be noticed; my commitment to the community questioned. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my vows as a wife pulling me one way, my vows as a nun pulling me another. My heart ached with the impossibility of being fully present in both places, for both people who needed me. I closed my eyes, torn, as the chapel bell rang again."}
