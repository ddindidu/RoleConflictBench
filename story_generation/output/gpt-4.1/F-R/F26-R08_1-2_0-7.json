She asked me how I had faced big changes in my own life, hoping for guidance and reassurance. I wanted to be the grandparent she needed\u2014steady, wise, and present, offering stories and advice drawn from my own journey. But as she spoke, my mind wandered to the envelope tucked away in my drawer, the one holding the savings I\u2019d carefully set aside for Hajj. This year, my friends are finally going, and I feel the pull of a lifelong spiritual duty, the expectation to fulfill one of Islam\u2019s pillars. I know the money could help her settle into her new life, maybe pay for books or a deposit on her apartment. My heart aches with the weight of both roles\u2014my faith calling me to Mecca, my love urging me to support my granddaughter. I listen to her, nodding, but inside I am torn, wrestling with the demands of devotion and family, unsure which path I will choose."}
