Let\u2019s celebrate\u2014my treat!\u201d I can almost hear her excitement through the screen. She\u2019s always been there for me, cheering me on, and I want nothing more than to do the same for her. We\u2019re both traveling for a conference, and she\u2019s found a little caf\u00e9 nearby, eager to mark her big moment with a meal together. \n\nBut as I check the address, my heart sinks. The only kosher-certified vendor is a tiny stand a few blocks away, and she\u2019s set her heart on this caf\u00e9. I know how much it means to her that I join, to share in her joy, to be the supportive sister she\u2019s always counted on. At the same time, my commitment to keeping kosher is not just a rule\u2014it\u2019s a part of who I am, a connection to my faith and family. \n\nI stand on the sidewalk, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of my sister\u2019s celebration and the quiet pull of my tradition, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
