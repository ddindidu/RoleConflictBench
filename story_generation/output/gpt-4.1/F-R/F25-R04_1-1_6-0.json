As the imam, I was expected to lead the evening prayer at the mosque, even though tonight the congregation would be small and Brother Yusuf, always eager, was more than capable of stepping in. Yet, I knew my presence mattered to the few who would gather, and the community expected consistency from their imam. \n\nBut just as I reached for my prayer robe, I heard my stepmother\u2019s voice from the kitchen, quieter than usual. My father had been withdrawn all week, and I\u2019d promised myself I would check in on them, offer the support a good step-child should. They needed me to ask, to listen, to show I cared about the peace in our home. \n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. If I stayed, I might finally open the door to a conversation my parents needed. If I left, I would fulfill my duty to the mosque, but perhaps at the cost of my family\u2019s trust. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between the call of faith and the call of family, unsure which door to walk through."}
