It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle questions, my father\u2019s quiet pride, the warmth of home echoing through the phone. Tonight, though, my hands tremble as I dial. Earlier today, I witnessed something at work that shook me: a senior colleague accepting a bribe, a clear act of corruption. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and courage, to stand against wrongdoing. My conscience screams at me to report what I saw, to do what is right, no matter the cost.\n\nBut as a daughter, I know what this could mean. My parents worry about my safety and stability. If I tell them, they\u2019ll beg me to stay silent, to protect myself, to avoid trouble. If I don\u2019t tell them, I\u2019m hiding a part of myself, betraying our trust. The phone rings, and my mother answers, her voice full of love and expectation. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the daughter they raised and the person my faith calls me to be."}
