My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve got an early meeting tomorrow.\u201d I nod, promising myself I\u2019ll get to it after dinner. But as I clear the plates, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the convent. The Mother Superior\u2019s request is clear: I am to lead daily reflections for the upcoming retreat, and she wants me to begin preparing tonight. The expectation is sacred, the responsibility heavy. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My spouse needs partnership, a shared life. My sisters need guidance, spiritual nourishment. I want to be present for both, but the hours slip away, and I am pulled in two directions. My hands hover over the laundry, my mind drifts to scripture, and my heart aches with the impossibility of being enough for everyone."}
