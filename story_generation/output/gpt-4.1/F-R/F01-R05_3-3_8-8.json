My daughter had just called, her voice trembling as she told me about my grandson\u2019s struggles\u2014he was in crisis, and the family needed me. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to be present, to offer comfort, to sit with them and listen, to be the steady hand they could hold. But as I hung up, another call came. A congregant\u2019s son, his words choked with grief, told me his father had passed away. The family needed me to officiate the funeral, and soon. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them through their sorrow, to lead the rituals, to be the spiritual anchor in their darkest hour. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s pain, my community\u2019s loss. I stared at the phone, torn, my mind racing with the expectations of grandfather and rabbi, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
