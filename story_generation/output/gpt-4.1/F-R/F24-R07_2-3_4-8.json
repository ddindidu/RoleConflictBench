My dad calls from the living room, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone\u2019s expected at the table by seven!\u201d I nod, feeling the familiar tug of obligation. As a step-sibling, I know how important it is to show up, to be present, to help knit this patchwork family together. But my phone vibrates\u2014a message from my Buddhist teacher: \u201cCan you prepare a summary of the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s session?\u201d I promised I\u2019d help, and the teachings are not just words to me; they\u2019re a path I\u2019m trying to walk sincerely. I glance at my notes, scattered and unfinished, and then at the clock. If I join the family, I\u2019ll have no time for quiet study or reflection. If I retreat to my room, I\u2019ll disappoint my family, maybe even widen the gap I\u2019ve worked so hard to close. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of the dining room and the quiet sanctuary of my desk, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
