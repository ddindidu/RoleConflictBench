My grandson, Amir, had just landed his first job, and the whole family was gathering for lunch to celebrate. As a grandfather, I know how much these moments mean\u2014Amir looks up to me, and my presence would show him how proud I am. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I am the sole imam scheduled for today\u2019s Friday sermon. The community has already announced my topic, and many will come seeking guidance and inspiration. I could hear the anticipation in my daughter\u2019s voice, and I could almost feel the weight of the congregation\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders.

I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decide, someone I care about will be disappointed."}
