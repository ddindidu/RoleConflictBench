My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my memory\u2014he\u2019d been so excited when I promised him a Nintendo for his birthday. As a mother, I wanted to give him everything, to see his face light up with joy. But the cost gnawed at me, especially with rent due and groceries running low. I felt the weight of ensuring our financial stability pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nIn the midst of my worries, I glanced at the small altar in the corner. My heart ached with guilt. I hadn\u2019t performed my full morning puja in weeks, only whispering a quick mantra under my breath as I rushed through the day. As a Hindu, I was expected to honor my faith with daily rituals, to set an example for my son. But time and stress always seemed to win.\n\nTorn between my roles, I felt the tension build inside me. Should I keep my promise to my son, risking our budget, or should I hold back, teaching him about sacrifice? Should I carve out time for my rituals, or keep pushing forward, hoping my whispered prayers were enough? The questions swirled, leaving me paralyzed, caught between the mother I wanted to be and the Hindu I was raised to be."}
