I kept an eye on him, remembering Mom\u2019s words: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d I wanted to call him back, to make sure he didn\u2019t trip into the street, but my mind kept drifting to the temple session tomorrow. Our teacher had asked us to summarize the Four Noble Truths, and I hadn\u2019t even started. I felt the weight of that expectation pressing on me, the need to reflect deeply, to honor my Buddhist practice with sincerity and focus.\n\nBut every time I tried to gather my thoughts, my stepbrother would shout, \u201cWatch this!\u201d or veer dangerously close to the road. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on my spiritual study, or keep my attention on him, as a good step-sibling should? The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my full presence. My heart raced with worry and guilt, caught between the safety of my family and the peace I sought in my practice. I slowed my steps, uncertain which responsibility should come first."}
