She looked uncertain, her eyes searching mine. \u201cGrandma, how do you know what to do when everything in your life is changing?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. My heart ached to share stories from my own winding path, to offer the comfort of lived experience. But the clock ticked insistently; in an hour, I was to lead the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, where the congregation expected me to guide them through dense theological ideas, not just gentle wisdom. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter needing the warmth of her grandmother\u2019s heart, my community needing the clarity of their pastor\u2019s mind. I wanted to be fully present for her, to listen and reassure, but the demands of my calling tugged at me, reminding me of the responsibility I bore. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for hers, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
