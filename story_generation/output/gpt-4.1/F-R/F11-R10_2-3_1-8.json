She needed me\u2014her words were laced with tears, and I could picture her alone in her apartment, struggling with the news of her job loss. As her sister, I was supposed to be there, to comfort her, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But my suitcase was already packed, and my parents were waiting by the door, reminding me of the importance of the festival we were about to attend. As a Hindu, I was expected to travel with them, to participate in every ritual, to honor our traditions and the gods. The festival was not just a family event; it was a spiritual duty, one that required my full presence and devotion. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014my sister\u2019s need for support against my family\u2019s and faith\u2019s call for commitment. I felt torn, guilt pressing on both sides, unsure which role I was about to betray."}
