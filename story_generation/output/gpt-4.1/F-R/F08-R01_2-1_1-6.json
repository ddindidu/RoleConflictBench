She hadn\u2019t said much all afternoon, but I could sense the heaviness in her silence. As her grandmother, I wanted to reach out, to share stories from my own life\u2014how I\u2019d stumbled and found my way, how sometimes it\u2019s okay not to have all the answers. I wanted to comfort her with the warmth of my experience, to let her know she was not alone.\n\nBut earlier that day, at the church picnic, I\u2019d spoken as Pastor Ruth, sharing the parable of the lost sheep with the congregation. I\u2019d emphasized faith, repentance, and the importance of returning to God\u2019s path. Now, as I looked at my granddaughter, I wondered if she needed spiritual guidance or simply a listening ear. Should I remind her of the story I\u2019d told, encouraging her to seek God\u2019s direction? Or should I set aside my pastoral role and just be her grandmother, offering understanding without judgment? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the weight of choosing which part of myself she needed most."}
