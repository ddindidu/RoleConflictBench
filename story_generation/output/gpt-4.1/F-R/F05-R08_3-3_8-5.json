We had just finished a tense conversation in the car about our finances\u2014she wanted to know everything, every detail, and I knew she deserved that honesty. As her husband, I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation to be open, to share even the uncomfortable truths. But as we prepared to enter the prayer hall, I noticed her attire\u2014a blouse with sleeves just a bit too short, a scarf that slipped back from her hair. My heart pounded. As a Muslim, I was expected to uphold modesty, not just for myself but to gently encourage it in my family. I could feel the stares of others already, the silent judgment. I wanted to protect her from embarrassment, to support her, but I also felt the pressure to say something, to remind her of our faith\u2019s guidelines. The words caught in my throat. I was torn between being the honest, supportive husband she needed and the devout Muslim I was expected to be. The call to prayer echoed, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
