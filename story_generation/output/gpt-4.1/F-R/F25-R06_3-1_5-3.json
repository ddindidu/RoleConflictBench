It shows you\u2019re truly part of the family.\u201d Her eyes had been hopeful, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to my father. This ceremony was a tradition, a way to honor our ancestors, and I was expected to step up, to prove I belonged. But the ceremony was on Sunday morning, the same time as church. I\u2019d been trying to make it to worship more often, to feel closer to God and the community that welcomed me. My pastor always said, \u201cPut God first,\u201d and I wanted to live by that. But how could I choose between honoring my family and honoring my faith? My heart twisted as I imagined the disappointment in my stepmother\u2019s face if I refused, and the emptiness I\u2019d feel missing church again. I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds, both asking me to prove where I truly belonged."}
