My daughter had called, her voice bright with excitement, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me. As a grandparent, I felt the weight of their expectation\u2014to be present, to share stories, to create memories that would last a lifetime. Yet, as I sat in my quiet room after prayer, another longing tugged at me. As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj grew stronger each year. I had promised myself, and Allah, that I would make the pilgrimage as soon as I could. But my savings were still modest, and every family event seemed to nudge that goal further away.\n\nThe family expected me to be there, to laugh and play and be the heart of our gathering. My faith called me to save, to prepare, to fulfill a sacred duty. I felt torn, my love for my family pulling me one way, my devotion to my faith pulling me another. The two roles I cherished most seemed to be at odds, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
