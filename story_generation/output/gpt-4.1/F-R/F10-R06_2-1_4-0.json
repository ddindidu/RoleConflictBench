This year, the family wanted to perform a ritual that had been passed down for generations, one that involved making offerings to our ancestors. I knew how much it meant to them, how it was a symbol of respect and unity. But as a Christian, I struggled. My faith taught me to worship only God, to avoid practices that felt like they conflicted with my beliefs. I wanted to honor my parents, to be the daughter they expected, but I also wanted to stay true to my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my heart torn between love for my family and loyalty to my beliefs. I stared at the invitation to the ceremony, my hands trembling, unsure of which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
