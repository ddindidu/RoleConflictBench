I feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for others. As a parent, I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why his behavior isn\u2019t acceptable. But my mind is elsewhere, tangled in guilt. It\u2019s Sunday morning, and I should be at church, worshipping with my community, showing my children the importance of faith and fellowship. I promised myself I\u2019d make time for church, to set an example as a Christian parent, but here I am, choosing groceries over God. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014one demanding I guide my child in the moment, the other urging me to honor my spiritual commitments. My heart aches as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between the expectations of being a good parent and a faithful Christian."}
