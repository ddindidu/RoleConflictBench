But my phone buzzes, and I see the reminder for the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah\u2014months in the making, a milestone I\u2019ve guided them toward, and a ceremony that means the world to them. As their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be present, calm, and focused, to lead with joy and wisdom. My spouse expects partnership, reliability, and for me to keep my word at home. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the laundry basket and the Torah scrolls each demanding my attention. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the sacred and the everyday, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
