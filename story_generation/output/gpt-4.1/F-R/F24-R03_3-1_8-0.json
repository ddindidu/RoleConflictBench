The convent van was waiting, the sisters already inside, waving for me to hurry. But across the street, I saw my stepbrother, distracted, headphones in, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart pounded. As a nun, I was expected to be punctual, to serve the community, to put the needs of the many before my own. But as a step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he was safe, to be the family he could rely on. The seconds stretched. If I called out, I might miss the van and let the sisters down. If I left him, I might never forgive myself. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
