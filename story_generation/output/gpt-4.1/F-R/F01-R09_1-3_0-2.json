Everything feels so new and confusing.\u201d He was talking about starting high school, but I could see the shadow of his upcoming bar mitzvah weighing on him too. As his grandfather, I wanted to reassure him, to tell him that life is full of unknowns and that he should trust himself, take things one step at a time. But as a Jew, I felt the pressing responsibility to guide him through the traditions, to make sure he was prepared for his bar mitzvah, to help him master his Torah portion and understand its meaning. I could sense his anxiety about not being ready, and I knew he was looking to me for comfort, not pressure. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to say\u2014should I focus on easing his worries about life, or should I remind him of the importance of his Jewish heritage and the work still to be done? The words caught in my throat as I tried to balance the wisdom of a grandfather with the duty of a Jewish teacher."}
