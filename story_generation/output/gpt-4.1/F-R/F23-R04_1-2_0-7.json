The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and my stepchildren would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014after all, I\u2019d missed the last parent-teacher meeting, and I could still hear the disappointment in their voices. But just as I reached for my car keys, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a pillar of our mosque, his message urgent: \u201cImam, can you meet me soon? I don\u2019t know where else to turn. My family is falling apart.\u201d I could sense the desperation between the lines, the kind of plea I\u2019d always told my congregation I\u2019d answer, no matter what. My mind raced, torn between the children who needed my presence and the congregant who needed my guidance. Both roles demanded my heart, my time, my undivided attention. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that refused to let go."}
