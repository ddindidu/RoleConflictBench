My spouse calls from the living room, asking if I\u2019ve finished dusting the shelves and reminding me that the guest towels still need to be set out. Relatives are arriving tomorrow, and every corner of the house must be spotless. I nod, feeling the weight of shared responsibility pressing on my shoulders. But as I dry my hands, I hear my son\u2019s voice from the dining room, stumbling over the Hebrew words of his Torah portion. His bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he\u2019s still struggling. I promised I\u2019d help him practice tonight, to guide him through the melodies and meanings, to pass on the traditions that shaped me. My spouse\u2019s voice grows sharper, asking if I\u2019ve started the laundry. My son\u2019s eyes meet mine, anxious and hopeful. I feel torn, pulled between the demands of a presentable home and the deeper call to nurture my child\u2019s Jewish identity. My heart aches as I stand between the kitchen and the dining room, unsure which role to answer first."}
