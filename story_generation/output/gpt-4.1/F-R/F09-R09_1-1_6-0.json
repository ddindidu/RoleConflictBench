He\u2019s been saving his allowance, but he\u2019s counting on me to make up the difference, just like I promised. Money is tight this month, and I know I should be putting every spare dollar toward groceries and bills. Still, I want to give him something special, something that makes him feel seen and loved.\n\nBut tonight is also our weekly Torah study, the time I set aside to teach him about our heritage, our stories, our values. It\u2019s the one tradition I\u2019ve managed to keep, even when life gets busy. I know I could move the lesson to another night, but I worry about what message that sends. Am I showing him that our traditions are less important than a new game console? Or am I being too rigid, denying him a bit of joy in the name of duty?\n\nMy heart aches as I weigh these choices. I want to be a good mother, to provide and to nurture. I want to be a good Jew, to pass on what matters most. But tonight, I can\u2019t seem to be both."}
