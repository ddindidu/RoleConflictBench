I notice Mei, my granddaughter, sitting at the kitchen table, her shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on a spot that isn\u2019t there. I sense her sadness, the way only a grandparent can, and I remember my own grandmother\u2019s gentle words when I was lost. My heart aches to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over a lifetime. Yet, tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a commitment I hold sacred. We are to discuss a chapter I haven\u2019t yet read, and my presence is expected\u2014not just to listen, but to share and reflect. The teachings remind me to be present, to cultivate understanding, but I feel torn. Mei needs me now, but so does my sangha, and my own spiritual growth. The clock ticks, and I stand in the hallway, caught between the pull of family and the call of the Dharma, my heart heavy with the weight of both."}
