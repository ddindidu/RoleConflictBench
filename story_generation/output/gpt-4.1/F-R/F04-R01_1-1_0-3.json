It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and her text was short: \u201cRough day. Could use a chat if you have a moment.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my sister would be here any minute, expecting me to help her celebrate her big promotion. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised her my full attention tonight. \n\nBut as a pastor, I knew how much a simple check-in could mean to someone like Mrs. Carter. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. My sister\u2019s laughter echoed from the driveway, and I felt the pressure of being the supportive brother she needed. At the same time, I felt the tug of my pastoral duty, the expectation to be present for my community, especially when someone reached out in need. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the joy of family and the call to serve."}
