The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow over every waking moment. As a mother, I knew I had to keep a roof over my children\u2019s heads, to make sure they never felt the fear of instability. The pressure to provide, to ensure our family\u2019s future, pressed down on me with every tick of the clock.\n\nThen, the phone rang. It was my boss, offering me a shortcut\u2014a way to earn a significant bonus if I overlooked a small, unethical detail in a client\u2019s paperwork. \u201cNo one will know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just business.\u201d But as a Christian, I was taught to walk in truth, to honor God in all things, even when no one was watching. My heart pounded with the weight of the choice. The promise of financial relief was so tempting, but the thought of betraying my faith gnawed at me. I closed my eyes, torn between the desperate need to protect my family and the call to live with integrity, feeling the two worlds collide inside me."}
