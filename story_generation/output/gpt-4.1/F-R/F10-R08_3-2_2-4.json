I know she expects me to look presentable and modern, like the other young women she admires on social media. At the same time, I feel the weight of my faith\u2014my commitment to dress modestly, to cover my arms and hair, even when everyone else at work will be in sleeveless dresses and styled hair. \n\nI stare at my wardrobe, torn between the sleek dress my mother bought me last Eid and the long-sleeved abaya I usually wear. My mother\u2019s texts keep coming, asking for updates, wanting to know if I\u2019ll fit in with my colleagues. I want to make her proud, to show her I belong, but I also want to honor my beliefs. My heart pounds as I try to compose a reply, feeling the pressure from both sides, unsure how to satisfy both my mother\u2019s wishes and my own sense of faith."}
