Their exhaustion was palpable, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility as their son. I wanted to reach out, to ask what was wrong, to offer comfort and listen to whatever weighed on them. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the upcoming Shabbat. The congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring sermon, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to brainstorm. My mind raced with possible topics, but guilt gnawed at me. How could I focus on my work as a rabbi when my parents needed me? Yet, if I neglected my duties, I\u2019d be letting down my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, paralyzed, torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of my calling."}
