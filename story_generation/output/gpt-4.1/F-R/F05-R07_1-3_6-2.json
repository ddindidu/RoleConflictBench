She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the worries I\u2019d been carrying from work, the small victories, the frustrations. I wanted to give her that, to be the husband who communicates, who doesn\u2019t hide behind silence. But my mind kept drifting to the monastery\u2019s festival tomorrow. The abbot had asked for volunteers to help set up before dawn, and as a practicing Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to be there, to support the community and honor the tradition. I could sense my wife\u2019s hope for a long, honest conversation tonight, but I also knew I needed to rest if I was to be of any use at the monastery. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014her need for connection, the sangha\u2019s need for commitment. I stared at my tea, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
