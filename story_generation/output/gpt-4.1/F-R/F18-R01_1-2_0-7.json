The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and a message that would help them navigate their own moral crossroads. I felt the weight of their trust, the responsibility to teach principles that could shape lives. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my younger brother, texting from the next room. He was preparing for his final exam, his anxiety almost palpable through the walls. He needed me, not as a pastor, but as his sibling, someone to listen, to reassure him that he was more than a grade. I could hear the tremor in his voice when he called out, \u201cCan you help me for a minute?\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for him, to sit beside him and remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But the sermon deadline loomed, and I knew the congregation was counting on me too. Torn between the pulpit and my brother, I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
