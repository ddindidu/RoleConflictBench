My mind raced with numbers, budgets, and the quiet anxiety of ensuring my family\u2019s security. Just as I was mapping out ways to tighten our expenses, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from the congregation, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet her. She was facing a life-altering decision and needed spiritual guidance.

But as I listened, my thoughts kept drifting back to my family, to the bills, to the weight of being the provider.

The pressure to be a steady parent and a devoted pastor pressed in on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet both needs without failing one."}
