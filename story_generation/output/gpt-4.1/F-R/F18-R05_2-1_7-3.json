He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, but this trick was new\u2014and dangerous. As his sibling, I felt a knot of worry tighten in my stomach. I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue was starting in twenty minutes. As the rabbi, I was expected to be there, to teach Torah and guide the community, even if the class was optional and attendance was unpredictable. I could see the anticipation on my brother\u2019s face, and I knew he wanted me to watch, maybe even to cheer him on. But I also pictured the expectant faces of my congregants, waiting for me to share wisdom and tradition. My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and the responsibility, torn by the weight of both roles, unsure which path to take."}
