She sat down, clutching her phone, and whispered, \u201cBubbe, I need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do about my friend\u2014she\u2019s in trouble, and I want to help, but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll make things worse.\u201d My heart ached to comfort her, to share the wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over decades, to be the steady presence she needs.\n\nJust as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next spring. They needed an answer soon, as venues and families were waiting. I knew how important these milestones are, how much my presence as their rabbi means to them.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Miriam\u2019s eyes searched mine for guidance, while the congregation\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind. I wanted to be fully present for my granddaughter, but I also knew my responsibilities as a rabbi could not be ignored. My heart wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
