You have to come!\u201d I could almost hear her laughter, see the rest of the family gathered, waiting for me to join. As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I show up, that I be present, not just in name but in spirit\u2014building the kind of mutual respect we\u2019d promised each other after our parents passed. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. At the same time, I had an appointment with Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation who had finally found the courage to seek help for a struggle she\u2019d kept hidden for years. As her priest, I was expected to be there, to listen, to offer guidance and comfort. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, and my community\u2019s need for support. I sat in my office, torn, the laughter of my family echoing in my mind while the silent plea of Mrs. Carter lingered in my heart, unsure which path to take."}
