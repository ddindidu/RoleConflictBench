My father, silent but clearly troubled, looked to me for reassurance. I could see how much they needed me\u2014to listen, to comfort, to be present. At the same time, I glanced at the clock and realized the Sunday service at church was about to begin. I knew how important it was for me, as a Christian, to join the worship, to be part of the community, and to honor my faith. But here, in this moment, my parents needed me more than ever. My heart ached as I wrestled with the expectations: to be a supportive son, and to be a faithful Christian. I felt torn, unable to ignore the silent plea in my parents\u2019 eyes, yet also feeling the pull of my spiritual commitment. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which path to choose."}
