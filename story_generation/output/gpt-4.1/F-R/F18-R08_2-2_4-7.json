Mom had made it clear\u2014everyone was expected to be there, no excuses. It was rare for all of us to gather, and I knew how much it meant to her. But as I scrolled through my messages, another group chat caught my eye: my friends were finalizing their plans for Hajj this year. I had been saving for this moment for years, setting aside every spare penny, and now the opportunity was finally here. Yet, the cost of the trip would mean missing out on helping with family expenses and possibly not being present for the dinner or other gatherings for a while. My heart twisted as I thought about my duty as a sibling, to be there for my family, and my longing as a Muslim to fulfill this pillar of my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself torn, unable to silence the voices pulling me in opposite directions."}
