The annual festival was tomorrow, and as a Hindu, I was expected to be there\u2014present for every ritual, every offering, every prayer. My family counted on me to uphold tradition, to show devotion, to set an example. Just as I zipped my bag, my granddaughter knocked softly and slipped into the room. Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you?\u201d she asked. She was about to start college, and she needed my guidance\u2014my stories, my advice, my time. She wanted to know how to face the unknown, how to stay true to herself. I could see she needed me now, not later. But the festival was not just a ritual; it was a duty, a part of my identity. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the temple, and toward the child who looked to me for wisdom. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which path to take."}
