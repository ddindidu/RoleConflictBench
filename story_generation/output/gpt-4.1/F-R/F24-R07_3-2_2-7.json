My stepbrother\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind, shaky and raw from the news he\u2019d just received\u2014his mother\u2019s illness had taken a turn for the worse. He needed me, he\u2019d said, and I could hear the desperation in his words. I knew what was expected of me as his step-sibling: to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and support. But tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a commitment I rarely missed. We were set to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I\u2019d promised myself to be more diligent in my spiritual practice. The group would expect my presence, my thoughtful participation. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, my heart pulled in two directions. The urge to help my stepbrother was strong, but so was the quiet call to honor my spiritual path. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
