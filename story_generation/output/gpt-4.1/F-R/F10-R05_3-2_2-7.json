My mother\u2019s name lights up the screen\u2014again. I know what she wants: our daily check-in, the ritual of sharing every small detail, the comfort of my voice. But inside the sanctuary, Ethan\u2019s family waits, the congregation gathering for a moment they\u2019ve anticipated for months. As their rabbi, I am expected to be present, focused, a steady guide through this milestone. Yet, as a daughter, I am expected to be available, attentive, a source of reassurance for my parents. My mother\u2019s texts grow more urgent, and I feel the familiar tug\u2014guilt, love, responsibility\u2014pulling me in two directions. I stare at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the sacred duty before me and the sacred bond that calls from home."}
