My daughter had worked so hard to organize this day, and I knew how much it meant to her that we all be together, sharing a meal, stories, and warmth. But as I peeked at the catered dishes, my heart sank. None of the food had kosher certification, and I could see shrimp cocktail and ham sandwiches among the platters. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. \n\nAs a Jewish woman, I have always tried to keep kosher, not just for myself but as a way to honor my parents and my faith. Yet, as a grandmother, I want to be present, to sit at the table with my family, to show my grandchildren that being together matters more than anything. I could see my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, waiting for me to join, and I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me of the importance of tradition. The two worlds pulled at me, and I stood frozen, torn between the love of my family and the love of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
