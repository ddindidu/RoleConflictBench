As her husband, I knew I should sit beside her, ask her what was weighing on her mind, and share my own worries from the week. We had always promised to communicate openly, to never let silence grow between us. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded with another responsibility. Today was not just any Friday\u2014it was the day our community marked a milestone, and people had travelled from far and wide to hear my sermon. As their imam, I was expected to deliver words of guidance and inspiration, to be present and focused for them. The weight of both roles pressed on me. My wife needed me now, but so did my congregation. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of husband and imam pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which door to walk through first."}
