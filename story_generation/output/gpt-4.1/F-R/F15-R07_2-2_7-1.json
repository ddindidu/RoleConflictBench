My children\u2019s laughter drifts in from the next room, a reminder of why I work so hard. The rent is due soon, and groceries are running low. My boss called earlier, offering me an extra shift tonight\u2014just enough to cover what we need for the week. Relief and guilt twist together in my chest.\n\nBut tonight is also the community memorial service at the temple. As a practicing Buddhist, I am expected to attend, to help prepare offerings and chant with the others. The abbot called this morning, gently reminding me how important my presence is, especially with so many people coming. I know the teachings: generosity, community, mindfulness. I want to be there, to honor those who have passed and support my sangha.\n\nYet, the thought of my children going without weighs heavily on me. I feel torn, pulled between the needs of my family and the commitments of my faith. My heart aches as I stare at the clock, knowing I must choose soon, but unable to move."}
