She had just broken up with her best friend and needed comfort. As her brother, I knew I should be there for her, listen to her, maybe even let her cry on my shoulder. She wanted to spend the day together, just the two of us, lounging in the living room, watching movies in our pajamas like we used to when we were kids.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I was always careful about how I dressed, even at home. My sister, in her distress, had thrown on a sleeveless top and shorts, not thinking about modesty. I felt torn. I wanted to be the supportive brother she needed, but I also felt the weight of my religious responsibility, the expectation to lower my gaze and maintain boundaries, even with family. My heart ached as I sat there, wrestling with the urge to comfort her and the need to uphold my values, unsure of what to do next."}
