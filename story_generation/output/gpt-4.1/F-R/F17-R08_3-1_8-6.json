She looked tired, her eyes red from crying. \u201cI just feel so lost sometimes,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I knew she needed me to be strong, to listen, to offer the comfort she always gave me as a child. I wanted to be there for her, to reassure her that things would get better, but my mind kept drifting to the letter I\u2019d received that morning\u2014a reminder from the mosque about the upcoming Hajj season. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of performing Hajj, and I felt the weight of that obligation pressing on me. But I was just starting my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone save for a pilgrimage. My heart ached with guilt. I wanted to be the supportive child my parents needed, but I also felt the pressure of fulfilling my religious duty. The two roles pulled me in different directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation I could meet without letting someone\u2014or myself\u2014down."}
