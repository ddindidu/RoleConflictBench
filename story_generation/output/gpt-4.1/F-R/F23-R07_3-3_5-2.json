The store clerk\u2019s eyes darted between us, waiting for my response. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing\u2014no matter how small\u2014was unacceptable. My partner trusted me to guide him, to be firm but fair, to help him grow into a good person. But as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s festival preparations were starting in less than an hour. I had promised my teacher and the sangha that I would be there at dawn, helping to set up the altar, arranging flowers, and chanting with the others. It was the one day a year when everyone\u2019s presence was needed, a time to show devotion and support the community. My heart pounded as I looked at my stepson\u2019s guilty face, torn between the urgent need to address his mistake and the deep commitment I felt to my Buddhist practice. I could feel the expectations of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
