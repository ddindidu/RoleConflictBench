My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes linger in my mind\u2014he\u2019s been waiting all week for the Nintendo I promised. He\u2019s been counting down, and I know how much it means to him, especially after the move and all the changes. But the cost is steep, and I\u2019ve been watching our budget closely, trying to keep us afloat. At the same time, tonight is the weekly meditation group. I\u2019m the leader, and everyone counts on me to guide the session, to be calm and present, to embody the mindfulness I teach. I can\u2019t be late, and I can\u2019t be distracted. But my mind is anything but calm. I feel torn\u2014between the promise I made to my stepson and the commitment I made to my sangha, between the material needs of my family and the spiritual practice that grounds me. My heart aches with the pressure, and I close my eyes, searching for a breath of clarity, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
