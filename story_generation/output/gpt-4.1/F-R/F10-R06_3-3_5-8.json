But just outside, through the window, I saw our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, struggling to carry groceries up her steps. She had lost her husband last month, and I knew she was lonely and needed help. My heart ached, remembering the words of Jesus about loving your neighbor and showing kindness. Inside, my family needed me to uphold our heritage, to be the daughter they expected. But outside, someone needed compassion, the kind my faith calls me to give. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take as everyone waited for me to move."}
