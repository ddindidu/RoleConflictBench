My phone buzzed with a message from my mom, asking for a quick video call to catch up. As a son, I knew how much it meant to her that we kept in touch, sharing even the smallest details of our day. She always expected me to respond quickly, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I was suddenly aware that my casual home clothes didn\u2019t meet the modesty guidelines I tried to uphold, even in front of family. The thought of appearing on video, even just for my mom, made me uneasy. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, the warmth of my mother\u2019s expectation for closeness, and on the other, the quiet but firm pull of my faith\u2019s teachings. My thumb hovered over the call button, my heart caught between the comfort of my role as a son and the responsibility of my identity as a Muslim."}
