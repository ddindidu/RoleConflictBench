The expectation was clear: honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to face our fears together. I wanted to be fully present, to reassure and share every detail, but my phone buzzed insistently. A member of my congregation, whose marriage was unraveling, needed me\u2014right now, she said, her voice trembling with desperation. As a pastor, I was expected to offer unwavering support, to be a steady presence for those in crisis. My spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for answers, while my mind raced with the weight of another\u2019s pain. I felt torn, the demands of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my undivided attention, my compassion, my truth. My heart ached with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, someone I loved or served would feel abandoned."}
