The quiet of the afternoon was perfect for reflection, and I had been looking forward to this time all week. Just as I began to read, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mother: \u201cCan we talk? Dad seems down lately.\u201d My heart tightened. As a daughter, I knew how much my parents relied on me for comfort, especially now that I lived away from home. They expected me to check in, to listen, to reassure them that everything would be alright. But as a nun, I was called to set aside worldly concerns, to focus on spiritual growth and contemplation, especially during these precious moments of solitude. I stared at the phone, torn between the gentle pull of my family\u2019s needs and the quiet call of my faith. The silence in the room grew heavy, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
