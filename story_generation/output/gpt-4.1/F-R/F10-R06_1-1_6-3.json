As their daughter, I know how much they rely on me, especially since Dad\u2019s health started to decline. I make it a point to check in, asking if everything is going well at home, listening to their worries, and offering comfort. Lately, though, I\u2019ve felt a growing pull to attend Sunday worship at church. My faith is important to me, and I want to be part of the community, to worship and grow spiritually. But the church service overlaps with the time my parents seem to need me most. I can see the relief in their eyes when I\u2019m there, and the disappointment when I mention church. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches with guilt at the thought of leaving them alone, even for a few hours, but I also long for the peace and connection I find at church. The expectations from both sides weigh heavily on me, and I find myself wrestling with what it means to be a good daughter and a faithful Christian, unsure which path to choose."}
