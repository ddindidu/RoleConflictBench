We\u2019d been searching for a place to eat, but the only vendor nearby was the small kosher cart at the corner, the one I always relied on when traveling. As I scanned the menu, my brother, distracted and impatient, darted ahead toward the curb. I saw him step off the sidewalk, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart leapt into my throat\u2014my first instinct was to shout, to run after him, to make sure he was safe. But at the same moment, I remembered the vendor\u2019s strict closing time and the long line forming behind me. If I left now, I might miss my only chance for a kosher meal all day. I felt torn, the weight of my responsibility as a sibling pulling me one way, and my commitment to keeping kosher tugging me the other. My mind raced, caught between the urge to protect my brother and the need to honor my faith, both expectations pressing in on me, demanding an answer."}
