We laughed about a joke from class, but our mood shifted when we saw our friend, Rohan, being cornered by a group of older kids. They were mocking him, pushing his backpack, their voices sharp and cruel. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to protect those who are wronged, and to act with courage and compassion. But as a sibling, my parents always reminded me: \u201cLook out for your brother. Keep him safe.\u201d If I intervened, I might put my brother in harm\u2019s way. If I walked away, I\u2019d betray my values and leave Rohan alone. My brother\u2019s hand tightened around mine, his eyes wide with fear and trust. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to protect my sibling and the responsibility to uphold my moral beliefs, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I struggled to decide what to do."}
