My family had always counted on me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be a brother in every sense. But as I set the phone down, another message buzzed in\u2014this time from Mark, a member of my congregation. His wife had just left him, and he was desperate for someone to talk to, someone to help him find his footing again. As a pastor, I knew my role was to offer support, to be available when my community needed me most. The dinner and Mark\u2019s crisis overlapped, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my presence, my laughter, my love. My congregation expected my guidance, my comfort, my time. I sat in the quiet, torn between the warmth of home and the call of duty, my heart aching as I tried to figure out how to be both brother and pastor when both needed me now."}
