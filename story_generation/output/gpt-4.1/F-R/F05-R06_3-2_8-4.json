She wanted to talk openly about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up and the choices we\u2019d have to make. As her husband, I knew she expected honesty and full transparency, a willingness to lay everything bare so we could face it together. But as she spoke, I glanced at the clock. Sunday service would start in less than an hour, and as a Christian, I felt the pull to be present at church, to worship and support our community. I could sense her need for me to stay, to listen, to reassure her that we were in this together. At the same time, I felt the tug of my faith, the expectation that I would not let my church family down. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice\u2014be the open, supportive husband she needed right now, or the committed Christian who never missed a service."}
