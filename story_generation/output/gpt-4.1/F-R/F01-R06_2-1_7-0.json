She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement. As a grandfather, I knew I should call her, share in her joy, and offer encouragement. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected\u2014regular communication, being present, showing support. But as I read her message, I noticed she mentioned a few things about her workplace that troubled me: the company\u2019s business practices didn\u2019t seem to align with the Christian values I try to live by every day. I felt a knot in my stomach. Should I celebrate her achievement wholeheartedly, or should I gently raise my concerns about the ethics of her new employer? I wanted to be the supportive grandfather she needed, but I also felt the weight of my faith, urging me to speak up for what I believe is right. The phone sat in my hand, my thumb hovering over the call button, as I wrestled with the expectations pulling me in two directions."}
