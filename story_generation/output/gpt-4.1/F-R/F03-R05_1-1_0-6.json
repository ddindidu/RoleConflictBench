My mother\u2019s name flashes on the screen\u2014just a simple, \u201cHow are you, sweetheart?\u201d I haven\u2019t called her in over a week, only sent a few quick texts. I know she wants more, a real conversation, but I keep telling myself I\u2019ll call when things slow down. At the same time, my email inbox dings. A young couple from the congregation is asking if I can officiate their wedding next summer. They want to meet soon, to talk about dates and details. As their rabbi, I know how important it is to be present, to guide them through this milestone. But the thought of another commitment, another evening away from my own family, weighs on me. I stare at my phone, torn between the son my parents hope I\u2019ll be and the rabbi my community needs. My fingers hover over the keyboard, caught between replying to my mother or the couple, feeling the pull of both worlds and not sure which to answer first."}
