The letter from my stepmother lay open in my lap, her familiar handwriting inviting me home for the annual family holiday\u2014an event I\u2019d never missed, even after taking my vows. My father expected me to help with the rituals, to light the candles and recite the prayers, to show that I still honored our family\u2019s traditions. Yet, just this morning, Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the sisters during the retreat, a responsibility that demanded my full presence and spiritual focus. I could almost hear her gentle voice reminding me that my commitment to the community was sacred, that my role as a nun came before all else. My heart twisted as I imagined my family gathered without me, my place at the table empty. I felt torn, pulled between the warmth of home and the quiet devotion of the convent, each side asking for a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
