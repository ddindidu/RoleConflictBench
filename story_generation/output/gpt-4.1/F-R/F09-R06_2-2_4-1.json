Suddenly, my son darted away, weaving between shoppers, giggling as he knocked over a display of apples. Embarrassed, I felt the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to discipline him. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him about respect and self-control, to correct him firmly so he\u2019d learn right from wrong. But as a Christian, I was reminded of patience, gentleness, and showing love even in moments of frustration. The urge to raise my voice battled with the quiet whisper inside, urging me to respond with grace. I could feel my cheeks burning, torn between the need to set boundaries and the call to embody Christ\u2019s compassion. My heart pounded as I reached for my son, wrestling with how to respond, knowing that whatever I did next would shape both his behavior and his understanding of love."}
