It\u2019s a ritual as sacred as any prayer, a time to check in, to hear my mother\u2019s voice, to reassure my father that I\u2019m eating well and sleeping enough. This week, though, my mind is tangled with the sermon I need to finish for Shabbat. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, a message that will carry them through the week. I glance at the clock\u2014just an hour before sundown. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s my mother, right on time, her name lighting up the screen. I know she\u2019ll want to talk, to share stories, to ask about my week. But my notes are scattered across the desk, half-formed ideas swirling in my head. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the daughter who should listen patiently, the rabbi who must lead with wisdom. My heart aches with the pull of both roles, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. The phone keeps ringing, and I sit frozen, torn between the voices that need me."}
