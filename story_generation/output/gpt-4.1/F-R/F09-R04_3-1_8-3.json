The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I felt the weight of my family\u2019s future pressing on my shoulders. As a mother, I knew I had to ensure our financial stability, to keep a roof over my children\u2019s heads. Every extra hour I could work, every side job I could take, mattered.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I remembered my other responsibility. Friday was approaching, and as the imam, the community expected me to deliver the Khutbah. My words guided them, gave them hope and direction. This week, though, a guest speaker was available\u2014he could step in if I needed. The thought tempted me. If I let him take the pulpit, I could use those precious hours to work, to prepare for the looming payment.\n\nYet, I felt torn. My congregation looked to me for leadership, especially in these uncertain times. Could I let them down, even for my family\u2019s sake? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I sat there, heart pounding, unable to decide which duty to fulfill."}
