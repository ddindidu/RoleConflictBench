They expect me, as always, to be the heart of our gathering, to listen to their stories, to laugh and cook and remind them of our traditions. I feel their longing for connection, especially after a year when we\u2019ve all been so busy. Yet, as the imam of our small mosque, I am also expected to lead the daily prayers, to be present for the congregation, even if it is just a handful of worshippers. Another brother is available to step in, but I know some in the community look to me for guidance and comfort, especially during these uncertain times. My heart aches as I weigh the warmth of my family\u2019s embrace against the quiet responsibility I hold at the mosque. The expectations press in from both sides, and I find myself torn, wondering which duty should guide my next step."}
