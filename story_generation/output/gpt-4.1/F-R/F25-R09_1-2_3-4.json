My step-siblings were already inside, waving me in, their faces bright with the excitement of our family road trip. My stepmother had made it clear\u2014joining in family meals was important, a way to show I belonged, to honor the traditions she cherished. But as I glanced at the menu taped to the window, I knew nothing inside was kosher. My stomach tightened. The only kosher option was a tiny vendor across the lot, a place my family always ignored, dismissing it as unfamiliar and inconvenient. I could already hear my stepmother\u2019s sigh if I excused myself, the subtle disappointment in her eyes. But the thought of breaking kosher gnawed at me, a quiet guilt that wouldn\u2019t let go. I wanted to be part of this family, to fit in, but I also wanted to stay true to who I was. My heart pounded as I stood between the diner and the vendor, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
