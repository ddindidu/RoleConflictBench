He wanted to talk about the hospital bills, about the future, about the things that weighed on both our hearts. He needed me to be present, to listen, to share my fears and hopes with him. I could feel the expectation in the silence between us: honesty, openness, the kind of trust that marriage is built on. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from the convent. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil, a rare honor, and the sisters were counting on me. The community needed my devotion, my voice, my presence at the altar. I felt the pull of both worlds, the vows I had made to God and to my husband, each demanding all of me at the same moment. My heart pounded as I looked at the clock, torn between the sacred call of prayer and the sacred trust of marriage, knowing I could not give myself fully to both."}
