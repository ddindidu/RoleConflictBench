My sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I could hear her muffled sobs before she even spoke. \u201cCan you come? I really need you,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. My heart clenched\u2014she never called unless it was serious. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, but as I hung up, the heavy church doors creaked open. A woman stumbled in, her face streaked with tears, clutching a crumpled letter. \u201cFather, please, I need to talk to someone. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she pleaded, her voice raw with desperation.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the two worlds I belonged to. My sister needed her brother, someone to hold her and listen. But this woman needed her priest, someone to offer comfort and guidance. Both expected me to be present, to give them my full attention and care. My chest tightened as I looked from the phone in my hand to the woman before me, feeling the weight of their needs pressing in from both sides. I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible pull of love and duty, not knowing which path to take."}
