My younger brother wants to go hiking, my parents suggest a movie night, and my sister is already making a list of snacks. I know how much these moments mean to them\u2014how much they mean to me, too. Being present for family activities is something I\u2019ve always valued as a sister. But as I listen, my phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation at the temple is in an hour. It\u2019s a practice I\u2019ve committed to as a Buddhist, a time to cultivate mindfulness and inner peace. I feel a knot tightening in my chest. If I join the family plans, I\u2019ll miss the meditation I\u2019ve been looking forward to all week. If I go to the temple, I\u2019ll disappoint my family, who expect me to be there, laughing and sharing stories. The expectations tug at me from both sides, and I find myself caught in the middle, uncertain and uneasy, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
