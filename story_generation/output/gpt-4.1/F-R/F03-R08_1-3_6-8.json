Lately, I\u2019d made it a habit to check in, asking if everything was alright at home, trying to be the supportive son they needed. My mother smiled, but I could see the tiredness in her eyes. My father\u2019s health had been fragile, and I knew they relied on me more than ever for comfort and reassurance.\n\nBut today, my mind was elsewhere. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance to travel safely.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, something I\u2019d dreamed of fulfilling. Yet, the thought of leaving my parents, even for a few weeks, filled me with guilt. What if they needed me? What if something happened while I was gone?\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My heart ached with the desire to honor my faith, but also with the fear of letting my parents down when they needed me most. I stared at my hands, unsure which path I could bear to choose."}
