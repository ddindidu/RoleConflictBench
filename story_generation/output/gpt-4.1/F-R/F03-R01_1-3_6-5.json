A terrible storm had swept through town, leaving several families without homes. As their pastor, I was expected to organize support, offer counseling, and be present for those in crisis. My mind raced with plans\u2014shelter, food, prayers. Just then, my mother entered the room, her face drawn and tired. \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d I asked, trying to sound calm, but she hesitated before answering. I could sense something was wrong, but she brushed it off, not wanting to burden me. I knew my parents needed me, too. As their son, I was supposed to be their emotional anchor, to check in and make sure they felt supported. But the weight of my congregation\u2019s needs pressed on me, demanding my attention and presence. My heart pulled in two directions, I stared at my phone, torn between rushing to help my community and sitting down to truly listen to my parents. The expectations from both sides felt impossible to meet at once, and I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which call to answer first."}
