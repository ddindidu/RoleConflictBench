My heart pounded with shame and worry. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable and that actions have consequences. I wanted to sit with him, talk through his mistake, and help him understand the importance of honesty and discipline. But tonight was the annual memorial service at the temple\u2014a sacred Buddhist ritual where my presence was expected, not just as a participant but as someone who helps lead the chanting. The community would notice if I was absent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the urgent need to guide my child through this moment, and the deep responsibility to my spiritual community. My mind raced, torn between the demands of motherhood and the call of my Buddhist practice, unsure which path to follow as the minutes slipped away."}
