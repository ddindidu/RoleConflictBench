My granddaughter\u2019s voice was bright with excitement as she told me about her new job, her words tumbling over each other. She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear the pride in her voice. I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present for these moments, just as a grandfather should be. But as she spoke, the call to prayer echoed from the mosque next door, louder than usual. Today was the special remembrance, and the congregation was larger than I\u2019d seen in months. I was the only imam present, the only one authorized to lead. I could already sense the anticipation in the air, the community\u2019s need for guidance and comfort. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my attention and love, and toward my community, who looked to me for spiritual leadership. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my granddaughter\u2019s laughter in my ear, the faithful waiting in the mosque, and I sat there, torn, unsure which duty to answer first."}
