I know I should call him back, teach him respect for others and the discipline I want him to carry through life. That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014guides, corrects, sets boundaries. But today, my mind is split. In an hour, we\u2019re expected at the community event, where the food is already a problem. The dishes aren\u2019t certified kosher, and I\u2019ve been wrestling with how to handle it\u2014do I let my son eat what\u2019s there, risking our family\u2019s commitment to Jewish law, or do I make a scene, possibly embarrassing him and myself in front of friends? The weight of both roles presses on me: the father who must teach right from wrong, the Jew who must uphold tradition. My son\u2019s laughter snaps me back. I open my mouth, torn between calling him to order and rehearsing what I\u2019ll say about the food later. The expectations swirl, and I feel the tension rising, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
