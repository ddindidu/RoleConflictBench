Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much these family moments matter. I wanted to be there, to laugh with them, to be the sister they counted on. But just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her words trembling with uncertainty, asking if I could meet soon. She needed guidance, someone to help her find hope in the middle of her storm. As her pastor, I knew how much she depended on me, how my presence could make a difference. My heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down. I felt the ache of wanting to be everything for everyone, knowing I couldn\u2019t. I sat in silence, torn between the family who shaped me and the flock who needed me, unsure which call to answer first."}
