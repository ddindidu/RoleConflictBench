As his step-sibling, I always felt responsible for him, especially since our parents married last year. I kept an eye on him, making sure he didn\u2019t dart into the street or get too close to the stray dogs that sometimes roamed our neighborhood. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a message from the church council: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014right now\u2014to help organize shelter and offer comfort. My heart pounded. As a pastor, I was expected to be there for my community in times of crisis, to provide guidance and support. But Jake was right beside me, trusting me to get him home safely. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I rush to the church and leave Jake to walk home alone, or stay with him and delay my response to the family in need? The street ahead seemed to stretch forever, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
