She wanted me to help prepare the ancestral dishes, decorate the house, and lead the prayers\u2014just as my late father would have wanted. But my phone buzzed with another message from Sister Maria: the mayor was pleading for help. The hurricane had left so many without shelter, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, organize volunteers, and comfort the displaced. My heart ached, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the urgent, desperate needs of the community. I could see my stepmother\u2019s hopeful eyes, hear the silent prayers of those left homeless, and feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
