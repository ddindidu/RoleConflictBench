We miss you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20149:30 a.m.\u2014and my church service starts in half an hour. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents all week, just sent a quick text on Friday, and I know they expect more. They want to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to feel connected. But I also know how important it is for me to be at church, to worship, to be part of the community that grounds my faith. My pastor always says that being present matters, that we grow together in Christ. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me. If I call my parents now, I\u2019ll miss the service. If I go to church, I\u2019ll disappoint them again. My heart aches as I stare at my phone, torn between being a good daughter and a faithful Christian, unsure which call to answer first."}
