He\u2019d been saving up, counting the days until I would buy him the Nintendo he wanted so badly. I wanted to give him that joy, to show him that I could provide, that I could keep my word as a father. But as I glanced at the calendar, I saw the holiday approaching\u2014one of the most important in our tradition. My own father had always made sure I knew the blessings, the stories, the meaning behind every ritual. I felt the weight of that legacy pressing on me. My son\u2019s eyes sparkled with excitement for the game, but I worried he was missing the deeper spark, the connection to our heritage. Money was tight, and time even tighter. I felt torn, pulled between the need to provide and the need to teach, between the world he wanted and the world I wanted him to inherit. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give him both, at least not right now."}
