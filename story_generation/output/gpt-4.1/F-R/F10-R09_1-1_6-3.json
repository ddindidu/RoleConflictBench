She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I felt that familiar tug of worry. As her daughter, I knew I should ask if everything was okay, offer to help, or just sit with her and listen. But as I reached for her hand, she smiled and pressed a plate of homemade cookies into mine. \u201cEat, sweetheart,\u201d she said, her voice gentle but insistent. I hesitated. The cookies weren\u2019t made with kosher ingredients\u2014she\u2019d used regular butter, and the chocolate chips weren\u2019t certified. I could see how much it meant to her, how she wanted to share something from her heart, to feel close. I wanted to be the daughter she needed, to accept her comfort and give her mine. But my Jewish identity tugged at me, reminding me of the rules I\u2019d chosen to follow, the boundaries I\u2019d set. My mother\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to take a bite, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
