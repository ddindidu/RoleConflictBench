The school\u2019s open class was that afternoon, and my daughter had been talking about it for weeks. She wanted me there, to see her artwork and meet her teacher. I knew how much it meant to her, and as a parent, I wanted to be present, to show her that her efforts mattered.\n\nBut Thursday was also just two days before Shavuot. We hadn\u2019t yet practiced the blessings or talked about the story of receiving the Torah. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my responsibility as a Jewish parent was to pass on these traditions, to make sure my children understood and cherished our heritage. The evenings were already packed with homework and dinner, and now the open class would take up the one evening I\u2019d set aside for our holiday preparations.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the school\u2019s expectations and my own sense of duty to our faith. My daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes and the unopened siddur on the table both called to me, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
