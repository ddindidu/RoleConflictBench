Tonight, we gather for a special healing service\u2014Sister Agnes is gravely ill, and the whole community is called to pray. I know I should silence my phone, focus my heart, and join the others in prayer. But the message from my mother glows insistently on the screen: \u201cHow was your day? Did you eat well? Call me if you can.\u201d She expects a reply, as she always does, every evening. Our daily conversations are her comfort, her way of knowing I am safe and well, even as I live behind these convent walls.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My sisters in faith expect my presence, my undivided attention, my prayers for Agnes. My mother expects my words, my voice, my reassurance. I clutch my phone, torn between the sacred silence of the chapel and the familiar warmth of my mother\u2019s concern. My heart aches with the impossibility of being fully present in both places at once."}
