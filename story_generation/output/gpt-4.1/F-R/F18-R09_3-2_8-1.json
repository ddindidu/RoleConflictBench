He was about to cross the street, eyes fixed on the ice cream truck across the road, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart pounded\u2014my parents always told me to look out for him, to keep him safe. I wanted to shout, to grab his arm, but at the same time, I remembered the promise I made to my mother: to help the kids learn the blessings for the upcoming holiday. We were already behind, and she was counting on me to teach them before sundown. If I stopped him now, I\u2019d have to wrangle him back home, and we\u2019d lose precious time. But if I let him go, even for a second, I risked his safety. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, my mind racing between the urgency of the street and the importance of our traditions. I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice between protecting my brother and fulfilling my role in our family\u2019s Jewish life."}
