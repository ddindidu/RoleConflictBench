I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them\u2014preserving our traditions, honoring our ancestors. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, a community member. \u201cImam, if you have a moment this weekend, I\u2019d really appreciate some advice,\u201d he wrote. I could sense the weight behind his casual words; he rarely reached out, and I knew he must be struggling.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a child, I wanted to make my family proud, to be the link that kept our traditions alive. As an imam, I felt the responsibility to be there for my community, to offer guidance when it was needed most. Both roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, my time, my heart. I stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure build, torn between the expectations of my family and the needs of my community, unsure how I could possibly fulfill both."}
