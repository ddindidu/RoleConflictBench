He needed me here, now, to talk about the mounting medical bills and the choices we had to make. He expected honesty, partnership, and my undivided attention. My phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from the convent. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil, a rare honor, and the sisters were counting on me to represent our community with grace and devotion. My heart pounded as I glanced between the clock and my husband\u2019s trembling hands. I could not be in two places at once. If I stayed, I would miss the vigil and let down my sisters and God. If I left, I would abandon my husband in a moment of vulnerability, betraying the trust we\u2019d built. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I felt tears prick my eyes as I tried to steady my voice, caught between the vows I\u2019d made to my faith and the promises I\u2019d made to the man I loved."}
