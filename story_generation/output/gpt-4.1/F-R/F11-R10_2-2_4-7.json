My brother had been looking forward to it all week, and Mom had already asked me twice to help set the table. As a sister, I knew how much these small gatherings meant to everyone, especially after how busy we\u2019d all been lately. But at the same time, my mind kept drifting to the temple. Tonight was the start of Navratri, and I had promised myself I would attend the evening aarti, wearing my new saree and joining the prayers with the community. The ceremony was important to me, a way to connect with my faith and traditions. Both events overlapped, and I could feel the tension building inside me. If I missed the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my family. If I skipped the ceremony, I\u2019d feel like I was letting down my beliefs. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both a good sister and a devoted Hindu, knowing that tonight, I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
