She had just started her first job and was struggling with a difficult coworker. \u201cGrandma, how do you know when to speak up and when to let things go?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I felt the familiar urge to share stories from my own youth, to offer her the comfort of my experience and the guidance she sought. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the weekly meditation group would begin in fifteen minutes. As a Buddhist, I had committed to this hour of mindfulness, a time to cultivate inner peace and clarity. The group relied on my presence, and I cherished the stillness it brought to my life. Yet here was Mei, needing me in a different way, her question hanging in the air. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the wisdom I could offer my granddaughter, and the quiet sanctuary of my Buddhist practice. I sat in silence, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to follow."}
