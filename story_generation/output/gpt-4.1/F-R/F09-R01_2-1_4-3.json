My son darted away, weaving between displays, his laughter echoing down the aisle. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014he needed to learn discipline, to understand boundaries. I called his name, my voice firmer than I intended, but he only giggled and ran farther. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to check in. She wrote, \u201cToday\u2019s been especially hard. If you have a moment, I\u2019d appreciate a prayer.\u201d I stared at the screen, torn. My son needed me to guide him, to teach him right from wrong, but Mrs. Carter needed comfort, a reminder that she wasn\u2019t alone. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, patient, and wise. I stood in the aisle, heart pounding, caught between the needs of my child and the needs of my flock, unsure which to answer first."}
