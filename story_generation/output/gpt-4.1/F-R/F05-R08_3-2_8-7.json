She looked at me, her eyes searching for reassurance as we discussed her recent health diagnosis and the expensive treatment her doctor recommended. As her husband, I knew I owed her honesty and openness, to share my thoughts and fears, to make decisions together. But in my heart, another voice spoke\u2014the longing to fulfill my duty as a Muslim and perform Hajj. This year, my friends were going, and the money we\u2019d saved was finally enough. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the expectation to be a supportive, transparent partner, and the spiritual pull to answer the call of pilgrimage. My hands trembled as I tried to find the words, torn between the promise I made to her and the promise I felt to my faith. The silence stretched, heavy with everything I wanted to say but couldn\u2019t, as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
