As a parent, I was determined to teach my daughter the importance of daily manners\u2014how to greet elders, how to sit at the table, how to speak politely. She was struggling with patience, and I knew I needed to guide her gently, to help her understand why these small acts matter. But as a Hindu, today was special\u2014our family was gathering for a religious ceremony, and it was expected that we arrive on time, dressed in our finest, to show respect for tradition and the gods. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late. Yet, as I watched my daughter fidget and resist my instructions, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I rush her, risking a lesson lost, or stay and teach, knowing I might disappoint my family and disrespect our customs? My heart ached with the pressure of these expectations, and I stood in the hallway, torn, unable to move forward."}
