She\u2019s starting high school soon, and she asked, \u201cGrandma, how do I know who to trust and how to treat people who aren\u2019t kind to me?\u201d As a grandparent, I felt the weight of her question, knowing she needed practical advice\u2014wisdom from my own tangled path through life. I wanted to tell her to be careful, to protect herself, to keep her heart guarded.\n\nBut then, as a Christian, I remembered the words of Jesus about loving your enemies and showing kindness even when it\u2019s hard. Just yesterday, I saw a neighbor struggling, and I felt compelled to reach out, to offer help and compassion, just as my faith teaches. Now, I wondered: should I tell my granddaughter to be cautious and self-protective, or to open her heart and show love, even to those who might hurt her? The two voices inside me wrestled, each pulling me in a different direction, as I looked at her hopeful face, searching for the right words."}
