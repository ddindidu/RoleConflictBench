My daughter had called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being together. As a grandfather, I knew how important it was to be present, to make memories, to show them they mattered.\n\nBut this morning, as I was leaving the grocery store, I saw a man sitting on the curb, shivering in the cold, his hands cupped around a battered coffee cup. He looked up, eyes hollow but hopeful. My heart ached. As a Christian, I\u2019d always believed in showing love and kindness, just as Jesus taught. I felt a pull to sit with him, to listen, maybe even take him somewhere warm.\n\nYet, the clock was ticking. If I stopped, I\u2019d be late for the family gathering, maybe miss it altogether. My daughter\u2019s words echoed in my mind, but so did the teachings of my faith. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
