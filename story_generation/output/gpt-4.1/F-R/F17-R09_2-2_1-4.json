It\u2019s our weekly call, something she looks forward to, and I know she expects me to share everything\u2014how I\u2019m doing, what I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m taking care of myself. I glance at the time, stomach rumbling, and realize I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. The only kosher vendor nearby is about to close, and if I don\u2019t hurry, I\u2019ll miss my chance for a proper meal. But my mom is asking about my day, wanting to hear every detail, and I can hear the hope in her voice that I\u2019ll stay on the line a little longer. I feel torn\u2014if I cut the call short, I\u2019ll disappoint her, but if I stay, I\u2019ll miss the kosher meal and break a promise to myself and my faith. My heart pounds as I try to listen to her, my mind racing between the warmth of her words and the pull of my beliefs, caught in the space where being a good child and a good Jew seem to pull me in opposite directions."}
