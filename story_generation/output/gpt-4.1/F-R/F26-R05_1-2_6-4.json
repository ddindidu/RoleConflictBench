I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing the laughter and the familiar chaos of our gatherings. But as I hung up, my eyes fell on my calendar\u2014bold letters marked the same evening for the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue. As the rabbi, I was expected to lead, to teach, to be present for the children and their families who relied on me for guidance and learning. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the joy of being a grandparent, the responsibility of being a rabbi. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would disappoint people I cared about. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat in silence, heart heavy, unsure which call to answer."}
