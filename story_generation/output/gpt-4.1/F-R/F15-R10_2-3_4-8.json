We traveled for hours to reach the temple, my heart full of anticipation and a sense of duty to honor my heritage. As the ceremony began, incense swirling in the air, I felt the weight of my role as a Hindu, expected to participate fully and respectfully in every offering and chant.\n\nBut my son, restless from the long journey, darted away from my side and began running between the aisles of the temple\u2019s small supermarket, giggling and weaving through the crowd. I could see the disapproving glances from elders and felt the pressure to correct his behavior, to teach him discipline and respect in public spaces. Yet, if I left the rituals to chase after him, I would be failing in my religious duties, missing the sacred moments I had come so far to honor. My heart pounded as I stood torn, the expectations of being a good parent and a devoted Hindu pulling me in opposite directions."}
