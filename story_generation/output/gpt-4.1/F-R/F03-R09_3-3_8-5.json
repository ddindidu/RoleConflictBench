She leaned in, her voice trembling as she confided in me about her recent health scare. I could see the worry etched on her face, and I knew she needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure her. As I reached for her hand, a server placed a plate in front of me\u2014chicken in a creamy sauce, rolls, and salad. My stomach tightened. The food wasn\u2019t kosher, and I could see there was no alternative. My parents, especially my mother, always valued our traditions, but right now, she needed comfort more than anything. I felt her eyes on me, searching for support, while the aroma of the meal reminded me of the laws I\u2019d promised to uphold. I wanted to be the son she needed, to share this meal and ease her burden, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to my faith. My heart pounded as I sat there, torn between honoring my mother in her moment of vulnerability and staying true to the dietary laws that shaped my identity."}
