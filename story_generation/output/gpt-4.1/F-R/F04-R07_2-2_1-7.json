It was my younger sister, her voice trembling on the other end. She\u2019d just broken up with her boyfriend and needed someone to talk to. As her brother, I knew she expected me to be there, to listen and comfort her, just as I always had. But tonight was also the only time our Buddhist group could meet to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I\u2019d promised myself to be more committed to my spiritual practice. The group counted on my presence and participation, and I longed for the peace and insight those evenings brought me. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the quiet sanctuary of the temple and the urgent need in my sister\u2019s voice. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, each pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the tension rise as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
