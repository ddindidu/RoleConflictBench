Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014just to talk, to feel that I was there for them, to ask if everything was okay at home, as I tried to do every week. But tonight, the parish council was gathering for the first planning meeting for our adult faith formation series, and as the priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to set the vision for the coming season. I could already picture the circle of expectant faces in the parish hall, waiting for me to open in prayer and guide the discussion. My parents needed me as their son, someone to listen and reassure them. My parish needed me as their priest, someone to shepherd and teach. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the phone heavy in my hand, my heart torn between the home I came from and the home I was called to serve."}
