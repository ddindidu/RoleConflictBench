My grandson, always so bright and full of laughter, was struggling with something dark and heavy. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. My family expected me to be present, to check in, to help hold them together in times of crisis. Yet, as I hung up, the convent bell rang, signaling the start of our emergency charity drive. A family in our neighborhood had lost everything in a fire, and my sisters were already gathering food and clothing to deliver. As a nun, I was expected to put the needs of the suffering community first, to serve selflessly and without hesitation. My heart ached, torn between the desperate needs of my own family and the urgent call to serve others. I stood in the hallway, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which path to take."}
