My heart pounded with worry\u2014I knew I should stay close, ready to help if anything went wrong. That\u2019s what being a good sibling meant: looking out for him, making sure he was safe. But as I glanced at my watch, I realized it was almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I was raised to never skip my prayers, to honor the gods with chanting and offerings at the exact time every day. The incense and flowers were already set up in the prayer room, waiting for me. I felt torn, caught between the pull of my faith and the responsibility I felt for my brother. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me as I tried to decide which role I should honor in this moment."}
