Haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\u201d I smiled, remembering how we used to laugh for hours over cards and snacks. As his sister, I know how much it means to him when I show up, how it builds the respect and closeness we\u2019ve worked hard to maintain. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. Shabbat was coming, and I hadn\u2019t even started brainstorming for my next sermon. The congregation expects thoughtful, inspiring messages, and I pride myself on never letting them down. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my brother\u2019s hope for connection, my community\u2019s need for guidance. I wanted to be present for both, but the hours in the day felt impossibly short. My mind raced with possible sermon topics, but guilt tugged at me for even considering skipping game night. I stared at my phone, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
