It means a lot to Mom.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, reminding me how rarely we all get together. My heart ached at the thought of missing the laughter, the shared stories, the sense of belonging that only family brings.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a call from the church deacon. \u201cPastor, several families lost their homes in the flood last night. They need you. We\u2019re organizing emergency shelter and counseling. Can you come right away?\u201d The weight of my congregation\u2019s pain pressed on me. They looked to me for comfort, for guidance, for hope in the darkest moments.\n\nI felt torn in two, the expectations of brother and pastor pulling me in opposite directions. My family needed me to show up, to be present, to celebrate life together. My community needed me to lead, to support, to help them heal. I sat in silence, my heart pounding, caught between love and duty, unsure which call to answer."}
