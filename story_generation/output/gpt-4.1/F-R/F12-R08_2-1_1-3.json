He needed me\u2014my words, my comfort, my presence. I wanted to be there for him, to sit close, to hold his hand, to reassure him that whatever he chose, I would stand by him. But as I reached for my favorite soft pajamas, I hesitated. They were comfortable, but not as modest as I usually wore, even at home. My faith taught me to dress modestly, to uphold my values at all times, even in the privacy of my own house. Yet, my husband\u2019s eyes pleaded for closeness, for the warmth of my support, and I knew he found comfort in the casual intimacy of our home. I felt torn\u2014between the gentle pull of my faith and the immediate need to be the supportive wife he needed. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, pajamas in one hand, my modest robe in the other, caught between two worlds that both meant everything to me."}
