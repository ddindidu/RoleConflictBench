My robe was already laid out, and the congregation would soon gather, expecting my calm presence and guidance. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the school. My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in immediately to discuss his behavior. As a step-parent, I knew I needed to be there for Ethan, to show him support and help him understand the gravity of his actions. But as a priest, I was expected to lead the prayer, to be a steady anchor for my community. My heart pounded with guilt and worry. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint the congregation and disrupt their spiritual routine. If I stayed, I\u2019d fail Ethan when he needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to choose them first. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds I loved."}
