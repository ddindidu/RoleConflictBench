My father called me over, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family traditions, especially now that we were all together. I could see the hope in his eyes, the silent plea for me to bridge the gap between old and new, to be the step-child who honored their values. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had just arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and wisdom, to be the steady hand in someone\u2019s storm. My heart pounded as I looked from my family, gathered and waiting, to the phone in my hand. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014one asking for my presence, the other for my compassion. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, caught in the silent struggle of choosing which part of myself to honor."}
