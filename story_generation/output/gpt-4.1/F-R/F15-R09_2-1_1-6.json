She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play and asking if I\u2019d be there. \u201cOf course,\u201d I\u2019d promised, ruffling her hair. But as I checked my phone, a reminder popped up for the Thursday evening minyan at synagogue. I\u2019d missed last week, and though the attendance is usually fine, I know how much it means to my community to show up, to be counted, to keep the rhythm of our tradition alive. My wife caught my eye, sensing my hesitation. \u201cShe\u2019ll be looking for you,\u201d she said softly. I nodded, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My daughter\u2019s hopeful face, the pride in her eyes if I\u2019m there. The quiet expectation of my congregation, the comfort of shared prayer. I could feel the tension knotting in my chest, torn between being the parent my child needs and the Jew my community expects. I sat down at the kitchen table, head in my hands, trying to figure out how to be both at once."}
