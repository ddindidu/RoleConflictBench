He didn\u2019t say a word, just brushed past me into his room. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could feel his pain. As his sibling, I wanted to sit beside him, listen, and remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other after Mom died: to be there, no matter what.\n\nBut my phone buzzed. It was a reminder about the appointment I\u2019d scheduled with Mrs. Carter, a parishioner who\u2019d confided in me about her ongoing struggle with depression. She was coming in fifteen minutes, and I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer hope and guidance. As a priest, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and reliable for my community.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My brother needed me now, but so did Mrs. Carter. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the love of family and the call of my vocation."}
