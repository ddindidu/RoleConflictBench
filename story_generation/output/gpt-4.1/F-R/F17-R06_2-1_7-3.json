I hear them talking in hushed tones about bills and work, and I feel this urge to sit with them, to make them tea, to just be there so they know they\u2019re not alone. I know they expect me to help out more, to be present, especially now when things seem so heavy for them. But Sunday is coming, and I keep thinking about church\u2014how I haven\u2019t been in weeks, how I miss the singing, the prayers, the sense of belonging. I know as a Christian I should be there, worshipping, connecting with others, and I feel guilty for letting that part of me slip. The thought of leaving my parents alone on Sunday morning, though, makes my chest tighten. I want to be a good child, but I also want to be a good Christian. The expectations pull at me from both sides, and I sit in my room, torn, not sure which part of me should come first."}
