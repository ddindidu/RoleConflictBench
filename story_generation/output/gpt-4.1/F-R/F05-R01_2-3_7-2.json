I knew something was weighing on her, and as her husband, I wanted to be present, to listen, to share my own worries and invite her to do the same. But my phone buzzed\u2014again. It was a message from a church member in crisis, someone who needed urgent spiritual guidance. Their choices tonight could change the course of their life, and as their pastor, I felt the heavy responsibility to respond, to offer counsel and comfort.\n\nMy wife looked up, her eyes searching mine, silently asking if I was really there with her. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me. I wanted to be the open, attentive husband she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the call for help from someone relying on me as their pastor. My heart ached with the weight of both responsibilities, and I sat there, phone in hand, caught between the two worlds that defined me."}
