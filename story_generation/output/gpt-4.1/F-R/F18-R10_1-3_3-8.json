My younger sister looked at me with hopeful eyes, suggesting a movie marathon and a picnic at the park. I could see how much it meant to her, and my parents chimed in, eager for us all to spend time together. Just as I was about to agree, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the annual Navratri festival was starting this weekend, and my extended family expected me to travel to our ancestral town to participate in the rituals and ceremonies. As a practicing Hindu, I knew how important it was to be present, to honor our traditions, and to help with the offerings. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s desire for togetherness and my duty to my faith. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I felt torn, caught between the warmth of my sibling bond and the pull of my religious commitment."}
