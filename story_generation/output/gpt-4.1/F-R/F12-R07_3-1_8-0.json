He wanted us to be honest, to lay everything out, to talk openly about our fears and plans. I knew this was what a good wife should do\u2014be present, communicate, share burdens. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The evening chant at the temple would begin soon, and as a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to join the community, to show up in body and spirit, to help maintain the harmony of our sangha. I could already imagine the gentle rhythm of voices, the peace I always found there, and the subtle disappointment if I didn\u2019t appear. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for my response, while my mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the duty of honesty at home, and the call of spiritual community. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt suspended, unable to move toward either without letting someone down."}
