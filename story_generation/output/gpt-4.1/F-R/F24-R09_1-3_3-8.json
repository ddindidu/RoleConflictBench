My stepdad nodded, looking at me expectantly. I knew how much it meant to them that I joined in, that I made an effort to be part of this new family. I wanted to say yes, to be included, to not be the odd one out.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue group chat: \u201cWe need one more for the minyan at the funeral service Saturday morning. Can anyone help?\u201d I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. I knew how important it was to be there, to help someone say Kaddish for a loved one. It was a mitzvah, a responsibility I took seriously.\n\nI looked up at my family, their faces full of hope, and then back at my phone.
