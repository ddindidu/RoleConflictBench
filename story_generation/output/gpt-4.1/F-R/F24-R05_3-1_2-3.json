He needed me\u2014he didn\u2019t have to say it outright. I could hear it in the way he tried to hold himself together, the way he paused, waiting for me to fill the silence with comfort. I wanted to be there for him, to sit with him in his pain, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In twenty minutes, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the adult education class I\u2019d spent all week preparing. People would be waiting, expecting guidance, insight, and a sense of community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my step-brother\u2019s need for support, and my congregation\u2019s expectation that I would show up, ready to teach. My mind raced, torn between the call of family and the call of duty, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
