It\u2019s our tradition to gather, share stories, and reconnect over a big meal. As the grandparent, I\u2019m expected to keep the family close, to be present and available, especially now, when everyone is scattered and busy. But as we drove through the unfamiliar town, my stomach rumbled. I knew from my careful research that only one small vendor nearby was kosher-certified, and it would close soon. My family, eager to keep moving, suggested we grab something quick at a popular caf\u00e9 instead. I felt the weight of their expectation to join in, to be flexible and easygoing, but my Jewish identity tugged at me, reminding me of the importance of keeping kosher, especially as an example to my grandchildren. My heart pounded as I looked from their hopeful faces to the passing streets, torn between the warmth of family togetherness and the quiet, persistent call of my faith."}
