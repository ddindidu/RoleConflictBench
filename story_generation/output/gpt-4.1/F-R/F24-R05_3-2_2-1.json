His voice had trembled as he told me about the news\u2014his job was gone, and with it, his sense of stability. He needed me, not just as a rabbi, but as his step-sibling, someone who could sit with him in his pain, listen, and offer comfort. But as I looked at the clock, my heart pounded with another kind of urgency. Shabbat was only hours away, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my sermon. The congregation expected guidance, inspiration, and a sense of peace from me. I could already imagine the sanctuary filling, the expectant faces, the weight of their hopes for wisdom. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my brother\u2019s raw need for support and the community\u2019s need for spiritual leadership. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pressing in, each one urgent, each one deserving. My hands shook as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my whole self to both."}
