She asks about my day, her eyes searching for more than the usual, and I know she wants me to open up, to share the stress I\u2019ve been carrying. I want to tell her everything, to be the husband who communicates, who doesn\u2019t keep his worries locked away. But as I start to speak, I catch sight of the calendar on the wall\u2014Passover is only days away. The kids are in the living room, their laughter echoing, and I remember I still haven\u2019t taught them the blessings for the Seder. My father\u2019s voice rings in my head, reminding me of my responsibility to pass on our traditions. I feel torn, pulled between being the open, attentive husband my wife needs and the devoted Jewish father my children deserve. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I find myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
