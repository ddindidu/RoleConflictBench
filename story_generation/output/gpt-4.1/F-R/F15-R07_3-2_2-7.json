She wrote that he had been caught bullying a classmate, and they wanted me to come in and discuss it. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to show up at the school, listen, and help him understand the seriousness of his actions. I imagined his anxious face, waiting for me to arrive, needing my guidance and support.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a time I cherished for quiet reflection and spiritual growth. We were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been looking forward to, one that promised insight into compassion and non-judgment. My friends would expect me there, and I felt a responsibility to my own practice and to the group.\n\nThe two roles pulled at me from opposite directions. My mind raced with questions: Was it selfish to want my own peace when my child needed me? Was I failing my spiritual path if I let anger or disappointment cloud my response? I sat in silence, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
