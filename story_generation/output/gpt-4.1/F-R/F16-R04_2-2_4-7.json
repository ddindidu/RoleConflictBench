My wife\u2019s voice lingered in my mind, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. The laundry basket was overflowing, and I\u2019d promised to help tonight. As I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. His message was urgent: \u201cImam, can you meet tonight? I really need to talk. My family situation is getting worse.\u201d I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, especially in times like this. But I could also picture my wife\u2019s tired eyes, the kids\u2019 hopeful faces, and the pile of chores waiting for me. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my presence and help, and toward my community, who looked to me for support. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need should come first."}
