Lately, I\u2019d noticed the tension between them\u2014short answers, tired eyes, a heaviness in the air. As their child, I felt it was my duty to check in, to ask if everything was okay, to offer comfort even if I didn\u2019t know how. Tonight, though, my mind was elsewhere. Earlier at school, I saw my friend Ravi being blamed for something he didn\u2019t do. The teacher\u2019s words were harsh, and Ravi\u2019s eyes pleaded for help. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to follow dharma and not turn away from injustice. But if I spoke up, I worried it might upset my parents, who always told me to avoid trouble and keep peace at home. I wanted to ask them about their day, to be the supportive child they needed, but my heart ached for Ravi. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat in silence, torn between comforting my parents and following the moral path I believed in."}
