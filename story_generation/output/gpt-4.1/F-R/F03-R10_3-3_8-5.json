My mother\u2019s eyes glistened as she finally confided in me about the burden she\u2019d been carrying\u2014my father\u2019s involvement in something she called \u201ca mistake at work.\u201d As she spoke, I realized she meant a bribe he\u2019d accepted, a clear act of corruption. My father looked at me, desperate for understanding, for comfort, for the support a son should give. My heart ached for them; I wanted to reassure them, to be the pillar they needed. But as a Hindu, I was taught to stand against adharma, to uphold truth and righteousness above all. The teachings of my faith echoed in my mind, urging me to act, to not let wrongdoing go unchallenged. My parents\u2019 pleading eyes met the weight of my conscience, and I felt torn in two\u2014between the son they needed and the person my beliefs demanded I become."}
