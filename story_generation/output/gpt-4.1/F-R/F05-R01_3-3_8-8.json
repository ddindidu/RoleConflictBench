She wanted to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about the future we both worried over in the quiet hours of the night. She needed me to be open, to share everything, to let her in. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the workshop I was leading in just an hour. As a pastor, I was expected to guide others, to teach them the intricacies of faith, to be a pillar of wisdom and composure. The community leaders were counting on me to help them understand doctrines that even I sometimes wrestled with. My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she asked if I was really listening. I felt the weight of her trust, the need to be fully present, but my mind kept drifting to the lesson plan, the questions I knew would come, the responsibility to my congregation. I wanted to be everything for both, but the demands pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled apart, uncertain which part of me should speak first."}
