As her husband, I knew I should sit beside her, ask about her day, and listen to whatever was weighing on her heart. We\u2019d promised to share our burdens, to be each other\u2019s confidant. But just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the evening prayer. My role as imam was not just a duty; it was a trust, and tonight, the community was counting on me. I looked at my wife, her lips pressed tight, and then at the clock. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and toward the people who relied on my guidance. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the call of home and the call of faith, unsure which path to take."}
