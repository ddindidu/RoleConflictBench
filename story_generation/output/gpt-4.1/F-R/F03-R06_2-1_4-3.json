My father calls me to help set the table, reminding me how important it is to honor our customs, especially now that my grandparents are visiting. I know how much it means to them that I\u2019m present, sharing stories and laughter, keeping our family close. But as I glance at the clock, I remember the church service starting soon. My pastor has encouraged me to be more involved, and I\u2019ve promised myself to attend regularly, to grow in faith and connect with the community. The thought of missing worship weighs on me, but so does the idea of disappointing my family. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet pull of my faith. I can feel both sides tugging at me, each demanding loyalty, each representing a part of who I am."}
