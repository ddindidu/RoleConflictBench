I had been looking forward to this moment all week\u2014a quiet evening to recite and reflect on the Quran, to reconnect with my faith in peace. Just as I settled into my favorite chair, the phone buzzed. It was my granddaughter, her name lighting up the screen. She had started her new job this week, and I knew the family expected me, as the grandfather, to check in, to share in her excitement, to offer encouragement. I could almost hear my wife\u2019s voice reminding me, \u201cShe needs to know you care.\u201d Yet, my heart yearned for the spiritual nourishment I had promised myself. The Quran lay open on my lap, its verses inviting me to immerse myself, to fulfill my duty as a Muslim. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my soul\u2019s need for reflection. The phone continued to ring, and I sat there, torn, the expectations of grandfather and Muslim pulling me in opposite directions."}
