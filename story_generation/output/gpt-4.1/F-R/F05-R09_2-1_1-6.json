She\u2019d just told me about the promotion offer at work\u2014one that came with more responsibility, but also more stress. She needed me, not just to listen, but to help her untangle her worries, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I wanted nothing more than to stay by her side, to talk it through until she felt lighter.\n\nBut tonight was also the regular Thursday service at synagogue. I\u2019d promised myself, and my community, to attend as often as possible. It was a commitment I took seriously, a thread connecting me to my faith and to generations before me. Even if my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed, I felt the weight of that promise.\n\nI could see the hope in my wife\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for me to stay. At the same time, I felt the pull of my Jewish identity, the quiet insistence that I honor my word. My heart ached as I sat between these two worlds, torn by the demands of love and tradition, unsure which path to take."}
