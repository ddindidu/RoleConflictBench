I knew something weighed on her, and as her spouse, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask her about her worries and share my own burdens from the day. We had always promised to communicate openly, to be each other\u2019s confidant. But as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Maghrib prayer at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to lead, even though tonight the congregation would be small and another qualified brother was present. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my community, and the duty to my wife, who needed me now. I could see the hope in her eyes, waiting for me to ask, to listen. At the same time, I felt the weight of my responsibility as imam, the trust placed in me by the congregation. My mind raced, torn between the call to prayer and the silent plea across the table, unsure which role to answer first."}
