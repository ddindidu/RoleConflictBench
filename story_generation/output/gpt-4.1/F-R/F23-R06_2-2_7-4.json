The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014rent, groceries, her school trip, all pressing in on me. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of making sure our home was secure, that she never felt the uncertainty I\u2019d known as a child. But tomorrow was Sunday, and as a Christian, I was expected to be at church, to worship, to serve, to show my commitment to God and the community. My boss had offered me a rare Sunday shift\u2014double pay, enough to cover groceries for the week and maybe even a little extra for her field trip. I knew what my family needed, but I also knew what my faith asked of me. My heart ached as I stared at the calendar, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my family and the promise I\u2019d made to God, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
