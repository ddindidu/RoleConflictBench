I really need to talk.\u201d Her words are heavy, and I know she wouldn\u2019t ask unless she truly needed me. As her brother, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, to support her through anything. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t read yet. I\u2019ve missed the last session, and my teacher gently reminded me how important it is to be present, to deepen my understanding and commitment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my sister\u2019s voice trembling on the phone, the quiet expectation of my sangha waiting for me to join in reflection. My heart aches with the pull in two directions: the urge to comfort my sister, and the longing to honor my spiritual path. I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, torn between the call of family and the call of the Dharma, uncertain which path to follow tonight."}
