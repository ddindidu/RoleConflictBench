It\u2019s our tradition, a thread that keeps us close even though I live far from home. They always ask about my work, my health, and gently remind me of my responsibilities\u2014not just as their child, but as a Muslim. Lately, my mother\u2019s voice has grown wistful when she mentions Hajj. \u201cYou\u2019re working now, alhamdulillah. Maybe next year, you can start planning for your pilgrimage,\u201d she says, hope lacing her words.\n\nI want to reassure her, to promise I\u2019ll go soon. But the truth is, I\u2019m barely making ends meet. Rent, bills, and student loans eat up my paycheck. I know performing Hajj is a pillar of my faith, something every Muslim must do if able. Yet, I also know how much my parents long to see me fulfill this duty, and how much they rely on our calls for comfort. Each week, I feel the weight of their expectations and my own limitations pressing in, torn between wanting to be a good child and a faithful Muslim. As I listen to my mother\u2019s gentle encouragement, I wonder how I can meet both demands when they seem so far apart."}
