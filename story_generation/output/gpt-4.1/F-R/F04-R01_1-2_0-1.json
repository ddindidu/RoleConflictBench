She wanted me to come over and celebrate with the family, to toast her hard work and share in her joy. I could hear her excitement even through the text, and as her brother, I knew how much this moment meant to her. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to lift a glass and tell her how proud I was.\n\nBut as I was grabbing my keys, my phone rang again. It was Sarah, a member of my congregation, her voice trembling. She was facing a life-altering decision and needed guidance\u2014tonight. She asked if I could meet her at the church, saying she didn\u2019t know who else to turn to. As her pastor, I felt the weight of her trust and the responsibility to offer her the support she needed.\n\nStanding in my hallway, keys in hand, I felt torn. My family expected my presence, my sister needed my support. But Sarah was reaching out in a moment of crisis, looking to me for spiritual guidance. The expectations of brother and pastor pressed in from both sides, and I stood there, heart pounding, unsure which door to walk through."}
