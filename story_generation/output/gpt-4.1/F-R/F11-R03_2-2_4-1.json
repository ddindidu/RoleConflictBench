Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much it meant for all of us to be together, especially after how busy I\u2019d been lately. Family dinners were sacred, a time to reconnect, to laugh, to be present. But as I set my phone down, the convent\u2019s bell rang, and Sister Maria hurried past my door. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering supplies for the Johnsons,\u201d she called. The Johnsons\u2014our neighbors\u2014had lost everything in a fire last night. The community was rallying to help, and as a nun, I was expected to lead by example, to serve those in need without hesitation.\n\nMy heart twisted. I could picture my family around the table, an empty chair where I should be. But I could also see the Johnsons, frightened and cold, waiting for kindness. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which door to walk through."}
