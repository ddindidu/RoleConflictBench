The words \u201cbullying incident\u201d glared up at me, and my heart clenched with worry and shame. As a mother, I knew I had to attend the meeting at school tomorrow, to face the teachers and the other child\u2019s parents, to stand by my son and help him understand the gravity of his actions. I could already hear the disappointment in their voices, feel the weight of their expectations for me to guide and correct him.\n\nBut tomorrow was also the day my Buddhist teacher had asked me to present a summary of the Four Noble Truths at the temple. I had promised to reflect deeply, to share insights that might help others on their path. The temple was a place of peace and learning for me, a refuge from the chaos of daily life. I felt torn\u2014my duty as a mother demanded my presence and action, while my commitment as a Buddhist called for contemplation and sharing. The two roles pulled at me, each urgent, each important, and I sat there, caught in the silent storm of my own heart, unsure which path to take."}
