You have to come.\u201d I could see how much it meant to her\u2014she always wanted us to do things together, to feel like a real team. As her brother, I knew how important it was to show up, to be included, to build that trust and respect between us.\n\nBut my mind immediately jumped to the food. Jake\u2019s place never had kosher options, and the last time I went, I ended up nibbling on a plain salad while everyone else devoured cheesy slices and pepperoni rolls. At home, our pantry was full of kosher snacks, and Mom always made sure I had something to eat. But out there, I\u2019d have to either break the rules or sit awkwardly, feeling left out.\n\nLeah was waiting for my answer, her hopefulness almost painful. I wanted to be the brother she could count on, but I also wanted to honor my Jewish values.
