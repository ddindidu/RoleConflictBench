He didn\u2019t say anything, just trudged past me toward his room. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his sibling, I felt that pull to go after him, to sit with him and let him talk or just be there so he wouldn\u2019t feel alone. That\u2019s what we do for each other, especially when things get rough.\n\nBut I glanced at the clock and realized church service was starting in twenty minutes. I\u2019d promised myself and my church community that I\u2019d be there every week, not just for worship but to help with the youth group. I knew how important it was to show up, to be part of something bigger, to honor my faith and commitments.\n\nStanding in the hallway, I felt torn. My brother needed me right now, but so did my church. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role I was supposed to choose."}
