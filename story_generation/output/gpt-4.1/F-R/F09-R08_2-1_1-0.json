She had been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with excitement as she practiced her lines for the class presentation. As her mother, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. But tonight was also the one evening this week with no work, no chores, no interruptions\u2014a rare, quiet space I had set aside for myself to recite and reflect on the Quran. I had been looking forward to this spiritual time, a chance to reconnect with my faith and find peace after a hectic week. The weight of both expectations pressed on me: my daughter\u2019s hopeful anticipation, and my own longing for spiritual fulfillment. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each important in its own way. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the evening stretching before me, uncertain which part of myself I would have to set aside."}
