The street is familiar, but today he seems quieter, glancing over his shoulder more than usual. I know I should ask him what\u2019s wrong, make sure he feels safe, but my mind is tangled with the sermon I need to finish for Shabbat. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014words that will carry them through the week. I promised myself I\u2019d have it ready by tonight, but every idea feels half-formed, slipping away as soon as I try to grasp it.\n\nMy brother stumbles, and I reach out instinctively, steadying him. He looks up at me, searching my face for reassurance. I want to be present for him, to listen, but the weight of my rabbinic duties presses in. I can almost hear the clock ticking down to Shabbat, the congregation waiting for my message. My brother\u2019s safety, his trust in me, pulls me one way; my responsibility to my community tugs me the other. I walk on, torn, the words of my sermon and my brother\u2019s silence echoing in my mind."}
