Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s younger and still learning the ropes of our new family. Today, though, my mind is elsewhere. The weekly meditation group meets in less than half an hour, and I\u2019ve been looking forward to the quiet, the gentle guidance, the chance to practice mindfulness after a stressful week. \n\nBut Sam lingers, stopping to tie his shoe, then to watch a stray cat dart under a car. I check my watch, feeling the minutes slip away. If I hurry him, I\u2019ll make it to the meditation on time, but I know he hates being rushed and sometimes gets anxious when I push him. If I stay patient and walk at his pace, I\u2019ll miss the group and the peace I crave. My chest tightens as I try to balance the responsibility of caring for Sam with my own need for stillness and self-care. The street ahead seems to stretch forever, and I can\u2019t decide which path to take."}
