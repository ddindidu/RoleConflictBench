My daughter had called twice this week, excited for the cousins to play together and for us to finally have a meal as a family. I promised my grandkids I\u2019d bring my famous apple pie and play board games with them. But as I was preparing the pie crust, my phone buzzed. It was a member of my congregation, her voice trembling as she explained her crisis\u2014her marriage was on the brink, and she needed guidance, now. She asked if I could meet her that very afternoon, the same time as the family gathering. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my family expecting my presence, laughter, and warmth; my calling as a pastor demanding compassion and wisdom in a moment that could change someone\u2019s life. My heart ached, torn between the joy of being a grandparent and the solemn duty of shepherding a soul in need. I stood in the kitchen, pie dough in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
