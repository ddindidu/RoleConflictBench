My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end\u2014something was wrong with my grandson, and she needed me right away. My heart clenched; family always came first. But as I reached for my coat, my other phone buzzed. It was a member of my congregation, desperate and in tears, asking if I could meet immediately. She was facing a crisis, her voice thick with fear, and she needed spiritual guidance before making a life-altering decision. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the sacred duty I held as a pastor. Both needed me now, both expected my full presence and care. My mind raced, guilt and worry twisting inside me, as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
