The clock ticked closer to the time I needed to leave, and I mentally rehearsed the prayers I would recite. Just then, my granddaughter appeared at my door, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cDadi, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d She sat beside me, clutching my hand, and poured out her worries about a friend in trouble, asking what she should do. I could see how much she needed me\u2014my words, my comfort, my time. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the family was waiting, the ceremony would begin soon, and I was expected to be there, dressed and ready, as a proud Hindu matriarch. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my granddaughter\u2019s pain and toward my family\u2019s expectations at the temple. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which path to follow."}
