Dad\u2019s eyes had dark circles, and my stepmom barely smiled at dinner. I knew they needed someone to talk to, someone to lean on, and I felt it was my place to be there for them, especially since I was the only one at home. But Sunday was coming up, and as a Christian, I was expected to be at church, not just for worship but to help with the youth group and join the community lunch afterward. Missing a service felt like letting down my faith and the people who counted on me there. I sat at the kitchen table, torn. If I stayed home, I could listen to my parents, maybe ease their burden a little. But if I left for church, I\u2019d be fulfilling my commitment to God and my church family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of me I was supposed to honor more."}
