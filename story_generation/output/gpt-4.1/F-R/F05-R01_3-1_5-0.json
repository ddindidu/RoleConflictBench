My wife was bustling around the kitchen, her voice tight as she reminded me, \u201cWe need to vacuum the living room and set the table before your cousins arrive.\u201d I nodded, guilt pricking at me for not having done more already. The house needed to be spotless\u2014her family expected nothing less, and I wanted to be the supportive husband she deserved.\n\nJust as I reached for the vacuum, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment? I really need to talk.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her words. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I knew how much she relied on my support.
