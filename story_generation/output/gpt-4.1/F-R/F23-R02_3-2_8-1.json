The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a shadow over every purchase and plan. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014my partner and stepchild depended on me to keep our home secure, to make sure we never missed a payment. I\u2019d been picking up extra shifts, cutting corners, and still, the deadline crept closer.\n\nBut as a priest, my phone buzzed with reminders: the main weekly service was tonight, the one that brought the whole community together. They expected me to lead, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present in spirit and body. I knew how much they relied on these moments, how my absence would be noticed and felt.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between preparing for the service and meeting with a potential client for extra work. The demands pulled me in opposite directions\u2014my family\u2019s security on one side, my congregation\u2019s faith on the other. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I had to choose, but not yet knowing how."}
