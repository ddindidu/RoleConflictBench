She just broke up with her boyfriend and begged me to come over. As her brother, I know I should be there for her, to comfort her and listen, just like she\u2019s always done for me. But today is also Ekadashi, a sacred day in my faith, and I have a strict schedule of prayers, fasting, and rituals that I cannot skip. My family expects me to uphold these traditions without fail, especially on auspicious days like this. I can hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that discipline in worship is the foundation of our spiritual life. Yet, my sister\u2019s voice trembles with pain, and I feel her need for me pulling at my heart. I stand in the hallway, torn between the prayer room and the front door, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
