Our family gathering was something I\u2019d promised not to miss\u2014an afternoon of laughter, stories, and the warmth only family can bring. I could already picture my youngest grandchild tugging at my sleeve, eager to show me her latest drawing. But as I set out the plates, my phone rang. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. Her father, a beloved member of our congregation, had just passed away. The family needed me to officiate the funeral, and the only time that worked for everyone was this afternoon. I heard the pain in her voice, the expectation that I would be there to guide them through their grief, as I always had. My heart twisted. My family needed me, but so did my community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving it. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
