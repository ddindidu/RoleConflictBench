My granddaughter, Amina, had just left my room, her eyes red from tears she tried to hide. She\u2019d confided in me, her voice trembling, about feeling lost at school and unsure of herself. My heart ached to stay with her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed from her grandmother. Yet, as the imam, I was expected to lead the evening prayer, even though tonight the congregation was small and Brother Yusuf was more than capable of stepping in. I could hear the shuffle of feet in the mosque, the quiet anticipation of the faithful. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the duty I owed my community and the love I owed my granddaughter. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the prayer mat and the soft, tear-stained pillow where Amina had just sat."}
