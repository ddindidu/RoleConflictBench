Riya\u2019s dance performance is at seven. She\u2019s been practicing for weeks\u2014she wants her Dadi in the front row.\u201d My heart swelled with pride. I pictured Riya\u2019s hopeful eyes, the family gathered, laughter and stories over dinner. But as I hung up, my gaze fell on my small altar, the brass lamp, the incense, the carefully arranged flowers. My daily puja is not just a habit\u2014it\u2019s a promise I made to myself and to God, a thread that ties me to my faith. The evening aarti, the chanting, the offerings\u2014they must be done at the right time, in the right way. If I leave for Riya\u2019s performance, I\u2019ll miss the evening rituals. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss her big moment. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest. I want to be the grandmother who never disappoints, but I am also the devotee who never falters. I sit in silence, torn, the clock ticking toward evening, my heart pulled in two directions."}
