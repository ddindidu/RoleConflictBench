I want to sit beside him, listen, offer comfort, maybe make his favorite tea. But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder about the bar mitzvah I\u2019m officiating tonight. Months of preparation, a family counting on me, a young boy waiting for this moment. I glance at the clock. I have just enough time to change and leave. My husband looks at me, hopeful, needing a few minutes of my attention. The congregation expects me to be present, composed, a guide for their celebration. My husband expects me to be his partner, his support. I stand in the hallway, coat in hand, heart pulled in two directions, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me."}
