My daughter\u2019s shoes had holes, and the fridge was nearly empty. As a parent, I felt the weight of providing for my family, knowing every dollar mattered. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for tonight\u2019s planning meeting at the church. As the priest, I was expected to organize and lead the new adult faith formation series, a responsibility I cherished and took seriously. The parish counted on me to guide them, to be present and prepared. But the meeting was scheduled during the only hours I could pick up an extra shift at the store, the one chance this week to earn enough for groceries. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between my family\u2019s immediate needs and my calling to serve the community. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled apart, uncertain which duty should come first."}
