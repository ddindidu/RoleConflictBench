He\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she meant\u2014he needed someone to talk to, someone to ask if he was really okay. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be there for them, especially after everything we\u2019d been through to become a family. But just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again. It was from the synagogue group chat: \u201cWe need one more for minyan at the funeral tonight. Can anyone come?\u201d I knew how important it was to be there, to help the community say Kaddish for the deceased. My heart twisted. If I went to the synagogue, I\u2019d miss the only time my dad might open up. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my community at a moment of need. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both families\u2014one by blood, one by faith\u2014pressing down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
