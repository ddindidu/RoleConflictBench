The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a step-parent, I know my family relies on me to keep us afloat, to make sure the roof over our heads stays ours. I should be working overtime tonight, or at least poring over our finances, searching for ways to save. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t even glanced at. My teacher expects us to come prepared, to engage deeply, to reflect and grow. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches to be present with my sangha, to nurture my spiritual path, but my mind races with anxiety about the mortgage. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my full attention, and I sit frozen, unable to choose, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me with every passing minute."}
