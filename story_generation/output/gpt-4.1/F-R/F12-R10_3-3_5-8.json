My husband\u2019s relatives would arrive by noon, and every corner of the house needed to shine. As a wife, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014meals to prepare, sheets to change, decorations to arrange. But today was also the day of the temple festival, one of the most sacred in our tradition. My parents had called, reminding me of my duty as a Hindu: to join them at the temple, participate in the rituals, and offer prayers with the family. The temple was two hours away, and the ceremonies would last all day. My heart pounded as I scrubbed the kitchen counter, torn between the pride of a perfect home and the spiritual fulfillment of the festival. My husband glanced at me, sensing my tension, but I couldn\u2019t voice the storm inside. Both roles demanded my full presence, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to imagine disappointing either side."}
