The convent was unusually still, sunlight slanting through the window onto my open book. I settled in, ready to lose myself in spiritual reflection, to find the peace I so often craved. Just as I began to read, my partner called from the next room, voice light but tinged with fatigue. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he said, almost as an afterthought. I could hear the unspoken need for comfort, the gentle expectation that I would listen, offer warmth, be present for him as a spouse should.\n\nBut my heart tugged in two directions. The sacred silence I\u2019d carved out for myself felt fragile, easily shattered by conversation. I wanted to be there for him, to offer the support he deserved, but I also longed for the spiritual nourishment I\u2019d promised myself. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each valid, each urgent in its own way. I sat there, book in hand, torn between the call to serve my partner and the call to serve my soul, unsure which voice to answer first."}
