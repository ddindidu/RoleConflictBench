She wanted me to be open, to share every worry and hope, to lay bare the truth so we could face it together. I knew she expected nothing less than full transparency, and I wanted to give her that. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my Buddhist friend, inviting me to join him for tea and discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. He valued my insight, and our conversations always left me feeling grounded and at peace. I felt the pull to step away, to reflect and engage in spiritual study, to nurture that part of myself. But here was my wife, needing me now, needing my presence and honesty. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which path to follow."}
