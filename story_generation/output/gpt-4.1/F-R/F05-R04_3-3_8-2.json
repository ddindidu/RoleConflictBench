My wife sits across from me at the kitchen table, her eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about our finances. She deserves honesty, my full attention, and the open communication we promised each other. I can see the worry in her face, the need for reassurance, for partnership. But my phone vibrates insistently\u2014messages from the mosque committee. The mosque is full tonight, a special remembrance drawing a crowd, and I am the only imam present. They need me to lead the prayer, to guide the congregation, to be the calm center for so many souls. My heart aches as I look at my wife, torn between the sacred trust of my marriage and the sacred duty to my community. Both expect my presence, my leadership, my care. I feel the tension coil inside me, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be left waiting."}
