She was still learning the basics of daily manners, and I knew I should remind her to greet everyone properly and help set the table for breakfast. As her step-parent, I felt responsible for guiding her, teaching her respect and discipline, even in small things like saying \u201cgood morning\u201d or helping out at home.\n\nBut as I moved to speak, I caught my reflection in the hallway mirror. I was wearing loose, comfortable clothes, but my hair was uncovered, and my sleeves were short. At home, with just family, I sometimes relaxed my dress, but I remembered the teachings about modesty, even in private spaces. I wondered if I was setting the right example for her\u2014not just in manners, but in faith. Should I cover up more, even at home, to show her what it means to be a Muslim woman? Or was it enough to focus on kindness and respect?\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides, and I hesitated, unsure which lesson to teach first, or how to be both the parent she needed and the Muslim I wanted to be."}
