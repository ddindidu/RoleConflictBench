Tonight, as I dial, my mind is still tangled in what happened at work. Earlier, I saw a colleague cut in line at the cafeteria, skipping ahead of someone who was clearly waiting. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with honesty and fairness. I felt a tug to say something, to gently point out the mistake, but I hesitated, unsure if it was my place.\n\nNow, as my mother\u2019s voice fills the line, she asks about my week. I want to tell her everything, to be the open, communicative daughter she expects. But I worry she\u2019ll be disappointed if I admit I stayed silent, that I didn\u2019t live up to the values she and my faith have instilled in me. My heart pounds as I weigh what to say, torn between being the dutiful daughter who shares everything and the Hindu who should have acted. The silence stretches, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
