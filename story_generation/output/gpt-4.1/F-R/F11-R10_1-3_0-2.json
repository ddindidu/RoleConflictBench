Our family had always celebrated each other\u2019s milestones, and as his sister, I knew he expected me to be there for him, to cheer him on and make him feel special. But today was also an important day in my religious calendar. As a practicing Hindu, I had committed to a strict schedule of prayers, chanting, and offerings that would take up most of the day. My family knows how seriously I take my rituals, and I know my spiritual community expects nothing less than full devotion, especially on auspicious days like this. I could hear my brother\u2019s hopefulness through the phone, waiting for me to say I\u2019d come over. At the same time, I felt the weight of my faith, the sense of duty to honor my commitments to the divine. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my brother\u2019s joy and toward my spiritual discipline. I stood in the hallway, phone pressed to my ear, torn between the two worlds that meant everything to me."}
