He always looked for me, his face lighting up when he spotted me in the crowd. I knew how much it meant to him, especially with graduation so close. As I gathered my things, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a friend from church. His wife had just been rushed to the hospital, and he was alone, scared, and asking if I could come sit with him. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I believed in being there for others, showing love and support in times of need. Mark had no one else nearby. But my son was waiting, counting on me. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the father my son needed and the friend my faith called me to be. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt the ache of wanting to be in two places at once, knowing I could only choose one."}
