The store owner\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him and make sure he understood the seriousness of stealing. But as a pastor, I was also expected to show compassion, to guide with forgiveness and use this as a lesson in grace. Just yesterday, at the community gathering, I\u2019d told the story of the prodigal son, emphasizing God\u2019s endless mercy. Now, those words echoed in my mind, clashing with the stern voice inside me that wanted to scold and punish. My son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears, and I felt the weight of everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014my congregation\u2019s, the store owner\u2019s, my own. I wrestled with the urge to be both the firm mother and the gentle pastor, torn between justice and mercy, not yet sure which path to take."}
