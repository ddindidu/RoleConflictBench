My family laughed and shared stories, the same ones we told every year, and I felt the familiar warmth of belonging. As the youngest, I was expected to help set the table and join in the old songs, honoring the traditions that shaped us. But as a pastor, I also felt the weight of another expectation\u2014guiding others in faith, even here among my own kin. When the conversation turned to the meaning of the holiday, I casually mentioned a parable from scripture, hoping to offer a deeper perspective. My uncle\u2019s smile faded, and my mother\u2019s eyes flickered with concern. I could sense the tension: my family wanted to celebrate in their way, without sermons or lessons. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to honor my family\u2019s customs while also feeling compelled to share the teachings I believed in. The laughter around me grew quieter, and I felt caught between the child my family expected and the pastor I had become, unsure which voice should speak next."}
