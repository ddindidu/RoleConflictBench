It was a rare chance for all of us to be together, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially to my parents, who always said family was everything. They expected me to be there, to laugh, to share stories, to make memories. But as I scrolled through the photos of our destination, my heart twisted. I\u2019d been saving every spare penny for Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of since I was a child. As a Muslim, it was my duty, a pillar of my faith, and I felt the weight of that responsibility every day. The trip would eat into my savings, setting me back years. I could almost hear my siblings\u2019 disappointment if I said no, but I could also feel the ache of delaying my spiritual journey. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding loyalty, and I sat frozen, torn between the love of my family and the call of my faith, unsure which voice to answer."}
