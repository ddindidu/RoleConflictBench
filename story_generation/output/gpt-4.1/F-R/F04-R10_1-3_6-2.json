She\u2019d even asked me, \u201cPromise you\u2019ll come this time?\u201d I could see how much it meant to her, and as her brother, I wanted to be there, to laugh with her and make her feel included. But the picnic was scheduled right in the middle of my daily puja time\u2014a time I dedicate to prayers, chanting, and offerings, following the schedule my family has kept for generations. My parents expect me to uphold these rituals without fail, and I feel a deep responsibility to honor our traditions. As the day approached, I felt torn. My sister\u2019s hopeful eyes haunted me, but so did the thought of breaking my spiritual routine. I kept replaying both expectations in my mind: being the supportive brother she needed, and the devoted Hindu I was raised to be. The pressure built inside me, and I found myself caught between two worlds, unable to see how I could possibly meet both demands."}
