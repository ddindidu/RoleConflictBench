She\u2019d been saving her allowance, but the rest was up to me. I knew how much it meant to her, and as a parent, I wanted to keep my word, to see her joy when she finally unwrapped it. But the cost weighed on me\u2014money was tight, and every purchase had to be carefully considered.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple in the community, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They wanted to secure the date, and I knew how important it was for them to have their rabbi present. As a rabbi, I felt the responsibility to be there for my congregants, to guide them through these sacred moments. But weddings often meant weekends away, and sometimes, the honorarium helped cover family expenses.\n\nI felt the tension rising inside me\u2014my daughter\u2019s expectant face, the couple\u2019s request, the unspoken pressure to provide both spiritually and financially. I stared at the screen, torn between my roles, unsure which path to take."}
