It\u2019s our ritual, a thread that keeps me tethered to the world I left behind. Lately, though, the Mother Superior has entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the retreat. The responsibility is immense; I must spend hours in prayer, study, and preparation, seeking wisdom to guide the sisters. My phone buzzes with messages from my mother, eager for our usual exchange. I glance at the unread texts, guilt prickling at my conscience. My heart aches, torn between the comfort my parents find in our conversations and the sacred duty I owe to my community. Each expectation feels urgent, each demand heavy. I pace my small room, rosary in hand, wondering how to honor both the family that raised me and the calling that now defines me."}
