Her eyes were red, and she looked so small sitting on the edge of the sofa. She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt at work and how lonely she\u2019d been lately. I could see she needed me\u2014her child\u2014to listen, to comfort her, to be present in a way I hadn\u2019t been before. But as she spoke, I kept glancing at the clock, knowing that if I didn\u2019t begin my prayers soon, I would miss the auspicious time for my daily ritual. My mind raced with guilt. As a Hindu, I was taught that these rituals were not just tradition, but a sacred duty, a way to honor the divine and keep our home blessed. Yet, as her child, I felt the weight of her pain and the unspoken expectation that I would be there for her. My heart pulled in two directions, I sat frozen, torn between the lamp waiting to be lit and my mother\u2019s need for me."}
