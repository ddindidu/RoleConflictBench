My partner sits on the couch, eyes red and distant, clutching a mug of untouched tea. I know they need me\u2014my words, my arms, my presence. They\u2019ve been unraveling for days, and I promised I\u2019d be here, that I\u2019d listen, that I\u2019d help hold them together. But as I watch them, my mind drifts to the Quran on my bedside table. I haven\u2019t recited or reflected in days, and tonight, with no work or errands, I finally have the time. My heart aches for that peace, the grounding I find in those verses, the connection to my faith that I\u2019ve been missing. Yet, I see the silent plea in my partner\u2019s eyes, the expectation that I\u2019ll stay close, talk, reassure. I feel torn, pulled between the comfort I long for in my faith and the comfort I\u2019m expected to give. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I sit frozen, unsure which need to answer first."}
