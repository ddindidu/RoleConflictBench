The whole family was gathering Friday evening to celebrate his achievement, and she wanted me there, not just as a grandmother, but as the heart of the family. I could hear the excitement in her voice, the expectation that I would be present, sharing in the joy and pride.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes drifted to the stack of notes and books on my desk. Shabbat was approaching, and as the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a thoughtful, inspiring sermon to my congregation. They relied on me for guidance, for words that would carry them through the week. I had barely begun to prepare, and the weight of that responsibility pressed on me.\n\nMy heart ached with the pull in both directions. My family needed me, my congregation needed me. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations felt impossibly heavy. I sat in silence, torn, unsure which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
