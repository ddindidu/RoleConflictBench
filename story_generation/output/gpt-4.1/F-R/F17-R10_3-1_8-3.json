Earlier, I\u2019d seen a coworker cut in line at the cafeteria, and it bothered me. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, even in small things. But I hesitated, unsure if I should say something or let it go. The guilt lingered, making me question if I was living up to my values.\n\nJust then, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how she needed someone to listen. I could see she was looking to me for comfort, for the kind of support a good child should give. But my mind kept drifting back to the cafeteria, to my own inaction. I wanted to be there for her, to give her my full attention, but I was distracted by my own moral struggle. I felt torn\u2014between being the supportive child my parents needed and being true to the ethical principles I\u2019d been raised with. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which to face first."}
