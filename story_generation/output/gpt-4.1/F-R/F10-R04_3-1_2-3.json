My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s important.\u201d As a daughter, I\u2019ve always made it a point to communicate with my parents every day, sharing details about my life and responding quickly. They rely on these conversations, especially since my father\u2019s health has been fragile lately. But as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah today\u2014a responsibility I take seriously. The congregation looks to me for guidance, and I know how much preparation goes into each sermon. Still, the guest speaker I\u2019d invited was ready and willing to step in if needed. I stared at my phone, torn. My mother\u2019s message sounded urgent, but stepping aside from the pulpit at the last minute would disappoint the community and perhaps undermine my role. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of being a devoted daughter against my duty as an imam, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
