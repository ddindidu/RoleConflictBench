As his wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was weighing on his mind, and share my own worries from the day. We\u2019d always promised to communicate openly, to be each other\u2019s safe place. But my phone buzzed with a message from a member of my congregation\u2014someone who\u2019d been struggling lately, someone who looked to me for spiritual guidance and comfort. I could hear the expectation in their words, the hope that I would offer them solace, just as I had so many times before. My heart pulled in two directions: toward my husband, who needed my presence and honesty, and toward my calling as a pastor, where I was needed to provide support and wisdom. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the demands of love and duty colliding, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
