My husband\u2019s shirt, stained from yesterday\u2019s work, lay on top of the pile. He\u2019d asked me to make sure it was clean for his meeting tomorrow. I knew how much he depended on me to keep things running smoothly at home, and I wanted to be the supportive wife he expected. But my phone buzzed with a message from a friend at church\u2014she needed help. She\u2019d made a mistake, a serious one, and was desperate for someone to talk to, someone who wouldn\u2019t judge her but would remind her of God\u2019s forgiveness. I felt the weight of my Christian values pressing on me, urging me to be there for her, to show compassion and grace. Yet, the laundry couldn\u2019t wait, and my husband\u2019s disappointment if I failed him lingered in my mind. My heart pounded as I stared at the overflowing basket, torn between the demands of my home and the call to live out my faith."}
