My spouse called from the living room, \u201cCan you help me move the chairs? My cousins will be here in an hour.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours until Shabbat. My mind raced with unfinished sermon notes, the Torah portion swirling in my head, half-formed ideas begging for my attention. The expectation to make our home spotless pressed on me, but so did the weight of my congregation\u2019s anticipation for a meaningful message. I could hear my spouse\u2019s footsteps, the tension in their voice as they asked again for help. I wanted to be present, to share the load, to show I cared about our home and our family. But the sacred responsibility of guiding my community tugged at me, demanding focus and solitude. My heart pounded as I stood between the broom and my books, feeling the pull of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they deserved."}
