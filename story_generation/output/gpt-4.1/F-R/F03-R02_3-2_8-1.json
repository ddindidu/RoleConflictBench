Her eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance, for the steady comfort I\u2019d always tried to give. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to listen, to hold her hand and promise her that everything would be alright. But as the clock ticked closer to six, my phone buzzed with reminders from the parish. Tonight was the main weekly service, the one that drew the whole community together, the one I was expected to lead with unwavering presence and faith. My congregation needed me, too\u2014they looked to me for guidance, for hope, for the rituals that shaped their week. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mother\u2019s tearful gaze on one side, the silent pull of my priestly duty on the other. My heart ached, torn between the son my parents needed and the priest my community expected. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wondered how I could possibly choose."}
