As his wife, I felt the familiar tug of concern. We always promised to share our burdens, to talk openly about our worries. I wanted to sit beside him, to ask what was weighing on his mind, to listen and reassure him. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. It was nearly time for the Friday prayer, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah. The congregation counted on me for guidance and inspiration. Yet today, a guest speaker was ready and willing to step in if I needed. I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to fulfill my duty to my community and the need to be present for my husband. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt the weight of both roles, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
