We want everyone to come over tonight to celebrate.\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014moments like these are what I cherish most as a grandparent, being present for my family\u2019s milestones, sharing in their joy, and making memories together.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes fell on the calendar. Tonight was the weekly religious school class, the one I lead for the children in our community. As their rabbi, I am expected to teach Torah, to guide them in Jewish law, and to be a steady presence in their spiritual lives. The parents count on me, and the children look forward to our lessons.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me, wanted me, and I longed to be with them. Yet my congregation also needed me, and I had made a commitment to them. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
