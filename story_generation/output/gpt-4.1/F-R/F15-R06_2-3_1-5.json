The school had sent a note home, asking parents to join their children in class, to see their progress and encourage them. My daughter\u2019s eyes had sparkled as she handed me the invitation, her voice hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d I knew how much it meant to her.\n\nBut the open class was scheduled at the same time as our church\u2019s weekly service. As a committed member, I was expected not only to attend but also to help with the children\u2019s ministry that day. The pastor had reminded us last week how important consistency was, especially for those serving. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my daughter\u2019s need for my presence, my church\u2019s need for my commitment. My heart ached as I tried to imagine disappointing either one. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the invitation and church bulletin side by side, unable to decide which part of me should take priority."}
