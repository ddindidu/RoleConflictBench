My wife\u2019s voice from the kitchen was gentle but firm, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for school tomorrow. I nodded, feeling the weight of my promise to help more at home. Just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the evening prayer. My heart pounded. I could picture the faces at the mosque, waiting for guidance, just as I could see my family\u2019s quiet hope for my presence and support. Both needed me, both counted on me. I stood frozen, torn between the sacred call of my community and the quiet, everyday needs of my family, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
