My mind raced, anxious about being unprepared and letting down my community. Just then, I saw my stepbrother, Adam, darting toward the busy street, headphones in, oblivious to the cars speeding by. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, especially since our parents trusted me to watch over him after school. But if I ran after him now, I\u2019d lose my place in the Quran, and I\u2019d be even less ready for the discussion tonight. I felt torn\u2014my responsibility to Adam pulling me one way, my commitment to my faith tugging the other. The seconds stretched, my hands trembling, as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment."}
