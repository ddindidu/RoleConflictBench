He asks about my day, his eyes warm and expectant. I know he values our open conversations, the way we share even the smallest details. I want to tell him about the little frustrations at work, the funny moment at lunch, the way I felt when my friend called. But as I open my mouth, my gaze falls on the Quran resting on the coffee table. It\u2019s been days since I last recited or truly reflected, and tonight, with no other plans, feels like the perfect opportunity. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the intimacy of sharing with my husband, and the spiritual peace I crave from connecting with Allah. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each important, each deserving. I hesitate, words caught in my throat, torn between the roles that shape who I am."}
