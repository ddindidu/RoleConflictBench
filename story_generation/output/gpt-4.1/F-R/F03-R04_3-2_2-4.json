Need to talk.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014forty minutes until the khutbah. As a son, I\u2019ve always made it a point to answer my parents quickly, sharing my day and listening to theirs. It\u2019s our ritual, and I know how much it means to them, especially since I moved out. But today, as the imam, I\u2019m the only one scheduled to deliver the sermon. The community has been anticipating my talk on unity all week; the posters are up, and people have sent in questions. My phone vibrates again\u2014my father this time, \u201cAre you there?\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents expect my attention, my voice, my presence.
