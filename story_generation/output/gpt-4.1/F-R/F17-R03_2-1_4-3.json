I stood in the hallway, habit pressed and rosary in hand, ready to join my sisters in the sacred silence of morning worship. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a rare intrusion. It was a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, today is the anniversary of Grandpa\u2019s passing. We expect you to join the family ritual at home, just like every year.\u201d My heart clenched. As a child, I was always the one to light the incense, to recite the prayers for our ancestors, to honor the traditions that bound us together. Now, as a nun, my life was shaped by a different rhythm, one that demanded my presence in the chapel at this very hour. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s longing for continuity, my community\u2019s call to devotion. I stood frozen, torn between the incense of my childhood and the incense of the altar, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
