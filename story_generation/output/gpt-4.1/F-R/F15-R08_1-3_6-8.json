My son\u2019s excited voice echoed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days until I could buy him the Nintendo I\u2019d promised. He\u2019d worked hard at school, and I wanted to reward him, to see his face light up with joy. But as I glanced at the envelope on the table, the one with \u201cHajj Savings\u201d written in careful script, my heart twisted. The doctor\u2019s words from last week rang in my ears: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to travel, do it soon. This may be your last chance.\u201d \n\nAs a Muslim, performing Hajj is a dream I\u2019ve carried for years, a duty I long to fulfill. But the cost is steep, and every ringgit I set aside for the pilgrimage is one less for my family\u2019s needs. My son\u2019s happiness, our financial stability, the promise I made\u2014these tug at me from one side. On the other, the call to Hajj, the fear that I may never get another chance. I stared at the savings, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
