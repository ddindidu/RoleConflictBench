They looked at me, expecting more than my distracted nods\u2014expecting me to really listen, to ask questions, to share my own thoughts. I wanted to be present, to communicate openly as we always promised each other. But my mind kept drifting to the church hall, where in less than an hour, a dozen children and their parents would be waiting for me to lead the weekly religious education class. I hadn\u2019t finished preparing the lesson, and I knew the parish expected me to be organized, to guide the children with energy and care. My spouse\u2019s voice faded into the background as I mentally rehearsed the opening prayer and lesson plan. Guilt gnawed at me; I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I looked at my spouse, torn between the need to be here and the duty pulling me away, unsure which expectation I would let down tonight."}
