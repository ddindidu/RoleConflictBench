She had just received news that her closest friend had passed away, and her voice trembled with grief. As her brother, I knew she needed me\u2014someone to hold her, to listen, to help her through the first waves of sorrow. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than two hours, I was expected at the mosque, where I was the sole imam scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon. The community had been looking forward to my talk, and I knew how much preparation and anticipation had gone into it. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the brother my sister needed, and the imam my community relied on. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, as I tried to figure out how to be present for both, knowing I could not fully be there for one without letting the other down."}
