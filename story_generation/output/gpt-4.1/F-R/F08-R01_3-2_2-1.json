Her eyes were red, her voice trembling as she confided in me about a decision that could change her life. She wanted my advice\u2014not as a pastor, but as her grandmother, someone who had weathered storms and could offer the comfort of lived experience. I reached for her hand, my heart aching to give her the gentle, practical wisdom she sought.\n\nJust as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a church member, desperate for spiritual guidance about a similar crossroads. As their pastor, I was expected to offer counsel rooted in faith, to point them toward scripture and prayer, to be a shepherd rather than a grandmother.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My granddaughter needed me to be her family, to share my own stories and mistakes. My congregation needed me to be their spiritual leader, to guide them with the authority of faith. I sat there, caught between the warmth of family and the calling of my vocation, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
