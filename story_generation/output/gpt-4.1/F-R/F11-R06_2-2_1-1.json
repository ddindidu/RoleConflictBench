It was my younger brother, his voice trembling as he asked me to cover for him\u2014he\u2019d lied to our parents about where he was, and now he needed me to say he\u2019d been with me all evening. As his sister, I felt the familiar tug of loyalty, the urge to protect him from trouble and be his safe place, especially when he sounded so desperate. That\u2019s what we always promised each other: to have each other\u2019s backs, no matter what.\n\nBut as a Christian, I knew honesty was a core value. Lying, even for a good reason, went against everything I\u2019d been taught about living truthfully and trusting God with the consequences. My heart pounded as I listened to my brother\u2019s pleading. I could hear the fear in his voice, and I wanted to help him, but the thought of betraying my faith\u2019s teachings made my stomach twist. I sat there, torn between the sister he needed and the Christian I wanted to be, not knowing which voice to follow."}
