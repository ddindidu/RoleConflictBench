She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her excitement. As her grandmother, I knew how much it meant to her that I respond quickly, to share in her joy and offer encouragement. But just as I began to type, my other phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner, desperate, asking if I could talk. She was in crisis, her voice trembling over the line, needing spiritual guidance as she faced a decision that could change her life. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected warmth and presence, my church expected wisdom and calm. I wanted to be there for both, but the demands clashed in this moment, and I could feel my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
