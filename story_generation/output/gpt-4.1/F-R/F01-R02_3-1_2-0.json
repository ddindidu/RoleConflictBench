The church was quiet, the kind of silence that always helped me focus before leading the congregation. Just as I was about to leave, my grandson, Daniel, appeared at the door, his face pale and eyes troubled. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important,\u201d he said, voice trembling. I could see he was wrestling with something heavy, the kind of burden that needed a gentle ear and careful words. As his grandfather, I knew my place was by his side, offering the wisdom and comfort only family can give. But as the priest, I was expected to be at the church, ready to guide my flock in prayer, even if tonight\u2019s service was optional. The community counted on my presence, my leadership. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of my calling. I looked at Daniel, then at the church bell tower visible through the window, and felt the struggle rise within me, unsure which path to take."}
