It\u2019s tradition, and your father would be proud.\u201d I knew how important it was to her, to all of them, that I step up and honor the family\u2019s way. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a widow from church who\u2019d been struggling since her husband passed. She wrote, \u201cIf you have a moment, I\u2019d love to talk.\u201d As a pastor, I felt the weight of her loneliness, the silent plea for comfort that I\u2019d promised to provide. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the family that still felt new and fragile, the other toward the flock that looked to me for support. I stared at the phone, the words of the blessing running through my mind, and felt the ache of wanting to be enough for both."}
