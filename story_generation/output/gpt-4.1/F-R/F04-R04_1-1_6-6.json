Don\u2019t forget, you promised!\u201d I smiled, remembering how we\u2019d agreed to spend more time together, to rebuild the closeness that had faded over the years. As her brother, I wanted to be present, to show her she mattered. But just as I was about to reply, another message arrived\u2014this one from a community member. \u201cImam, if you have a moment tonight, I\u2019d really appreciate your advice. It\u2019s been a tough week.\u201d I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me. As imam, I was expected to be available, to offer guidance and comfort whenever needed. Yet, as a brother, I was expected to nurture our bond, to be there for my family. Both roles demanded my presence, my time, my heart. I stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
