He was about to start college, and he asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do I know what kind of person I should be?\u201d As a grandfather, I felt the weight of responsibility to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years\u2014practical advice about hard work, honesty, and making good choices. But as a Christian, I also felt the call to speak about love, compassion, and the teachings of Jesus, especially since I knew one of his friends was struggling and being left out by others.\n\nI could sense he wanted clear, actionable guidance, something rooted in my own life experience. Yet, my heart tugged toward reminding him to show kindness, to reach out to those who are hurting, even if it\u2019s not the easiest path. The two roles pressed in on me\u2014one urging me to be pragmatic and protective, the other to be open-hearted and selfless. I hesitated, feeling the tension between giving him the tools to succeed and encouraging him to be vulnerable for the sake of others. My mind raced, caught between these two voices, as I searched for the right words."}
