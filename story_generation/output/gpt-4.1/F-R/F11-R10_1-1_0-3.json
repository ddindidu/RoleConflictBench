As his sister, I was expected to be his biggest cheerleader, to make him feel proud and supported. I\u2019d even planned a small surprise for him at the office canteen, where he was meeting me for lunch. \n\nBut as we waited in line, I noticed him quietly slip ahead of someone who\u2019d been waiting longer. It was subtle, almost unnoticeable, but I saw it. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to uphold dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small things. My heart thudded with discomfort. Should I say something and risk dampening his joy, or stay silent and betray my own values? The expectation to support my brother clashed with my urge to gently correct him, and I felt torn, caught between love and principle, celebration and conscience."}
