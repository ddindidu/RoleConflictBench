My son darted between the supermarket aisles, laughter echoing, drawing the attention of other shoppers. As a father, I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee\u2014today was my turn to deliver the Friday sermon, and the congregation was expecting me to speak on the importance of patience and self-control. The topic had been announced for days; people were coming specifically to hear my words. My heart pounded as I tried to catch my son\u2019s eye, torn between the urgent need to guide him and the responsibility to my community. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides, my mind racing with possible consequences no matter which role I chose to fulfill first."}
