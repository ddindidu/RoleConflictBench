She told me about the big decision she had to make at work\u2014whether to accept a promotion that would mean longer hours and more travel. She needed my support, my advice, and most of all, my reassurance that I\u2019d be there for her no matter what she chose. I wanted to be the husband she could lean on, to listen and encourage her, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, with colleagues from every department, men and women mingling freely. The invitation specified business casual, and I knew from past experience that my usual modest attire\u2014long sleeves, loose pants, and a kufi\u2014would stand out. I could already imagine the curious glances, the awkward questions. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations, the responsibility to represent my beliefs with dignity.\n\nI felt torn, caught between being the supportive husband my wife needed and staying true to my religious values in a public setting. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I sat there, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
