She\u2019d barely slept in days, her eyes red from crying, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my unwavering presence. I wanted nothing more than to stay by her side, to be her anchor as she weathered this storm. But as I stroked her hair, my phone buzzed with a message from Mark, a friend from church. He was struggling, too\u2014his mother was in the hospital, and he\u2019d reached out, asking if I could come pray with him, just for a little while. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I felt called to show love and kindness, to be there for those in need, just as Jesus taught. But how could I leave my wife when she was so fragile? If I stayed, I\u2019d be turning my back on someone else who needed compassion. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning the person I promised to support above all others. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
