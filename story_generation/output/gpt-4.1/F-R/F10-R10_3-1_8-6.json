She told me about her worries\u2014my father\u2019s health, her own loneliness, the weight of growing older. I could see how much she needed me, her daughter, to listen and comfort her, to be present and supportive. I reached for her hand, but my mind wandered as the sounds of drums and laughter drifted in from outside. Today was the local Navratri festival, and I had promised myself I would join the evening aarti, to feel connected to my faith and community. The colorful lights and the scent of incense called to me, reminding me of my role as a Hindu, the expectation to participate in rituals and celebrate with others. I felt torn\u2014my mother\u2019s pain anchoring me to the couch, my heart yearning for the spiritual joy outside. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
