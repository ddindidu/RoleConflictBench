He looked at me, waiting for my thoughts on the new medical expense we hadn\u2019t planned for. As his wife, I knew he expected me to be honest, to share my worries and ideas openly so we could face this together. But my mind kept drifting back to what happened at work earlier\u2014a colleague had cut in line for a promotion, bending the rules just enough to get ahead. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma, to act ethically and speak up when something is wrong. I felt a responsibility to address it, but I also worried about the consequences at work and the extra stress it might bring home. My husband needed my full attention and transparency right now, but my conscience tugged at me, urging me to do the right thing at work. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
