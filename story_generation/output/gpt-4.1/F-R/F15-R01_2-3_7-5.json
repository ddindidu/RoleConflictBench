My family needed groceries, the rent was due, and my daughter\u2019s school trip payment was overdue. As a parent, I felt the weight of providing for them, ensuring we had enough to get by. Just as I was about to call the bank, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church council\u2014several families in our congregation had lost their homes in a sudden flood. They needed immediate support, counseling, and someone to organize relief efforts. As their pastor, I was expected to be present, to comfort, to lead. My heart ached for them, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the anxious faces of my own children, waiting for dinner. The demands pulled at me from both sides, each urgent, each impossible to ignore. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure build, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my flock, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
