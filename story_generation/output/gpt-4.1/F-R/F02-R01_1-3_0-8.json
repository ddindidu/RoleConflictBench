It was their last week before summer, and they\u2019d been excited all morning, reminding me not to be late. But in the next room, the church\u2019s fellowship hall was filling with community leaders, all waiting for me to begin the intensive workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. They looked to me for guidance, expecting me to help them wrestle with difficult theological questions and lead them deeper in faith. I could hear their voices, eager and expectant, and I felt the weight of their trust. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my children, who needed their father\u2019s presence, and toward my congregation, who needed their pastor\u2019s wisdom. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, Bible in the other, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door I would walk through."}
