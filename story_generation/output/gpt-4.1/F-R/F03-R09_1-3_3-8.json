It was one of those rare evenings when everyone would be together, sharing stories and laughter, upholding the traditions my parents cherished. I knew how much it meant to them, especially my father, who always said that family was the heart of our home. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for a member\u2019s funeral. I could almost hear Rabbi Cohen\u2019s gentle plea, the weight of community expectation pressing on me. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help others fulfill this sacred obligation, to be present for someone in mourning. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s embrace and the solemn call of my faith. Both sides needed me, both expected me to show up. I felt the tension twist inside me, unsure which path to take, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
