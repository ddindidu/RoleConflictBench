I knew I should ask if everything was okay at home, offer her the support she needed from me as her step-child. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d lost her job and was struggling, reaching out for spiritual guidance. As a pastor, I was expected to offer her comforting words, to be present for her in her time of need. My stepmother glanced at me, waiting, perhaps hoping I\u2019d ask about her day. At the same time, I felt the weight of Mrs. Carter\u2019s troubles pressing on my conscience. I wanted to be there for both of them, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions. My heart ached with the pressure, torn between the family I was trying to support and the flock I was called to guide."}
