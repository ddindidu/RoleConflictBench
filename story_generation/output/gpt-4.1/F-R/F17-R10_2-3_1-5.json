It\u2019s our ritual\u2014me, their only child, living far from home, sharing stories about my week, asking about their health, and listening to their gentle advice. Tonight, as I dial their number, my mind is heavy. Earlier today, I witnessed something at work that shook me: a senior colleague accepting a bribe, a clear act of corruption that could harm many innocent people. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve been taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and courage, even when it\u2019s difficult. My conscience screams at me to report what I saw, to stand up for what\u2019s right.\n\nBut as the phone rings, I feel torn. My parents expect me to share everything, to be open and honest with them. Yet, I know this news will worry them deeply, maybe even put them in a difficult position if word spreads. I want to protect them from anxiety, but I also want to honor the values they raised me with. My heart pounds as I hear my mother\u2019s voice, and I wonder\u2014can I be both the dutiful child and the principled Hindu tonight?"}
