My wife\u2019s gentle reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cShe\u2019s been practicing her poem for weeks. She really wants you there.\u201d I pictured her hopeful eyes, the way she\u2019d look for me in the crowd. As a father, I knew how much my presence meant to her, how these moments built her confidence and trust in me.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with messages from my friends, already booking their flights for Hajj this season. We\u2019d been planning this for years, saving every spare coin. As a Muslim, performing Hajj was not just a dream, but a religious duty I\u2019d longed to fulfill. The thought of finally standing in Mecca, completing my faith, filled me with anticipation and a sense of spiritual urgency.\n\nYet, the open class and the Hajj trip overlapped. If I went to Mecca, I\u2019d miss her big day. If I stayed, I\u2019d have to postpone Hajj again, uncertain when the next chance would come. My heart ached, torn between my daughter\u2019s need for her father and my own longing to answer the call of faith."}
