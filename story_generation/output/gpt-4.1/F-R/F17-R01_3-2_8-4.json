Her eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance, for the kind of comfort she\u2019d always given me. I wanted to be the strong child she needed, to hold her hand and promise her everything would be alright. My phone buzzed on the table, a message from a church member: \u201cPastor, can you talk? I\u2019m falling apart. I need you.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding. As a pastor, I was expected to be available, to offer guidance and hope to those who reached out. But right now, my mother needed me too, not as a pastor, but as her child. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, my empathy, my strength. I felt torn, unable to give fully to either, afraid of letting both down."}
