She confided in me about a decision she was facing\u2014one that weighed heavily on her young heart. She wanted my advice, trusting me as her grandmother to offer wisdom and comfort. I could see how much she needed my support, how much she hoped I would understand and guide her without judgment.\n\nBut as she spoke, I realized her dilemma touched on values that, as a Christian, I hold deeply. The choice she faced was tangled with questions of right and wrong, forgiveness, and truth. My faith teaches me to be honest, to encourage what is good and just, and to gently guide others toward God\u2019s love. Yet, I also know that my granddaughter needs to feel safe and accepted, not shamed or pushed away.\n\nInside, I felt torn. The loving grandparent in me wanted to simply hold her, to reassure her that she is loved no matter what. The Christian in me felt the weight of responsibility to speak truth and encourage her to choose the path of faith. My heart ached as I wrestled with how to respond, knowing that whatever I said next could shape her trust in me\u2014and perhaps her faith as well."}
