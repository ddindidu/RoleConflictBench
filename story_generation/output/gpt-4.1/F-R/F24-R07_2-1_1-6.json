I knew something had happened at school\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of being there for him, to listen and offer comfort, especially since our parents were both working late. I started to walk toward him, but my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the Buddhist center, asking if I had time to talk about the sermon we\u2019d both heard last night. We\u2019d promised to reflect together, and I knew how important these discussions were for my spiritual growth and for supporting my friend\u2019s journey too.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My stepbrother needed me now, maybe more than ever, but so did my friend\u2014and my own commitment to Buddhist practice. The expectations pressed in from both sides: be the supportive sibling, be the devoted practitioner. My heart raced as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the tension of wanting to be everything for everyone, but knowing I couldn\u2019t."}
