My daughter had called earlier, insisting that everyone be present\u2014this was a moment not to be missed. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to see the joy on her face, to offer the warm embrace only a grandmother can give. Yet, in the back of my mind, the responsibilities of my other life tugged at me. As rabbi, I was expected to begin preparing my next Shabbat sermon, a process that demanded quiet reflection and careful thought. The congregation relied on me for guidance and inspiration, and I knew how much they valued a message that spoke to their hearts. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s laughter grew louder, but so did the silent call of my study, where books and notes waited for me. I closed my eyes, torn between the warmth of family and the solemn duty of my calling, unsure which path to follow."}
