She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I felt that familiar tug inside me\u2014the urge to ask if everything was okay, to be the supportive child she needed. I wanted to help, to listen, to be there for her, just like I always tried to be. But as I opened my mouth, I remembered the argument I\u2019d overheard last night, words that went against everything I\u2019d learned in church about forgiveness and kindness. I felt torn. As a Christian, I was supposed to hold onto love, to encourage peace, and to avoid gossip or judgment. But as a child, I felt responsible for my parents\u2019 happiness, for making sure our home was safe and loving. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
