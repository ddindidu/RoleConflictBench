I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d never asked for help so directly before, and I knew things must be bad. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, no matter what. But the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse. My doctor had just told me that my health was declining, and if I wanted to perform Hajj, this year might be my only chance. The pilgrimage was not just a dream\u2014it was a religious duty, a pillar of my faith. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my brother\u2019s voice trembling with need, and the sacred call to fulfill my obligation as a Muslim. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn between the bond of family and the pull of faith, unsure which path I could bear to leave behind."}
