He\u2019s been excited for weeks, and I promised I\u2019d be there. As his step-parent, I know how much it means to him that I show up, especially since his mother can\u2019t make it. I want to be the supportive adult he needs, someone he can count on. But as I lay out my clothes, my phone buzzes with a message from work: a last-minute office function is scheduled for this afternoon, and attendance is expected. It\u2019s a mixed-gender event, and I know my colleagues will be dressed casually, but as a Muslim, I feel the pressure to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing my hijab. I worry about standing out, about the questions and stares, about being seen as different. I feel torn\u2014between being the parent my stepson needs at his school and upholding my faith\u2019s expectations in a professional setting. My heart pounds as I stare at my wardrobe, caught between two worlds, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
