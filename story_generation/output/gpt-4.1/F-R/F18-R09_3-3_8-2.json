He was distracted, eyes darting to the ice cream truck across the street. Suddenly, he tugged free and darted forward, not even glancing at the cars. My heart leapt into my throat\u2014I was supposed to keep him safe, to look out for him, just like Mom always said. But as I reached for him, my mind flashed to last night, when I\u2019d tried to help him practice his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. He\u2019d gotten frustrated, slamming the book shut, saying he didn\u2019t care about the Hebrew words or the stories. I was supposed to guide him, to help him understand what it means to be Jewish, to pass on our traditions. Now, in this split second, I felt torn\u2014do I shout at him to stop, risking embarrassing him in front of his friends, or do I let him go, hoping he\u2019ll be okay, so I can talk to him later about both safety and our heritage? My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
