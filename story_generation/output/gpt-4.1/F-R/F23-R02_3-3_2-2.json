My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me at the school first thing tomorrow to discuss what happened. As his step-parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to show him support and guide him through this mistake. But tomorrow was also the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the priest, I was expected to lead the morning prayers and the main service\u2014an event that drew the entire community, many of whom looked to me for spiritual guidance and comfort. I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I wasn\u2019t there. Ethan needed me, but so did my congregation. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, my care, my leadership. I stared at the calendar, torn, my mind racing with the impossible choice before me."}
