She needed me\u2014her husband\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to help her find clarity. I reached for her hand, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was Miriam, the conversion candidate, reminding me that her final study session was in fifteen minutes. She was anxious, desperate for guidance before her Beit Din. As her rabbi, I knew how much this meant; I had promised to be there, to teach and support her at this crucial moment. My wife\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cCan you stay with me a little longer?\u201d My heart twisted. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s need for comfort, Miriam\u2019s need for spiritual preparation.
