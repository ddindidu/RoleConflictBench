I know he needs comfort, maybe a warm meal together, a chance to unwind and feel cared for. But as lunchtime approaches, my stomach tightens\u2014not just from hunger, but from worry. We\u2019re far from home, and the only place I know is kosher is a tiny vendor a few blocks away. He\u2019s never minded eating kosher with me, but today, I can see he just wants something easy, maybe a burger from the place across the street, something familiar and comforting. I feel the weight of my own commitment to keeping kosher, the rules I\u2019ve followed since childhood, and the guilt of possibly making his day harder. I want to be the supportive wife he needs, to say, \u201cLet\u2019s eat wherever you want,\u201d but I also feel the pull of my faith, the boundaries I\u2019ve set for myself. My heart aches as I try to balance his needs with my own, caught between love and tradition, unsure which way to turn."}
