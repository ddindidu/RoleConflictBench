He drops his bag and sighs, mentioning offhand that work was a bit much today. I can see the tiredness in his eyes, the way his shoulders slump. As his wife, I want to be there for him, to listen, to offer comfort, to let him know I care. But tonight is also the weekly slot I set aside to teach our children about our Jewish heritage\u2014stories, prayers, the values I hope will shape them. The kids are already waiting in the living room, books open, eager for our time together. I know I could shift the lesson to another night, but I promised myself to be consistent, to show them that our traditions matter. My husband glances at me, hopeful for a moment of connection, while the children\u2019s voices call from the next room. I stand in the hallway, heart tugged in two directions, feeling the weight of both promises pressing in on me."}
