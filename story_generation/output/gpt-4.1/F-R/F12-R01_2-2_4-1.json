It was Sarah from church, her message urgent: \u201cCan you talk? I really need your advice.\u201d I glanced at the overflowing laundry basket, the kids\u2019 soccer uniforms still buried somewhere inside. My husband had asked if I could make sure everything was ready for tomorrow\u2019s busy day. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family counting on me to keep things running smoothly, and Sarah, vulnerable and searching, needing her pastor\u2019s wisdom. I could hear the washing machine\u2019s chime, reminding me of the chores left undone, while my heart ached for Sarah\u2019s pain. I wanted to be present for my family, to share the load and show my love in these small, daily ways. But I also felt the sacred pull of my calling, the responsibility to guide and comfort those who trust me. My hands trembled as I held the phone, torn between the demands of home and the needs of my congregation, unsure which voice to answer first."}
