As a brother, I knew how much it meant to them for all of us to be together, especially this year. My parents kept saying, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My little sister had already started making a list of games we\u2019d play. I felt the weight of their expectations, the unspoken rule that family comes first.\n\nBut earlier that day, I\u2019d seen Mark, a friend from church, sitting alone outside the caf\u00e9, his shoulders slumped. He\u2019d lost his job last week, and I could see the worry etched on his face. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to reach out, to spend time with him, to show the love and kindness Jesus taught us. I knew he needed someone now, maybe more than ever.\n\nThe two roles tugged at me from opposite sides\u2014my family\u2019s joy and togetherness, Mark\u2019s silent plea for comfort. My heart ached as I wrestled with the choice, feeling torn between being the brother my family needed and the Christian my faith called me to be."}
