She confided in me about a difficult situation at school, asking for my advice. As her grandmother, I felt the weight of her trust, knowing she expected me to offer wisdom and comfort, to guide her with the experience I had gathered over the years. Just as I was about to respond, I glanced out the window and saw a colleague at work, who had come to visit, quietly cutting in line at the neighborhood shop across the street. My upbringing as a Hindu taught me to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and fairness, and to gently correct wrongs when I see them. I felt a tug inside\u2014should I excuse myself to address the small injustice outside, or stay and give my granddaughter the undivided attention she needed? Both roles demanded something of me at that moment, and I could feel the tension rising, my heart torn between the call of family and the call of principle."}
