The house needed to be spotless, the food prepared, every detail perfect. He looked at me with hopeful eyes, expecting me to help coordinate the chores, to share the load as we always promised. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014today was the monthly food drive at the convent, a commitment I made as a nun, a promise to serve those in need. The sisters would be counting on me to help pack meals, to offer comfort and presence to the hungry. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my husband\u2019s silent plea for partnership and my sisters\u2019 trust in my devotion. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my home and the call to serve beyond its walls, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I loved would be left waiting."}
