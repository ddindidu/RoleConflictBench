My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019s in tears, desperate, her marriage on the brink. \u201cCan you talk? I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I know how much she needs guidance right now\u2014her choices tonight could change everything. My heart aches for her, but I glance at the laundry, at the clock, at the closed bedroom door where my spouse waits for a partner, not just a pastor. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest. I want to be present for my family, to share the load, but I also feel the pull of my calling, the expectation to shepherd those in crisis. I stand frozen, torn between the needs of my home and the needs of my flock, unsure which to answer first."}
