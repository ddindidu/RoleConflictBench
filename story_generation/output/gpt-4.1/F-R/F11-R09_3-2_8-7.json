She wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the argument we\u2019d had last night. She said she\u2019d be home in an hour, and she hoped we could finally clear the air. I knew how important it was to her, and to me, that we rebuild the trust we\u2019d lost. I wanted to be there, to listen, to show her that I cared enough to work through our misunderstandings.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at synagogue, ready to chant my Torah portion. I\u2019d been preparing for weeks, and the rabbi was counting on me. My family expected me to honor our tradition, to show up and participate fully. Missing the service would be letting them down, and I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my chest.\n\nI paced the hallway, torn between my sister\u2019s need for connection and my commitment to my faith. Both mattered deeply to me, but I couldn\u2019t see how to be the sister she needed and the Jew my community expected at the same time."}
