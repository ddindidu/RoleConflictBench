I sense her heaviness, the way only a grandmother can. My heart aches to reach out, to offer the stories and gentle advice that have guided my own children through storms. Yet, tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle\u2014a commitment I hold sacred. We are to discuss a chapter on compassion, one I have not yet read, and my presence is expected. The group relies on my insights, and I cherish the peace and clarity these evenings bring. I feel the pull of both worlds: the urge to sit beside my granddaughter, to listen and guide, and the call to honor my spiritual path, to deepen my understanding and support my fellow practitioners. The weight of these expectations presses on me, and I find myself standing in the hallway, torn between the living room and the door, my heart wrestling with the impossible choice."}
