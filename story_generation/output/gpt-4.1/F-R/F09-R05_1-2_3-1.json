She glared, stubborn, and I felt the familiar tug of frustration. I wanted to teach her gratitude, to help her grow into a thoughtful person, but my mind kept drifting to the open notebook on the counter. The blank page stared back at me, waiting for the sermon I needed to finish before Shabbat. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance, a message that would resonate. My phone buzzed with a reminder: only a few hours left before sundown. My daughter\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for attention, while my thoughts raced with Torah passages and unfinished ideas. I felt split in two\u2014torn between nurturing my child\u2019s heart and fulfilling my duty to my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
