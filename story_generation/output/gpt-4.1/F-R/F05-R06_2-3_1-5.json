She was facing a huge decision at work\u2014one that could change the course of her career\u2014and she needed me. She reached for my hand, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cCan we talk tonight? I really need you.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation: to listen, to comfort, to be present.\n\nBut as I glanced at my phone, I saw the reminder for tonight\u2019s church service. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, not just to worship but to help with the youth group and support the community. I knew people counted on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. The church had always been a source of strength for me, and I believed in being consistent in my commitments.\n\nYet, as I looked at my wife, torn and vulnerable, I felt a knot in my stomach. I wanted to be the husband she needed, but I also wanted to honor my faith and my church family. The two worlds pulled at me, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
