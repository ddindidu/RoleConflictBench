Her eyes were red, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d I could see the weight she carried, and I wanted nothing more than to wrap her in comfort, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over a lifetime. Just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a church member, desperate for guidance about a family crisis unraveling that very moment. As a pastor, I knew my congregation expected me to be present, to offer counsel and hope whenever they called. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s need for her grandmother\u2019s undivided attention, and my parishioner\u2019s plea for their pastor\u2019s support. I felt the pressure mounting, the ache of wanting to be everything for everyone, yet knowing I could not be in two places at once. My granddaughter\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting, as my phone vibrated again."}
