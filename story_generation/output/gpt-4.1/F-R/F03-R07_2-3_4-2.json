Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I\u2019d been looking forward to for months. As a practicing Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to help with the preparations, to be present for the rituals that connected me to my faith and my community. But as I tiptoed past the living room, I saw the table set for our family\u2019s traditional breakfast\u2014a custom my parents insisted we never miss, especially now, when they said our family ties needed strengthening more than ever. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me that honoring our family traditions was a way of honoring our ancestors, a value she held sacred. Yet, the thought of letting down the monks and my fellow Buddhists tugged at me just as strongly. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet call of my spiritual community, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
