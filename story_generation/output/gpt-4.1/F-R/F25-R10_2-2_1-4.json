It\u2019s our ritual\u2014me sharing updates about my classes, them asking about my health, and me listening to their stories. They always remind me to be polite, to avoid conflict, to keep the peace in the family. Tonight, as I dial, my mind is elsewhere. Earlier today, I saw my friend Priya being blamed for something she didn\u2019t do. The unfairness gnaws at me. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and protect others from injustice. But my parents have always warned me not to get involved in other people\u2019s problems, to focus on my own life, to avoid drama. My stepmother\u2019s voice is warm on the line, asking about my week. I want to tell her about Priya, to ask what I should do, but I know she\u2019ll tell me to stay out of it. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations\u2014one to keep the peace at home, the other to do what\u2019s right. I listen to my parents, my mind racing, caught between their wishes and my own sense of duty."}
