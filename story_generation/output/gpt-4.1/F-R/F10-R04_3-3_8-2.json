Her eyes searched mine, desperate for comfort, for the steady presence I\u2019d always tried to be. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her pain settle on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed insistently. It was the mosque committee\u2014reminding me that the congregation was waiting. Tonight was the special remembrance, and I was the only imam available to lead the prayers. I could picture the rows of worshippers, their anticipation, their trust in me to guide them. My mother\u2019s voice wavered, pulling me back. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the daughter my parents needed, the other by the imam my community depended on. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, caught between the expectations of faith and family, unsure which call to answer first."}
