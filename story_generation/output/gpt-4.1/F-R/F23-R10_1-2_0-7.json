The school bell would ring soon, and I was supposed to be there, waiting outside with a smile, just like I promised the kids. As their step-parent, I knew how much it meant to them that I showed up, especially after all the changes in their lives. But today was also the day of the family puja, a ceremony my parents had been planning for weeks. As a Hindu, I was expected to arrive early, help with the preparations, and wear the traditional saree my mother had picked out for me. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my mother, her message gentle but firm: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, beta. Everyone is counting on you.\u201d I could already picture the disappointment in both sets of eyes\u2014the children\u2019s if I missed their pick-up, my family\u2019s if I arrived late and flustered. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in one hand, saree in the other, torn between two promises I desperately wanted to keep."}
