As his sister, I know how much it means to him for me to be there, cheering him on, sharing in his joy. He\u2019s always looked up to me, and I\u2019ve promised to support him, especially on days like this. But today is also the day I lead our weekly group meditation at the temple. As a Buddhist, I am committed to guiding others in mindfulness, and people rely on me to create a peaceful space for their practice. The session is scheduled for the exact hour my family will be cutting the cake and taking photos. My phone buzzes with messages from both sides\u2014my brother asking if I\u2019ll be home soon, and my meditation group confirming their attendance. I feel a tightness in my chest, torn between the warmth of family celebration and the calm responsibility of my spiritual practice. The expectations press in from both directions, and I sit quietly, wrestling with the weight of choosing between being a supportive sister and a devoted Buddhist."}
