As her step-parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I show up, to be there in the audience, smiling and cheering her on. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for days, and I promised I\u2019d be there. But tonight was also the first evening in weeks with no work, no errands, no interruptions\u2014a rare chance to sit quietly, recite the Quran, and reflect, as I\u2019d been longing to do. My heart ached for that peace, the spiritual nourishment I\u2019d been missing. Yet, I could almost hear Aisha\u2019s hopeful voice, see her searching the crowd for my face. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to nurture her confidence, and my need to nurture my own faith. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the evening stretching before me, each path pulling at a different part of who I am."}
