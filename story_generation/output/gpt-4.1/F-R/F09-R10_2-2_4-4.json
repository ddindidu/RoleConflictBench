As a mother, I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to correct his behavior right then and there. But just as I reached for his hand, I noticed a commotion near the checkout. My friend Priya was being unfairly accused of shoplifting by a store employee. As a Hindu, I believe deeply in standing up for what is right, in practicing dharma and defending those who are wronged. My heart pounded as I looked from my son, who was now pulling items off a shelf, to Priya, whose eyes pleaded for help. I felt torn\u2014my duty as a mother demanded I focus on my child, but my faith and conscience urged me to intervene for my friend. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two roles that meant everything to me."}
