I remembered my promise to his father\u2014to help guide him, to teach him right from wrong, to instill good manners. \u201cWe don\u2019t put elbows on the table during meals,\u201d I said gently, hoping to sound more nurturing than strict. But he just glared at me, his eyes full of silent defiance. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I knew I was called to be patient, to show love and understanding, to correct with kindness and not anger. But the expectation to discipline, to set boundaries, pressed on me just as hard. I could feel my frustration rising, the urge to snap at him warring with the voice inside urging me to show grace. Was I being too harsh? Too lenient? I wanted to honor my faith, to be a good example, but I also needed to fulfill my role as a parent. The tension between these demands knotted in my chest as I stood there, unsure of what to say next."}
