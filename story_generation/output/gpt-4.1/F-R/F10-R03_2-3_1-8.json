It\u2019s a ritual that grounds me, a thread connecting my life as their daughter to the quiet halls of the convent. My mother always asks about my health, my father tells me about the garden, and I listen, feeling their love across the miles. This week, though, the Mother Superior has asked me to lead daily reflections for our upcoming retreat. It\u2019s an honor, but it means hours of preparation\u2014reading, meditating, and writing\u2014leaving little time for anything else. As Sunday approaches, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents will wait for my call, expecting the comfort of my voice, while my sisters here look to me for spiritual guidance. I sit in my small room, torn between the gentle pull of family and the sacred duty I\u2019ve chosen. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot give myself fully to both, and I wonder which part of me must wait."}
