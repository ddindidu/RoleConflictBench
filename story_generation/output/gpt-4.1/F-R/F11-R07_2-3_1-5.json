It was my younger brother, his voice trembling, asking if I could come over. He\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend and needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I knew he expected me to be there, to listen and comfort him, just as I always had. But tonight, I was also the leader of our weekly Buddhist meditation group. Everyone would be waiting for me to guide the session, to help them find calm and clarity. I could almost hear their quiet voices and see the cushions arranged in a circle, the incense already burning. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my brother\u2019s pain and my commitment to the sangha. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
