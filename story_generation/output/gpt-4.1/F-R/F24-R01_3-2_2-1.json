My stepbrother\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind, raw and trembling after he\u2019d told me about the news\u2014his mother\u2019s illness had taken a turn for the worse. He needed me, not just as a family member, but as someone who could sit with him in the pain, no sermons, no platitudes, just presence. But as I tried to gather myself, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was a member of my congregation, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. She was waiting in the church office, expecting me to offer wisdom, to be the calm, spiritual anchor she\u2019d come to rely on. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s grief, my parishioner\u2019s crisis. Both needed me, but in such different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, my own emotions tangled in the middle, unsure which part of myself to answer with first."}
