It was a message from my younger sister, her words shaky and desperate. She\u2019d had a rough night, and she needed me to come over. I could almost hear her tears through the screen. As her sister, I knew I should be there for her, especially when she was hurting. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, no matter what.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized church service would start in less than an hour. I\u2019d been trying to be more consistent with attending Sunday worship, not just for myself, but to be part of the community and grow in my faith. I knew how much it meant to my church family, and to me, to show up and participate.\n\nI sat on the edge of my bed, torn. My heart ached for my sister, but I also felt the weight of my commitment as a Christian. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I found myself wrestling with what to do next, feeling the tension pull me in two directions."}
