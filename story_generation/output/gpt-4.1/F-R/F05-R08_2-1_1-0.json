I had planned to spend this evening with the Quran, reciting and letting its words settle in my heart after a long week. It\u2019s a rare chance\u2014no work emails, no errands, just me and the sacred text. But as I set the Quran on the table, my wife walks in, her face clouded with worry. She sits beside me, her voice trembling as she shares the dilemma she\u2019s facing at work. She needs me\u2014my attention, my comfort, my advice. I see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for reassurance. Yet, a part of me aches to turn inward, to fulfill my spiritual need, to honor my commitment as a Muslim. The expectations tug at me from both sides: to be the supportive husband she deserves, and to be the devoted Muslim I strive to be. My heart pounds as I sit between these two worlds, feeling the weight of both, unsure which to choose."}
