We needed to talk openly about our finances\u2014there were bills piling up, and my spouse deserved honesty and reassurance. I could see the worry in their eyes, and I knew this was a moment that called for my full attention and transparency. But my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He was desperate for a private meeting tonight, overwhelmed by family stress. As an imam, I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, especially in moments like this. My heart pulled in two directions: my spouse needed my presence and honesty, but my community expected me to be available, compassionate, and wise. I felt the tension rising inside me, torn between the vows I made at home and the responsibilities I carried at the mosque. The clock ticked, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
