As a father, I know I\u2019m supposed to teach him discipline\u2014help him learn responsibility, even if it means being firm. My own father would have raised his voice, maybe even sent me to my room. I want my son to grow up with strong values, to understand consequences. But as I opened my mouth to scold him, I caught sight of his wide, anxious eyes. My heart tugged in another direction. As a Christian, I\u2019m called to show love and kindness, to be patient and gentle, just as Jesus would. I could see he was already embarrassed, maybe even scared. The urge to comfort him, to show compassion, pressed against the duty to correct him. I stood there, torn between the stern father I thought I should be and the loving Christian I strive to become, my words caught somewhere between discipline and grace."}
