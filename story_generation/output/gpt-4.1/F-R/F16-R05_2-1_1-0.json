They\u2019d just received news of a possible promotion, but it came with a difficult choice\u2014relocation or staying put and risking stagnation. They reached for my hand, voice trembling, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I need you.\u201d I squeezed their fingers, wanting to be fully present, to listen, to reassure. But in the back of my mind, the clock ticked louder. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to outline my sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance, a message that would resonate weeks from now. My phone buzzed with reminders, and guilt gnawed at me. I wanted to give my partner my undivided attention, to be the spouse they needed. Yet, the weight of my rabbinic duties pressed in, demanding reflection and creativity. My heart pulled in two directions, each role asking for all of me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
