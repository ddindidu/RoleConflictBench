Instinctively, I wanted to go to him, to sit on the couch and listen, to be the sibling he needed\u2014someone who would let him talk, or just sit in silence, offering comfort. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was starting in ten minutes. As a priest, I was expected to lead, to be prepared and present, to guide the team in shaping the spiritual journey for our parishioners. I could already imagine the disappointment if I arrived late or distracted. My brother\u2019s muffled sobs drifted from the hallway, tugging at my heart, while the weight of my priestly responsibilities pressed on my shoulders. I stood frozen, torn between the call of family and the call of faith, feeling the impossible pull of both roles demanding all of me at once."}
