I know I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, as a good mother would. Other shoppers glance our way, some with disapproval, and I feel their silent judgment. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my Buddhist teacher about the summary I promised for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I haven\u2019t even started. The teachings on patience and mindfulness swirl in my mind, but I can\u2019t find a quiet moment to reflect, let alone write. I want to be present for my son, to guide him, but I also want to honor my commitment to my spiritual community. The expectations press in from both sides: to raise a good child, to deepen my practice. My heart aches with the tension, torn between the noisy demands of motherhood and the silent call of the Dharma. I stand frozen, unsure which voice to answer first."}
