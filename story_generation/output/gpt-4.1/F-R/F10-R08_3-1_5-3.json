The house was filled with the comforting smells of my mother\u2019s cooking, and I felt at ease, knowing I could relax in my own space. Suddenly, my father called me into the living room. \u201cWe need you to lead the family ceremony this year,\u201d he said, his eyes shining with pride. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep our traditions alive, and everyone will be watching.\u201d\n\nMy heart skipped. The ceremony meant extended family, neighbors, and even some family friends would be present. Our tradition required the leader to wear a special dress\u2014one that was beautiful but didn\u2019t meet the modesty guidelines I follow as a Muslim. I could already hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cIt\u2019s just for a few hours, for the family.\u201d But I also felt the weight of my faith, the comfort and conviction I found in dressing modestly, especially in front of others. I sat there, torn, the expectations of being a dutiful daughter and a practicing Muslim pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
