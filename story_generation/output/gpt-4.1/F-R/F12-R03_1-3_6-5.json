He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than just a simple answer. As his wife, I knew he expected honesty, a window into my thoughts and feelings. I wanted to tell him everything\u2014the nervous excitement, the weight of responsibility I felt after being chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral. But as a nun, I was bound to the discipline of my order, to humility and discretion, especially about convent matters. The sisters trusted me to represent them, to keep our inner life sacred. My husband\u2019s gentle prodding clashed with the vow of silence I felt pressed upon me. I could see the hurt flicker in his eyes when I hesitated, torn between the openness he deserved and the duty I owed to my sisters and God. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, words caught in my throat, wrestling with the impossible choice between two worlds that both claimed my heart."}
