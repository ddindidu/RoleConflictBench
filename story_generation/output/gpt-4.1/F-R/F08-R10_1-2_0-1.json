My hands moved automatically, arranging the flowers and incense, my mind already reciting the prayers I have said every day for decades. Just as I reached for the matchbox, my granddaughter appeared at the doorway, her eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cAmma, can I talk to you?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. She wanted to know how to face the changes coming with her new job in a distant city\u2014how to be brave, how to stay true to herself. I saw the hope in her face, the trust that I would have the right words. But the clock ticked closer to the auspicious time for my puja, and I felt the weight of my faith pressing on me. If I delayed, I would miss the sacred moment. If I turned her away, I would fail her as a grandmother. My heart pulled in two directions, I stood frozen, torn between the call of my faith and the needs of my family, unsure which voice to answer first."}
