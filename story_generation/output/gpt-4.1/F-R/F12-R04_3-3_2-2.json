He sits on the edge of our bed, eyes red, hands trembling, needing me\u2014his wife\u2014to be his anchor. I want nothing more than to hold him, to listen, to reassure him that he is not alone in this storm. But my phone vibrates insistently. The mosque committee\u2019s message flashes on the screen: the congregation is waiting, the remembrance gathering is larger than expected, and I am the only imam present who can lead the prayers. My heart pounds as I glance between my husband and the phone. I feel the weight of two worlds pressing in on me\u2014one expects my unwavering presence and comfort, the other my spiritual leadership and guidance. Both are urgent, both are sacred. My chest tightens as I realize I cannot be in two places at once. I stand frozen, torn by love and duty, knowing that whatever I choose, something precious will be left wanting."}
