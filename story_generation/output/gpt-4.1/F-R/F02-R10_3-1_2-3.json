My heart ached with worry and disappointment, but I also felt the weight of responsibility\u2014my son needed me to listen, to teach, to support.\n\nBut as I walked toward the school entrance, my phone buzzed with a message from work. Someone had cut in line for a promotion, bending the rules just enough to get ahead. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and fairness, even in small matters. I felt a tug inside me, a call to speak up, to address the injustice, however minor it seemed.\n\nCaught between these two worlds, I felt the pressure mounting. My son needed my attention and guidance, but my conscience urged me to act at work. I stood there, torn, the expectations of fatherhood and faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path to take first."}
