His final exam was tomorrow, and I could feel the tension radiating through the walls. As his step-sibling, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to talk to, someone to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone in his anxiety. I wanted to be there for him, to offer comfort and maybe even help him review.\n\nBut it was Sunday morning, and as a Christian, I felt the pull to attend church. I hadn\u2019t been in a few weeks, and I missed the sense of peace and community that came with worship. I knew the church expected me to show up, to participate, to be present in faith and fellowship. The guilt gnawed at me\u2014if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my spiritual community and, in a way, my own beliefs. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my stepbrother when he needed me most. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
