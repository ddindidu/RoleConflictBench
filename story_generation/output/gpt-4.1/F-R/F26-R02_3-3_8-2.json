My grandson had been in an accident\u2014nothing fatal, but serious enough to shake the whole family. As a grandmother, my heart ached to be with them, to hold my daughter\u2019s hand, to reassure my grandson that he was safe and loved. My family needed me, and I felt the pull of that responsibility deep in my bones.\n\nBut as I hung up, the church bells reminded me of my other duty. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year. The sanctuary would soon fill with people seeking comfort, guidance, and the sacred rituals I alone could provide. The community expected my presence, my prayers, my leadership. I could already picture the pews crowded with faces, some anxious, some hopeful, all waiting for me.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the desperate need of my family and the sacred trust of my congregation. My phone buzzed with another message from my daughter, while the church clock chimed again. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
