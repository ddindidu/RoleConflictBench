He barely looked at me before heading to his room. As his sibling, I knew I should go after him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014he always counted on me to be there when things got rough. But as I reached his door, I remembered what he\u2019d told me last week: he and his friends had been making fun of another kid at school, and he\u2019d laughed along. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I\u2019m supposed to stand up for kindness and honesty, to gently guide others toward what\u2019s right. If I comfort him now, am I ignoring the wrong he\u2019s done? But if I confront him about his actions, will I be turning away from the support he needs from his sibling? I stood outside his door, torn between the urge to hug him and the need to speak the truth, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
