I have set aside this afternoon for spiritual reading, a rare moment to nourish my soul in silence. My Bible lies open, the words inviting me to deeper reflection. Yet, my phone vibrates softly in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter. She tells me that my grandson is struggling, his world shaken by something he cannot yet name. As a grandmother, I feel the pull to call her, to offer comfort, to be present for my family in their time of need. But as a nun, I am expected to honor this sacred time, to remain in contemplation and prayer, undistracted by the outside world. My heart aches with the weight of both loves: the call to family, the call to God. I sit, torn, the silence now heavy with the tension of my divided roles, unsure which voice to answer first."}
