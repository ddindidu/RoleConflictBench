She\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and tonight the weight of her crisis seems unbearable. She needs me\u2014my words, my arms, my presence. I hold her, whispering comfort, feeling her pain as if it were my own. My phone buzzes insistently. The mosque is full; a special remembrance has drawn a crowd, and I am the only one authorized to lead the prayer. The community expects me to be there, to guide them, to fulfill my duty as imam. My wife\u2019s grip tightens, silently pleading for me not to leave. My heart aches, torn between the sacred trust of my congregation and the desperate need of the woman I love. I can feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding all of me, right now. I close my eyes, caught in the impossible space between two sacred trusts, not knowing which to choose."}
