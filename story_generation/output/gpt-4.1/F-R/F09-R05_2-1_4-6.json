I know I should stop, kneel down, and teach her about respect for public spaces, about self-control\u2014lessons I\u2019ve always promised myself I\u2019d instill as a mother. But my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. It\u2019s an email from a couple, asking if I can officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I know how important it is to respond promptly, to show care and commitment to those seeking spiritual guidance. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the mother who must teach discipline in this moment, and the rabbi who must be present and responsive to her community. My daughter\u2019s laughter rings out again, and I glance at my phone, torn between the urgent and the important, my heart pounding as I wrestle with which expectation to meet first."}
