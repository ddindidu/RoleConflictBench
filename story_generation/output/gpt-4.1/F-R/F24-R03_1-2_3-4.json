Your brother\u2019s been looking forward to it.\u201d My stepbrother grinned at me, hope shining in his eyes. I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of family expectation\u2014being present, sharing laughter, making memories. But as I sipped my tea, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: \u201cWe\u2019re holding a special healing service for Sister Maria on Saturday. Your presence would mean a lot.\u201d My heart clenched. The community needed me, too. I was expected to be there, to pray, to offer comfort and faith. The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each holding a piece of my loyalty. I wanted to be the sister my family needed, but also the nun my community relied on. The weight of choosing between them settled heavy in my chest, and I stared at my hands, torn and uncertain, as the voices of both families echoed in my mind."}
