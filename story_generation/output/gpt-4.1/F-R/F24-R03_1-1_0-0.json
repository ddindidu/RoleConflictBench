The convent was already bustling with preparations for the food drive\u2014Sister Agnes called out for volunteers to help load the van, and the scent of fresh bread filled the halls. Today was our monthly outreach, and I was expected to be present, to serve with compassion and devotion. But my phone buzzed again, a message from my stepbrother: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about the exam.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in his voice, remember the way he\u2019d always looked to me for reassurance since our families blended. He needed me, just as I\u2019d promised I would always be there for him, especially when he was anxious or afraid. My heart twisted, torn between the call to serve my community and the silent plea from my brother. The weight of both vows pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, unable to move toward the chapel or pick up the phone, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
