As a parent, I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, especially in public spaces. My heart ached with the responsibility to guide him, to shape him into a kind and considerate person. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a message from the mayor. The hurricane had devastated our town, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be present for those who had lost everything. The community needed me now, perhaps more than ever. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My son\u2019s innocent joy clashed with the desperate needs outside these walls. I gripped the shopping cart, my mind racing, caught between the call to serve my child and the call to serve my community, unsure which voice to answer first."}
