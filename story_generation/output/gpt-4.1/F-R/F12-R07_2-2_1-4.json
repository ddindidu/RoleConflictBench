He looked up at me, eyes searching for reassurance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said, voice trembling. \u201cIf I take the promotion, I\u2019ll have to move. But if I don\u2019t, I might regret it.\u201d I could feel the weight of his anxiety, the silent plea for comfort and guidance. I wanted to sit with him, listen, and help him untangle his thoughts\u2014be the supportive wife he needed.\n\nBut I glanced at the clock. In ten minutes, my weekly meditation group would begin. It was the one hour each week I dedicated to mindfulness, to reconnect with my Buddhist practice and find inner peace. I knew how much I needed that space, how it helped me stay grounded and compassionate. Yet, here was my husband, needing me now, not later.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the cushion waiting in the quiet room, and toward the man I loved, who needed my presence more than ever. I stood there, torn, the expectations of wife and Buddhist pulling me apart."}
