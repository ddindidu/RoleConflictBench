He\u2019d been withdrawn lately, and as his grandfather, I felt the weight of responsibility to reach out, to offer the wisdom and comfort that only years can bring. I wanted to sit beside him, listen to his troubles, and help him find his way. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the letter from the doctor, the one that said my health was failing, that if I ever wished to perform Hajj, it must be now or never. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a pillar of my faith, and I have waited my whole life for this chance. But if I leave, I\u2019ll be gone for weeks, right when my grandson needs me most. The expectations of my faith and my family pull at me from opposite sides, and I feel torn, my heart heavy with the knowledge that I cannot fully be both at once."}
