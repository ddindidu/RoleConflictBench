My stepson\u2019s open class was today, and I knew how much it meant to him that I show up. He\u2019d asked me twice this week if I\u2019d be there, his eyes searching for reassurance. As a step-parent, I wanted to be present, to show him he mattered, to build trust that sometimes still felt fragile. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was Mei, my friend from the temple. She wanted to meet and discuss the recent sermon on compassion and detachment, a topic I\u2019d been struggling with in my own practice. She rarely reached out, and I knew these conversations were important for my spiritual growth. I felt torn\u2014my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full presence. I sat on the edge of my bed, the weight of expectation pressing down, wondering how I could possibly honor both without letting someone down."}
