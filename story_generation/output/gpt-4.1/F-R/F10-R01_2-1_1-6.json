I could already hear Mom\u2019s gentle voice asking about my week, Dad\u2019s quiet chuckle in the background. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved away for my pastoral work. But tonight, the community gathering had run late. I\u2019d just finished sharing a story from scripture, and a few members lingered, eager to talk more about faith and their struggles. As their pastor, I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014to listen, to guide, to be present. Yet, as a daughter, I felt the tug of my parents\u2019 hope for connection, their need to know I hadn\u2019t forgotten them. My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: \u201cReady when you are, sweetheart.\u201d I looked at the faces around me, then at the phone in my hand, my heart caught between two worlds, each asking for a piece of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
