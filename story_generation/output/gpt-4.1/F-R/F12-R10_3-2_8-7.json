My husband\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014he wanted to talk tonight, to finally lay everything out about our finances. He\u2019d asked for honesty, for us to be open, to share every worry and hope. As his wife, I owed him that. But my phone buzzed again: my mother reminding me that the family puja was starting soon, and I needed to be there, dressed in my sari, ready to help with the rituals. It was an important festival, and as a Hindu daughter-in-law, my presence was expected, my participation a sign of respect and devotion. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014toward the living room where my husband waited, and toward the temple room where my family gathered. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded at the same time."}
