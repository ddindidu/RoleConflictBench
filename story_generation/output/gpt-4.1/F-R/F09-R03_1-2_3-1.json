He looked up at me, eyes wide with frustration, and I knew this was one of those moments when I needed to be patient, to teach him perseverance and kindness to himself. As a mother, I wanted to be present, to guide him through these little lessons that would shape his character. But my phone buzzed urgently on the counter\u2014a message from the convent. The sisters were gathering supplies for the family next door, whose house had burned down last night. They needed hands, and as a nun, I was expected to serve, to put the needs of others before my own. My heart pulled in two directions: the quiet, steady work of raising my child, and the immediate, pressing call to help those in crisis. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing on my chest, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
