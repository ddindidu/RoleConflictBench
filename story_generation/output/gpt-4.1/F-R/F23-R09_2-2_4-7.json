I feel the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him how to behave in public. I know I should call him back, set boundaries, show him discipline and care\u2014what a good step-parent is supposed to do. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: I\u2019m scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue in less than an hour. It\u2019s not just any service; I\u2019ve been preparing for weeks, and my community expects me to be there, to honor my commitment and my faith. My heart pounds as I watch my stepson giggle, oblivious to the tension inside me. I want to be the parent he needs, but I also want to be the Jew my community expects. The minutes tick by, and I\u2019m torn, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
