Their eyes were red from crying, and I could feel the weight of their pain pressing into the room. They needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my unwavering presence. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to listen, to reassure them that I was here and that things would be okay. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I could join them for tea and talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last week. They were struggling with some of the teachings and hoped I could help them reflect and find clarity. I felt a tug in my chest.
