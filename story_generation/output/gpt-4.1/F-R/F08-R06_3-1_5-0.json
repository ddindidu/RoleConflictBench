My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, pleading for me to come over\u2014my grandson had gotten into trouble at school, and the family needed me. As a grandmother, I knew my place was with them, offering comfort and guidance, being the steady presence they could rely on. But as a Christian, I was still reeling from what I\u2019d learned: my grandson had lied to cover up his mistake, and now the family was asking me to help smooth things over with the school, maybe even bend the truth a little to protect him.\n\nMy heart ached with love for my family, but my conscience tugged at me, reminding me of the values I\u2019d tried to live by\u2014honesty, integrity, and trust in God\u2019s plan.
