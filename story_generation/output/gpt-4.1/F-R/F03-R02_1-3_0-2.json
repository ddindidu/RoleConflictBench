We miss you.\u201d I knew she and Dad waited for my voice, our weekly ritual of laughter and stories. But this weekend was different. As the priest of our small town, I was expected to lead the most significant religious holiday of the year. The congregation would fill every pew, their eyes on me for guidance, comfort, and tradition. My mind raced with preparations\u2014sermons, prayers, the logistics of the service. Yet, my heart tugged toward home, to the warmth of my parents\u2019 voices, their simple need to hear from their son. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the community\u2019s spiritual needs and my family\u2019s longing for connection. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. My thumb hovered over the call button, the church bells echoing in the distance, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between duty and love."}
