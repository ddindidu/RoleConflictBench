My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you please fold the clothes today? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I know it\u2019s my turn. I want to help, to share the load, to be the partner I promised I\u2019d be. But the clock on the wall reminds me that it\u2019s almost time for my evening puja. The incense, the lamp, the mantras\u2014each step is sacred, each moment a thread in the fabric of my faith. If I skip even one part, I feel a gnawing guilt, as if I\u2019ve let something precious slip away. My heart tugs in two directions: the duty of love and the duty of devotion. I stand in the hallway, hands trembling, torn between the laundry waiting for me in the living room and the altar glowing softly in the other room, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
