Her eyes were red, her voice trembling as she confided in me about a mistake she\u2019d made\u2014one that weighed heavily on her heart. She wanted my advice, not as her pastor, but as her grandmother, someone who\u2019d lived and learned, someone who could offer comfort without judgment. Yet, just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. A message from a member of my congregation, asking if I had a moment to talk. She\u2019d been struggling, too, and often found solace in my spiritual counsel. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter needing the warmth of family wisdom, my parishioner seeking the reassurance of faith. My heart ached, torn between the gentle guidance of a grandmother and the spiritual support of a pastor, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
