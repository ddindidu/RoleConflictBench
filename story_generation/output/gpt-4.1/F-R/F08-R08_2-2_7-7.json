She had just started her new job, and her excitement was infectious. She wanted to call tonight, to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present for these milestones. As a grandmother, I always tried to be there, to keep our family close, to show them they mattered.\n\nBut as I looked at the calendar, my heart tightened. My friends were preparing for Hajj this year, and the savings I had set aside were finally enough. It was the chance I had waited for, a pillar of my faith, a journey I had dreamed of making for so long. The group was meeting tonight to finalize plans, and I needed to confirm my place.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My family expected my presence, my faith called me to fulfill a lifelong obligation. I stared at the phone, my hands trembling, caught between the joy of my granddaughter\u2019s new beginning and the sacred journey that awaited me."}
