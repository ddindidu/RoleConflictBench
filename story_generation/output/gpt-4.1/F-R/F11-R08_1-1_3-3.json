My younger sister wanted a movie marathon, my brother suggested a backyard barbecue, and my mom chimed in with a plan for a family pool day. Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to me, waiting for my input. I loved these moments\u2014just us, laughing and planning, no outside world to worry about. But as soon as the pool was mentioned, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. \n\nAt home, I usually wore comfortable shorts and a t-shirt, but swimming was different. Even with just my family, I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. Modesty wasn\u2019t just for public; it was a part of who I was, something I tried to honor every day. But my siblings expected me to join in, to splash around and relax like everyone else. I could already hear my sister\u2019s disappointed sigh if I hesitated, and I didn\u2019t want to be the reason the plan changed. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, torn, unsure how to be both the sister they wanted and the Muslim I needed to be."}
