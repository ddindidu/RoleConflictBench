My wife had already done her share, and I knew she was hoping I\u2019d finally fold it tonight. I could hear her in the kitchen, the clatter of dishes a reminder that we were supposed to be a team. Just as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed. It was Mark from church\u2014his message urgent, asking if I had a moment to talk. He was facing a decision that could change his life, and he needed my guidance as his pastor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present and helpful at home, and the call to shepherd someone through a spiritual crisis. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and duty wrestling inside me. I stood there, laundry in hand, phone in the other, caught between the needs of my family and the needs of my flock, unsure which to answer first."}
