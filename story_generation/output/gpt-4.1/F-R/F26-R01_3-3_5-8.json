My daughter\u2019s voice trembled over the line, \u201cMom, can you come? The kids are scared, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My heart ached to be there, to hold my grandchildren close and reassure them that everything would be alright. At the same time, my calendar blinked with reminders for the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. The church expected me to guide our leaders through the intricacies of faith, to be present and focused, to answer their questions with wisdom and patience. I could almost hear the anticipation in their voices, the trust they placed in me as their pastor. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my family needed my comfort, my congregation needed my guidance. I stared at the clock, torn between the call of my blood and the call of my calling, feeling the tension twist inside me as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
