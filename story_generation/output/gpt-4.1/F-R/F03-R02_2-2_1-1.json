It\u2019s a ritual as sacred as any prayer, a time to hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice and my father\u2019s quiet laughter. They wait for my call, eager for stories from my week, and I know it means the world to them. But tonight, the main weekly service at the temple has been rescheduled\u2014moved to the same hour as my call. The community expects me to lead; they rely on my presence, my words, my prayers. I can already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to guide them. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cCall home.\u201d My heart aches, torn between the duty to my parents and the responsibility to my community. Both expect my time, my attention, my care. I stare at the phone, the temple bell echoing in the distance, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
