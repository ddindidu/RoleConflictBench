My grandson had been in an accident\u2014nothing fatal, thank God, but serious enough to shake the whole family. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to rush to their side, to hold my daughter, to comfort my grandson, to be the steady presence they needed. I promised I would call back soon, my heart aching with worry.\n\nNo sooner had I hung up than my other phone rang. It was the son of Mrs. Goldstein, a beloved congregant. His mother had just passed away, and he was desperate for me to officiate the funeral. The family needed me, not just as their rabbi, but as a source of comfort and tradition in their grief. The funeral would have to be soon, as is our custom.\n\nI stood in my kitchen, torn between two worlds. My family needed their grandmother. My congregation needed their rabbi. Both expected me to be present, to offer comfort, to lead. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my heart, my time, my presence."}
