I promised them I\u2019d be there, just as I always am, to hear about their day and walk home together. But my desk is covered in notes and books, the beginnings of a sermon swirling in my mind. Shabbat is weeks away, but the congregation expects inspiration, wisdom, something meaningful. I can\u2019t leave it to the last minute; I owe them my best. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d My heart tugs in two directions. I want to be the mother who never disappoints, who listens to every story and holds every hand. But I am also their rabbi, and my community looks to me for guidance and hope. I stare at my half-written notes, then at the clock again, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
