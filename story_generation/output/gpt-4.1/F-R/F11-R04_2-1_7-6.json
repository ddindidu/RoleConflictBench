He was upset again, frustrated that I didn\u2019t understand his choices, and I knew he expected me to listen without judgment, to be the patient, understanding sister he could trust. I wanted to be that for him, to build the respect between us that had sometimes felt fragile. But as I typed a reply, another message popped up\u2014this time from a community member. She\u2019d mentioned at the mosque earlier that she needed advice, and now she was asking if I had time to talk. As the imam, I knew my role was to provide guidance, to be available and supportive, especially when someone reached out. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in on me: my brother needing my empathy, my community needing my counsel. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at the same time. I stared at my phone, torn, unsure which message to answer first, feeling the tension of being pulled in two directions."}
