Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, and I knew how much it meant to everyone that I be there. My siblings expected me to join in the laughter, the games, the traditions that stitched us together as a family. But as I scrolled through my calendar, my heart sank. I had already promised to meet with Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation who had finally gathered the courage to seek help for a struggle she\u2019d kept hidden for years. She needed me to listen, to guide her, to be present in a way only a priest could. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s longing for togetherness, and my calling to serve those in need. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, as I sat in silence, unable to choose which part of myself to let down."}
