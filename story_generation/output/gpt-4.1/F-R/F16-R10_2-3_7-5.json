I knew something was wrong, and as a partner, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask, to share my own worries from work in hopes of opening a space for honesty. But my mind kept circling back to what I had witnessed earlier that day\u2014a colleague accepting a bribe, a clear act of corruption that went against everything I believed in as a Hindu. My dharma demanded I act, to stand up for what was right, to not let adharma go unchallenged. Yet, if I brought this up now, would I burden my spouse further, adding my own turmoil to theirs? Or would I be failing in my duty as a spouse by hiding my distress, keeping secrets when we promised openness? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
