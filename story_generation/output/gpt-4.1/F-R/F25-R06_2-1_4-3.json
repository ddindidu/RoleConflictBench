Since moving in, she\u2019s made it clear that honoring family customs is how we show respect and unity. Lately, she\u2019s been especially insistent, reminding me that these moments are what bind us as a new family. But as a Christian, I feel a different pull\u2014Sunday is the day I\u2019m supposed to be at church, worshipping and connecting with my faith community. I know my stepmother expects me at the table, but my heart aches to be in the pews, singing hymns and praying with others who share my beliefs. The pressure builds as I hear her call everyone to breakfast, while my Bible sits unopened on my nightstand. I want to be a good stepchild, to help this family feel whole, but I also want to honor my faith. The two expectations tug at me, and I sit on the edge of my bed, torn between the warmth of family tradition and the quiet call of my church."}
