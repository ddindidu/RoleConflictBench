She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to share, to open up about the exhaustion and the small joys, to be the partner she needed. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque. Someone was waiting, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As an imam, I knew my presence could offer comfort and hope. My wife\u2019s voice softened, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I saw the expectation in her gaze, the silent plea for connection. At the same time, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s trust, the urgency in that message. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and the people who relied on me. I gripped my phone, torn between staying and going, between being a husband and being an imam, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
