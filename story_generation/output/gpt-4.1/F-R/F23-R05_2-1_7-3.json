The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. I knew the family needed me to pick up an extra shift at the store tonight, just to cover groceries and the electric bill. But as I glanced at my calendar, I saw the reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue. I was supposed to teach about the weekly Torah portion, and a few new faces had promised to drop by. As a rabbi, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would be there to guide and inspire, even if the class was optional. But as a step-parent, I saw the anxious look in my wife\u2019s eyes, the way she avoided the stack of bills, and I knew she was counting on me to keep us afloat. My heart twisted, torn between the pulpit and the kitchen table, between the needs of my family and the needs of my congregation. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wondered which part of myself I would have to let down tonight."}
