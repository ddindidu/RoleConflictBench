Sunday was circled in red\u2014both the day of the church service and the day I\u2019d promised to take my son to the store for his Nintendo. He\u2019d been saving his allowance, and I\u2019d promised to cover the rest. He\u2019d been counting down the days, his excitement bubbling over every morning. But the church had also asked me to help with the children\u2019s program this week, and I knew how much my presence mattered, not just for me but for the community. I felt the weight of both promises pressing down on me. As a mother, I wanted to see my son\u2019s face light up, to keep my word and give him something he\u2019d worked so hard for. As a Christian, I felt the pull of my faith, the expectation to be present, to serve, to worship. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
