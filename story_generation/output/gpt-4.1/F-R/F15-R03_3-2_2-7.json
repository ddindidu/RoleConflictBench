My son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal expected me to come in and address the situation. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there for my child, to guide him and show him the right path. But just as I was about to call the school, the phone rang. It was Sister Agnes, telling me that Mrs. Ramirez from the parish was in distress, desperate to meet with me about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to offer comfort and spiritual guidance, to be present for those in need. My heart ached, torn between my child and my calling. Both needed me, both expected me to be fully present, but I could not be in two places at once. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
