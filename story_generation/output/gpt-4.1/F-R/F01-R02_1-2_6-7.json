As a grandfather, my daughter expects me to be present, to share stories and laughter with my grandchildren, especially during our cherished holiday. She called last night, her voice warm but insistent, reminding me how much the children look forward to our time together. Yet, as the parish priest, I am responsible for leading the weekly religious education class, a commitment I made to the children and their parents. The class falls on the same day as the family gathering, and I know how much the parish relies on me. My heart aches as I picture my grandchildren\u2019s hopeful faces and the eager eyes of the parish children. Both expect my presence, my guidance, my love. I sit at my desk, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which promise I must break."}
