My stepmother\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt would mean a lot if you could be there this year.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings mattered, especially since I\u2019d joined the family. They wanted me to be present, to laugh, to belong. But as I scrolled, another message buzzed in\u2014a desperate plea from a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her voice trembling over the phone, asking if I could meet her tonight. She needed guidance, and I was her pastor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to show up, to be a real sibling, to help knit us together. My calling demanded I offer comfort and wisdom, especially when someone\u2019s life might change forever. I sat in my car, keys in hand, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of family and the gravity of my pastoral duty, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
