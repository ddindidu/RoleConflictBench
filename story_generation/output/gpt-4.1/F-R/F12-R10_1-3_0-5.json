He told me about his day\u2014nothing dramatic, just the usual office politics, a snide comment from his boss. I could sense he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the calm in his storm. As I sat beside him, my phone buzzed. A message from a colleague: evidence of a serious fraud at my workplace, implicating someone I knew. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act against injustice, no matter the cost. But my husband\u2019s voice pulled me back\u2014he needed me, now, to be present, to offer warmth and understanding. My mind raced between the urge to act immediately, to report the wrongdoing, and the need to comfort my partner. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
