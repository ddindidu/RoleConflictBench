She says it\u2019s important to keep the family close, and I know he appreciates the effort, even if our conversations are sometimes awkward. Tonight, though, I\u2019m running late. The community potluck at church ran over, and as the pastor, I stayed to chat with everyone. During dessert, someone asked about forgiveness, and I found myself sharing the parable of the prodigal son, weaving in lessons about grace and second chances. The group listened, nodding, and I felt that familiar sense of purpose.\n\nBut as I packed up, my phone buzzed with a text from Mom: \u201cDid you call your stepdad yet?\u201d Guilt twisted in my stomach. I was supposed to be the bridge in our family, the one who kept us connected. But as a pastor, I\u2019m expected to be present for my congregation, to teach and guide, even when it means missing personal obligations. I stared at my phone, torn between the family I promised to nurture and the flock I vowed to lead, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
