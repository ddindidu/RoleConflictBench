Your father always did, and it\u2019s important to keep the tradition alive.\u201d I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for me to step up, to be the bridge between the old and the new in our blended family. I wanted to honor that, to show I belonged, but the weight of expectation pressed heavily on my chest.\n\nJust as I was rehearsing the words I\u2019d need to say, my phone buzzed. A message from a parishioner: \u201cHi, Father. I\u2019ve been struggling lately. Could we talk sometime soon?\u201d I knew what was expected of me as a priest\u2014to be available, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. But the ceremony was tomorrow, and preparations would take all my focus. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people who needed me for different reasons. My heart ached with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
