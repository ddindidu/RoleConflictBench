She wants everyone at the dinner table for the annual ancestor remembrance, a ritual that means a lot to her and my step-siblings. I know how much it matters to them, and I want to show respect, to be a part of this family in the way they hope I will be. But tonight is also the weekly meditation group at the temple, and I am supposed to lead. The group relies on me to guide them in mindfulness, to help them find peace in the present moment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my stepmother\u2019s hopeful eyes, the trust of my meditation group. My heart aches with the fear of disappointing someone, of not being enough for either side. I sit in my room, torn between the pull of family and the call of my spiritual path, unsure which expectation I can bear to let down."}
