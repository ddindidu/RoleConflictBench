I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d Her final study session before the Beit Din was scheduled for 7:00, and I knew how much she depended on me to guide her through these last, crucial hours. At the same time, I could hear my husband\u2019s uneven breathing from the living room. He\u2019d barely spoken all day, lost in the fog of his father\u2019s sudden illness. He needed me\u2014needed my presence, my comfort, my hand in his. I felt the weight of his silent plea, the expectation that I would be his anchor. But Miriam\u2019s journey, her trust in me as her rabbi, pressed just as heavily. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the sacred promise I made to my partner. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, unsure which need I could bear to leave unmet."}
