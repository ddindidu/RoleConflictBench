He looked up at me, eyes pleading for reassurance, and I knew he needed me to stay, to listen, to remind him he was more than his grades. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Maghrib prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even though tonight the group would be small and another qualified worshipper was present. My heart tugged in two directions: the mosque expected my presence and leadership, but my brother needed my comfort and support. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my time and care. I stared at the clock, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
