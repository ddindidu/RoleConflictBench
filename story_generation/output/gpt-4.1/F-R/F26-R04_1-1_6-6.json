They expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to uphold the tradition of togetherness that I had always championed. I felt the warmth of their anticipation, the unspoken hope that I would be the glue holding us close. Yet, just yesterday after prayers, Brother Ahmed lingered, his voice low as he mentioned he needed advice\u2014nothing urgent, just whenever I had a moment. As imam, I knew the weight of such requests; spiritual guidance could not be postponed lightly, and my community looked to me for support, especially during times of reflection and gathering. The demands pressed in from both sides: my family\u2019s longing for my presence, and my community\u2019s quiet reliance on my counsel. I sat in my study, phone in hand, heart torn, wondering how I could possibly be enough for both."}
