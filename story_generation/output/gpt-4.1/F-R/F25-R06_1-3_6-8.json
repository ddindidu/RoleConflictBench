Dad had left for work early, and the house felt heavy with unspoken words. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her step-child, I felt I should ask if she was okay, offer some comfort, maybe even a hug. But our relationship was still new and awkward, and I worried she\u2019d see my concern as prying or insincere. \n\nAt church last Sunday, the pastor spoke about loving others as Jesus did\u2014especially those who might be hard to reach. I remembered his words now, echoing in my mind, urging me to show kindness and compassion. But I hesitated, torn between my role as a step-child, careful not to overstep, and my faith, which called me to act with love. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
