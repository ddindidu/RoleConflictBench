The principal\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind: \u201cYour stepson was involved in a bullying incident. We need you here.\u201d I could picture his anxious face, the way he looks at me for approval, for guidance. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to show up, to be present, to help him learn from his mistakes and support him through the consequences. But just as I reached for the door handle, my phone rang again. It was a member of my congregation, sobbing, desperate for guidance. She was on the verge of a life-altering decision, and she needed her pastor\u2014needed me\u2014to help her find her way. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my family needing me to be a parent, my church needing me to be a shepherd. My heart pounded as I stared at the dashboard, torn between two calls for help, each demanding all of me, each expecting me to be fully present. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the edges of both roles blur and clash inside me."}
