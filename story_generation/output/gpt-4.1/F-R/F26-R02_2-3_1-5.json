She\u2019d barely touched her tea, and I could sense the heaviness in her silence. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to reach out, to offer the comfort of my years, to remind her that storms do pass and that she is never alone. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the church: someone was waiting for me, desperate and broken, needing the priest\u2019s ear and the solace of prayer. My heart twisted. My granddaughter needed her grandmother\u2019s wisdom, but my parishioner needed the priest\u2019s guidance. Both expected me to be present, to listen, to help. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I sat there, caught between the love of family and the call of faith, unsure which path to take first."}
