As the eldest son, I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them. Yet, as the imam of our small mosque, I was also expected to lead the evening prayers. Tonight, the congregation would be small, and Brother Yusuf, a capable worshipper, was more than willing to step in. Still, I felt the weight of my responsibility to the community, the unspoken expectation that I should always be present, always available. My heart pounded as I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I chose the mosque, and the subtle disapproval of the congregation if I chose my family. The two worlds I belonged to seemed to pull me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to let go. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the call of tradition and the call of faith."}
