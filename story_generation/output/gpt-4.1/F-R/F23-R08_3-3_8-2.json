The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a step-parent, I felt the responsibility to keep our family secure, to make sure my partner\u2019s child never felt the instability I once knew. Every dollar mattered, and I needed to work extra hours to make the payment in two months. \n\nBut tonight, the community was gathering for our Quran study circle. As a Muslim, I was expected to recite and reflect on the verses, to show up with understanding and humility. I hadn\u2019t read the assigned passages yet\u2014my mind had been too full of financial worries. I imagined the gentle disappointment in my friends\u2019 eyes if I missed the session, or worse, if I came unprepared. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cStudy circle at 7.\u201d I stared at the clock, torn between the urge to open my Quran and the stack of bills demanding my attention. My heart ached with the pressure of both roles, each pulling me in a different direction, neither willing to let go."}
