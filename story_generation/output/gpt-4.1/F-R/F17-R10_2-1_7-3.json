As their child, I feel this heavy responsibility to be there for them, to listen, to offer comfort, and to not add to their worries. Tonight, as I sat with them at dinner, I could see the exhaustion in their eyes, and I promised myself I\u2019d do whatever I could to make things easier for them.\n\nBut earlier today, at work, I saw a colleague cut in line at the cafeteria, ignoring the quiet order everyone else followed. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with honesty and fairness, even in small matters. My conscience pricked at me, urging me to say something, to gently remind my colleague about fairness. But then I thought about my parents\u2014how they need me to stay out of trouble, to not bring home any more stress or conflict. I felt torn, caught between the urge to uphold my values and the need to protect my parents from any more worry. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, unsure of what to do next."}
