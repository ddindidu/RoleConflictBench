Today was the open class at my daughter\u2019s school, and she had been practicing her lines for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mama?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her eyes shining with hope. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I prepared breakfast, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday sermon at the mosque. I am the imam, and the community expects me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them, especially on days like this. \n\nThis week, though, we have a guest speaker who has prepared a sermon and can step in if needed. Still, I know some congregants look forward to hearing me, and I feel the weight of their expectations. My daughter\u2019s face flashes in my mind, her excitement and need for reassurance. My heart aches as I picture the congregation, waiting for me to lead them. I stand in the kitchen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
