Dad barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window. I felt the weight of their exhaustion, the silent plea for comfort that hung in the air. As their child, I wanted to sit beside them, listen, and offer the warmth I knew they needed. But that evening, at the community center, I was Pastor. People gathered around, waiting for guidance, and I found myself sharing the story of Job\u2014how faith can endure through suffering. I saw my parents in the crowd, their faces drawn, and I wondered if my words were enough. Was I offering them the support they needed as their child, or was I hiding behind my role as pastor, teaching principles when what they needed was simply their son? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, unsure which part of me should speak, and which should simply listen."}
