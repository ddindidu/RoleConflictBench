It was the one hour each week I set aside to nurture my Buddhist practice, to sit in stillness and reconnect with myself. Just as I was about to leave, my husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. He mentioned, almost offhandedly, that work had been a bit rough\u2014nothing major, just a string of small frustrations. I could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he lingered in the doorway, hoping for comfort. As his wife, I knew he expected me to listen, to offer a warm hug and a gentle word, to be present for him. But the clock ticked on, and my mind tugged me toward the quiet sanctuary waiting for me. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the urge to support him and the longing to honor my commitment to mindfulness. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence in a different way, and I stood there, caught in the silent struggle of choosing which part of myself to honor."}
