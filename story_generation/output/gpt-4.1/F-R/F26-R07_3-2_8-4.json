My grandson is struggling, and the family is in turmoil. As a grandparent, I feel the pull to be present, to offer comfort, to call again and again, making sure everyone knows I am here for them. Yet, today is also the weekly group meditation at the temple\u2014a sacred hour I have never missed, a time to cultivate mindfulness and peace, not just for myself but for all beings. The phone buzzes with messages from my family, each one a thread tugging at my heart, urging me to respond, to be the steady presence they expect. At the same time, my Buddhist practice calls for stillness, for letting go of attachments, for being present in the moment. My mind races, torn between the urge to reach out and the need to retreat inward. I sit in silence, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, uncertain which path to follow."}
