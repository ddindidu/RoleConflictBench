Our family has always honored tradition, and as the eldest son, it was my turn to step forward. But as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mosque committee had finalized the special Friday gathering, and people from neighboring towns were coming to hear my sermon. As imam, I was expected to guide the community, especially on such a meaningful day. My father\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urging me to never let family down, while the weight of my congregation\u2019s trust pressed on my shoulders. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions\u2014my family\u2019s legacy on one side, my duty to my community on the other. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly be in both places at once."}
