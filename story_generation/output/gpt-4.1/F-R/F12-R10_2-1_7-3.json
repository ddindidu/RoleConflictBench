He looked tired, distracted. As a wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was wrong, and share my own worries too. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no secrets. But my mind kept drifting back to what happened at work today. I saw a colleague cut in line at the cafeteria, taking advantage of someone\u2019s kindness. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in little moments. I felt I should have spoken up, but I hesitated, afraid of causing a scene. Now, as I sat with my husband, I wanted to tell him about it, to unburden myself. But I worried he\u2019d think I was making too much of it, or worse, that I wasn\u2019t living up to my own values. The expectations of being a good wife and a good Hindu pressed in on me, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to listen to first."}
