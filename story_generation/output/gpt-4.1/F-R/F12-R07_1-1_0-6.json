He mentioned, almost in passing, that work had been a little rough\u2014nothing major, just a few things piling up. I could hear the fatigue in his words, the subtle way he lingered in the doorway, waiting for me to ask more, to offer comfort. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Anong, my friend from the temple. She was eager to talk about the sermon we\u2019d both heard last night, about impermanence and letting go. I\u2019d promised her we\u2019d reflect together, and I knew how much these conversations meant to both of us, how they deepened my own practice. My heart tugged in two directions: toward my husband, who needed gentle reassurance, and toward my spiritual path, which called for mindful attention and presence. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, the urge to be a good wife and a devoted Buddhist, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
