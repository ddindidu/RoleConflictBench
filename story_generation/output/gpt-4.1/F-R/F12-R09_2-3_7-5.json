He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I knew something was weighing on him. As his wife, I wanted to reach across the table, take his hand, and ask him to share what was on his mind, just as we always promised to do. But as the first course arrived, my heart sank. The food looked delicious, but there was no kosher certification, and I couldn\u2019t be sure how it was prepared. My stomach tightened with anxiety. If I refused the meal, I risked drawing attention and making David uncomfortable in front of his colleagues. If I ate, I\u2019d be betraying my commitment to kashrut, a core part of my Jewish identity. I glanced at David, who caught my eye, his expression softening. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, to listen and comfort him, but the plate in front of me felt like a wall between my two worlds. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my marriage and my faith, unsure which voice to follow."}
