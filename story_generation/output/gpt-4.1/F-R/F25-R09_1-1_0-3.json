My stepmom just texted, \u201cMovie night in the living room! I made your favorite\u2014pepperoni pizza. Come down soon!\u201d I know she means well, trying to include me, making an effort to connect. As her step-child, I\u2019m supposed to show appreciation, join in, and keep the lines of communication open. I haven\u2019t checked in much this week, and I can feel the distance growing. \n\nBut as I walk toward the kitchen, the smell of the pizza hits me. I glance at the pantry, where my kosher snacks are lined up, untouched. I promised myself I\u2019d stick to kosher, even if it meant skipping out on family meals sometimes. My dad always says, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in touch with your roots.\u201d But my stepmom\u2019s eyes light up when I join her, and I know she\u2019s trying to make me feel at home. \n\nI stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of her invitation and the quiet pull of my own beliefs, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
