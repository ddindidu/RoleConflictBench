He was determined to try a new skateboard trick, and I could already imagine the scrapes and bruises if things went wrong. As his sibling, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014shouldn\u2019t I be there, ready to catch him if he fell, or at least talk him out of it? But just as he rolled his board to the edge, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my daily ten-minute meditation. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019d promised myself to honor this quiet window, to sit in stillness and cultivate mindfulness, no matter what. The two roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding I stay present for my brother\u2019s safety, the other urging me to retreat into silence and self-awareness. My heart pounded with worry and guilt, torn between the urge to protect and the need to practice. I stood frozen, the sounds of the skatepark and the call to inner peace clashing inside me, unsure which path to follow."}
