She slouched, elbows on the table, and I gently reminded her, \u201cSit up, please. Remember what we talked about.\u201d As a parent, I felt the weight of shaping her into a kind, respectful person. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The main weekly service at the church would begin soon, and as the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and offer guidance to my congregation. They relied on me for spiritual support, especially on this day. My daughter looked up, eyes searching mine for approval and patience. I could hear the church bells in the distance, a reminder of my other calling. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me\u2014my child needing my presence and teaching, my community awaiting my leadership. I stood in the kitchen, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that both needed me, unsure which path to take."}
