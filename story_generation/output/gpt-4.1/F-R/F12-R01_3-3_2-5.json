He needed me\u2014needed my arms around him, my words to anchor him as he tried to make sense of the storm inside. I reached for his hand, but the phone buzzed again. This time, it was the church deacon. The Johnson family had lost their home in the flood, and the congregation was gathering for emergency prayer and support. My heart twisted. My husband\u2019s grip tightened, silent plea in his touch, but the voices of my congregation echoed in my mind, expecting their pastor to lead, to comfort, to be present. I felt split in two, torn between the man I loved and the people who looked to me for hope. My chest ached with guilt and helplessness, knowing that wherever I turned, someone would feel abandoned. I closed my eyes, the weight of both worlds pressing in, and tried to steady my breath, caught in the impossible space between wife and pastor."}
