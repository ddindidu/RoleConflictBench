Riya has something special to share with everyone.\u201d As a grandparent, I know how much these moments mean\u2014being present, listening, and celebrating with my family. I could already picture Riya\u2019s eager face, waiting for my reaction. But as the sun dipped lower, I felt the familiar tug of my other role. As a Hindu, I am expected to perform my daily rituals at dusk\u2014lighting the lamp, offering prayers, and chanting mantras. Lately, I\u2019ve only managed to quietly repeat a short mantra during the day, telling myself it\u2019s enough. But tonight, with everyone gathered, I know there will be laughter, stories, and little privacy. The thought of skipping my full ritual again fills me with guilt, yet missing Riya\u2019s moment feels unthinkable. My heart aches, caught between the warmth of my family and the quiet pull of my faith, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
