She was facing a tough decision at work, and she needed me\u2014her husband\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to help her find clarity. I reached for her hand, ready to offer the comfort she sought. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of our congregation. He was in crisis, his family on the brink, and he needed his pastor\u2014me\u2014to call him back immediately, to be a source of strength and wisdom. My wife\u2019s eyes searched mine, silently pleading for my attention, while my sense of duty as a pastor pulled me toward Mark\u2019s urgent need. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my heart torn between the woman I love and the flock I am called to shepherd. I sat frozen, the phone in my hand, feeling the impossible tension of being needed in two places at once."}
