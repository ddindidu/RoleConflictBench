She wanted me there, front row, cheering her on. As a parent, I knew how much it meant to her, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave for the school, my phone buzzed again. It was Brother Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque, who had been struggling lately. He\u2019d mentioned after Fajr prayer that he needed to talk, \u201cwhenever you have time, Imam.\u201d Today, he called, his voice quiet but urgent, asking if I could meet him this morning. As an imam, I felt the weight of his trust and the community\u2019s expectation that I would be there for anyone in need.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between my daughter\u2019s hopeful anticipation and Brother Ahmed\u2019s quiet plea. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
