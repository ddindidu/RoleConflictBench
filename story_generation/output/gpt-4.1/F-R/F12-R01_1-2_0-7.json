The sermon for Sunday pressed on my mind\u2014I needed to find the right words to guide my congregation, to help them navigate the moral choices they faced every day. I was deep in thought, searching for a passage that would resonate, when my husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. He mentioned, almost offhand, that work had been stressful\u2014nothing major, just a tough meeting and a few deadlines. I nodded, half-listening, my mind still tangled in scripture and sermon outlines. But then I caught the look in his eyes, the quiet hope for comfort, for a listening ear. I felt the pull\u2014my role as his wife, to be present, to offer warmth and understanding. Yet the weight of my pastoral duty pressed just as hard, the expectation that I would be prepared, insightful, ready to lead. I sat there, torn, the demands of both roles heavy on my shoulders, unsure which voice to answer first."}
