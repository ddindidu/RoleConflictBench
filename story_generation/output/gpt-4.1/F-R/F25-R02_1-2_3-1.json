The scent of her special roast filled the air, and laughter echoed from the kitchen. She caught my eye and smiled, reminding me how important it was to be present, to honor the traditions that made us a family. I knew how much it meant to her, especially since I was still learning to fit into this patchwork of relatives and rituals.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service at church was about to begin. As a priest, my congregation expected me to lead them in prayer, to be a steady presence in their spiritual lives. Missing the service would let them down, and I could already imagine the disappointment in their faces.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My stepmother\u2019s hopeful glance, the congregation\u2019s trust\u2014both pulling me in opposite directions. I closed my eyes, heart pounding, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
