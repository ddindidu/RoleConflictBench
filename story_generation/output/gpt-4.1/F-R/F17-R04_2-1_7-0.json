My father barely touched his tea, lost in thought. I wanted to stay, to offer comfort, to be the child they needed\u2014someone to listen, to help lighten their burdens, even if only with my presence. But the clock ticked closer to prayer time. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, to be a source of spiritual strength and stability. Tonight, the mosque would be quiet, just a handful of worshippers, and I knew Brother Ahmed was more than capable of leading in my place. Still, the role weighed on me; people looked to me for guidance, and I feared letting them down. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my parents, who needed their son, and toward my community, who expected their imam. I stood in the hallway, torn, the call to prayer echoing softly from my phone, unsure which door I should walk through."}
