The shopkeeper\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a parent pressing down. I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline, but shame and disappointment tangled in my chest. I wanted to show him compassion, to explain why stealing was wrong, but I also knew I had to be firm.\n\nAt the same time, my mind drifted to my own shortcomings. As a Muslim, I was expected to perform Hajj, to fulfill this pillar of my faith. Yet, here I was, still early in my career, barely making ends meet, unable to save enough for the journey. I felt like I was failing in both roles\u2014unable to provide the spiritual example I wanted for my child, unable to meet the expectations of my faith. The pressure to be a good parent and a good Muslim pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, heart pounding, unsure of what to do next."}
