He was determined to land a new trick, but I could see the risk in every jagged edge. As his stepbrother, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if he got hurt, I\u2019d never forgive myself for not stopping him. But my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was sick, and everyone was waiting for me to lead the prayer. The time was tight; if I left now, I\u2019d make it just in time. If I stayed, I could watch over my brother, maybe talk him out of it, or at least be there if something went wrong. My heart pounded as I looked from my brother, poised at the top of the ramp, to the clock ticking down to prayer time. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, and my guidance. I stood frozen, torn between the call of family and the call of faith, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
