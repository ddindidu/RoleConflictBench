As a parent, I knew my children depended on me to keep the lights on, to put food on the table. The envelope from the school reminded me that tuition was due soon, and the fridge was nearly empty. I had planned to take on a few extra hours at the bakery today, hoping the overtime would help us get by this month.\n\nBut as a nun, my heart was pulled in another direction. Sister Agnes had fallen ill, and the convent was holding a special healing service for her this afternoon. The Mother Superior had asked all of us to attend, to pray together for Sister Agnes\u2019s recovery. It was outside our usual schedule, but the expectation was clear: my presence was needed, my prayers were needed.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My children\u2019s needs tugged at my conscience, while my vows and the suffering of my fellow sister called to my soul. I closed my eyes, torn between the demands of love and duty, unsure which path to take."}
