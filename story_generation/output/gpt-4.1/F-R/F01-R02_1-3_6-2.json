As a grandfather, my children and grandchildren expect me to be present, to share stories, laughter, and the warmth of our tradition. My daughter called last night, her voice hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Dad? The kids miss you.\u201d I could almost hear my youngest grandson\u2019s giggle in the background.\n\nBut as a priest, my congregation looks to me for guidance and comfort, especially on this holy day. The church will be full, the pews crowded with faces seeking solace and inspiration. The bishop reminded me, \u201cYour presence is essential. The community needs you.\u201d\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders. My heart aches at the thought of disappointing my family, yet I know the disappointment my absence would bring to my parishioners. I sit in silence, torn between the laughter of my grandchildren and the prayers of my flock, uncertain which path to follow."}
