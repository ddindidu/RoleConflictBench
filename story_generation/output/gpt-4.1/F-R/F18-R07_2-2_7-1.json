He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, determined to master this new skateboard trick, and he wanted me there to cheer him on. As his older sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if anything happened, I\u2019d never forgive myself. But tonight was also the community memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I\u2019d promised to attend. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to help set up, and to chant with the others for those who had passed. My teacher had reminded me how important it was to support the sangha, especially during rituals that brought comfort to grieving families. I stood at the edge of the ramp, my phone buzzing with reminders from both worlds\u2014my brother\u2019s hopeful grin on one side, the gentle insistence of my Buddhist community on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the safety of my family and the spiritual obligations I\u2019d embraced."}
