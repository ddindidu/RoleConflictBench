As a sibling, I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone\u2014my presence was expected, a sign of unity and love. But my phone buzzed with a message from my friend, her words trembling with hurt. She was being treated unfairly by someone we both knew, and she needed me. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to act with compassion and courage, even if it meant discomfort. My heart pounded as I glanced at my family, their faces glowing with happiness, and then at my phone, where my friend\u2019s pain was so clear. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014should I stay and fulfill my duty as a sibling, or leave to uphold my moral responsibility? The conflict twisted inside me, leaving me torn between loyalty to my family and the call to do what I believed was right."}
