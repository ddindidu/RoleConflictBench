The scent of cinnamon and pine filled the house, and I could almost hear my father humming the old songs we always sang together. As the eldest child, I was expected to lead the prayers, to honor the rituals passed down through generations, to be present\u2014fully present\u2014for my family.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders: the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks planning for the church was tomorrow. As pastor, I was responsible for guiding our community leaders, helping them wrestle with the nuances of faith, and ensuring they left inspired and equipped. The congregation looked to me for wisdom and commitment, especially now, when so many sought deeper understanding.\n\nMy heart twisted as I glanced between the flickering candlelight and the stack of workshop materials on my desk. My family needed me to uphold our traditions, to be the child they remembered. My church needed me to lead, to teach, to be the pastor they trusted. The weight of both expectations pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the silent struggle between two worlds that both claimed my devotion."}
