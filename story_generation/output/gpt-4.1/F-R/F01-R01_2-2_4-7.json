She wanted the whole family to come, to see her on stage for the first time. My daughter looked at me expectantly, hoping I would promise to be there, to make it a special day for all of us. But in the back of my mind, the unfinished sermon for Sunday\u2019s service weighed heavily. The congregation was facing a difficult issue, and I knew they needed guidance, clarity, and comfort. I could almost hear the voices of my parishioners, relying on me to help them navigate their choices. My heart ached as I listened to my family, feeling the pull of their love and the warmth of their hopes. At the same time, I felt the responsibility of my calling, the duty to teach and shepherd my flock. The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my devotion. I sat in silence, torn between the joy of my family and the needs of my congregation, unsure which path to choose."}
