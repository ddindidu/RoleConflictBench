They wanted all of us together, to bond and make memories, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially since I was still the \u201cnew\u201d sibling, expected to join in and show I belonged. But my mind kept drifting back to what happened at work earlier that day. I\u2019d seen a coworker cut in line at the cafeteria, skipping ahead of someone who\u2019d been waiting patiently. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to follow dharma even in little moments. I felt a tug inside me, a responsibility to speak up, but I hesitated, not wanting to cause trouble or seem self-righteous. Now, as my stepfamily called me to help with the trip plans, I felt torn\u2014should I focus on fitting in and being present with them, or should I address the ethical slip I\u2019d witnessed, even if it meant stirring up discomfort at work? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, unsure which path to take."}
