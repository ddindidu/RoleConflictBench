They didn\u2019t seem too upset, but I knew they appreciated it when I offered comfort and a listening ear. As I reached out to hold their hand, my phone buzzed with a message from a close friend. The text described how they were being treated unfairly by a mutual acquaintance, and I could feel my sense of duty as a Hindu stirring within me\u2014the teachings about standing up for dharma, for what is right, echoed in my mind. My partner looked at me expectantly, waiting for my response, while my thoughts raced. I wanted to be present, to provide the emotional support they deserved, but I also felt a powerful urge to intervene for my friend, to uphold the moral principles I valued so deeply. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself torn, heart and mind wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
