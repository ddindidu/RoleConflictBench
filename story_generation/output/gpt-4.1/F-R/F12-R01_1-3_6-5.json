He asked about my day, and I tried to listen, to be present, but my phone kept buzzing with messages from church members. There had been a terrible accident in town, and several families needed immediate support. As a pastor, I knew I should be organizing help, offering prayers, and counseling those in shock. But as a wife, I was supposed to be here, listening, sharing, and communicating openly with the man I loved. I nodded at his words, but my mind raced with plans for the church\u2019s response. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014if I left the table now, I\u2019d be abandoning him, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my congregation in their hour of need. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two worlds that needed me, both expecting me to be fully present, both deserving of my care."}
