My partner sat at the kitchen table, swirling tea, their voice soft as they recounted a frustrating meeting at work. I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way their fingers drummed the mug. I wanted to sit beside them, listen, offer comfort\u2014be the spouse they needed tonight. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was starting in twenty minutes. As the rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide the lesson, to answer questions about Jewish law with patience and warmth. The parents and children counted on me, and I knew how important consistency was for their learning. My partner looked up, searching my face for empathy, maybe for a few minutes of undivided attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the quiet, everyday holiness of being present for the person I love."}
