My stepmom smiled at me, her eyes hopeful, and I felt the familiar tug of wanting to belong, to be present, to show I cared about this new family. Just as I was about to suggest a picnic, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in crisis again, her marriage on the brink, and she needed to talk\u2014tonight, if possible. I glanced at my family, laughter bubbling around me, and then at the message, feeling the weight of my pastoral calling. They needed me here, but Sarah needed me too. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to both worlds at once, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility to guide and comfort someone in pain. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat frozen, caught in the impossible space between them, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
