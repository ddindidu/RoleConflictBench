As her brother, I know how much this means to her, and I want to be there, cheering her on at the celebration dinner she\u2019s planned for tonight. But as the oldest in the family, I\u2019m also the one who\u2019s supposed to teach my younger siblings the blessings for the upcoming Jewish holiday. The holiday is only a few days away, and they still stumble over the words. My parents are counting on me to help pass down our traditions, and I feel the weight of that responsibility. I can see my sister\u2019s hopeful eyes, waiting for me to join her, and I hear my mother\u2019s gentle reminder about the importance of teaching the blessings. My heart twists as I stand between these two worlds\u2014wanting to be the supportive brother my sister needs, and the responsible Jewish role model my family expects."}
