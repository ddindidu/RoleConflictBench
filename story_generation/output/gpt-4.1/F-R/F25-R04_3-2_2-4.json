The community had been looking forward to my sermon on compassion, and I felt the weight of their expectations. As I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother. She wanted to talk\u2014she sounded anxious, and I knew she expected me to reply quickly, to share how I was doing, to reassure her that I was okay. This daily ritual was important to her, a way to bridge the distance between us and maintain the fragile bond we\u2019d built.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. I needed to leave soon, to prepare at the mosque, to greet the early arrivals, to center myself before standing before hundreds. My stepmother\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more insistent, and I could feel her worry through the screen. I wanted to be present for her, to honor the promise I\u2019d made to communicate openly. Yet, the community was counting on me, too. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two worlds that demanded all of me at the same time."}
