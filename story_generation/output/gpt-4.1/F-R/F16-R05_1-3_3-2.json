My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight?\u201d I promised I would, but now, as the sun dips below the horizon, my laptop glows with the blank page of my High Holiday sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014words that will carry them through the year. I feel the weight of their anticipation, the sacredness of the moment, and the responsibility to deliver something meaningful. Yet, the laundry remains, a testament to the life I share at home, the partnership I vowed to nurture. My heart tugs in two directions: toward the quiet, ordinary work of folding clothes with my spouse, and toward the pulpit, where every word will be measured and remembered. I sit, paralyzed, the demands of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
