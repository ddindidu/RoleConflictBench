My parents expected me to join in, to be present, to laugh and bond with everyone. But my mind kept drifting back to what I\u2019d witnessed at work the day before\u2014a manager quietly accepting a bribe, turning a blind eye to someone being unfairly dismissed. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma, to stand up for what is right, even when it\u2019s difficult. The guilt gnawed at me; how could I celebrate with my family, pretending everything was fine, when I knew I should speak up? Yet, if I missed the trip or brought up the issue now, I\u2019d disappoint my family, especially my sister, who had been looking forward to this for months. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family and the call of my conscience, unsure which path I would choose."}
