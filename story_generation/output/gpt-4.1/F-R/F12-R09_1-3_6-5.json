He asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the luncheon at the community center. I wanted to tell him everything\u2014how the conversation with my colleagues had drifted to family, how I\u2019d laughed more than I had in weeks. But the memory of the buffet lingered. The food looked delicious, but none of it was certified kosher. I\u2019d felt a pang of hunger and a sharper pang of guilt as I weighed my options. \n\nNow, as David waited for me to share, I felt the pressure of my two worlds. As his wife, I knew he valued honesty and openness; he always said we should never keep secrets, no matter how small. But as a Jewish woman, I was expected to uphold our traditions, to keep kosher even when it was inconvenient. I could feel the words pressing at my lips, the need to confess and the fear of disappointing him or betraying my faith. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I could bear to break."}
