It\u2019s the one time of year when my children and grandchildren gather, laughter echoing through the house, stories shared over tea. My daughter called this morning, reminding me to wear the new dress she bought for me\u2014a bright, sleeveless gown she thought would make me look \u201cmodern\u201d in the family photos. She sounded so excited, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I feel a deep responsibility to dress modestly, especially in public and around men who aren\u2019t family. This afternoon, my office is hosting a function with colleagues from every department, men and women alike. The invitation says \u201cdress smart, be festive,\u201d and I know my daughter expects me to wear her gift. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore the discomfort that rises in me at the thought of wearing something that doesn\u2019t align with my beliefs.\n\nI stand in front of my closet, the new dress hanging beside my usual long-sleeved abaya. My phone buzzes with a message from my granddaughter, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you, Nana!\u201d My heart aches as I weigh the expectations of my family against my faith, unsure which path to take."}
