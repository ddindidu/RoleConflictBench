Call when you can.\u201d I glance at it, guilt pricking at me. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents in over a week, and I know they worry when I go silent. I promised myself I\u2019d call them today, just to check in, to be a good son. But as I set my phone down, it rings again\u2014this time, it\u2019s the synagogue office. A congregant has passed away, and the family is distraught. They need me to officiate the funeral, to comfort them, to be present as their rabbi. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my parents\u2019 gentle expectation for connection, and my community\u2019s urgent need for guidance and support. My heart aches with the knowledge that, whatever I choose, I will be letting someone down. I stare at my phone, torn, the demands of being a child and a rabbi pulling me in opposite directions."}
