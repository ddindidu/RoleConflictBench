Miss you.\u201d It\u2019s Sunday afternoon, and I know she expects me to call, to share a little about my week, to let her know I\u2019m okay. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents in days, just the occasional text, and guilt tugs at me. But as I start to type a reply, I remember the daily prayer service at the chapel. It\u2019s not mandatory, but the congregation finds comfort in my presence, and I know some of them look forward to these moments all week. I feel the weight of their expectations, the silent hope that I\u2019ll be there to guide them, to offer a sense of peace. My phone buzzes again. I stare at the screen, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet responsibility I feel for my community. My heart aches, caught between the child my parents still need and the priest my congregation expects."}
