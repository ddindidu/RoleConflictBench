Today was the open class at my daughter\u2019s school\u2014she had been practicing her lines for weeks, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Baba?\u201d I promised her I would. But as I sipped my tea, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was also the Friday sermon, and not just any sermon. Our community was celebrating a milestone, and families from neighboring towns had come, eager to hear my words. The committee had emphasized how important my presence was, how much the congregation looked up to me for guidance and inspiration. I could picture the mosque filling up, the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me as their imam. Yet, I could also see my daughter scanning the crowd, searching for me, her face falling if I wasn\u2019t there. My heart twisted, caught between the pull of my duty to my community and the promise I made to my child. The clock ticked on, and I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
