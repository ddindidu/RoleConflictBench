My spouse and I have relatives arriving in a few hours, and every corner must gleam. I\u2019m expected to help\u2014dusting, arranging cushions, chopping vegetables, and making sure the bathroom sparkles. My partner\u2019s eyes meet mine, silently asking for help with the mountain of chores. But as I reach for the mop, I glance at the clock. It\u2019s almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I\u2019m expected to light the lamp, offer flowers, and chant prayers at the altar\u2014an act that centers me, a promise I made to myself and my faith. My hands tremble as I weigh the broom against the incense sticks. If I step away now, I\u2019ll leave my spouse to shoulder the burden alone, risking disappointment or even resentment. But if I skip my ritual, I\u2019ll feel a gnawing guilt, as if I\u2019ve let down something sacred. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the kitchen and the altar, the demands of love and the pull of devotion."}
