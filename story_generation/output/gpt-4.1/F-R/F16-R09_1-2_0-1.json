I see the slump in their shoulders, the way they linger in the kitchen, hoping for a moment of comfort. I want to wrap them in a hug, listen to every detail, and let them know I\u2019m here. But as I glance at the calendar, I\u2019m reminded that the holiday is just days away. The kids are sprawled on the living room floor, their books untouched, and I know they still haven\u2019t learned the blessings. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014my partner needs me, but so do my children, and the weight of passing on our Jewish traditions feels urgent. I stand in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure of being a good spouse and a good Jewish parent, wondering how I can possibly be both at once."}
