It means a lot to your dad.\u201d My heart squeezed. I knew how much these gatherings mattered, how hard my family tried to make me feel included, especially after my father remarried. I could already picture my little stepsister\u2019s hopeful face, the empty chair at the table if I didn\u2019t come.\n\nBut in the quiet of my room at the convent, the bell tolled, reminding me of the special healing service tonight. Sister Agnes was gravely ill, and the Mother Superior had asked all of us to attend, to pray together for her recovery. It wasn\u2019t just a duty\u2014it was a calling, a moment when my presence was needed in the community I had chosen.\n\nI felt torn, pulled by the warmth of my family and the solemn responsibility of my vows. Both sides expected me to be present, to show love and commitment. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I sat on my bed, paralyzed by the weight of choosing between them."}
