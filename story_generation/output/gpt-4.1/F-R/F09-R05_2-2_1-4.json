That was the day of my daughter\u2019s open class at school, the one she\u2019d been talking about for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Ima?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her eyes shining with hope. I promised her I would. But then, as I checked my phone, a reminder popped up: the weekly religious school class I teach at the synagogue was scheduled for the exact same time. I knew how much the children and their parents relied on me to guide them, to share Torah and tradition, to answer their questions. Cancelling would mean letting down a room full of families who counted on me. My daughter\u2019s face flashed in my mind, her excitement, her need for me to be there. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectations of my community and my child pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing I could only choose one."}
