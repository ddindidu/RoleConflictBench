The bills on the counter seem to glare at me, a silent reminder of the overtime shift I promised to take this morning. My phone buzzes with a message from my boss, asking if I can come in early. I feel the familiar knot in my stomach\u2014my family needs the money, and I can\u2019t ignore that. But I also see the small meditation cushion in the corner, waiting for me. I had promised myself ten quiet minutes before the day began, a chance to breathe, to be present, to practice the mindfulness that keeps me grounded as a Buddhist. The house is finally still, the only time I can sit in silence. My mind tugs in two directions: the urgent need to provide, and the deep longing to nurture my inner peace. I stand in the kitchen, torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, unsure which voice to answer first."}
