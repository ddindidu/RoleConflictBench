She had just received news that her job was being cut, and I could hear the panic in every word. As her sibling, I knew she needed me\u2014someone to sit with her, to listen, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart ached to be by her side, to offer comfort the way we always promised we would.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized the church service was about to start. I\u2019d already missed last week, and the pastor had gently reminded me how important it was to be present, not just for worship but for the community that counted on me. I felt the weight of my faith, the expectation to show up, to serve, to be a part of something bigger than myself.\n\nTorn between my sister\u2019s pain and my commitment to my church, I felt my chest tighten. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
