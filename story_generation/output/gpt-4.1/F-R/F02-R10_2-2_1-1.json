The gentle glow of the lamp and the scent of incense fill our small prayer room, and I find peace in these quiet moments, chanting mantras and offering flowers to the deities. But today, my mind is restless. My daughter\u2019s school is holding an open class, and she\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement. She wants me there, sitting in the front row, watching her recite her poem. The open class, however, is scheduled at the same time as my morning rituals. My wife reminds me how important it is for our daughter, and I know she\u2019s right. Yet, skipping my prayers feels wrong, almost like betraying a part of myself and the traditions my parents taught me. I stand in the hallway, torn between the altar and the front door, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which part of myself I must set aside."}
