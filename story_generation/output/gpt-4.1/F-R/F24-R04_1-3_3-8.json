My stepbrother nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for the hiking trip they were planning. I saw the hope in my stepmother\u2019s eyes\u2014she wanted us to bond, to feel like a real family. Just as I was about to answer, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had arrived, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As the imam, I knew my presence was needed, that I was expected to offer comfort and wisdom in moments like this. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s expectant faces to the urgent message on my screen. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding I nurture new family ties, the other calling me to serve those in spiritual crisis. I sat frozen, caught between the warmth of home and the solemn duty waiting at the mosque, unsure which path to take."}
