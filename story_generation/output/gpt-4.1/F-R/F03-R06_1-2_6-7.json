She looked tired, her shoulders slumped, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. As their son, I knew I should ask if everything was okay, offer a listening ear, and be the support my parents needed. But my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a friend from church. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and as a Christian, I felt called to reach out, to show her the love and kindness Jesus taught us to give. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my parents needed me here, but Sarah needed someone too. I could hear my father\u2019s footsteps upstairs, a reminder that I hadn\u2019t checked in with him either. I wanted to be present for my family, but I also wanted to live out my faith and care for others beyond these walls. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
