It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of my siblings, the laughter, the stories, the comfort of being together. But as I glanced at my calendar, my stomach tightened. The Seder fell on the same evening as my weekly religious school class\u2014the one I teach, the one the children and their parents rely on. I could already picture their eager faces, the parents\u2019 trust in me to guide their children in Torah and tradition. My family expected my presence, my laughter, my support. My congregation expected my leadership, my teaching, my commitment. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. How could I choose between my family\u2019s embrace and my community\u2019s faith in me? The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
