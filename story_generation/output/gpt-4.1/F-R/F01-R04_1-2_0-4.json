He\u2019s about to start university, and he asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do I stay true to myself when everything around me is changing?\u201d As a grandfather, I want to give him all the time he needs, to share stories and wisdom, to listen and reassure him. But my phone buzzes with reminders: today is Friday, and I am the only imam scheduled for the khutbah. The community expects me to deliver a sermon I\u2019ve spent days preparing, and they\u2019ve already announced the topic. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my heart aches to be present for Yusuf, to guide him through this turning point, but I know the congregation is counting on me, too. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the quiet needs of my family and the public duty I cannot ignore."}
