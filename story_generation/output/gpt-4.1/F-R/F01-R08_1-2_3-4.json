My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the anchor my family needed. But as I ironed my clothes for the day, my mind drifted to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a formal event, and my colleagues\u2014men and women\u2014would all be there. The invitation had specified a dress code: business casual, which for most meant short sleeves and no head coverings. \n\nAs a Muslim, I knew my faith asked me to dress modestly, to uphold my values even in public spaces. I could already imagine the curious glances, the awkward questions if I showed up in my usual attire. My family expected me to be cheerful and relaxed tonight, but I worried that the stress from the afternoon would linger. I stood in front of my closet, torn between the expectations of my faith and the desire to fit in at work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
