She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, how my day was going, if I\u2019d remembered to take my vitamins. I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my dinner, and a few lines about my day. I always tried to answer right away, to reassure her, to keep that connection strong. But as I typed out a response, I noticed Mrs. Lee sitting alone in the back pew, her shoulders hunched, eyes red. I remembered she\u2019d lost her husband last month, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in on her, offer a listening ear, maybe a prayer. I could see she needed comfort, someone to sit with her, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mom, asking if I was okay. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in. I wanted to be the attentive child my parents needed, but I also felt the pull of my calling, the responsibility to care for my congregation. My fingers hovered over my phone, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which need to answer first."}
