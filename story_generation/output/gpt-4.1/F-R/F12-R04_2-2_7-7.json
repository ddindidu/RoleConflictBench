As his wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was weighing on his mind, and share my own worries from the day. We had always promised to communicate openly, to be each other\u2019s confidant. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Sister Amina, asking if I could meet her tonight. She sounded desperate; her family was falling apart, and as the imam, I was expected to offer guidance, to be present for my community in their darkest moments. My heart pulled in two directions: toward the man I loved, who needed me to listen, and toward the woman who saw me as her spiritual anchor. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, the expectations swirling in my mind, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for them both tonight."}
