The family group chat is already buzzing with plans for the holiday dinner\u2014my daughter wants to know if I\u2019ll bring my famous curry, my grandson asks if I\u2019ll help him with his school project. I know how much these gatherings mean, how my presence weaves the family together. Yet, on the kitchen table, my Buddhist texts are spread open, notes half-written. My teacher has asked me to summarize the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, a rare honor and responsibility. I feel the weight of both worlds: the warmth and laughter of my family, the calm and clarity of my spiritual path. My phone vibrates with another message, while my mind drifts to the Dharma, to the importance of reflection and presence. I want to be fully there for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. My heart aches with the tension, unsure which call to answer first."}
