My grandson was finally going to share his college acceptance news with the whole family tonight, and everyone was expected to be there. I could already picture his proud, nervous smile, the way he\u2019d look for my reaction first. But tonight was also Thursday, and I always attend the evening minyan at synagogue. It\u2019s not a holiday, and the minyan will likely have enough people without me, but I know how much my presence matters to the regulars, and to myself. I\u2019ve always believed in showing up, in being counted, in honoring my faith and community. Yet, my family expects me to be present for these milestones, to be the grandparent who never misses a moment. My heart aches as I imagine disappointing either side\u2014missing my grandson\u2019s big moment or letting down my synagogue friends. I stare at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I can bear to set aside."}
