My mom called from the dining room, reminding me that everyone was waiting for me to join the family dinner. My younger brother, bouncing with excitement, wanted me to help set the table and share stories like we always did. But upstairs, my son sat hunched over his Torah portion, frustration etched on his face. His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew words. As his parent and as a Jew, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide him, to make sure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them. Yet, as a sibling, I knew how much my family cherished these dinners, how much my brother looked forward to my presence. The laughter and warmth of the gathering called to me, but so did the quiet urgency of my son\u2019s struggle. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my time, my care, my presence. I stood at the bottom of the stairs, torn, unsure which expectation to answer first."}
