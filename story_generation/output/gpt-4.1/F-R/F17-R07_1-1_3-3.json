My family was bustling around, preparing for our annual holiday dinner. The smell of my grandmother\u2019s special soup filled the house, and I could hear my cousins laughing as they set the table. I knew I was expected to help, to be present, to honor our family\u2019s traditions by joining in the preparations and sharing stories. But I had promised myself I would take ten minutes for meditation, to practice mindfulness as my Buddhist teacher had encouraged. The quiet window I\u2019d carved out was now, but my mother\u2019s voice called from the hallway, asking for help with the plates. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth and belonging of my family, and the calm, centered space I found in meditation. I felt guilty for wanting to step away, but also uneasy about breaking my commitment to my practice. I sat there, torn, listening to the sounds of family and the silence I craved, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
