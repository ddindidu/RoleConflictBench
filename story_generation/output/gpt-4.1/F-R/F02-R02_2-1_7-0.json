The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. My son needed new shoes, and the fridge was nearly empty. As a father, I felt the weight of providing, of making sure my family never went without. Just as I was about to call a friend about a short-term job, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the church was in an hour. As the priest, the community expected me to be there, to lead them in faith, even if today\u2019s service was optional. I knew some parishioners found comfort in these moments, especially those who came every day. My heart twisted. If I skipped the service, I could take the job and bring home much-needed money. But if I did, I\u2019d be letting down my congregation, breaking a trust I\u2019d worked years to build. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the needs of my family and the call of my faith."}
