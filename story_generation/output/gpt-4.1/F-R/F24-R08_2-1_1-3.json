I knew something was wrong, and as her step-sibling, I felt the urge to comfort her, to sit close and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. She curled up on the couch, hugging her knees, and I wanted to wrap my arm around her, just like we used to before things got complicated. But I hesitated, glancing down at my loose t-shirt and pajama shorts\u2014comfortable, but not exactly modest by Islamic standards, even at home. My mom always reminded me that modesty wasn\u2019t just for outside, and I felt her words echoing in my mind. I wanted to be there for my stepsister, to show her I cared, but I also didn\u2019t want to compromise my beliefs. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I stood frozen in the hallway, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself to listen to."}
