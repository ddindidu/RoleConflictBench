The numbers on the page didn\u2019t add up, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a step-parent pressing down on me. I needed to find a way to cover groceries and rent this month, maybe by picking up an extra shift at work tonight. But tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses. As a Muslim, I was expected to recite and reflect, to show up prepared and engaged. My friends would notice if I missed another session, and I longed for the peace those evenings brought me. Yet, the thought of leaving my family\u2019s needs unmet gnawed at me. I stared at the clock, torn between the urgent demands of my family and the spiritual nourishment I craved, feeling the tension twist inside me as the evening crept closer."}
