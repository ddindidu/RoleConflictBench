She\u2019d come to me, eyes downcast, voice barely above a whisper, confiding that she\u2019d been overlooked for a part in the school play. My heart ached to comfort her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years\u2014how setbacks can be stepping stones, how self-worth isn\u2019t measured by applause. As I reached for her hand, a commotion caught my attention. At the ice cream stand, a man slipped ahead of a waiting mother and child. My Hindu upbringing tugged at me, reminding me of dharma\u2014my duty to uphold fairness and speak against wrongs, even small ones. But my granddaughter\u2019s need for comfort pressed on me just as strongly. Should I leave her side to address the injustice, or stay and offer the guidance she sought? The weight of both roles pressed on my chest, each demanding something different, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds I belonged to."}
