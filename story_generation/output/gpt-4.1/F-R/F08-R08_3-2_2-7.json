She needed me\u2014she needed advice, comfort, and the kind of guidance only a grandmother could give. She poured out her worries about her future, about choices she was afraid to make alone. I listened, heart aching, knowing she trusted me to help her find her way. But as she spoke, my mind drifted to the envelope tucked away in my drawer\u2014the savings I had carefully set aside for Hajj. This year, my friends were finally going, and they hoped I would join them. It was a dream I had carried for decades, a pillar of my faith, a duty I longed to fulfill. Yet, my granddaughter\u2019s need was urgent, her pain real. I felt torn between the sacred journey I owed to Allah and the immediate, tangible help I could offer my family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat in silence, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which path to follow."}
