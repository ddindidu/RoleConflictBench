Mom wanted everyone together for the holiday, insisting it was important for us to make memories as a family. I knew how much it meant to her, and as a sister, I felt the pull to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be part of the warmth that only family can create. But as I glanced across the room at my son, hunched over his Torah portion, frustration etched on his face, another responsibility weighed on me. His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he was struggling. As a Jewish mother, I felt it was my duty to guide him, to help him understand not just the words, but the meaning behind them, to pass on the traditions and values that shaped me. The thought of leaving him to prepare alone filled me with guilt. Torn between being the sister my family expected and the Jewish parent my son needed, I felt the tension knotting in my chest, unsure which role to honor first."}
