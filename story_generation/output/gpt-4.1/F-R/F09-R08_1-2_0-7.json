They reminded me that our savings were finally enough, that this was the season we had all dreamed of. My heart ached with longing; performing Hajj was not just a wish, but a duty, a pillar of my faith I had waited years to fulfill. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered my children\u2019s school was letting out soon. Today was their last day, and they had begged me to be there, to pick them up and celebrate together. I could picture their faces searching the crowd, hoping to see me. The thought of missing this milestone in their lives tugged at me, just as the call to fulfill my religious obligation pulled from the other side. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. My hands trembled as I reached for my keys, my mind swirling with guilt and longing, caught between the expectations of motherhood and the call of my faith."}
