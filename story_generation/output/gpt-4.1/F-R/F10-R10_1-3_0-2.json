It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what they expect\u2014my mother always says, \u201cJust a message, beta, so we don\u2019t worry.\u201d But lately, my weekends have become sacred in a different way. As a practicing Hindu, I\u2019ve committed myself to a strict schedule of daily rituals\u2014morning prayers, chanting, and offerings that take up hours. I feel peace in the rhythm of incense and mantras, but the time slips away. My phone buzzes with my mother\u2019s gentle reminders, and guilt creeps in. I know she worries if I don\u2019t reply, but if I pause my rituals, I feel I\u2019m failing my faith. The pressure builds inside me, torn between the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices and the spiritual discipline I\u2019ve promised myself. I stare at my phone, the incense curling in the air, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
