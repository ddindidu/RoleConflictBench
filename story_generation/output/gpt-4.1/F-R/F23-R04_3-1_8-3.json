As a step-parent, I knew my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure the roof over our heads stayed ours. My partner\u2019s anxious glances and my stepdaughter\u2019s hopeful chatter about her school trip only deepened my sense of responsibility. Yet, as Friday approached, another duty loomed. The congregation expected me, their imam, to deliver the Khutbah\u2014my words guiding their week, my presence a source of comfort. This week, though, a guest speaker was ready, his sermon prepared, his offer to step in sincere. If I let him take the pulpit, I could use the time to meet with a potential client, a chance to secure extra income for the loan. But would my absence disappoint the community? Would my family understand if I chose the mosque over our financial needs? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, heart pounding, unable to see a way to satisfy both worlds."}
