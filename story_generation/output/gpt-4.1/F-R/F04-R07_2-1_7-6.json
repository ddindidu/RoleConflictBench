As her brother, I knew she needed me to listen, to be patient and understanding, to help her feel respected even when we disagreed. I set aside my book and tried to focus on her words, nodding and offering comfort. But my phone buzzed\u2014my Buddhist friend, eager to discuss the profound sermon we\u2019d both attended that morning, was waiting for our scheduled call. I\u2019d promised to engage deeply, to reflect and share insights as part of my spiritual practice. The weight of both expectations pressed on me: my sister\u2019s need for my undivided attention, and my commitment to spiritual growth with my friend. My mind raced, torn between being the supportive brother she deserved and honoring my path as a Buddhist.
