As a Hindu, I had looked forward to this day for months\u2014the temple\u2019s annual festival, a time to immerse myself in prayers, rituals, and the vibrant community.

It\u2019s serious.\u201d My grandchild was unwell, and my family needed me now more than ever. The expectation to be the steady, loving grandparent, to comfort and support, pressed heavily on me.
