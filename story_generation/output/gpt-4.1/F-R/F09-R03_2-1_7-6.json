My children\u2019s laughter drifts in from the next room, a reminder of the groceries I still need to buy and the rent that\u2019s due next week. As a mother, I know I should be searching for extra work, maybe picking up a shift at the parish office or tutoring after school. The family needs money, and I am the one they look to for stability.\n\nYet, as a nun, this afternoon was meant for spiritual study\u2014a rare, precious time set aside for quiet reflection and prayer. My heart aches for the silence of the chapel, the comfort of scripture, the peace I find in God\u2019s presence. But the weight of my family\u2019s needs presses down on me, pulling me away from the sanctuary I crave. I close my eyes, torn between the demands of my children and the vows I have made, feeling the tension coil tighter within me as I try to decide which call to answer."}
