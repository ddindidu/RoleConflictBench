Today was the open class at Lily\u2019s school\u2014the first one since I became her stepmother. She had left a note on my pillow last night, her handwriting hopeful: \u201cI hope you can come, it would mean a lot.\u201d I knew how much she needed to see me there, to feel that I was truly part of her life, not just a visitor in her home.\n\nBut as I reached for my habit, Sister Maria burst into my room, her face pale. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down last night. They have nothing. Mother Superior wants us to gather food and clothes, immediately.\u201d The urgency in her voice was unmistakable. As a nun, I was expected to put the needs of the suffering first, to be present for those in crisis, to serve without hesitation.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between my two worlds. Lily\u2019s hopeful eyes haunted me, but so did the image of the Johnsons, shivering and lost. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, my compassion, my love."}
