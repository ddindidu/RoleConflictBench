I knew I had to be there, to show him right from wrong, to support and guide him as a father should. \n\nBut just as I was about to step out, my phone rang again. It was David from the synagogue. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan. There\u2019s a funeral prayer, and the family is waiting.\u201d I could hear the urgency in his voice. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help complete the minyan, especially for a grieving family. It was a mitzvah, a sacred duty.\n\nI stared at the school doors, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My son needed me. My community needed me.
