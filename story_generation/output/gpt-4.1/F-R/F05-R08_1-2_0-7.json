She didn\u2019t seem upset, but I could sense the fatigue behind her words. I knew she expected me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. I wanted to be that husband, the one who could ease her worries with a gentle word or a warm embrace. But my mind kept drifting to the envelope tucked away in our drawer\u2014the savings we\u2019d set aside for Hajj. This year, my friends were finally going, and they\u2019d been urging me to join them. As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj felt stronger than ever, a duty I\u2019d longed to fulfill. Yet, I wondered if now was the right time, with my wife needing me here, with our life together still settling. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I listened to her, but inside, I was torn, unsure which path to take."}
