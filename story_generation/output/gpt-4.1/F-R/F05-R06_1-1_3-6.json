She\u2019s been working late all week, and I know she expects me to help out more at home. As a husband, I want to share the load, to show her I care in practical ways. But just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from a neighbor who\u2019s been struggling, asking if I have a moment to talk. As a Christian, I believe in showing love and kindness, especially when someone reaches out in need. I feel torn, caught between folding laundry to support my wife and stepping out to offer comfort to my neighbor. My heart aches with the pressure of both roles, each demanding my time and compassion. I stand in the living room, laundry in one hand, phone in the other, wrestling with the impossible choice between being a good husband and living out my faith."}
