Call me when you\u2019re free.\u201d It\u2019s Saturday, and I know she expects me to check in, to share the little details of my week. I type a quick reply, promising to call after my office function this afternoon. As I set my phone down, my mind shifts to the event. It\u2019s a semi-formal gathering, and my colleagues have been talking about what they\u2019ll wear\u2014dresses, skirts, bright colors. I feel the familiar tug of anxiety. As a Muslim, I\u2019m committed to dressing modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing a loose scarf. I want to fit in, to not draw attention, but I also want to honor my faith. My mother would want to hear about my day, to know I\u2019m comfortable and happy, but I can\u2019t tell her how nervous I am about standing out. I stare at my closet, torn between a long, loose dress and the more fitted outfit my friends suggested. My phone buzzes again\u2014my mother, checking in. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation to meet."}
