We had just started a serious conversation about our finances\u2014something that needed honesty and openness. As his wife, I felt the weight of his expectation: to share everything, to be transparent, to let him in on my worries and fears. But as we prepared to enter the main prayer hall for Friday prayers, I realized I had forgotten my long-sleeved abaya in my rush to leave the house. My scarf covered my hair, but my arms were bare, and I knew it wasn\u2019t modest enough for the prayer hall.\n\nHe looked at me, waiting for me to continue our conversation, but I could see his eyes flicker to my uncovered arms. I felt torn\u2014should I be the open, honest wife he needed right now, or the modest Muslim woman my faith required me to be in this sacred space? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to honor first."}
