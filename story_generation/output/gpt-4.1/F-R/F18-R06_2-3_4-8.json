Mom had been planning it for weeks, and as the oldest sibling, I knew how much it meant to her that we\u2019d all be together. I could already picture my little brother\u2019s jokes, the laughter, the warmth of being home. But just as I was about to leave, I got a call from a friend\u2014someone I knew from church, someone who\u2019d been struggling lately. She was in tears, her voice trembling as she asked if I could come over. She needed someone to talk to, someone to just sit with her and remind her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nMy heart twisted. As a Christian, I felt the weight of Jesus\u2019 teachings\u2014love your neighbor, be there for those in need. But as a sibling, I was expected to show up, to be present for my family. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own demands, and I felt torn in two. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the sibling my family needed and the Christian my faith called me to be."}
