It was rare for all of us to be together, and I felt the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being just a sibling for a while. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: a congregant\u2019s family, grief-stricken, asking if I could officiate the funeral service as soon as possible. My heart tightened. As a rabbi, I knew how much it meant to them to have me there, to guide them through their loss. But as a sibling, I saw my family\u2019s hopeful faces, eager for my presence after so many missed gatherings. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s longing for togetherness, my congregation\u2019s need for support. I felt torn, caught between the sacred duty I owed my community and the simple, irreplaceable moments my family craved. My mind raced, emotions tangled, as I sat in silence, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
