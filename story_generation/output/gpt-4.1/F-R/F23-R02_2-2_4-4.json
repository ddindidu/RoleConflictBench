As his step-parent, I knew I should step in\u2014teach him about respect, boundaries, and discipline, especially in public. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of my other role. In less than fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter at the church. She\u2019d confided in me about her ongoing struggle with addiction, and today was the day she\u2019d finally agreed to seek help. As a priest, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and unwavering in my support. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: do I pause to correct my stepson, risking being late and letting down someone in spiritual crisis? Or do I rush him along, ignoring the teachable moment, so I can fulfill my pastoral duty? The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my family and my congregation, unsure which path to take."}
