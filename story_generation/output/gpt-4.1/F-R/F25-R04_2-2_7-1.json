My stepmother\u2019s hands trembled as she poured tea, and my father barely touched his food. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to offer comfort in the way only family can. But as I reached for my father\u2019s hand, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee: \u201cThe backup imam is still out. Can you lead Maghrib tonight? Everyone is counting on you.\u201d I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. The congregation expected me to be there, to guide them in prayer, to be a pillar of strength and calm. But here, at home, my parents needed me just as much. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on my chest. How could I be the imam my community needed and the son my parents deserved, all at once? I sat frozen, caught between the call of duty and the pull of family, unsure which path to take."}
