I could sense she needed me\u2014her grandmother\u2014to offer comfort, to share a story from my own tangled youth, to remind her that confusion and sadness are part of growing up. I wanted to reach across the table, take her hand, and give her the time she needed. But my phone buzzed insistently. It was the synagogue president: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral, to guide them through their grief, to be their rabbi in this moment of loss. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders. My granddaughter\u2019s silent plea for attention, my congregation\u2019s urgent need for leadership\u2014both were real, both were immediate. My heart ached as I sat between them, torn by love and duty, knowing I could not be fully present for both at once."}
