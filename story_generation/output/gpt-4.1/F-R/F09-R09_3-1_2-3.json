She wrote that Daniel had been caught bullying a classmate, and she wanted to meet with me after school. I felt a wave of shame and worry\u2014what kind of mother lets her child act this way? I knew I had to be there, to show Daniel and the school that I take this seriously, that I care. But as I packed a snack for him to bring, I noticed the bag of cheese crackers he\u2019d begged for at the store last week. They weren\u2019t kosher, but he\u2019d pleaded, and I\u2019d caved, thinking it was a small thing. Now, with the meeting looming, I wondered if I should let him have them, just this once, to comfort him after such a hard day. But the thought of breaking kosher, even for a moment, made my stomach twist. I wanted to be a good mother, to soothe my child, but I also wanted to honor my faith, to keep our home kosher as I promised myself I would. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the crackers in my hand, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
