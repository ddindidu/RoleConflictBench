My mind raced with numbers, calculations, and the weight of ensuring my family\u2019s financial stability pressed heavily on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, her texts growing more desperate, and she asked if I could meet her for coffee to talk. As a pastor, I knew she needed spiritual guidance, a listening ear, and comforting words. But as a father, I felt the urgent need to use every spare moment to find extra work, to plan, to make sure my family wouldn\u2019t falter. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my time and heart. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the pressure mount as I wrestled with what to do next."}
