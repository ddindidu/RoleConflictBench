She\u2019s been offered a promotion at work, but it means relocating\u2014leaving behind friends, family, and the life we\u2019ve built together. She reaches for my hand, her voice trembling as she asks, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I know she needs me here, to listen, to reassure her, to help her sort through the confusion and fear.\n\nBut tonight is also the annual memorial service at the temple. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to attend, to chant with the community, to honor those who have passed. The abbot personally asked me to help lead the ceremony, and I know how important my presence is to the sangha.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s need for comfort tugs at my heart, while my commitment to the Buddhist community and the teachings of compassion and presence call me to the temple. I sit in silence, torn, the clock ticking closer to the time when I must choose where to be."}
