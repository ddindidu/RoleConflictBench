The home loan repayment loomed just two months away, and I knew every shekel counted. My wife\u2019s anxious glances told me she was thinking the same thing: I needed to find extra work, maybe take on a few more tutoring sessions or help with after-school programs. My children\u2019s laughter drifted in from the next room, a reminder of why I worked so hard to keep our home secure.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her final study session before the Beit Din was scheduled for tomorrow evening\u2014the only time she could meet. She was nervous, desperate for reassurance and guidance. As her rabbi, I was expected to be fully present, to teach Torah with patience and care, to help her cross this threshold with confidence.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me to focus on our financial future. My community needed me to guide Miriam at this crucial moment. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved at the same time."}
