I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea that I would finally embrace this custom as my own. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Today was also the convent\u2019s monthly food drive, a day when all the sisters, myself included, were expected to serve at the shelter, offering meals and comfort to those in need. Mother Superior had spoken just yesterday about the importance of our presence, how our absence would be felt by the community. I stood in the kitchen, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the calling of my faith, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, each demanding my loyalty, each certain that I belonged wholly to them."}
