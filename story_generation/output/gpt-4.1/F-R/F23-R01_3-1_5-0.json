A half-eaten candy bar peeked from his pocket. As his step-parent, I knew I was expected to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him so he\u2019d learn honesty and respect. But as a pastor, I was also called to offer compassion, to guide with gentle words and understanding, especially to those who falter. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014should I be stern and enforce consequences, or should I kneel beside him, speak softly, and help him understand forgiveness? The store\u2019s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the manager waited for my response, and my stepson\u2019s small hands trembled. I felt the eyes of the congregation in my mind, expecting wisdom and grace, while at home, my partner expected firmness and boundaries. My heart ached as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between justice and mercy, discipline and comfort, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
