I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the heaviness in his words, and as his sister, I knew I should be there for him, especially since he rarely reached out like this. At the same time, I glanced at my calendar and saw a reminder about the private meeting I\u2019d scheduled with Sister Amina, a congregant who had confided in me about her family\u2019s struggles. She\u2019d asked for guidance, saying she felt lost and needed someone to listen\u2014tonight was the only time she could meet.\n\nAs an imam, I felt the weight of my responsibility to the community, to be present and offer counsel when someone was in distress. But as a sister, I couldn\u2019t ignore my brother\u2019s plea for support. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two people who needed me most, each expecting me to be their anchor. The pressure built inside me, and I felt paralyzed, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
