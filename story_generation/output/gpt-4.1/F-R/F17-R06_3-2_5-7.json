My parents had just asked me to lead the family\u2019s annual ancestral ceremony, a tradition that meant everything to them. They looked at me with hope, expecting me to honor our heritage and show respect to generations past. I knew how important this was\u2014how much it would mean to my grandparents, especially. But as I glanced across the room, I saw my cousin, eyes red and shoulders slumped, quietly withdrawing from everyone. I remembered what I\u2019d learned in church: to love others, to reach out and show kindness, especially when someone is hurting. I wanted to go to her, to comfort her, to be the kind of Christian I believed I should be. But if I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even embarrass them. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling torn between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and following the compassion I felt called to show."}
