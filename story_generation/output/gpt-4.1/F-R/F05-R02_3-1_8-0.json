She wants me to be fully present, to share my worries and hopes, to be her partner in this uncertainty. I know she expects openness, and I want to give her that\u2014she deserves nothing less. But as the clock ticks closer to seven, my phone vibrates with a reminder: the daily prayer service at church. Even though it\u2019s optional, I know the congregation looks to me for guidance and comfort, especially in these anxious times. I feel the weight of their expectations, the silent hope that I will be there to lead them in prayer. My heart aches, torn between the sacred trust of my marriage and the spiritual duty I hold as a priest. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demand my full attention. I look at my wife, then at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside me, unsure which path to take."}
