My wife had asked me to help fold the laundry before I left for Friday prayers, and I\u2019d promised I would. But time slipped away, and now the pile sat untouched on the couch. I glanced at my watch\u2014just minutes before the call to prayer. I quickly changed into my cleanest shirt and trousers, but realized my only available shirt was a bit tight and didn\u2019t quite meet the modesty I strive for as a Muslim. \n\nMy wife\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, her gentle reminder that we share the home and its burdens. At the same time, I felt the weight of my faith, the expectation to present myself modestly and respectfully before God and my community. I hesitated at the door, torn between returning to the laundry and searching for a more appropriate shirt, or rushing out as I was to make it in time for the prayer. My heart pounded, caught between my responsibilities as a husband and my devotion as a Muslim, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
