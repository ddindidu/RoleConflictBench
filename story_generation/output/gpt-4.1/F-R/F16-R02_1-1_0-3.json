They smiled, but I could sense the fatigue behind it. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, their voice light, almost dismissive. I knew that tone\u2014an invitation to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. I wanted to sit down, hold their hand, and let them talk it out, to be the spouse they needed.\n\nJust as I reached for the chair, my phone buzzed. A message from a parishioner: \u201cHi, Father, could we maybe talk sometime soon? Nothing urgent, just feeling a bit lost.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of my collar even in my own home. My mind raced with the responsibility to be available, to offer guidance, to be the priest they expected.\n\nI stood there, torn, the warmth of my partner\u2019s presence on one side and the silent call of my vocation on the other. Both needed me, both trusted me, and I felt the ache of being split in two, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
