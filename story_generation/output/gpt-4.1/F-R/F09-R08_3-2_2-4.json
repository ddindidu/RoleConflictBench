My heart sank as the principal explained that my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss the situation. As a mother, I felt a surge of responsibility and shame, knowing I needed to be there for my child, to guide him and show the school I take this seriously. But today is also the day of an important office function, one I cannot miss, and I know my colleagues expect me to attend. \n\nAs a Muslim, I always dress modestly, covering my hair and wearing loose clothing. At work, I am careful to maintain this, even when others dress differently. The office function, however, is more formal, and my manager hinted that I should \u201cblend in\u201d more, perhaps wear something less traditional. I feel torn\u2014my son needs me, my faith guides me, and my job demands something else. The weight of these expectations presses on my chest as I sit in my car, keys in hand, unsure which direction to drive."}
