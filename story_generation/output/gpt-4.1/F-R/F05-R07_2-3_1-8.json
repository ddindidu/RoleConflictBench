She\u2019s anxious, torn about a decision at work that could change her career. She wants me to listen, to reassure her, to help her find clarity. I reach for her hand, but my mind drifts to the stack of Buddhist texts on the counter. My teacher asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a rare honor, and one I\u2019ve longed for. I know I should be present with my wife, offering her the support she needs, but the words of the sutras echo in my mind, unfinished and demanding my attention. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the loving husband she needs tonight, and the devoted Buddhist I strive to be. My heart aches with the pull of these expectations, each urgent, each worthy, and I sit in the quiet storm of not knowing which part of myself to answer first."}
