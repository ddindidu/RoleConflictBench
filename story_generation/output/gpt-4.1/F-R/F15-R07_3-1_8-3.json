The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. I know I need to make a plan, to ensure my family\u2019s security, to be the responsible parent they expect me to be. My phone buzzes with reminders\u2014school fees, groceries, utilities. My mind races, searching for solutions, for ways to stretch every dollar.\n\nBut then I remember my intention for the day: a quiet ten-minute window for mindfulness and meditation. As a Buddhist, I know how much I need this pause, this space to breathe and let go. Yet, as I glance at the clock, guilt creeps in. How can I sit in silence when there\u2019s so much to do, when every minute could be spent working toward our financial stability? The demands of both roles pull at me, and I feel torn\u2014between the urgent needs of my family and the quiet call of my own spiritual practice. My hands tremble as I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
