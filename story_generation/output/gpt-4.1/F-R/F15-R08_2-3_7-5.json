In my hand, I clutched the uniform from my new job at the local restaurant\u2014a job I desperately needed to keep food on the table for my children. The manager had insisted I wear the short-sleeved shirt and fitted pants, no exceptions. I had tried to layer a long-sleeved shirt underneath, but he said it looked unprofessional. Now, as I prepared to join the Friday prayer, I felt the stares of the other worshippers. I knew the expectations: as a Muslim, I should dress modestly, covering my arms and legs. But as a parent, I couldn\u2019t risk losing this job; my family depended on me. The imam\u2019s voice echoed from inside, calling the faithful to prayer. I hesitated, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my children, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
