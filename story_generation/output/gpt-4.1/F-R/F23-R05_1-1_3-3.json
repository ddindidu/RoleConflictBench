I\u2019d reminded him countless times about table manners, but he seemed oblivious, lost in his own world. As his step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide him, to teach him respect and discipline, especially in these small, everyday moments. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the adult education class at the synagogue. As the rabbi, I was expected to be there, to teach Torah and answer questions, even if the class was optional and attendance unpredictable. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I left now, I\u2019d be on time for the class, fulfilling my duty to the community. But if I stayed, I could sit with Eli, gently reinforce the lessons I wanted him to learn, and maybe even connect with him a little more. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, standing in the doorway between home and synagogue, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
