They\u2019d both been working longer hours, and lately, their laughter had faded. As their son, I felt the weight of their exhaustion, the unspoken plea for comfort in their tired eyes. I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer the support they needed. But just as I reached for my mother\u2019s hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner in crisis, sobbing and desperate, waiting at the church for guidance only I could give. As a priest, I knew my duty was to offer solace and spiritual counsel, to be present for those in need. My heart pulled in two directions: the son who longed to care for his parents, and the priest called to serve his flock. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door to walk through first."}
