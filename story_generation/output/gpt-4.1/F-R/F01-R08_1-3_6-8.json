Every year, this gathering was sacred\u2014a time to share stories, laughter, and the warmth of togetherness. They counted on me to be there, to listen, to guide, to be the steady heart of our family. Yet, as I looked at my passport and the letter from my doctor, my thoughts drifted to another sacred duty: Hajj. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014this might be my last chance to make the pilgrimage, a pillar of my faith I had longed to fulfill. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds. My family needed me, expected me, and I cherished every moment with them. But my faith called me, too, and the window was closing. I sat in my quiet room, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s embrace and the call of my faith, feeling the pressure of time and the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
