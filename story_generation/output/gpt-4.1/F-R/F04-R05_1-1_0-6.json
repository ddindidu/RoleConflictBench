But then, as I scrolled through my emails, I saw a new inquiry from a young couple in the congregation. They wanted to meet about their wedding, scheduled for the same weekend as my sister\u2019s graduation.

My family expected my unwavering support, my presence at every celebration. My congregation expected my commitment, my leadership at their most sacred moments. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure how I could possibly honor both without letting someone down."}
