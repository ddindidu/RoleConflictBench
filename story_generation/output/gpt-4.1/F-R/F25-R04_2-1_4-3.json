It\u2019s our tradition.\u201d Her eyes had been pleading, her words heavy with the weight of family history. As a step-child, I felt the pressure to honor these customs, to prove I belonged. Yet, as Friday approached, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the guest speaker was ready and eager to deliver the Khutbah. As imam, I was expected to welcome him, perhaps even step aside, showing humility and hospitality. The congregation trusted me to make the right call, to balance respect for guests with my own leadership. My heart pounded as I imagined my stepmother\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t lead the prayer at home, and the community\u2019s reaction if I insisted on giving the sermon instead of the guest. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself torn, caught between the longing to honor my family and the duty to serve my congregation."}
