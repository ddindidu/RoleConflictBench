They expect more, though\u2014calls, updates, a real conversation. I know it makes them happy, and as their son, I want to be there for them. But my mornings are already packed. As a practicing Hindu, I follow a strict schedule: waking before sunrise, bathing, lighting incense, chanting mantras, and making offerings. Each ritual is important, and skipping even one feels like a betrayal of my faith and discipline.\n\nThis Sunday, my phone buzzes with a message from my mother: \u201cCall us when you have time.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just a few minutes before my morning prayers. My heart tightens. If I call now, I\u2019ll be late for my rituals, but if I wait, my parents will worry, maybe even feel neglected. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, torn between the expectations of a devoted son and a faithful Hindu, unsure which voice to answer first."}
