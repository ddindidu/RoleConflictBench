It was one of those rare afternoons when the whole family gathered, laughter echoing through the house. My grandmother placed a plate of her homemade cookies in front of me, the ones she only baked for special occasions. Everyone watched, waiting for me to take the first bite. I knew these cookies weren\u2019t made with kosher ingredients\u2014Grandma never really understood the rules, and she always said, \u201cA little taste won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I could feel my parents\u2019 eyes on me, silently reminding me of the kosher snacks in the pantry. My heart pounded as I looked at Grandma\u2019s hopeful smile, remembering how much she loved sharing her traditions with me. I wanted to make her happy, to be the grandchild she could be proud of, but I also wanted to honor what I\u2019d learned about being Jewish. The plate sat between us, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
