My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about my grandson\u2019s troubles\u2014he was struggling, lost in a crisis I could not fix from afar. As a grandmother, my heart ached to be present, to call every day, to offer comfort and guidance, to be the steady voice my family needed. Yet, as soon as I hung up, the bell rang for evening prayers, and I remembered the Mother Superior\u2019s request: I was to lead daily reflections for the retreat, a sacred duty that demanded my full attention and spiritual preparation. The community expected me to be a pillar of faith, immersed in scripture and contemplation, not distracted by worldly concerns. I felt torn, pulled between the needs of my family and the expectations of my sisters. My mind raced with guilt and longing, wondering how I could possibly be both the grandmother my family needed and the nun my community relied upon."}
