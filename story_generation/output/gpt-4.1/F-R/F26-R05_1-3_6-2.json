My daughter calls, her voice warm but insistent, reminding me that the family is gathering for our traditional holiday meal. \u201cWe haven\u2019t all been together in so long, Abba,\u201d she says, and I hear the longing in her words. My grandchildren are excited, too, already planning games and stories they want to share with me. I know how much it means to them\u2014and to me\u2014to keep these connections strong.\n\nBut as soon as I hang up, my phone buzzes again. The synagogue president wants to confirm the details for the High Holiday sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, and comfort\u2014especially this year, when so many are struggling. I feel the weight of their hopes, the responsibility to prepare something meaningful, something worthy of the moment.\n\nI sit at my desk, torn between the notes for my sermon and the family group chat filling with photos and plans. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot be fully present for both. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I wonder how I can possibly choose."}
