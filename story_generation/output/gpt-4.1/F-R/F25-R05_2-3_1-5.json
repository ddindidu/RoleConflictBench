It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my stepmother and father. They expected it\u2014our weekly ritual, a lifeline of connection since I moved away. I knew they waited for my updates, for the comfort of my voice, and I felt the weight of their hope that I\u2019d never drift too far.\n\nBut tonight, my mind was split. In less than an hour, I was supposed to meet with Miriam, the conversion candidate I\u2019d guided for months. Her Beit Din was tomorrow; this was our last chance to review, to reassure her, to answer her trembling questions about Jewish law and tradition. She was counting on me, and I knew how much this meant to her.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family\u2019s need for closeness, my sacred duty to my student. Both roles tugged at me, demanding my presence, my care. My heart ached with the impossibility of being fully there for both. I closed my eyes, torn, the phone still silent in my hand."}
