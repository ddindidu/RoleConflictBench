My granddaughter, Amina, sat across from me, her eyes downcast, fingers nervously twisting the edge of her sleeve. I could sense her turmoil, the way only a grandparent can. I wanted to reach out, to offer her the comfort and wisdom she needed, to remind her that she was never alone in her struggles. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the mosque: the imam scheduled to lead the special remembrance prayer had fallen ill, and the congregation was waiting for me. No one else could step in. My heart tightened. As an imam, I was expected to guide the community, to be present in their moments of need. But here, in my own home, my granddaughter needed me just as much. I looked at Amina, her vulnerability so clear, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
