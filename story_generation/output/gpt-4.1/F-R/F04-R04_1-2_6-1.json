Everyone\u2019s excited.\u201d I smiled, remembering how we\u2019d both agreed to make more time for each other, to not let our bond fade into the background of busy lives. But as I tucked the phone away, the mosque committee chair approached, his face earnest. \u201cImam, the backup is still out of town. The congregation is counting on you to lead Maghrib tonight.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight settle on my shoulders. My brother\u2019s expectation was simple\u2014show up, be present, share laughter and stories. The congregation\u2019s was sacred\u2014guide them in prayer, be the anchor of their faith. Both roles demanded my presence, both were rooted in respect and trust. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the warmth of family and the solemn duty of faith. I sat quietly, wrestling with the knowledge that no matter what I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
