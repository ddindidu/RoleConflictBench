My mind wandered to my family\u2019s recent dinner, where my parents spoke passionately about the importance of upholding our traditions\u2014respecting elders, keeping peace, and never causing a scene. As their son, I felt the weight of their expectations, the unspoken rule to avoid confrontation and maintain harmony, just as they always had.\n\nSuddenly, a colleague slipped ahead in the line, pretending not to notice the rest of us. My heart thudded. As a Hindu, I\u2019d been taught to value dharma\u2014righteousness and fairness. It was a small thing, but I felt a tug to speak up, to gently remind them of the right thing to do. Yet, my family\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, warning against drawing attention or creating discomfort. I stood frozen, torn between the urge to uphold my ethical beliefs and the deep-rooted desire to honor my family\u2019s wishes. The tray grew heavier in my hands as I wrestled with what to do next."}
