It means a lot to Mom.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, reminding me how much these gatherings matter to our family. I glanced at the stack of Buddhist texts on my desk, the ones my teacher had asked me to summarize for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. He\u2019d said, \u201cYour insights will help guide the group\u2019s reflection. Please take your time with it.\u201d I felt the weight of both requests pressing in on me. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be a good sibling. But my teacher and my sangha were counting on me to prepare, to be thoughtful and thorough, to honor my commitment as a Buddhist practitioner. I stared at the clock, feeling the hours slip away, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet call of my spiritual path, unsure which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
