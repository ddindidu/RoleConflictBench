The school bell will ring in half an hour, and I promised the kids I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like every Friday. They look for my face in the crowd, and I know how much it matters to them, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through together. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and this week\u2019s chapter is one I\u2019ve never read before\u2014everyone will expect me to share my thoughts. The group is counting on my presence, and I crave the quiet reflection, the sense of belonging and peace it brings. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids. Study circle at 6.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be present for my stepchildren and the longing to nurture my own spiritual path. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, sutra in the other, torn between two promises I desperately want to keep."}
