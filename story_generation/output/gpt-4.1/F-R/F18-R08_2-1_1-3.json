I knew something was wrong, and as her older sibling, I felt the urge to comfort her, to sit close and let her cry on my shoulder like we always did when things got tough. But today, I was wearing shorts and a sleeveless top, something I only wore at home when it was just us. As a Muslim, I was taught to dress modestly, even around family, but I\u2019d always relaxed a bit when it was just my sister and me. Now, I hesitated. Should I rush to her side as I was, or take the time to change into something more modest, even if it meant leaving her alone for a few more minutes? The expectations tugged at me from both sides\u2014my sister needed me now, but so did my faith. I stood frozen in the hallway, heart pounding, torn between comforting her immediately and honoring the values I\u2019d been raised with."}
