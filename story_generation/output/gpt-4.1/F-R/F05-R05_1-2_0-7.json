She looked up and smiled, but I could see the fatigue in her eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, and she nodded, brushing it off with a small laugh. I knew she wanted me to sit, to listen, to be present\u2014her husband, her support. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah was in less than an hour. Months of preparation, a young boy\u2019s big day, a family counting on me as their rabbi. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Miriam needed me here, now, to hold her hand and hear her out.
