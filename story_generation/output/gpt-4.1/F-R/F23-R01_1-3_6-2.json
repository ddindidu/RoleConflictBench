The bills stacked beside my coffee mug seemed to grow taller with every word she spoke. I knew how much this meant to her, how much she wanted to feel like any other kid at school. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of providing, of keeping my promise, of making her feel secure and loved. \n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member in crisis, desperate for guidance. As their pastor, I was expected to be available, to offer wisdom and comfort, especially now when their choices could change everything. I felt torn, the demands of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once. I stared at the Nintendo ad on my screen, then at the message notification, feeling the pressure mount inside me, unsure which need should come first."}
