My daughter had called days ago, her voice bright with anticipation, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me. I pictured their eager faces, the games we\u2019d play, the stories I\u2019d tell. Yet, as I sipped my morning coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session. This was no ordinary meeting; it was the last chance to guide them before their Beit Din, a moment that could shape their entire spiritual journey.\n\nAs a grandfather, my heart ached to be present, to laugh and share in the warmth of my family. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of responsibility, knowing how much this candidate depended on my guidance. Both roles pulled at me, each with its own sacred expectation. I sat at the table, torn, feeling the pressure mount as the hours ticked by, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
