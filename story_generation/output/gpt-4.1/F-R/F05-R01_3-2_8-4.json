She needed me to be open, to share my fears and hopes, to let her in on every detail so we could face this together. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: a member of my congregation was in crisis, desperate for guidance. As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer unwavering support and wisdom, to be the steady hand in someone else\u2019s storm. But as a husband, I owed my wife my full attention, my transparency, my heart. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully theirs. My mind raced, torn between the sacred trust of my marriage and the sacred duty to my flock, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
