The pride in her voice was unmistakable, and I could hear Daniel in the background, bubbling with excitement. She asked if I could come over tonight for dinner, to celebrate and hear all about his first week. I promised I\u2019d try, but as I hung up, I glanced at the calendar and remembered tonight is Shabbat. I\u2019ve always attended Friday night services at the synagogue, lighting candles and joining my community in prayer. It\u2019s a tradition that grounds me, a commitment I\u2019ve kept for years. My family expects me to be present, to share in their joys and milestones, but my faith calls me to the sanctuary, to honor the rituals that have shaped my life. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family\u2019s celebration and the quiet sanctity of the synagogue."}
