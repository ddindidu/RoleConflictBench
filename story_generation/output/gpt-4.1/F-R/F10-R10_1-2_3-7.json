Today was the day of the family ceremony, and as a daughter, I knew how much it meant to my parents that I uphold our traditions. My mother had laid out a sari for me, the same one my grandmother wore years ago. She expected me to help with the preparations, to greet relatives, and to perform the rituals just as she had taught me. \n\nBut as a Hindu, I also felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. The temple was holding a special puja at the same time, and my friends from the youth group had asked me to join them. They said it was important to show our devotion, to be present as a community. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014my family\u2019s pride and happiness on one side, my spiritual commitment and sense of belonging on the other. I stood in front of the mirror, sari in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both claimed me."}
