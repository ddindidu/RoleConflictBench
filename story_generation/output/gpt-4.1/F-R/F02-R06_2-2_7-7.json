As a father, I knew my family depended on me to keep the lights on, to make sure there was food on the table. Every dollar mattered, and lately, it felt like there were never enough. My wife glanced at me, concern in her eyes, and I forced a reassuring smile, though my chest felt tight.\n\nThat afternoon, I received a message from Mark, a friend from church. He\u2019d lost his job and was struggling to make ends meet. He didn\u2019t ask for help directly, but I could hear the desperation in his voice. As a Christian, I felt the call to show love and kindness, to help those in need as Jesus taught. But how could I give when my own family was barely scraping by? The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my duty as a provider, my calling as a follower of Christ. I closed my eyes, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my heart, unsure which path to take."}
