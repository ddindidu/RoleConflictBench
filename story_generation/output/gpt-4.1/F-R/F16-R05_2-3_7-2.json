The words wouldn\u2019t come. My mind kept drifting to my spouse, who had been unusually quiet all evening, eyes shadowed with worry. As a spouse, I knew I should reach out, ask what was wrong, and listen\u2014really listen. We promised each other open communication, to share our burdens. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of the congregation\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. The High Holiday service was tomorrow, and everyone would be there, waiting for words of comfort and inspiration. I could hear my spouse moving around in the next room, the silence between us growing heavier. My heart ached with the urge to go to them, to be present, but the sermon deadline loomed. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the sacred trust of my marriage, feeling the impossible pull of both roles at once."}
