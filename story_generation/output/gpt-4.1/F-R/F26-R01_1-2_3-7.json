I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the smell of burgers on the grill. But as I sat at my desk, my Bible open and sermon notes scattered, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cSunday Service\u2014Sermon due.\u201d The congregation was expecting guidance, especially after the recent troubles in our community. They needed reassurance, clarity, and I was the one they looked to for answers. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family and the weight of my calling. I felt the pressure mounting, the guilt of possibly letting someone down, whether it was my grandchildren or my church family.
