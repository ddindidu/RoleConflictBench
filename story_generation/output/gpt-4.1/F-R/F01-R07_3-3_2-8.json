The words blur as my mind drifts, heavy with the responsibility of distilling the Buddha\u2019s teachings for others. Just then, my granddaughter\u2019s voice trembles from the doorway. She steps in, eyes red, clutching her phone. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d Her pain is raw, and I know she trusts me to guide her, as I always have. Yet, the weight of my commitment to the sangha presses on me. The temple expects my best, and I have so little time left to prepare. My heart aches, torn between the wisdom I owe my granddaughter and the spiritual duty I owe my teacher and community. I close my eyes, feeling the pull of both worlds, uncertain which path to walk in this moment."}
