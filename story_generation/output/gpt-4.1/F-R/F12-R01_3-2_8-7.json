He wanted me to be open, to share my worries and fears, to let him in completely. I knew he expected transparency, that our marriage depended on it. But in the back of my mind, the sermon I was preparing for Sunday pressed on me. I was supposed to stand before the congregation and teach about trusting God\u2019s provision, about faith in the face of uncertainty. How could I preach about unwavering faith when I was struggling to admit my own doubts at home? The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014my husband needed my vulnerability, my church needed my strength. I felt torn, caught between the honesty my marriage required and the steadfastness my calling demanded. My hands trembled as I reached for his, unsure which part of myself to reveal."}
