My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer the comfort of my presence. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was expected at the chapel to lead the daily prayer service. It was a routine gathering, not mandatory, but the congregation looked to me for guidance and solace, especially in these uncertain times. I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I didn\u2019t show up. My parents needed me at home, but my community needed me at the altar. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn, standing in the hallway between the kitchen and the door, unsure which way to turn."}
