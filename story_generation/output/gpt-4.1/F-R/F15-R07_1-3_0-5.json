My children\u2019s school day ends at 3:15, and I promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like every Thursday. They always look for me, their faces lighting up when they spot me in the crowd. But today is also the day I lead the weekly meditation group at the temple. As the leader, everyone expects me to guide the session, to be calm and present, to help others find peace. I know how much the group relies on me, and I value the stillness we create together. Yet, my children\u2019s hopeful faces tug at me, reminding me of my promise. I feel torn, my mind racing between the gentle responsibility of my Buddhist practice and the fierce love I have as a parent. Both roles ask for my presence, both are important, and I can\u2019t seem to quiet the storm inside as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
