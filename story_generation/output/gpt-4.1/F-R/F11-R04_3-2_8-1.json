She was upset\u2014again\u2014about something I\u2019d said last night, and she wanted to talk it through, right now, before it festered. As her sister, I knew how important it was to listen, to show her respect by being present and open, especially when misunderstandings threatened to wedge us apart. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart thudded. The call to prayer would sound in fifteen minutes, and with the regular backup away, everyone at the mosque was expecting me to lead. I could already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to step forward, to guide them in worship as their imam. My phone buzzed again\u2014my sister, pleading for a few minutes of my time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred trust of the community and the fragile bond of family, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
