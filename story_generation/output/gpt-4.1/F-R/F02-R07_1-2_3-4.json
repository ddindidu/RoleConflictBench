He\u2019s been struggling with patience lately, and I know this is the perfect moment to teach him about respect and discipline, to guide him as a father should. But tonight is also the weekly group meditation at the temple, a time I cherish for centering myself, for practicing mindfulness and deepening my Buddhist practice. The group expects my presence, and I long for the peace that meditation brings. Yet, my son\u2019s eyes meet mine, searching for attention and guidance. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the quiet sanctuary of the temple and the noisy, messy reality of fatherhood. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I cannot give to both at once. The clock ticks on, and I sit, torn, unsure which path to follow tonight."}
