She had just received news of a difficult decision at work, and her eyes searched mine for comfort and guidance. I reached for her hand, wanting nothing more than to be present, to listen, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The congregation had gathered for a special remembrance, and the other imam was unexpectedly absent. They needed me to lead the prayers; no one else was authorized. My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she began to share her fears, and I felt the weight of her trust in me. At the same time, I knew the community was waiting, expecting me to fulfill my duty as their imam. My heart pounded as I sat between these two worlds, torn by the demands of love and responsibility, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
