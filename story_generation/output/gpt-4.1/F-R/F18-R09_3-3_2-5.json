She\u2019d just gotten the news about her job, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed comfort, needed to feel like she wasn\u2019t alone. The tables were filled with platters of food, but none of it was kosher-certified. I could smell the warm bread, the rich stews, and I saw my sister\u2019s plate untouched. She looked at me, her voice barely above a whisper, \u201cCan you just eat with me? I don\u2019t want to do this alone.\u201d \n\nMy heart twisted. As her sibling, I wanted to be there for her, to share this meal and show her she wasn\u2019t alone in her pain. But as a Jew, I felt the weight of my commitment to keeping kosher, a promise I\u2019d made to myself and my faith. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my sister\u2019s need for comfort, my own need to honor my beliefs. I sat there, torn, the noise of the room fading as I wrestled with what to do next."}
