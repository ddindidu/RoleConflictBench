My phone buzzed with messages from my friends, their excitement about this year\u2019s Hajj almost tangible through the screen. I had saved for years, setting aside money bit by bit, dreaming of the day I would fulfill this pillar of my faith. Now, the opportunity was here\u2014my friends had secured their spots, and they urged me to join them. But as I looked at the school gates, I remembered my promise to my children: I would always be there to pick them up, especially now, as they neared the end of their school days. They counted on me, and I cherished these moments, knowing soon they would be gone. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward Mecca, and toward my children waiting for me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty as a father and my longing as a Muslim."}
