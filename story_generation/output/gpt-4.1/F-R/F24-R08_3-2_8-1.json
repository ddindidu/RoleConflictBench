Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind, feeling the weight of my promise to finish the Quran this month. The house was unusually quiet, and I tried to focus, but the words blurred together as guilt pressed on me for falling behind. Just then, I saw my stepbrother, Adam, outside, heading toward the busy street. He was distracted, headphones in, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart pounded. I knew I should run out and stop him\u2014my mom always said we had to look out for each other, especially since we became a blended family. But I was also desperate to finish my reading before Maghrib, to not let my spiritual goals slip further. I stared at the page, torn between the duty to my stepbrother and my commitment to my faith, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from inside."}
