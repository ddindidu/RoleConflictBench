She glanced at me, her eyes expectant. \u201cYou\u2019ll help with the prayers tonight, right? It\u2019s important to your father and me that we do things the way our family always has.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her words. I wanted to belong, to show respect for their customs, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly meditation group was meeting in half an hour. As a Buddhist, I cherished that hour of quiet, the gentle guidance of my teacher, the sense of peace I found in the practice. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the family prayers and the meal, and I knew how much it mattered to them. My heart pounded as I looked from my stepmother\u2019s hopeful face to the clock, torn between honoring my new family\u2019s traditions and staying true to my own spiritual path."}
