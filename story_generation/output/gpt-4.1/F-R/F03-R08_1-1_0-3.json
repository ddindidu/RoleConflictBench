My phone buzzes\u2014a message from my mom: \u201cHow are you? Can we video call?\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I want to reassure her. But I glance down at my clothes and hesitate. As a Muslim, I\u2019m supposed to dress modestly, even at home, especially when talking to my parents, who always remind me of the importance of upholding our values. But I\u2019m comfortable, and it\u2019s just a quick call, right? Still, I can already hear my mom\u2019s gentle reminder if she sees me like this. I want to be a good son, to keep her from worrying, but I also want to honor my faith and the expectations that come with it. My thumb hovers over the call button, my mind tangled between the comfort of the moment and the weight of what\u2019s expected from me."}
