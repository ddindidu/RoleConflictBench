My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cWe need you with us for the family trip this year. It\u2019s important.\u201d She wanted me to help bring everyone together, to show my younger step-siblings that I cared, that I belonged. But the same date was circled in red for another reason: the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for the entire community. People would travel from far away, filling the pews, looking to me for guidance and comfort.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions. My family needed me to be a brother, a son, a bridge. My congregation needed me to be their spiritual anchor. Both roles demanded my presence, my heart, my time. I could hear my stepbrother\u2019s laughter, see the hopeful look in my stepmother\u2019s eyes. I could also see the faces of my parishioners, waiting for me at the altar. The weight of their expectations pressed on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
