It means a lot to her.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, reminding me how much family means, especially during these celebrations. I knew how much my presence mattered\u2014being there, laughing, sharing stories, making Grandma smile. But just as I was about to reply, my friend Avi called, his voice trembling. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan at the funeral home. Can you come? It\u2019s urgent. The family can\u2019t say Kaddish without you.\u201d My heart twisted. As a Jew, I knew the weight of this mitzvah, the comfort it brings to mourners, the sacredness of helping complete the quorum.
