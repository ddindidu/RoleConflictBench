The scent of marigolds and incense drifted through the air, and I felt the familiar pull of my Hindu faith, the urge to join the prayers and rituals, to be part of the community\u2019s celebration. Just then, my granddaughter sat beside me, her eyes full of questions. She was entering a new phase in her life, uncertain and searching for guidance. She asked me how to make choices when everything felt so overwhelming, looking to me for the wisdom I was expected to provide as her grandmother.\n\nBut as she spoke, the temple bells rang out, calling the faithful to join the ceremony. I could see the neighbors gathering, and I knew they would expect me to be there, to participate and uphold our traditions. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my granddaughter, who needed my undivided attention and support, and toward my community, who expected my presence and devotion. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should fulfill in that moment."}
