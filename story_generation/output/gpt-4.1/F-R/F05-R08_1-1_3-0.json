My wife sighs as she passes by, her eyes lingering on the mess. I know she\u2019s been waiting for me to help, and I promised I\u2019d share the load. Tonight, finally, there\u2019s nothing on the calendar\u2014no work emails, no errands, just a quiet evening at home. \n\nBut as I reach for the laundry, my gaze falls on the Quran resting on the shelf. I haven\u2019t spent time reciting or reflecting in days, and guilt tugs at me. As a Muslim, I know the importance of connecting with Allah, especially when I have the time and peace to do so. The house is calm, the perfect moment to immerse myself in the verses and find spiritual grounding.\n\nYet, the laundry remains, a silent reminder of my promise as a husband. My heart feels pulled in two directions\u2014toward my faith and toward my partner. I stand in the middle of the room, hands hovering between the basket and the Quran, torn by the weight of both expectations."}
