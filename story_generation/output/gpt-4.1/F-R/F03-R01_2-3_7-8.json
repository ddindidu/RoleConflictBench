My father barely spoke at dinner, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. I knew they needed me\u2014needed their son to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort and reassurance. But as I glanced at my phone, reminders for tomorrow\u2019s workshop flashed across the screen. As pastor, I was expected to guide our community leaders through a challenging, multi-day seminar on theological principles. The church board had emphasized how crucial this was for the future of our congregation. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, just as I felt the silent plea in my parents\u2019 eyes. My heart ached, torn between the family who raised me and the flock I was called to shepherd. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I loved would feel my absence."}
