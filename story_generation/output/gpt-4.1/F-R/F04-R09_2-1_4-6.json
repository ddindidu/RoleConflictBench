Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I know how much these family dinners mean, especially since Dad\u2019s been working late and we rarely all sit together anymore. As the oldest brother, I\u2019m expected to be there, to set an example, to keep the peace when my younger siblings bicker. But as I glance at the clock, I remember tonight is also the regular Thursday service at synagogue. I\u2019ve always tried to be consistent, to show up even when it\u2019s not a holiday, because it matters to me\u2014and to the community. Still, I know the minyan will be fine without me; there are always enough people. My mind races between the warmth of my family\u2019s table and the quiet comfort of the sanctuary. I feel pulled in two directions, guilty at the thought of letting anyone down. I wish I could be in both places at once, but I know I have to choose."}
