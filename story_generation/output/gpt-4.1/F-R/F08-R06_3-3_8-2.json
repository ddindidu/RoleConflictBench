She was in trouble\u2014real trouble\u2014and she needed someone to talk to. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always believed in being there for my family, keeping the lines of communication open, no matter what. But as I read her words, my heart pounded. She confessed to something that went against everything I\u2019d been taught as a Christian. The expectation was clear: I should offer love and support, but also uphold the values I\u2019ve lived by for decades. My mind raced with questions. If I comfort her, am I condoning her actions? If I speak out, will I push her away when she needs me most? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different. I wanted to be the grandmother she could trust, but I also felt the pull of my faith, urging me to stand firm. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the love I felt and the beliefs I held dear."}
