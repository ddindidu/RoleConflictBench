He stared at his shoes, shoulders slumped, the weight of something heavy pressing down on him. As his grandfather, I felt the urge to offer advice, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned from my own stumbles and triumphs. I wanted to tell him how to stand tall, to face his troubles head-on, to be strong. But as a Christian, I remembered the words of Jesus\u2014love one another, show compassion, listen before you speak. My heart ached to fix things for him, to guide him with the certainty of my years, but I also knew he needed gentleness, not just answers. The silence between us grew thick, and I wrestled with myself: should I speak with the authority of experience, or simply offer the quiet comfort of love? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
