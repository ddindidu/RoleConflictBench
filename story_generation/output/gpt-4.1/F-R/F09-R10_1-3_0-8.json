The temple bells echoed in the background as the priest called for the next offering. Today was the festival I had waited for all year, a day to honor my faith and traditions, surrounded by family and community. The rituals were intricate, each step meaningful, and I knew my presence was expected, my devotion measured by how fully I participated. Yet, as I knelt before the altar, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my children would be finishing school soon, waiting for me at the gate, eyes searching the crowd for their mother. I pictured their faces, the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there, the trust they placed in me to always show up. Torn between the sacred chants and the schoolyard, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to honor our beliefs, but my children needed me, too. The incense smoke curled around me as I struggled to decide where I truly belonged in this moment, my heart pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
