I slipped my phone into my pocket, feeling its familiar weight. Every morning, before prayers, I would send my parents a message\u2014just a simple update, a photo of the garden, a few words to reassure them I was well. They waited for it, I knew. My mother would reply almost instantly, her words warm and expectant. \n\nBut today, I was running late. The Mother Superior\u2019s voice had already called us to the chapel. I hesitated in the corridor, thumb hovering over the screen. If I sent the message now, I\u2019d be late for prayers, disrupting the sacred silence and risking gentle admonishment. If I waited until after, my parents would worry, their anxiety growing with each minute of silence. \n\nI stood frozen, torn between the quiet sanctuary of the chapel and the gentle, persistent love of my parents. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt the weight of my two worlds pulling me apart."}
