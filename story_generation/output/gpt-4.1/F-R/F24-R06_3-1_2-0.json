My stepbrother\u2019s text was desperate\u2014he\u2019d just found out his biological father was in jail again, and he needed someone to talk to. As his step-sibling, I knew I should be there for him, to listen and support him through this pain. But as a Christian, I also felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. He wanted to meet at the park late at night, but I knew my parents wouldn\u2019t approve, and I worried about the temptation to gossip or judge his father, which went against my beliefs. My heart ached for him, but my mind raced with questions: Could I be the supportive sibling he needed without compromising my values? Was it possible to comfort him without falling into negativity or breaking my parents\u2019 trust? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I stared at the phone, torn between the love I owed my stepbrother and the principles I tried so hard to live by."}
