She had colored the edges with bright markers, her excitement shining through every scribble. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Abba?\u201d she had asked, her eyes wide with hope. I promised I would. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. The open class was scheduled for the same afternoon as the High Holiday service. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would guide and inspire the entire congregation. People counted on me to be present, prepared, and focused. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014my daughter\u2019s need for her father\u2019s support, my community\u2019s need for their rabbi\u2019s leadership. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between the pride in my daughter\u2019s face and the trust in my congregants\u2019 eyes. I wanted to be fully present for both, but the hours overlapped, and I knew I couldn\u2019t split myself in two."}
