She expects me to check in every evening, to tell her about my day, to answer her questions right away. It\u2019s how we stay close, how I show her I care. But tonight, I\u2019m sitting cross-legged at the front of the meditation hall, guiding our weekly session. As the leader, I\u2019m supposed to be fully present, to set an example of mindfulness and calm for everyone here. My mind keeps drifting to my phone, to the messages piling up, to the worry I know my mom feels when I don\u2019t reply. I try to focus on my breath, on the gentle rhythm of the group\u2019s breathing, but guilt tugs at me. I want to honor my commitment to this practice, to the people who look to me for guidance, but I also want to be the attentive child my parents expect. The two roles pull at me from opposite directions, and I sit in the quiet room, heart pounding, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
