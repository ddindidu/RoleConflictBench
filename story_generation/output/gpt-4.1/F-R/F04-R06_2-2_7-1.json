He was angry, lashing out after a fight with our parents, and he wanted me to cover for him\u2014just a small lie, he said, so he wouldn\u2019t get into more trouble. As his brother, I felt the weight of our bond, the unspoken rule to stand by each other, to be patient and understanding even when we disagreed. I remembered all the times he\u2019d confided in me, trusting I\u2019d have his back.\n\nBut as a Christian, I was taught to value honesty, to live by the truth even when it was hard. The thought of lying, even for my brother, made my stomach twist. I could hear my pastor\u2019s words echoing in my mind about integrity and the importance of setting a good example. My brother\u2019s trust pulled me one way, my faith pulled me another. I stared at my phone, torn between the love I had for my brother and the values I tried to live by, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, waiting for me to choose."}
