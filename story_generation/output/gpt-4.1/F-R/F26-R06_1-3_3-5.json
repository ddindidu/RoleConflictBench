This Sunday, the whole family was coming over\u2014my daughter had planned it weeks ago, hoping we could all be together for the first time in months. The grandkids were excited, and I could already picture their laughter filling the house. As a grandparent, I knew how much these moments mattered, how fleeting they could be.\n\nBut Sunday was also the day of our church service, and not just any service. I was supposed to help with the community lunch afterward, something I\u2019d committed to months ago. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to serve, and to worship with my church family. They counted on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my church\u2019s need for my presence. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, feeling the weight of both roles. My mind raced with possible solutions, but none seemed right. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
