The home loan repayment loomed large in my mind, a weight pressing on my chest. As a father, I knew I had to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. I\u2019d promised my wife we\u2019d never fall behind, and my children depended on me to keep our home safe and secure. Yet, as I glanced at the calendar, I saw Shabbat approaching. As the rabbi, my congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring sermon\u2014something to guide them, to uplift their spirits. I could hear the echo of their voices, the anticipation in their eyes. But every time I tried to focus on the Torah portion, my mind drifted back to the numbers, the deadlines, the fear of letting my family down. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by love and duty, unable to give my full self to either role. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
