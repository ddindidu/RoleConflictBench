She spoke of her worries about Dad\u2019s health, her fears about the future, and I could see the exhaustion in her eyes. She reached for my hand, searching for comfort, and I felt the weight of her need settle on my shoulders. I wanted to be present, to listen, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But in the back of my mind, I remembered the Buddhist study circle meeting tonight\u2014the one I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss. We were discussing a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I knew my absence would let down my teacher and friends, and disrupt my own spiritual progress. My heart tugged in two directions: the son who wanted to hold his mother\u2019s hand and the Buddhist who longed for the quiet wisdom of the Dharma. I sat there, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
