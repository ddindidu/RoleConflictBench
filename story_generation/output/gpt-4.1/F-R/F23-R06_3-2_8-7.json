The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a step-parent, I knew my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure we didn\u2019t lose our home. Every dollar counted, and I\u2019d been carefully setting aside money for months. \n\nThen, during Bible study, I learned that Mark, a friend from church, had lost his job. He was struggling to pay for groceries, his kids going to bed hungry some nights. My heart ached for him. As a Christian, I felt the call to help, to show the love and kindness Jesus taught us. But the thought of dipping into our savings terrified me. What if helping Mark meant I couldn\u2019t make the loan payment? What if my family suffered because I tried to live out my faith? \n\nI stared at the checkbook, torn between my responsibility to my family and the compassion I felt for Mark. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to follow."}
