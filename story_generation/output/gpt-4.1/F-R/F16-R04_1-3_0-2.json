She spoke quietly, her words trailing off as she described a tense moment with her supervisor. I could see the fatigue in her eyes, the way her shoulders slumped. She needed me to be present, to offer comfort, maybe just to listen a little longer. My phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee: the crowd for the special remembrance was larger than expected, and no other imam was available. They needed me to lead the prayer, and the gathering was already waiting. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s unspoken hope for my support, the community\u2019s expectation for my guidance. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each expectation valid and urgent. I looked at my wife, then at the message, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, unsure which call to answer."}
