My mind races with numbers, calculating every cent, every possible way to stretch our budget. As a parent, I feel the weight of responsibility pressing down\u2014my family\u2019s security depends on me. I need to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind, that there\u2019s always a roof over our heads. \n\nBut as I open the pantry, I see the shelves lined with kosher ingredients\u2014matzah, canned tuna with the right hechsher, jars of gefilte fish. The kosher snacks are more expensive, and I know I could save money by buying non-kosher brands. The thought gnaws at me. I want to honor my Jewish identity, to teach my children the importance of our traditions, but the cost is real. \n\nMy heart aches as I weigh the expectations: the need to provide for my family\u2019s future, and the commitment to our faith. I feel torn, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
