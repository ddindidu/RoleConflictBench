My daughter\u2019s open class was scheduled for Thursday morning\u2014the same time as the intensive workshop I\u2019d been planning for weeks at the church. As a father, I knew how much it meant to her for me to be there, sitting in the front row, smiling and cheering her on. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for days, asking if I\u2019d watch her perform. But as a pastor, I was expected to lead the workshop, guiding community leaders through challenging theological concepts. People were counting on me to teach, to inspire, to help them grow in faith. I could already imagine the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s eyes if I missed her big moment, and the letdown in my congregation if I failed to show up as their guide. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, dreading the choice I\u2019d have to make."}
