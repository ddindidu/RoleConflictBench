As a sister, I knew how much it meant to my parents and siblings for all of us to be together, sharing laughter and stories, making memories that would last. They expected me to be there, to join in every tradition, to be present and connected. But my phone vibrated with a message from Anna, a friend from church who had been struggling lately. She was alone, her family far away, and she\u2019d confided in me about how hard the holidays were for her. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to show her love and kindness, to be there for her in her loneliness, just as Jesus would want. The two expectations pressed in on me, each demanding my time and heart. I felt torn, guilt and worry swirling inside me, unsure how to honor both my family and my faith."}
