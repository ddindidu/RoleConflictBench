My younger sister, Aisha, had just called, her voice tight with frustration. She wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the argument we\u2019d had last night. She said she\u2019d come over before my office function, hoping we could clear the air. I knew how important it was to her that we communicate openly, to rebuild the mutual respect we\u2019d always shared. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety twisted in my stomach. The office function was in two hours, and I was expected to attend, dressed professionally but also modestly, as my faith required. My colleagues, including men, would be there, and I worried about standing out or being judged for my long sleeves and scarf in the summer heat. I wanted to be a good sister, to listen and resolve things with Aisha, but I also needed time to prepare myself\u2014mentally and physically\u2014for the event. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure how to honor both without letting one down."}
