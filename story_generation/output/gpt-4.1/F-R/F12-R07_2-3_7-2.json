As his wife, I know I should reach out, encourage him to share what\u2019s weighing on his mind, and offer comfort. We\u2019ve always promised to communicate openly, especially when life feels heavy. But as I glance at the clock, anxiety prickles in my chest. The monastery\u2019s annual festival begins at dawn, and I\u2019ve already promised the sangha I\u2019ll help with the early morning preparations. It\u2019s a sacred duty, one I cherish as a Buddhist, and the community relies on my presence. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward my husband, who needs me to listen, and toward my spiritual family, who expects my commitment. I sit in silence, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to follow as the night deepens."}
