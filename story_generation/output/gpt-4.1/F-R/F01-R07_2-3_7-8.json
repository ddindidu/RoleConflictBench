She\u2019s just started her new job, and her words are bubbling with excitement. My daughter calls too, eager for us all to gather on a video call and celebrate this milestone together. As a grandfather, I know how much these moments matter\u2014how important it is to show up, to listen, to share in their joy. Yet, on my desk, the teachings of the Buddha lie open, notes scattered, reminders of the promise I made to my teacher. Tomorrow, I am to present a summary of the key teachings at the temple, a responsibility I do not take lightly. The expectation is clear: to prepare thoroughly, to reflect deeply, to honor the Dharma with my full attention. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s happiness and toward my spiritual commitment. I feel the weight of both, the pull of love and the call of practice, and I sit in the quiet, uncertain which path to follow tonight."}
