My mom was in the living room, staring blankly at the TV, not really watching. The air felt heavy, and I could sense something was wrong. As their step-child, I knew I should go to them, offer comfort, and try to ease whatever burden they were carrying. They\u2019d always said how much it meant to have my support, especially since the family blended. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a classmate who\u2019d been bullied all week, asking if I could meet up. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to show love and kindness, to be there for someone in need, just as Jesus taught. My heart twisted, torn between staying to support my parents and rushing out to help my friend. Both needed me, both expected something from me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
