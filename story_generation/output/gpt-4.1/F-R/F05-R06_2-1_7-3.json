I knew something was bothering her, and as her husband, I felt the weight of my promise to always be there, to listen and share openly. I wanted to ask her about her day, to tell her about the stress piling up at work, and to let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the church service starting soon. As a Christian, I was expected to attend, to worship and be present in the community, especially since I\u2019d missed the last two Sundays. The guilt tugged at me\u2014my faith was important, but so was my marriage. I could see the hope in my wife\u2019s eyes, waiting for me to reach out, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual commitment. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn by the demands of love and faith, unsure which voice to answer first."}
