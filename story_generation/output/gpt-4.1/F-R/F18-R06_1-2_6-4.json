It was almost time for the Wednesday evening church service, and I knew how important it was to be there\u2014Pastor Lee always said our presence mattered, not just for worship but for the sense of community. But as we passed the old bakery, my brother winced and grabbed his ankle, stumbling. He\u2019d twisted it badly, and I could see the pain in his eyes. He needed me to help him home, maybe even to the doctor. I felt the weight of my responsibility as his sibling, to make sure he was safe and cared for. But the church bells in the distance reminded me of my other duty, the one to my faith and my church family. I could feel the expectations pulling me in two directions\u2014my brother\u2019s need for me right now, and the call to be present at church, to not let anyone down. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, torn between the two roles that meant so much to me."}
