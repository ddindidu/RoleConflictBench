I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, \u201cYou\u2019re part of this family now. We want you there.\u201d I wanted to go, to laugh with them, to feel like I truly belonged.\n\nBut as I packed my bag, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the mosque committee. \u201cWe know you\u2019re busy, but the congregation feels at ease when you lead. Will you be here for prayers this weekend?\u201d I knew another brother could step in, and the group was small, but I also knew how much the community valued my presence, how they looked to me for guidance and comfort.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family wanted me to show up as a brother, to be present and build memories. My community wanted me to show up as an imam, to lead and inspire. I stood in the hallway, suitcase in hand, heart pounding, caught between two homes that both needed me."}
