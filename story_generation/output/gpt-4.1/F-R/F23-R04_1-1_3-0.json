He had refused to clear his plate again, and I knew this was one of those moments where I needed to step in, to teach him about respect and responsibility\u2014values I held dear, not just as a step-parent, but as a person of faith. Yet, as I took a breath to enter the kitchen, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: time for Maghrib prayer. The mosque was only a few minutes away, and though the congregation was small tonight, I was expected to lead. Another brother could fill in, but I knew the community looked to me for consistency and guidance. My wife glanced at me, her eyes pleading for help with her son. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my presence and patience, and toward my community, who relied on my leadership. I stood frozen, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which duty to answer first."}
