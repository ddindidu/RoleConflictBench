One is for the family holiday, a tradition I\u2019ve cherished since my children were small, now passed on to my grandchildren. They expect me to be there, to share stories, laughter, and the warmth of our togetherness. My daughter called last night, her voice full of excitement, reminding me how much it means to everyone that I\u2019m present, especially for the little ones who look forward to my tales and gentle hugs.\n\nBut the other circle is for the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a sacred event that only comes once a year. As a devoted Buddhist, I am expected to help with the dawn preparations, to chant, to serve, to be fully present for my sangha. The abbot asked me personally, saying my experience and calm presence are needed to guide the younger volunteers.\n\nI sit at my kitchen table, torn. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations. I want to honor my family\u2019s love and the spiritual community that sustains me. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my presence, and I feel the tension rising within, unsure which path to follow."}
