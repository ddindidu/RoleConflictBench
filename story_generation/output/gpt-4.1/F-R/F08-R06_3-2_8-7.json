My daughter had just confided in me about her struggles\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she begged me not to tell anyone else in the family. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of keeping our family close, of making sure everyone was connected and supported. But now, I was being asked to keep a secret, to hold back from reaching out to my other children and grandchildren, who might be able to help or at least offer comfort.\n\nAt the same time, my faith tugged at me. At church, we\u2019d just talked about loving our neighbors, about reaching out to those in pain, no matter who they were. I knew a woman from our congregation who was also struggling, and I\u2019d been quick to offer her a listening ear and a warm meal. Why did it feel so much harder with my own family? I wanted to show love and kindness, to be the grandmother who held everyone together, but I was torn between honoring my daughter\u2019s trust and the urge to rally the family around her. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to do next."}
