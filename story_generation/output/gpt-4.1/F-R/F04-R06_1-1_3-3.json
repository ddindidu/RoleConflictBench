My younger sister wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a family brunch, and everyone looked at me, expecting me to join in. I knew how much these moments meant to them\u2014being present, sharing laughter, and making memories together. But as they talked, my mind drifted to Sunday morning, when I usually attended church. Worship and fellowship were important to me, not just as a routine, but as a way to grow in faith and serve my community. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me: my family\u2019s hope for togetherness and my own commitment to my faith. My heart tugged in two directions, and I wondered how I could honor both without letting anyone down."}
