Tonight, a special healing service was being held for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and offer comfort, especially during such moments. But my phone buzzed quietly on the nightstand\u2014a message from my stepmother: \u201cYour father seems down lately. Can you call him tonight?\u201d I knew what she wanted: for me to check in, to ask if everything was going well at home, to be the emotional bridge between them. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for my family, to offer the support they needed, but the community here needed me too. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, my care. I stared at the phone, then at the chapel door, torn between the vows I had made and the family I could never quite leave behind."}
