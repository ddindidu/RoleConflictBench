The air was thick with the scent of marigolds and incense, and I felt the familiar pull of my faith, the urge to join in the prayers and rituals that have shaped my life. But as I paused to watch the dancers, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my daughter\u2014my grandson was struggling, caught in the middle of a crisis that had shaken our family. As a grandfather, I knew I should call, offer comfort, and be present for them, just as my father had been for me. Yet, the festival was about to begin, and my community expected my participation. I could almost hear my elders\u2019 voices, reminding me of my duty to uphold our traditions. My heart ached, torn between the warmth of family and the call of my faith. I stood there, phone in hand, the sounds of celebration swirling around me, uncertain which path to take."}
