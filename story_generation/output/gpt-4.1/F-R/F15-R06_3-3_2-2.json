My son had been caught bullying another child\u2014pushing, name-calling, even making the other boy cry. The teacher\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing down. As a parent, I was supposed to defend my child, to stand by him and advocate for him, especially in front of school staff. But as a Christian, I was called to honesty, compassion, and to teach my child right from wrong, even when it hurt. My heart ached for the other boy, for his parents, and for my own son, who sat beside me, eyes downcast. I wanted to protect him, to shield him from shame, but I also knew I couldn\u2019t ignore what he\u2019d done. The principal asked what I thought should happen next. My mind raced, torn between my instinct to defend my child and my conviction to uphold the values I claimed to live by."}
