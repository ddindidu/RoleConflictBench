She had just started her new job, and her excitement leapt from every word. As her grandfather, I know how much it means to her that I listen, encourage, and share in her joy. My children expect me to be present, to keep our family close with regular calls and messages. But as I read her message, I glanced at the clock\u2014my morning puja was about to begin. As a Hindu, my daily rituals are sacred. The prayers, the chanting, the offerings\u2014they must be performed at precise times, without interruption. If I delay, I feel I am failing my spiritual duties, disrespecting the traditions passed down to me. Yet, if I ignore my granddaughter\u2019s message, I risk disappointing her, making her feel unimportant. My heart tugs in two directions: the pull of my faith and the love for my family. I sit, phone in hand, torn between the temple bell\u2019s call and the bright hope in my granddaughter\u2019s words, unsure which duty to answer first."}
