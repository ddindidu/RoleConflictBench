They needed me\u2014needed my encouragement, my advice\u2014as they wrestled with a difficult decision at work. I wanted to be present, to listen, to offer the support they deserved. But in the next room, our son\u2019s voice faltered over the Hebrew words of his Torah portion. The bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he was still struggling. I knew I should be with him, guiding him through the verses, sharing the stories and values that have shaped our family for generations. My heart tugged in two directions: the spouse who must be a rock, and the parent who must be a teacher of tradition. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I closed my eyes, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
