My younger brother\u2019s message glowed on the screen: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, to listen, to support him no matter what. But just as I was about to call him, another message popped up\u2014this time from a community member. \u201cSalam, Imam. If you have a moment today, I\u2019d love to get your advice about something important.\u201d I knew how much people relied on me for guidance, how they trusted me to be available, to offer comfort and wisdom. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the sister my brother needed, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as imam. Both roles demanded my presence, my empathy, my time\u2014right now. I stared at the two messages, feeling the pressure build inside me, torn between the family I loved and the community that depended on me."}
