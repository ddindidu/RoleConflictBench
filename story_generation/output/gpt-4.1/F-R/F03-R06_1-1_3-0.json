My parents believe it\u2019s a way to honor our heritage and show respect to those who came before us. The incense, the bowing, the offerings\u2014these are all part of what it means to be a good son in their eyes. But as a Christian, I\u2019ve always been taught to worship only God, and the idea of bowing before ancestral tablets makes me uneasy. I want to respect my parents and not disappoint them, especially when they look at me with such hope and pride. At the same time, I feel a deep sense of guilt, as if I\u2019m betraying my faith by participating in rituals that conflict with my beliefs. The pressure builds as the day approaches, and I find myself torn, caught between the love and loyalty I owe my family and the convictions that guide my life. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, and I wonder how I can possibly honor both without letting someone down."}
