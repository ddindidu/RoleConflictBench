The numbers on the loan statement stared back at me, a reminder that in two months, the bank would expect its due. My wife glanced at me, worry flickering in her eyes, and I knew she was thinking of the same thing\u2014how we would manage the next repayment. As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down, the need to secure our home, to keep my family safe and stable.\n\nBut as the evening call to prayer echoed from the mosque, another duty called. The congregation was small tonight, and Brother Yusuf, a capable worshipper, was already present and could easily lead. Yet, as the imam, the community looked to me for guidance, for consistency, for presence. I could almost hear the unspoken expectations: to be there, to lead, to serve.\n\nMy heart twisted between these two worlds\u2014one demanding my time and energy to find extra work, the other asking for my spiritual leadership. I sat in silence, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, unsure which path to take."}
