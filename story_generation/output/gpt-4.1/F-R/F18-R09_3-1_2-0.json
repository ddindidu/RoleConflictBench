It was something I took pride in\u2014passing on our Jewish traditions, making sure they understood the stories and values that shaped us. But my phone buzzed, and I saw my brother\u2019s name. He never called during the day unless something was wrong. When I answered, his voice was shaky, barely holding together as he told me about the news he\u2019d just received\u2014news that left him reeling, desperate for comfort.\n\nI glanced at the clock. The kids would be home soon, expecting our study session. I could shift the lesson, I knew that, but I also knew how much consistency mattered, how much I wanted to be the parent who kept Jewish learning alive in our home. At the same time, my brother needed me\u2014needed the kind of support only a sibling could give. My heart twisted as I weighed the pull of my family\u2019s expectations against the ache in my brother\u2019s voice, torn between being the teacher my children needed and the comfort my brother deserved."}
