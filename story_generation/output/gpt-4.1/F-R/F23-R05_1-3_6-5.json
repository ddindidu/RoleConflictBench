My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes echoed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days, reminding me of my promise. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of providing, of keeping my word, of making him feel secure and loved in this new family. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was in an hour. As their rabbi, I was their guide, their anchor, and this session was crucial before their Beit Din. They\u2019d waited months for this moment, and I knew how much it meant. My heart twisted. If I went to the store now, I\u2019d miss the session. If I postponed the Nintendo, I\u2019d break my promise and risk my stepson\u2019s trust. Both roles demanded my presence, my reliability.
