It was my younger sister, her voice trembling, barely holding back tears. She had just received some terrible news\u2014her closest friend had been in a serious accident. I could hear the panic and confusion in her words, the way she clung to me for comfort, needing me to be present, to listen, to help her make sense of the chaos. As her sibling, I knew she expected me to stay, to be her anchor in this storm.\n\nBut tonight was also the one night a week I dedicated to my spiritual growth, a commitment I made to myself and my Buddhist community. We were set to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I felt a responsibility to show up, to contribute, to deepen my understanding. The teachings always brought me peace, but now, torn between my sister\u2019s pain and my own spiritual path, I felt a knot of anxiety tightening in my chest. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role I should honor."}
