It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come right away\u2014she needed me, her big brother, to help her through a crisis she couldn\u2019t face alone. I promised I\u2019d be there, my heart already aching for her. But as I hung up, another call came in: a congregant\u2019s daughter, her words choked with grief. Her father had just passed, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral service as soon as possible. I could hear the expectation in her voice, the trust that I would guide them through this sacred moment. I stood in my study, torn between the brother my sister needed and the rabbi my community expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each deserving my full heart. I closed my eyes, feeling the impossible pull, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
