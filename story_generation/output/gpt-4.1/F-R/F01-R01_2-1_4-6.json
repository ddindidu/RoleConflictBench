My grandson tugged at my sleeve, his eyes shining. \u201cGrandpa, I want to show everyone my science project!\u201d The family gathered, eager to celebrate his achievement. As I watched him beam with pride, I felt the warmth of being a grandfather, the expectation to be present, to listen, to make him feel special.\n\nBut then, as the conversation drifted, someone mentioned a recent hardship, and all eyes turned to me, the pastor. They waited for me to offer comfort, perhaps a story from scripture, a lesson to guide them. I could feel the weight of their expectation, the silent request for wisdom and reassurance.\n\nInside, I wrestled with the moment. Should I let my grandson have the spotlight, honoring my role as his grandfather? Or should I step into my pastoral shoes, sharing a story that might help the family heal? The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, heart torn, unsure which part of myself to give."}
