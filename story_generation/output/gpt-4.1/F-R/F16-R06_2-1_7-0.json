I could see the worry etched on their face, the way their fingers fidgeted with the edge of their mug. I knew I should open up, share the challenges I\u2019d been facing at work, the doubts gnawing at me, just as we promised we would. But the truth was, some of those challenges involved decisions that didn\u2019t sit right with my faith\u2014small compromises, white lies, things my boss expected that clashed with the Christian values I tried to live by every day.\n\nMy spouse deserved honesty, and I wanted to be the partner who communicated openly, who didn\u2019t hide behind silence. But I also feared their disappointment if I admitted I\u2019d been struggling to uphold the morals we both believed in. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. I looked at my spouse, heart pounding, torn between confessing everything and protecting the image of the person they thought I was."}
