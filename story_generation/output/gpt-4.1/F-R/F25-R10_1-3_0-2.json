But lately, my mornings are packed with my Hindu rituals\u2014lighting the lamp, chanting mantras, offering flowers, and meditating. Each step is important, and I feel guilty if I rush or skip anything. Last Sunday, as I finished my prayers, I saw three missed messages from my stepmother. She\u2019d texted hours ago, asking if I was free to talk. I felt a pang of guilt. I know she expects me to check in, to show I care, but my rituals are sacred, and I can\u2019t just set them aside. I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of her messages and the peace I find in my daily practice, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
