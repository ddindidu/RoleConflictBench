He was frustrated, his voice trembling as he accused me of never understanding him. I wanted to be patient, to listen, to show him the respect he deserved as my brother, even though our differences seemed to grow wider every day. Just as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed urgently\u2014a message from the mosque. Someone had arrived, devastated by a recent loss, and needed immediate spiritual guidance. As the imam, I knew the community expected me to be present, compassionate, and wise, especially in moments of crisis. My brother\u2019s eyes searched mine, pleading for understanding, while my mind raced with the responsibility waiting for me at the mosque. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be someone different. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need was greater or how to choose between them."}
