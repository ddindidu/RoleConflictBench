It was my sister, her message short but heavy: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her brother, I felt the familiar pull to drop everything and be there for her, to listen, to comfort, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I reached for my coat, the church secretary knocked on my door. \u201cFather, Mrs. Evans from the parish called. She\u2019s hoping you can find time to meet with her soon. She didn\u2019t say what it was about, but she sounded anxious.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My sister needed her brother, someone who would listen without judgment, who would simply be present. But Mrs. Evans needed her priest, someone who could offer spiritual guidance and reassurance. Both expected me to be there, to help, to care. I stood in the quiet hallway, torn between the call of family and the call of faith, my heart aching with the knowledge that I could not be in two places at once."}
