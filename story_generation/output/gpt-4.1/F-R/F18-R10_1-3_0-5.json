He was hunched over, eyes red from lack of sleep, hands trembling as he tried to memorize formulas for his final exam. I knew how much this meant to him\u2014how much he needed me to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he could do it. That\u2019s what siblings do, especially when things get tough.\n\nBut earlier that day, I had witnessed something that gnawed at my conscience. A teacher had accepted money from a student\u2019s parent, promising to leak the exam questions. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to act with integrity and courage. My heart pounded with the weight of this knowledge. I felt I had to report it, to stop the injustice.\n\nYet, if I spoke up now, the investigation would disrupt the exam, and my brother\u2019s fragile confidence might shatter. If I stayed silent, I would betray my values. I could feel the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
