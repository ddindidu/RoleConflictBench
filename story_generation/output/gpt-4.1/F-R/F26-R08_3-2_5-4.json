As a grandmother, I knew my place was by her side, comforting my grandchildren and holding the family together. But today was also the day of my office function, a rare event where all my colleagues, men and women, would gather. I had already chosen my outfit: a long, loose dress and a scarf, modest and in line with my faith. Yet, I remembered the subtle comments from my manager last year, hinting that my attire made me seem distant, not part of the team. I felt the weight of expectation from both sides\u2014my family needing my warmth and presence, my workplace expecting me to blend in, perhaps even dress a little less conservatively. My heart pounded as I stood in front of the mirror, torn between the call of my family and the silent pressure to fit in at work, knowing I could not be in two places, or two selves, at once."}
