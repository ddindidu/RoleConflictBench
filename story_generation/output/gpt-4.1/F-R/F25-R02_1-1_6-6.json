I nodded, trying to offer comfort, asking if she and Dad were okay, if there was anything I could do. She smiled, grateful, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014being the one who checks in, who tries to keep the peace.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, a calendar reminder flashing: \u201cFaith Formation Planning Meeting\u20146:00 PM.\u201d As a priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for my parishioners. The committee would be waiting for me, eager to discuss the new curriculum, looking to me for guidance and vision.\n\nI glanced at my stepmother, then at the clock. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I wanted to stay, to listen, to be the support she needed. But I also knew my absence at the meeting would disappoint the team and disrupt the planning. My heart ached, torn between the home that needed me and the church that depended on me."}
