My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted me to come in and discuss it. As his step-parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show him that I cared and that his actions mattered. But as I looked around the crowded temple, the scent of incense thick in the air, I remembered why I was here\u2014this festival was one of the most important in my faith, a time to honor my ancestors and seek blessings for my family. My relatives had traveled from far away, expecting me to lead the rituals and participate in every offering. I felt the weight of their expectations, the pride in their eyes as they watched me. Yet, my phone buzzed again, a reminder of my other role, the one that demanded I put my stepson first. My heart pounded as I stood between the temple and the school, torn by the impossible choice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
