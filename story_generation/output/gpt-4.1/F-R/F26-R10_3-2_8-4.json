My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about her husband\u2019s job loss, the tension in their home, and how the children were starting to notice. As a grandmother, I knew I should call every day, offer comfort, and be the steady presence my family needed. But as I hung up, my thoughts drifted to my friend, Mr. Sharma, who lived down the street. He was being unfairly blamed for a mistake at the temple committee, and the gossip was spreading fast. My heart ached for him. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak the truth and defend those who are wronged, even if it meant facing disapproval from others in the community.\n\nI felt torn. My family needed me, my daughter needed my support, but my conscience screamed at me to help my friend. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat in silence, unsure which path to take, my heart pulled in two directions."}
