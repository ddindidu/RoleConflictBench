He needed comfort, someone to listen, and I could see how much he was relying on me. My heart ached for him, and I wanted nothing more than to stay, to offer the support he so clearly needed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was less than an hour away. As the imam, the community expected me to deliver the khutbah, to guide and inspire them. I knew there was a guest speaker prepared to step in, but I also knew how much the congregation valued my presence and words, especially on important days like this. Torn between my duty to my family and my responsibility to my community, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. My stepfather\u2019s voice trembled as he spoke, and I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that needed me."}
