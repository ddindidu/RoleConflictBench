Dad\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I glance at the message, guilt pricking at me. It\u2019s Saturday afternoon, and I\u2019m already at the synagogue, rehearsing the Torah portion with Daniel, whose bar mitzvah is tomorrow. His family has been planning this day for months, and I know how much it means to them. As their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be present, focused, and supportive, especially now, on the eve of such a milestone.\n\nBut my mother\u2019s message tugs at me. I haven\u2019t called home all week, just sent a few quick texts. I know my parents expect more\u2014regular calls, real conversations, not just updates squeezed between meetings. I feel the weight of their worry, the unspoken hope that I\u2019ll be there for them, especially when Dad isn\u2019t well.\n\nStanding in the sanctuary, I feel split in two. My congregation needs me here, but my family needs me, too. I stare at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the daughter I want to be and the rabbi I am expected to be."}
