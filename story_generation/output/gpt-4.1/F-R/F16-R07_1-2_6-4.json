They ask about my day, and I know this is our time to connect, to share honestly. I want to be present, to listen and open up, as we promised each other we would. But my mind keeps drifting to the clock\u2014my weekly meditation group meets in twenty minutes. I haven\u2019t missed a session in months; it\u2019s my anchor, my way to practice mindfulness and find peace. I feel the pull of both worlds: the need to honor our relationship with real conversation, and the commitment I made to my Buddhist practice. My partner\u2019s eyes search mine, waiting for me to speak, but my thoughts are tangled. If I stay, I risk missing the calm and clarity I find in meditation. If I leave, I worry I\u2019ll seem distant, breaking the trust we\u2019ve built. The weight of these expectations presses on me, and I sit in silence, torn between two parts of myself."}
