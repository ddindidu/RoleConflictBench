I really need you.\u201d She was just a few blocks away, her voice shaky over the call. I promised I\u2019d be there, but my stomach growled\u2014traveling all morning, I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. The only food nearby was a tiny vendor, the one I\u2019d researched before the trip, the only kosher-certified place for miles. I knew my family expected me to keep kosher, just as I\u2019d always done. But my sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, and I remembered all the times we\u2019d leaned on each other, the unspoken rule that we\u2019d always show up, no matter what. If I stopped to eat, I\u2019d be late, maybe too late to help her. If I went straight to her, I\u2019d be running on empty, distracted, maybe not the brother she needed. My hands shook as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the demands of my faith and the needs of my sister, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
