Tonight is her last study session before she faces the Beit Din, and she\u2019s counting on me to guide her through the final, intricate details of Jewish law. I see the hope and anxiety in her face, and I know how much this means to her. But the buzzing doesn\u2019t stop. I glance at the screen\u2014three missed calls and a string of messages from my mother. She expects me to check in every evening, to share how my day went, to reassure her that I\u2019m safe and well. I can almost hear her voice, tinged with worry, if I don\u2019t respond soon. My heart pounds as I try to focus on Miriam\u2019s questions, but my mind is split. I want to be fully present for her, to honor my role as her rabbi, but I also feel the pull of my mother\u2019s expectations, the guilt of not being the attentive daughter she relies on. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I sit there, torn, unable to choose which part of myself to let down."}
