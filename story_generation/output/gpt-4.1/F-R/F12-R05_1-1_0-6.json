He told me about a frustrating meeting, nothing earth-shattering, but I could hear the tiredness in his voice. I wanted to put down the spoon, sit with him, and listen\u2014really listen\u2014the way he always does for me. But my phone buzzed with an email from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They sounded so hopeful, so eager to start planning. I knew how much it meant to them to have their rabbi\u2019s blessing, to feel seen and supported as they began their life together. I could almost hear their excitement in the message. I felt the pull in both directions: David needed my presence, my comfort, my undivided attention; the couple needed my promptness, my reassurance, my commitment. I stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, soup simmering, heart torn, wondering how to be enough for both."}
