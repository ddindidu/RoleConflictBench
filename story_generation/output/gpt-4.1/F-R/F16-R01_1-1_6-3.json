I nodded, trying to listen, but my mind kept drifting to the text I\u2019d received earlier from a church member. She\u2019d sounded so low, her words heavy with sadness, and I knew she needed someone to reach out. My spouse\u2019s voice softened, and I realized I\u2019d missed the last part of their story. Guilt pricked at me\u2014wasn\u2019t I supposed to be present, to communicate openly and share in these small, important moments? But as a pastor, I felt the pull to check in with the woman from church, to offer a kind word and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. The phone sat between us on the table, a silent reminder of the expectations tugging me in two directions. I wanted to be the attentive partner my spouse deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the quiet plea for support from someone in my care. My heart ached as I weighed the needs of the person across from me against the needs of someone just a message away."}
