Haven\u2019t seen you in ages!\u201d I could almost hear her laughter, feel the warmth of our old rituals\u2014popcorn, silly jokes, the comfort of just being together. She\u2019d been reaching out more lately, hoping we could rebuild the closeness that had faded since I entered the convent. I knew how much it meant to her, this simple act of including me, of making space for us in her life.\n\nBut as I typed my reply, the parish secretary knocked on my door. \u201cSister, Mr. Alvarez needs to see you. He\u2019s struggling with his faith and asked for your guidance tonight.\u201d My heart twisted. The expectation was clear: as a nun, I was to be present, to listen, to offer spiritual counsel. The call to serve was sacred, and I felt its weight.\n\nI sat in silence, torn between the world I\u2019d left behind and the one I\u2019d chosen. My sister\u2019s hope for connection pressed against the parish\u2019s need for comfort. I closed my eyes, feeling the ache of wanting to be everything for everyone, and not knowing how."}
