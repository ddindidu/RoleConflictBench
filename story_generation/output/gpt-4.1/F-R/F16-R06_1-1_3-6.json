It\u2019s been a long week, and I know they\u2019re tired too. I hear the dryer buzz again, a reminder that I\u2019ve let things pile up. My spouse glances at the mess, then at me, and I sense their silent hope that I\u2019ll finally tackle it tonight. \n\nBut just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes with a message from a neighbor who\u2019s having a rough time. She asks if I can come over for a few minutes\u2014she just needs someone to talk to. As a Christian, I believe in showing love and kindness, being there for others as Jesus taught. I want to help her, to be that comforting presence. \n\nYet, I feel torn. If I leave now, the laundry will stay untouched, and my spouse will feel let down. If I stay, I\u2019ll ignore someone who needs compassion. My heart aches as I stand between these two calls, unsure which to answer first."}
