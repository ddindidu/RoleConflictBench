They expect to hear about my day, every detail, and I know it brings them comfort. Tonight, though, as I walk home, I see a woman sitting alone on a bench, crying softly. My phone buzzes\u2014Mom\u2019s message: \u201cAre you home yet?\u201d I know she\u2019ll worry if I don\u2019t reply right away. But I also feel the tug of my faith, the quiet urging to sit beside the woman, to offer a listening ear or a gentle word, just as Jesus would. My parents want reassurance, my presence, my stories. My faith asks me to step outside my routine, to show love to a stranger. I stand on the sidewalk, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the comfort of my family and the call to kindness. The woman\u2019s quiet sobs drift on the evening air, and my phone vibrates again. I hesitate, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to answer first."}
