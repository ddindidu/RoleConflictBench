It\u2019s our tradition to talk before the holiday, to share stories and laughter, to remind him of our family\u2019s love. I know how much these moments mean, especially now that he\u2019s away at college. But as I stand in line at the sweet shop, waiting to buy his favorite laddus, I notice a man quietly slipping ahead of an elderly woman. My heart tugs at me\u2014my Hindu values urge me to speak up, to stand for dharma, for what is right. Yet, my phone vibrates again, and I see my grandson\u2019s name flashing. I feel torn, caught between the warmth of family connection and the call to uphold righteousness, both demanding my attention at the same moment. My mind races, weighing the gentle voice of tradition against the quiet insistence of conscience, unsure which path to follow."}
