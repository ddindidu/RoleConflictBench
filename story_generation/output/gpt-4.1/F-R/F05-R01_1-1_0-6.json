She didn\u2019t seem too upset, but I could sense she wanted me to listen, maybe offer a hug or a few gentle words. I reached for her hand, but my mind wandered to the community gathering I\u2019d just left. There, someone had asked about forgiveness, and I\u2019d shared a parable, hoping to guide them. Now, as my wife spoke, I caught myself wanting to offer her the same lesson\u2014remind her to let go, to forgive, to see the bigger picture. But I hesitated. Was that what she needed from me as her husband, or was I slipping into my pastor\u2019s role, teaching instead of comforting? The weight of both expectations pressed on me. I wanted to be the supportive partner she deserved, but the urge to guide, to teach, was strong. I looked at her, unsure which part of me she needed most in this moment."}
