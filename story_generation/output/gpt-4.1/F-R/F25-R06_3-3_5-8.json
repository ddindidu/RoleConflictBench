My stepmother\u2019s eyes found mine, her voice gentle but firm as she asked me to lead the ritual this year\u2014a tradition passed down for generations. I knew how much it meant to her, to the family, to see me embrace their customs as my own. But as I glanced at my stepbrother, sitting alone in the corner, his face clouded with sadness after a recent argument, my heart ached. My faith as a Christian tugged at me, reminding me that love and kindness should come first, that I should reach out to him, comfort him, even if it meant stepping away from the ceremony at a crucial moment. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014one to honor my new family\u2019s traditions, the other to live out the compassion I believed in. I felt torn, caught between the hope of belonging and the call to show love, unsure which path to take."}
