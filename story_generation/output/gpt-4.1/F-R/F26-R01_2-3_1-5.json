Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the weight she carried, though she hadn\u2019t said a word. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to set aside everything else, to offer her the comfort and wisdom she needed, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone in her struggles. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the church council. The storm last night had left several families without power or shelter, and as their pastor, I was expected to organize immediate support, to be present for those in crisis, to lead with compassion and strength. My heart ached, torn between the silent plea in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes and the urgent needs of my congregation. Both needed me, both expected me to guide and support them, but I could not be in two places at once. I sat there, paralyzed, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
