It\u2019s a role my grandmother once held, and now, as her daughter, I am expected to step up, to honor our family\u2019s traditions and values. I know how much this means to her, to everyone. But as a practicing Hindu, my daily rituals are sacred and precise\u2014each prayer, each chant, each offering must be performed at the right time, in the right way. The family ceremony, though, will take hours and overlap with my scheduled prayers. If I lead the ceremony, I\u2019ll have to skip or rush through my daily rituals, something I\u2019ve never done. My heart pounds as I imagine disappointing my family or failing in my spiritual discipline. I sit quietly, torn between the daughter my family needs and the devotee my faith demands, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
