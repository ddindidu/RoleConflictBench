I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from Mom, just checking in, asking how my week had been. I knew she expected me to reply, to keep the connection strong, to be the daughter who always communicates, even if it\u2019s just a quick text. But just as I was about to type a response, I noticed a woman nearby, sitting alone on a bench, quietly crying. Something in me stirred\u2014the teachings from church, the words about loving your neighbor, about reaching out with kindness. I felt pulled in two directions: my mother\u2019s gentle expectation for a reply, and the Christian call to show compassion to someone in need. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between sending a reassuring message home and walking over to offer comfort to a stranger. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which expectation I should answer first."}
