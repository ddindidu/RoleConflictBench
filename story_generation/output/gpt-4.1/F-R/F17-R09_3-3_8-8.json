She looked at me, her eyes searching for comfort, for the reassurance that everything would be okay. I wanted to be there for her, to hold her hand and listen, to be the child she needed in that moment. But my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for someone\u2019s father. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I knew how important it was in our community, how much it meant to the grieving family. My heart twisted as I looked at my mother, torn between being the support she needed and fulfilling my responsibility as a Jew. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
