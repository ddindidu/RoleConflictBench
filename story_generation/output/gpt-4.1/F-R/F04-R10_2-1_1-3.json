She had just called me, her voice trembling, asking if I could come and be with her after a tough day. As her brother, I knew I had to support her, to listen and comfort her, to be the shoulder she needed. While we waited, a man slipped ahead of us in the queue, pretending not to notice. My heart tightened. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to act with honesty and fairness, even in small matters. I felt the urge to speak up, to gently remind the man about the line, to uphold the values I believed in. But my sister\u2019s hand gripped mine, her eyes pleading for quiet, for peace, for me to just be there for her. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to my sister, and my responsibility to my principles\u2014each pulling me in a different direction."}
