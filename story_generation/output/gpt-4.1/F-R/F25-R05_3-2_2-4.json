She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I was feeling okay. I knew she expected a quick, thoughtful reply\u2014she always said that regular communication was the glue holding our family together. I usually sent her long updates, little stories about my day, and she\u2019d respond with warmth and encouragement. But tonight, as I sat in my office at the synagogue, the clock ticked closer to the start of the children\u2019s Torah class. As their rabbi, I was expected to be fully present, to teach with energy and wisdom, to answer their questions about Jewish law and tradition. The children would be arriving any minute, their parents trusting me to guide them. My phone buzzed again. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my congregation\u2019s need for leadership. My fingers hovered over the screen, my mind torn between the two calls, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
