My granddaughter\u2019s voice trembled as she asked for advice about a painful friendship, her eyes searching mine for comfort and guidance. I felt the familiar pull of my role as her grandmother\u2014she needed my wisdom, my stories, my reassurance that things would be alright. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the temple, eager to discuss the profound sermon we\u2019d heard that morning. She wanted to reflect, to share insights, to deepen our understanding together. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached to be present for my granddaughter, to offer her the support she sought, but I also longed for the quiet, spiritual connection that nourished my Buddhist practice. The demands of both roles swirled within me, each urgent, each important, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to follow in that moment."}
