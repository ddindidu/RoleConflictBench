My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the other room, reminding me that the kids needed new shoes and the fridge was nearly empty. As a parent, I felt the weight of providing for my family, ensuring we had enough for daily living. Yet, on the other side of the table, my open Bible and scattered sermon notes called to me. Sunday was approaching fast, and as the pastor, my congregation expected a thoughtful sermon to guide them in making moral choices. I knew they looked to me for spiritual leadership, for words that would help them navigate their own struggles. But every time I tried to focus on the sermon, my mind drifted back to the unpaid bills and the anxious faces of my children. The pressure to be both a responsible provider and a faithful teacher pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt torn, unsure which role needed me more at that moment."}
