He told me about a difficult meeting at work, his voice light but his eyes tired. I knew he needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present as his wife. I wanted to sit with him, to let him talk, to reassure him that home was his refuge. But just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the evening prayer. I could almost hear the quiet anticipation from the mosque, the trust they placed in me as their imam. My heart pulled in two directions: the warmth of my husband\u2019s need, the weight of my community\u2019s expectation. I stood there, soup spoon in hand, feeling the pressure build inside me, torn between the comfort of my home and the call of my faith."}
