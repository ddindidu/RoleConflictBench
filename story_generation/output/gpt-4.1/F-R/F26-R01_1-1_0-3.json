Her eyes were bright with uncertainty as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to take a big step in life?\u201d I could see she needed more than a simple answer\u2014she wanted the kind of wisdom only years could give. As I searched for the right words, my phone buzzed. A message from the church secretary: Mrs. Evans was having a hard day again, and she\u2019d asked if I could call her soon. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My granddaughter\u2019s hopeful gaze tugged at my heart, but so did the quiet expectation that, as pastor, I would be there for those who needed comfort. I wanted to give my granddaughter my full attention, to share stories and advice, but I also knew Mrs. Evans was waiting for a gentle word. The clock ticked, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my family and my calling to serve others."}
