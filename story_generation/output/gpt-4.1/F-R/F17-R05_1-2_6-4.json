I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her child, I felt the weight of her sadness. I wanted to ask, as I often did, if everything was okay at home, to offer comfort and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the weekly religious school class was about to begin. As the rabbi, I was expected to teach Torah to the children, to be present and inspiring, to guide them in their learning. My congregation counted on me to show up, prepared and focused. My mother looked up, her lips parting as if to speak, and I felt torn. The urge to stay and support her pressed against the obligation to fulfill my duties as a rabbi. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
