At dinner, my mom barely touched her food, and my dad kept sighing, lost in thought. I know they need me\u2014to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort. As their son, I feel responsible for being present, especially now when they seem so fragile. But this week, like every week, my church expects me to be there for Sunday service and the youth group meeting afterward. I\u2019m supposed to help set up, greet newcomers, and join the prayer circle. My pastor always says our commitment to the church community is a reflection of our faith. I feel torn. If I stay home, I worry I\u2019ll let down my church family and maybe even my faith. If I go, I\u2019ll leave my parents alone when they need me most. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
