As a mother, I knew I had to make sure there was enough money for groceries, school fees, and the rent due next week. My children depended on me to keep the house running smoothly, to never let them feel the pinch of our tight budget. But as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. The important festival at the temple was just two days away, and my family expected me to travel with them, to participate in every ritual and make the proper offerings. As a Hindu, it was my duty to honor our traditions, to show my devotion and set an example for my children. The journey would be long and expensive, and the offerings would cost more than I could spare. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me.
