They needed me to be present, to talk honestly about our finances, to share my fears and hopes. I could see the worry in their eyes, the expectation that I would be open, that I would not hide anything. But as the clock ticked closer to six, my mind kept drifting to the chapel, where the congregation would soon gather for the daily prayer service. Even though it was optional, I knew some parishioners counted on my presence, finding comfort in the routine and my guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my spouse needing my undivided attention, my community expecting my spiritual leadership. My heart ached with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down. I looked at my spouse, then at the clock, torn between the vows I made at the altar and the ones I made before God."}
