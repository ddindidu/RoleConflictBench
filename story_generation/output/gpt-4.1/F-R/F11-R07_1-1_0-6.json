Come over tonight\u2014let\u2019s celebrate!\u201d I felt a surge of pride and happiness for her. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, to cheer each other on through every milestone. I started picturing the evening\u2014her favorite cake, laughter, maybe even a toast.\n\nJust as I was about to reply, another message popped up. This one was from Mei, my friend from the Buddhist center. \u201cCan we talk tonight? I really want to discuss the sermon on detachment. It\u2019s been on my mind all day.\u201d I remembered how much these conversations meant to both of us, how they deepened my own understanding and kept me grounded in my practice.\n\nI stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both expectations. My sister needed me to celebrate her joy, to be the supportive sibling I\u2019d always tried to be. Mei needed me to be present, to share in spiritual reflection and growth. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure how to honor both parts of myself without letting someone down."}
