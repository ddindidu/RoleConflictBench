He\u2019d never come to me like this before, and I could see the weight of his worry. As a grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to wrap him in reassurance, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned over a lifetime, to be the steady hand he needed. But as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the appointment I\u2019d promised to keep with Mrs. Evans, a parishioner who\u2019d confided in me about her ongoing struggle with depression. As her priest, I knew how much she depended on my counsel, how fragile her hope was. My heart pulled in two directions: the deep, personal bond of family, and the sacred duty to my flock. Both needed me, both deserved my full attention, and I felt the pressure mounting inside, torn between the wisdom I owed my grandson and the spiritual support I owed Mrs. Evans."}
