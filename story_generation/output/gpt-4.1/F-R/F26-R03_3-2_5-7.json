My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained that my grandson had been rushed to the hospital. \u201cWe need you, Mom,\u201d she pleaded, her words heavy with worry. My heart ached with the pull of family, the urge to comfort, to hold, to be present for them in this moment of fear. \n\nBut just as I hung up, Sister Agnes knocked gently on my door. \u201cSister Maria, Mrs. Delgado is here. She\u2019s in tears\u2014she says she\u2019s lost her faith and needs to speak with you.\u201d The expectation pressed in: as a nun, I am called to guide, to listen, to offer solace to those in spiritual pain. \n\nI felt torn, my soul stretched between two worlds.
