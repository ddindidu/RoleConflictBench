They mentioned, almost in passing, that something at work had upset them, their voice soft, eyes averted. I knew I should ask more, listen, be present\u2014open communication was the foundation of our marriage. But my mind was already elsewhere, weighed down by the knowledge that tonight was the most significant religious holiday of the year. The community expected me to lead the prayers, to be a source of strength and guidance. I could already picture the packed sanctuary, the anticipation in everyone\u2019s faces. My spouse\u2019s words faded into the background as I wrestled with the pull between my duty to them and my responsibility to my congregation. My heart ached, torn by the impossible choice: to stay and be the partner they needed, or to leave and fulfill my calling as a priest."}
