My father was recounting stories from his youth, and my siblings laughed, urging me to join in the preparations. As the eldest son, I was expected to lead the family prayer and help uphold our cherished traditions, especially during these rare gatherings. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon\u2014he was struggling with family issues and needed guidance. As the imam, I knew my community relied on me for support, especially in moments of crisis. My heart tightened. I glanced at my parents, their faces glowing with anticipation, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of Ahmed\u2019s plea. The expectations of my family and my congregation pressed in from both sides, each demanding my presence, each believing their need was most urgent. I closed my eyes, torn between the warmth of home and the call of duty, unsure which path to follow."}
