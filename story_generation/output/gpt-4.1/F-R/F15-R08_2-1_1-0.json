She had been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with excitement as she practiced her lines for the class presentation. As a parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. But tonight was also the one evening this week with no work or errands, a rare pocket of quiet I had set aside for myself. I had been looking forward to spending it in reflection, reciting the Quran, reconnecting with my faith in a way that felt impossible during the usual rush of daily life. The expectation to be present for my child tugged at me, but so did the longing to nurture my spiritual self, to find peace and guidance in the verses. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving my full attention. My heart ached as I stood in the kitchen, caught between the joy of supporting my child and the solace of my faith, unsure which path to choose."}
