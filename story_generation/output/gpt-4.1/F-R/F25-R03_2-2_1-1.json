It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my stepmother and father. They expected to hear my voice, to know I was thinking of them, to share the small details of my week. I could almost hear my stepmother\u2019s gentle reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call us, dear.\u201d But tonight, the convent was buzzing with urgency. Sister Maria had just told us about the family down the street whose house had burned down. The mother was in tears, the children shivering in borrowed coats. The sisters were gathering food and clothing, and I was expected to help\u2014no, needed to help. My vows called me to serve, to be present for those in crisis. Yet, my family\u2019s voices echoed in my mind, their need for connection just as real. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, guilt rising no matter which way I turned. The phone felt heavy in my hand as I listened to the bustle of the sisters preparing to leave, caught between the call of family and the call of faith."}
