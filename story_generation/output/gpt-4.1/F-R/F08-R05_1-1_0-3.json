Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cBubbe, how did you know what to do when you started something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I felt the familiar tug to share stories from my own youth, to offer the gentle, personal wisdom that only a grandmother can give. But as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult education class I was scheduled to teach at the synagogue in half an hour. The topic was \u201cTransitions in Jewish Life,\u201d and I knew several congregants were planning to attend, hoping for guidance rooted in Torah and tradition. I could see the hope in Miriam\u2019s face, the same hope I\u2019d seen in my students\u2019 eyes so many times. My heart twisted as I weighed the needs of my family against my responsibility to my community, both expecting me to guide them through uncertainty. I sat there, torn, the clock ticking, unsure which path to take."}
