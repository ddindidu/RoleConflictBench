Just as I settled onto my cushion, my phone buzzed. The school had emailed\u2014my stepson was caught bullying a classmate. My heart sank. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to attend to this immediately, to show up, to guide him, to be present and supportive. But as a Buddhist, I felt the pull to remain calm, to respond with compassion, not anger, and to honor my commitment to mindfulness. My mind raced with questions: Should I rush to talk to him, or should I first center myself? If I delay, am I failing him as a parent? If I react now, will I lose my temper and forget my practice? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, the silence of my meditation space now filled with the noise of my own inner struggle."}
