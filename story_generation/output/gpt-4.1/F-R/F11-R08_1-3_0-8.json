My younger sister\u2019s graduation was next week, a milestone she\u2019d worked so hard for, and she wanted me there, front row, cheering her on. She\u2019d always been my confidante, and I\u2019d promised to celebrate every achievement with her. But then, the doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year is your best chance. Your health may not allow it later.\u201d Hajj was a pillar of my faith, a journey I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood, and now, it felt like Allah was calling me. But the dates overlapped exactly with my sister\u2019s big day. I felt torn in two\u2014my duty as a sister pulling me one way, my devotion as a Muslim pulling me another. I could almost hear my sister\u2019s laughter, see her searching for me in the crowd, and at the same time, I imagined myself standing before the Kaaba, tears streaming down my face. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
