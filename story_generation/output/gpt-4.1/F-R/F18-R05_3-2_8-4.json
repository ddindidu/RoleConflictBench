Instinctively, I wanted to shout, to grab his arm, to protect him\u2014just as I always had. But at that very moment, a group of children and their parents gathered at the synagogue entrance, waiting for me to begin the weekly Torah class. They looked to me for guidance, for wisdom, for the structure of Jewish law that I was meant to impart. I could hear their voices, feel their expectation. My brother was oblivious, one foot already in the street, and I was torn. My duty as a sibling screamed at me to run to him, to ensure his safety. Yet my role as rabbi demanded I stay, to fulfill my promise to the community, to teach and lead. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the pull of family and the call of faith, unsure which way to turn."}
