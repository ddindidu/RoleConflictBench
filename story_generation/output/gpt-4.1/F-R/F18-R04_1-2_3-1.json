My younger sister eagerly described her idea for a weekend picnic, and my parents looked to me, hoping I\u2019d join in the planning. I could see how much it meant to them; we rarely had time together, and they wanted me to be part of these moments. Just as I was about to suggest a park, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee flashed on the screen: \u201cBackup imam is out of town. Can you lead the prayers this weekend?\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my chest. The congregation depended on me, especially now, and I knew how important it was to be present for them. But my family\u2019s hopeful faces reminded me of the promises I\u2019d made to spend more time with them. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself caught between the warmth of my family and the duty I felt toward my community, unsure which path to take."}
