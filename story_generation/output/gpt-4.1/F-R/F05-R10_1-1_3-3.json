My wife glanced at me, her eyes tired, and I knew she hoped I\u2019d help fold the clothes tonight. As a husband, I wanted to share the load, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in these daily battles. But my mind kept drifting back to work, to the moment I saw a colleague quietly slip ahead in the lunch line, ignoring the others waiting patiently. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small things. I felt I should have spoken up, gently reminded my colleague about fairness. Now, guilt gnawed at me for staying silent, for not living up to the ethical standards I hold dear. The laundry called for my attention, my wife\u2019s unspoken request hanging in the air, but my conscience tugged me back to that moment at work. I stood in the hallway, torn between making things right at home and wrestling with the feeling that I\u2019d failed my own principles."}
