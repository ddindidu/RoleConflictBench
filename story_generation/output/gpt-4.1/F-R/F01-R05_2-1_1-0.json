The congregation expected inspiration, clarity, and a message that would resonate. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the living room, where my grandson sat curled up on the couch, shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on nothing. I could sense his discouragement, the way he avoided my gaze, the heaviness in his silence. As a grandfather, I wanted to set aside everything, sit beside him, and offer the wisdom of my years, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressing in\u2014sermons don\u2019t write themselves, and the calendar waits for no one. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full presence, each expectation valid and urgent. I stared at my notes, unable to write a single word, torn between the call of my family and the call of my faith."}
