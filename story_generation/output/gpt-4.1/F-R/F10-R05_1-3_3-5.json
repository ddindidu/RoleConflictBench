As a daughter, I was expected to uphold our family\u2019s traditions, to be there, especially tonight. But as a rabbi, I had promised Miriam this last session before her Beit Din. She was anxious, her conversion journey culminating in this moment, and she needed my guidance and reassurance. I could picture her waiting, clutching her notes, hoping I would help her feel ready. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my family\u2019s warmth and pride, my mother\u2019s hopeful eyes, against Miriam\u2019s trust in me as her teacher and guide. I felt the tension coil inside me, torn between the table set for family and the sacred responsibility to my student."}
