My sister, eyes red from crying, clung to my arm. She\u2019d just gone through a painful breakup, and this community dinner was supposed to lift her spirits. She whispered, \u201cPlease, just eat with me. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d I could see how much she needed me, how much she wanted us to sit together, share a meal, and talk like we always did when things got hard.\n\nBut as I looked at the food, I realized nothing was kosher-certified. The organizers had tried their best, but there were no labels, no familiar symbols. I knew the rules\u2014what I could and couldn\u2019t eat. My parents had always taught me to keep kosher, to honor our traditions, even when it was inconvenient. Yet here was my sister, needing me in a way that felt just as sacred.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and my sister\u2019s trembling hand on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, caught between being a good brother and a faithful Jew."}
