This Saturday was circled in bright red\u2014our long-awaited family gathering. My daughter had called earlier in the week, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me, how they\u2019d been counting down the days. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being surrounded by those I love most.\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the synagogue. I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion during the Shabbat service, something I had committed to weeks ago. As a Jewish woman, attending services and participating actively in the community is not just a duty, but a source of spiritual fulfillment and pride. The rabbi had even mentioned how much the congregation appreciated my voice and presence.\n\nNow, the two worlds collided. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and hugs, to be the grandmother they cherished. My faith and community expected me to honor my commitment, to stand before the ark and chant. I sat at my kitchen table, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
