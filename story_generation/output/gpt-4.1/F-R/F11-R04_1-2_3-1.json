My younger brother nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for the weekend trip to the lake. My parents looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d say yes for once, instead of disappearing for mosque duties. I wanted to be there, to be the sister who joined in, who didn\u2019t always have to leave early or miss out. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and everyone was counting on me to lead the prayers. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I didn\u2019t show up. My heart twisted, caught between the warmth of my family and the weight of my responsibility to the community. I tried to smile, but inside, I was torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
