I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her. As her husband, I felt the pull to sit beside her, to ask about her day, to share my own worries from work, and to let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. We\u2019d promised each other honesty and openness, and I wanted to be there for her, to talk through whatever was on her mind.\n\nBut as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. Passover was only days away, and I hadn\u2019t yet taught the kids the blessings for the Seder. My father\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the importance of passing down our traditions, of making sure our children understood their heritage. I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on me, knowing how much it mattered.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. Should I sit with Sarah and be the supportive husband she needed, or gather the kids and fulfill my duty as a Jewish parent? The expectations from both roles pulled at me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
