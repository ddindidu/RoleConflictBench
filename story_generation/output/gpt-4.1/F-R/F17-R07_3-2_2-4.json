My phone, silenced but not forgotten, sits just out of reach. Every week, I look forward to this hour of stillness with my Buddhist group, a time to let go of distractions and focus on my breath. But today, my mind keeps drifting to my parents. They expect me to check in every evening, to share how my day went, to answer their messages quickly. I know they worry if I don\u2019t reply right away. \n\nAs the group leader guides us deeper into meditation, my phone vibrates with a message\u2014I can almost feel it. My heart tugs in two directions: the comfort of fulfilling my parents\u2019 expectations, and the peace I find in honoring my Buddhist practice. I want to be a good child, attentive and present for my family, but I also want to be true to my spiritual path, to give myself fully to this hour of mindfulness. The tension coils in my chest as I sit, eyes closed, wrestling with the urge to reach for my phone."}
