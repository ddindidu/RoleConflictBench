As his sister, I wanted to reach out, hug him, and tell him everything would be okay, to listen without judgment and just be there for him. I remembered all the times we\u2019d fought as kids, how hard we\u2019d worked to build trust and respect between us. But as his pastor, I felt the weight of my responsibility to guide him spiritually, to help him see the consequences of his choices and encourage him to do what was right, even if it was hard to hear. He looked at me, searching for comfort, but also for answers. My heart ached, torn between the gentle patience of a sister and the firm guidance of a pastor. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to let speak first."}
