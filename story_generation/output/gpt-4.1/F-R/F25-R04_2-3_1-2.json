Every Sunday evening, I called my stepfather and mother, just as I promised when I moved out. They waited for my voice, for stories about my week, for the comfort that I hadn\u2019t forgotten them. But tonight, the mosque was full\u2014more than usual. A beloved elder had passed, and the community gathered for a special remembrance. I was the only imam present, the only one who could lead the prayers. The congregation\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for guidance, for words of solace. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a reminder I set for these calls. My heart twisted. If I led the prayer, I\u2019d miss the call, and my parents would worry, maybe feel neglected. If I stepped outside to call, I\u2019d leave the community without their imam in a moment of need. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between two families, two sets of expectations, unable to move."}
