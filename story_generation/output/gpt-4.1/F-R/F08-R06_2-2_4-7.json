Today was her big day\u2014she\u2019d been practicing her piano piece for weeks, and the whole family was gathering to hear her play. She\u2019d asked me to sit right in the front row, to be there for her, to share in her joy. My heart swelled with pride and love.\n\nBut as I set the cookies on a plate, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Linda, a woman from church who\u2019d recently lost her husband. She wrote that she was struggling, feeling alone, and wondered if I could come by for a cup of tea. I knew what Jesus would do\u2014He would go to her, offer comfort, show kindness. That\u2019s what I\u2019d always tried to do, to live my faith in action.\n\nYet, my family expected me to be present, to celebrate with them, to be the grandmother who never missed a moment. My faith called me to reach out, to be there for someone in pain. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which love should come first."}
