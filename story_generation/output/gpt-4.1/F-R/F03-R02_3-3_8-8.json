She looked at me, her eyes searching for reassurance, for the comfort only a son could give. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her vulnerability. My phone buzzed on the table, a message from the parish secretary: the Martinez family needed me to lead a final preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight, no postponement possible. I could picture the little girl\u2019s anxious face, her parents\u2019 hope resting on my guidance. My mother\u2019s voice wavered, pulling me back. She needed me here, now, to listen and hold her together. But the church needed me too, to fulfill my promise and shepherd a family through a sacred milestone. My heart pounded as I tried to be present for my mother, while my mind raced through lesson plans and prayers. I felt torn, the expectations of son and priest pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent, each impossible to ignore."}
