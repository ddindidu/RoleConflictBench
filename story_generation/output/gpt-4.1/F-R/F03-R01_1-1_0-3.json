I see a text from my mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Miss you.\u201d I haven\u2019t called her in a week, just sent a quick text yesterday. Guilt pricks at me\u2014she always wants to hear my voice, not just read a line or two. But before I can reply, my phone buzzes again. It\u2019s a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of the congregation. She\u2019s been struggling since her husband passed, and I\u2019ve been checking in with her, sending her encouraging words. She writes, \u201cThank you for your prayers, Pastor. It means a lot.\u201d I know she needs more than a text, maybe a visit or a call, but I only have so much time. My parents expect me to be present, to share my life with them, but my congregation needs me too. I stare at my phone, torn between calling my mom and reaching out to Mrs. Carter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
