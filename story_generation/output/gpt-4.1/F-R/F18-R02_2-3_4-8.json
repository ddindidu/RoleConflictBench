Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the roast and hear the laughter that always filled our kitchen. Family dinners were sacred in their own way, a rare chance for all of us to be together, to catch up, to just be siblings again. But as I set my phone down, another message buzzed in\u2014this one from the Martinez family. Their son\u2019s sacrament was this weekend, and they needed me to lead a final preparation session tonight. It was the only time their whole family could gather, and I knew how much this meant to them. As a priest, I was expected to be there for my parishioners, to guide and support them, especially at such important moments. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, present at the table, but I was also the priest, called to serve. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat in silence, torn between two worlds that both needed me tonight."}
