My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. But my phone buzzed with a message from the parish: the Martinez family needed a final preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament, and it had to be tonight. As a priest, I was expected to guide and support my parishioners, especially at such important moments. I could hear the tension in Mrs. Martinez\u2019s voice, her anxiety about her daughter\u2019s readiness. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed comfort, and toward my parish, who needed leadership. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, torn between the silent plea in my parents\u2019 eyes and the urgent call of my vocation, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
