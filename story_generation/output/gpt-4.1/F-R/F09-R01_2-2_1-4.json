She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I would be there. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her eyes shining with hope. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. \n\nBut this morning, just as I was packing her lunch, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Lee from church, her voice trembling as she explained her husband had left unexpectedly, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. She needed someone to talk to, someone to pray with her, right now. As her pastor, I knew how much she depended on me for support, especially in moments like this.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My daughter\u2019s expectant face, the trust in her eyes. Mrs. Lee\u2019s desperate voice, the faith she placed in my guidance. I stood in the kitchen, torn between the classroom and the living room, between being the mother my daughter needed and the pastor my community relied on, my heart aching as I tried to figure out how to be both."}
