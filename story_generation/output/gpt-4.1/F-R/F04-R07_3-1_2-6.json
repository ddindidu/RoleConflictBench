It was my younger sister, her message short but urgent: \u201cCan I call? I really need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, no matter what. But tonight, my Buddhist friend had also asked if we could talk about the sermon we\u2019d both attended\u2014he was wrestling with some of the teachings, and I\u2019d agreed to help him reflect.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My sister needed comfort, someone to listen and support her. My friend needed spiritual companionship, someone to help him make sense of his path. Both roles mattered deeply to me, but the demands were pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached with the urge to help them both, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The silence of my room was suddenly heavy, filled with the tension of choosing between family and faith."}
