I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her step-child, I felt a responsibility to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home. My father expected it too, hoping I\u2019d help bridge the gap between us all. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a message from my cousin in Mecca, reminding me that this year\u2019s Hajj registration was closing soon. \n\nAs a Muslim, I felt the weight of that obligation\u2014performing Hajj is a pillar of my faith, and my friends were already making plans. But I was just starting my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone save for a pilgrimage. My stepmother looked at me, waiting for me to speak, and I felt torn. Should I focus on being present for my family, or start planning for the journey my faith demands? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, caught between the two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
