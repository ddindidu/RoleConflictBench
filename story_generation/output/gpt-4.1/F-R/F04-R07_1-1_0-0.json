As her brother, I know how much it means to her that I\u2019m there, cheering her on, sharing in her joy. She\u2019s always counted on me to show up for her big moments, and I want to be the supportive brother she deserves. But tonight is also the night of the temple\u2019s routine evening chant, a ceremony I\u2019ve never missed since I took my vows. The sangha expects my presence, and I feel a deep responsibility to uphold my commitment to the Buddhist community. The thought of letting down either my sister or my fellow practitioners weighs heavily on me. I can picture my sister\u2019s hopeful face, and at the same time, I hear the gentle, rhythmic chanting that brings me peace. My heart aches as I stand at this crossroads, torn between two worlds that both define who I am."}
