We\u2019re both tense, the weight of our conversation about our mounting medical bills pressing down on us. I know I owe my spouse honesty\u2014full transparency about the savings I\u2019ve tucked away, the debts I haven\u2019t mentioned, the fears I\u2019ve tried to hide. But my stomach growls, reminding me that we haven\u2019t eaten since morning. My spouse suggests grabbing something quick from the food trucks outside, but I hesitate. Only one small vendor nearby is kosher-certified, and I know the lines are long and the options limited. My spouse, not Jewish, doesn\u2019t always understand why I can\u2019t just eat anywhere, especially when we\u2019re stressed and hungry. I feel the pressure to be open and present in this conversation, to meet my spouse\u2019s need for connection and trust. At the same time, I feel the pull of my Jewish identity, the commitment to keep kosher even when it\u2019s inconvenient. The expectations tug at me from both sides, and I can feel myself caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
