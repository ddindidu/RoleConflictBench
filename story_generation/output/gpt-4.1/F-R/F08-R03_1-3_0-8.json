My granddaughter\u2019s message blinked on my phone: \u201cGrandma, can we talk? I need your advice about starting college.\u201d My heart swelled with love and the familiar urge to guide her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades. Yet, just as I reached for the phone, a soft knock came at my door. It was Sister Agnes, reminding me that Mother Superior wanted to see me. The retreat was approaching, and I\u2019d been chosen to lead the daily reflections\u2014a sacred responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual preparation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My granddaughter needed me as her grandmother, her confidante, her guide. But my sisters needed me as a nun, devoted and present, ready to nurture their faith. I closed my eyes, torn between the pull of family and the call of my vocation, my heart aching with the impossibility of being fully present for both."}
