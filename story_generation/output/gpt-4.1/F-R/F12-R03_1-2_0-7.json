He didn\u2019t sound upset, but I could sense the fatigue in his words, the subtle way he lingered on the story of his boss\u2019s criticism. As his wife, I knew he needed me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just a gentle hand on his shoulder and a few words to remind him he was valued. But my phone buzzed with a message from the parish: a young woman was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present for those in spiritual need, to offer guidance and prayer, especially in moments of doubt. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in on me\u2014my husband\u2019s unspoken need for reassurance, the parishioner\u2019s urgent plea for spiritual support. My heart pulled in two directions, guilt and responsibility tangling together as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, my husband\u2019s worried eyes on me, and the chapel\u2019s quiet promise of solace in the other."}
