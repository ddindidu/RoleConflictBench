She looked at me, her eyes searching for honesty, for the open communication we promised each other when we married. I knew she expected me to share everything\u2014my worries about the medical expenses, the uncertainty about my job. She needed my full attention, my transparency, and my support.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with another reminder: the church group was meeting tonight, and I was expected to be there. As a Christian, I was supposed to attend every service, to be present in worship and community, to show my commitment not just in words but in action. The pastor had even asked me to help organize the event.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I stayed, I might disappoint my church family and feel like I was neglecting my faith. If I left, I\u2019d be breaking the trust my wife needed most right now. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I could bear to let down."}
