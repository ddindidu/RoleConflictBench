My hands moved automatically, arranging the flowers and incense, but my mind was elsewhere. Just moments before, I had seen my granddaughter sitting alone on the veranda, her shoulders slumped, eyes distant. I could sense her sadness, the way only a grandmother can. My heart ached to go to her, to offer the comfort and wisdom I have gathered over a lifetime. Yet, the time for my daily prayers had arrived\u2014a sacred duty I have never neglected, a practice that grounds me in my faith and connects me to the divine. I stood torn, the lamp in my hand trembling slightly. Should I pause my ritual, breaking a tradition I hold dear, or should I trust that my granddaughter will find her way, just as I must honor my own path? The weight of both roles pressed upon me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction."}
