The school bell will ring in twenty minutes, and my kids will be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there, like always, to hear about their day and walk them home. But my stomach growls, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast. Traveling has made it so hard to keep kosher, but I spotted a tiny vendor a few blocks away\u2014one of the only places I know is certified. If I go now, I can grab something quick, but I\u2019ll be cutting it close, maybe even late. If I wait until after pickup, the vendor will be closed, and I\u2019ll have nothing kosher to eat until tomorrow. My children expect me to be there, present and reliable. My faith expects me to honor the laws I\u2019ve kept my whole life. I stand on the sidewalk, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of myself to disappoint."}
