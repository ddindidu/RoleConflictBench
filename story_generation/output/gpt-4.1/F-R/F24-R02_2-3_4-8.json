My stepmother had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, especially since we hadn\u2019t all gathered in months. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me that being present was part of being family now. At the same time, my parish office phone blinked with a voicemail from the Martinez family. Their daughter\u2019s sacrament was this weekend, and they needed me to lead a final, mandatory preparation session tonight\u2014the only time their whole family could attend. As a priest, I knew how much this moment meant to them, how the Church expected me to guide and support my parishioners, especially at such milestones. My chest tightened as I weighed the two calls on my time and heart. I wanted to be the reliable step-sibling my family hoped for, but I also felt the sacred responsibility to my parish. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting my devotion."}
