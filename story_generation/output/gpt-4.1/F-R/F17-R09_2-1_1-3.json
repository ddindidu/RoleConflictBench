It\u2019s our tradition, and I know how much it means to them. Tonight, as I dial, I\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the plate of cookies my mom sent last week. She baked them herself, just like she used to when I was little. But this time, she tried a new recipe, and I can see from the label that one of the ingredients isn\u2019t kosher. I know she meant well\u2014she just wanted to surprise me with something special. \n\nAs the phone rings, I feel a knot in my stomach. I want to tell her how much I appreciate the cookies, how much I love her for thinking of me. But I also know she\u2019ll ask if I tried them, and I can\u2019t lie. I want to make her happy, to be the good child who shares everything and makes her proud. At the same time, I want to honor my commitment to keeping kosher, something that\u2019s become so important to me. The phone clicks as she answers, and I\u2019m caught between wanting to make her smile and staying true to my beliefs."}
