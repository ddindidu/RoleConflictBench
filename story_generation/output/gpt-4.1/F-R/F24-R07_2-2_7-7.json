He\u2019d been talking about this new skateboard trick for days, and now he was determined to try it, despite my warnings about the uneven surface. As his step-sibling, I felt a knot of responsibility in my stomach\u2014I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been eager to explore, one that promised insight into letting go of attachment and cultivating mindfulness. My teacher expected us to be present, to engage deeply, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another session. I glanced at my phone, the meeting starting in fifteen minutes, while my stepbrother called out, \u201cHey, can you spot me?\u201d The pull between staying to watch over him and leaving for my spiritual commitment twisted inside me, each role demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn, unable to move in either direction."}
