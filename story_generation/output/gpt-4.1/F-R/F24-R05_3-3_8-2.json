The congregation would be gathering soon, and as their rabbi, I was expected to offer words of wisdom and comfort, to guide them through the holiest day of the year. My phone buzzed with reminders from the synagogue board, each message a reminder of the weight of my responsibility. \n\nThen, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my step-brother, Sam, distracted by his phone, stepping off the curb without looking. My heart lurched. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he was safe, especially since our parents trusted me to keep an eye on him today. But if I ran after him, I\u2019d risk missing the start of the service, disappointing the entire congregation and failing in my duty as their rabbi. \n\nI felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, my mind caught between the safety of my brother and the spiritual needs of my community."}
