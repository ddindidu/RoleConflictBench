My son\u2019s eyes had sparkled with hope when I promised him this gift for his birthday. As a parent, I wanted to keep my word, to see his joy, to show him that I could provide. But the price tag gnawed at me. Money was tight this month, and I knew that buying this would mean cutting corners elsewhere\u2014maybe even skipping a donation to the church or not helping a neighbor in need as I usually did.\n\nAs a Christian, I was taught to be generous, to put others before myself, to avoid materialism. Was I teaching my son the wrong lesson by giving in to his wishes? Was I putting our family\u2019s wants above our duty to help others? The weight of these expectations pressed on me, my heart torn between the joy of fulfilling a promise and the call to live out my faith. I stood there, wrestling with what was right, the Nintendo box growing heavier in my hands."}
