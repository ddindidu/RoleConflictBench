Dad had left for work early, and the house felt heavy with unspoken words. As a step-child, I knew I should ask her if everything was okay, offer some comfort, but I hesitated. Our relationship was still new, and I worried my questions would seem intrusive or forced. Yet, as a Christian, I felt the tug to show kindness, to reach out with love as Jesus taught. I wanted to offer a gentle word, maybe help with the dishes, but my fear of overstepping held me back. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family needing my support, my faith urging me to act with compassion. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do, torn between the awkwardness of my role at home and the call to be a source of kindness. I opened my mouth, unsure of what would come out, caught in the tension of wanting to do right by both my family and my faith."}
