It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you come? I really need you.\u201d She rarely reached out like this, and I could sense the urgency in her words. As her brother, I knew I should be there for her, especially when she was in distress. But as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah in less than an hour. The congregation counted on me for guidance and inspiration every week. \n\nI remembered that we had an invited guest speaker today, someone who had prepared a sermon and could step in if needed. But would the community understand if I wasn\u2019t the one on the pulpit? Would my absence disappoint them or make them question my commitment? My heart ached as I weighed my sister\u2019s need for support against my responsibility to the mosque. The pressure of both roles pressed down on me, and I found myself torn, unable to ignore the pull of either duty."}
