My son\u2019s excited voice echoed from the living room, reminding me of the promise I\u2019d made weeks ago: a Nintendo for his birthday. He\u2019d been counting down the days, his eyes shining with hope every time he mentioned it. As a mother, I wanted to give him everything, to see him happy and to keep my promise. But the numbers in my bank account told a different story. We were barely making ends meet, and I knew that buying the Nintendo would mean cutting back on groceries or skipping a bill.\n\nAt the same time, my faith pressed on my conscience. As a Christian, I tried to live simply, to avoid material excess, and to teach my son the value of gratitude and contentment. Was I teaching him to want more than he needed? Was I putting worldly happiness above spiritual lessons? The pressure from both sides squeezed my heart. I wanted to be a good mother, but I also wanted to be true to my beliefs. I stared at the envelope, torn between the joy in my son\u2019s eyes and the quiet voice of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
