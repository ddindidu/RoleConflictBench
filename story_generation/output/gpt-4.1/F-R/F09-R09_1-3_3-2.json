The bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he still stumbles over the Hebrew words, his frustration mounting with every attempt. As his mother, I want to teach him patience, perseverance, and the importance of discipline\u2014values I believe will serve him well in life. But as a Jewish parent, I feel the weight of tradition pressing on my shoulders. The community expects him to chant his portion flawlessly, to honor our ancestors and our faith. I hear my own mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important this milestone is, how it shapes a child\u2019s Jewish identity. Yet, I see my son\u2019s eyes glaze over, his spirit dimming with every correction I offer. I want to guide him gently, to nurture his confidence, but I also fear letting him down\u2014letting our family down\u2014if he isn\u2019t ready. The two roles pull at me, each demanding something different, and I sit there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
