I settle into my favorite chair, Quran in hand, ready to recite and let the words soothe my heart. But my phone buzzes, lighting up with a message from my granddaughter. She just started her new job, and the family group chat is alive with her updates\u2014photos of her desk, her first lunch, her beaming smile. I know how much it means to her, and to everyone, that I join in, share my pride, and keep the conversation going. As a grandmother, I feel the pull to be present, to nurture these moments, to show her she is seen and celebrated.\n\nYet, as a Muslim, I cherish these rare, uninterrupted evenings for my own spiritual growth. The Quran rests in my lap, a gentle reminder of my commitment to deepen my faith, to recite and reflect in peace. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s joy and toward my own need for spiritual connection. I sit, phone in one hand, Quran in the other, torn between the warmth of family and the quiet call of faith, unsure which to answer first."}
