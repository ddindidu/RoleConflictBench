She had just landed her first job, and her excitement leapt off the screen. She wanted to call, to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I celebrated with her. As a grandparent, I felt the weight of being present, of nurturing these moments that build our bond. Yet, as I scrolled through her photos, my mind drifted to the other expectation pressing on my heart: the call to perform Hajj. I had always dreamed of fulfilling this pillar of my faith, but my savings were modest, and I had promised myself to set aside every extra bit for the pilgrimage. Now, with my granddaughter\u2019s new job, there would be more family gatherings, more gifts, more travel to see her. I felt torn\u2014between the joy of being the grandparent she needed and the quiet, persistent longing to answer the call of my faith. My heart wrestled with the demands, unsure which path to follow."}
