My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you please handle the laundry today? The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. But as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes\u2014a gentle reminder that I am leading the weekly meditation group in less than an hour. As a Buddhist, I am expected to guide others in mindfulness, to be present and calm, to honor the commitment I made to the sangha. My heart tugs in two directions: the tangible needs of my family and the spiritual needs of my community. I feel tension coil in my chest, guilt and anxiety mingling as I stand between the hum of the washing machine and the quiet sanctuary of meditation. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the demands of both worlds press in, each expecting my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
