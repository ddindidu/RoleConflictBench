As his wife, I know when something is weighing on him. I want to sit beside him, ask what\u2019s wrong, and listen\u2014really listen\u2014like we promised each other we would. But my laptop is open, the blinking cursor taunting me. The High Holiday sermon is only hours away, and as the rabbi, I\u2019m expected to offer words that will guide and inspire the entire congregation. My mind is split: one part rehearsing lines about hope and renewal, the other aching to reach out to David, to be present for him. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the guilt of choosing one over the other twists inside me. I stand in the doorway, torn, the clock ticking louder with every heartbeat."}
