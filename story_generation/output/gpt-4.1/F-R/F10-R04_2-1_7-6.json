As their daughter, I felt a pull to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to offer comfort and listen to their worries. But just as I was about to join them, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sister Amina, a member of our mosque. She wrote, \u201cWhenever you have a moment, I\u2019d love to talk. I\u2019m struggling and could use your guidance.\u201d As the imam, I knew how much people relied on me for spiritual support, especially those who rarely reached out. My heart ached, torn between the urge to be present for my parents and the responsibility I felt toward my community. I stood in the hallway, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which need was greater or how to choose between them."}
