My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, \u201cCan you please fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019ve got to finish this project.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of the request settle on my shoulders. As a spouse, I wanted to share the load, to show I cared in these small, everyday ways. But tonight was also the temple\u2019s evening chant\u2014a ritual I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss, a time to reconnect with my sangha and my own practice. The clock ticked closer to seven. I could already hear the distant bell in my mind, calling the community together. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of home, the comfort of shared chores, and the quiet pull of the temple, the promise of peace and belonging. I stood in the hallway, laundry in my arms, torn between the expectations of love and the commitments of faith, unsure which path to take."}
