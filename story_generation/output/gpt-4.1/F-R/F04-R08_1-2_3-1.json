My younger sister nudged me, asking what I thought about going to the beach this weekend. My parents looked at me, waiting for my input, and I knew they expected me to join in, to be present, to help make these moments special. But as I smiled and nodded, my mind drifted elsewhere. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. I could feel the weight of those missed pages, the quiet guilt of not keeping up with my spiritual goals. I wanted to be the brother who was always there, who made memories with his family, but I also wanted to be the Muslim who honored his commitments to Allah, especially in this sacred month. The two roles tugged at me from opposite sides, each demanding my time, my attention, my heart. As the conversation about the weekend grew more animated, I sat in silence, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet call of my faith, unsure which path to follow."}
