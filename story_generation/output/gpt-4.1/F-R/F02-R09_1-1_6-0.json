He\u2019d been saving up, counting the days until I would take him to buy the Nintendo he\u2019d wanted for months. As a father, I wanted to give him that joy, to see his face light up and to keep my word. But the numbers in my bank account told a different story\u2014rent was due soon, and work had been slow. I felt the weight of providing for my family pressing down on me.\n\nAt the same time, tonight was our weekly study slot. I\u2019d planned to teach him about the story of Passover, to share with him the traditions and values that shaped our family. I knew I could move the lesson to another night, but I worried about what message that would send. Was I showing him that our heritage could be set aside for something material? Or was I being too rigid, not allowing him the simple happiness of a new game?\n\nThe expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which promise to keep."}
