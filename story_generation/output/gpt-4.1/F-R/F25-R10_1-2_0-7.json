My stepmother had texted, \u201cCan you call us this weekend? Dad misses you.\u201d I knew I should reply, maybe even call, but my mind was already tangled with preparations for the puja at my aunt\u2019s house. As a Hindu, I was expected to be there early, help with the decorations, and join the prayers in my best kurta. The family would notice if I was late or distracted. But if I ignored my stepmother\u2019s message, I\u2019d be letting down my dad, who always tried so hard to make me feel included. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014one asking for my presence and devotion, the other for my attention and care. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be a good step-child and a devoted Hindu at the same time, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
