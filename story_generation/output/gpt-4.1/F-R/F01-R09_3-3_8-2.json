She was struggling, her voice tight with worry about her job and her health. As a grandfather, I knew I should call her, offer comfort, and check in on my grandson, who was quiet lately. But as I glanced at the dining room, I saw my grandson hunched over his Hebrew books, frustration etched on his face. His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Torah portion. My heart ached with the weight of both roles\u2014my family needed me to be present, to listen, to support. Yet, as a Jewish grandfather, I felt the deep responsibility to guide my grandson, to pass on our traditions, to ensure he felt confident and proud on his special day. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need was greater, feeling the pressure of being both a grandfather and a bearer of our faith."}
