It was from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to respond promptly and thoughtfully, to help them feel seen and supported as they began planning such a significant moment. But just as I started to type a reply, my stepmother walked in, her face drawn and tired. I remembered my promise to myself\u2014to check in more, to be the kind of step-child who noticed when things weren\u2019t right. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I asked, my voice gentle. She hesitated, then sat down across from me, her eyes searching mine. I could feel the weight of her unspoken worries, the expectation that I would listen, offer comfort, be present. My phone buzzed again, the couple\u2019s excitement palpable even through the screen. I felt torn, pulled between the needs of my family and the responsibilities of my calling. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, the demands of both roles pressing in on me, each urgent in its own way."}
