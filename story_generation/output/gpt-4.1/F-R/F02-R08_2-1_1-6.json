She had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she mentioned her science project. As her father, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, to watch her present and to show her that I cared. But as I sipped my tea, my mind wandered to the other expectation that weighed on me\u2014my duty as a Muslim to perform Hajj. I was still early in my career, and every extra hour at work, every bit of overtime, was a step closer to saving enough for the pilgrimage. The open class was scheduled for a weekday afternoon, right in the middle of my shift. If I took time off, it would mean less pay, another delay in reaching my goal. My heart ached as I thought about the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s face if I missed her big day, and the quiet guilt that gnawed at me for postponing a pillar of my faith. I stared at the invitation, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
