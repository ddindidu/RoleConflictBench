But today, my phone vibrated with a message from my son\u2019s school: he had been caught bullying a classmate. My heart clenched. As a parent, I knew I should be at the school, facing the teachers, comforting my child, and addressing his actions. But as a nun, I was expected in the chapel, kneeling in silent devotion with my sisters, fulfilling my commitment to God and community. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my son needed guidance and love, but my spiritual family needed my presence and prayers. I stood in the corridor, torn between the chapel\u2019s open doors and the urgent call from the school, feeling the impossible pull of two lives I had chosen, each demanding all of me at the same moment."}
