My parents would be waiting, expecting to hear about my week, to share their stories, to feel connected. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, asking if I was eating well, if work was stressful, if I was happy. But on my desk, the Buddhist texts lay open, pages marked and notes scattered. My teacher had asked me to summarize the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, a responsibility I\u2019d never had before. I wanted to do it well, to honor the Dharma and my teacher\u2019s trust. My mind tugged in two directions: the warmth and duty of being a good daughter, and the quiet, focused reflection required of a sincere Buddhist practitioner. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart caught between the comfort of family and the call of spiritual growth. The phone vibrated with a message from my mother: \u201cAre you calling tonight?\u201d I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
