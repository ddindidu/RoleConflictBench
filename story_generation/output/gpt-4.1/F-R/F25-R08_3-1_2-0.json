My stepmom had just sent another message, asking about my day and reminding me to call her before it got too late. She always wanted to know everything\u2014what I ate, who I talked to, how I felt. I knew she expected me to reply quickly, to keep up the daily rhythm we\u2019d built since I moved in. But tonight, my heart ached for something quieter. The Quran lay open on my desk, its pages inviting me to recite and reflect, to find peace in the words and reconnect with my faith. I could almost hear the verses in my mind, calling me to slow down and be present. Yet, the pressure to be a good step-child tugged at me, making me feel guilty for even hesitating. My thumb hovered over the reply button, but my eyes kept drifting to the Quran. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding my attention, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
