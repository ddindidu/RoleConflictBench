My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the family crisis\u2014my grandson had gotten into trouble at school, and everyone looked to me for guidance and comfort. As a grandmother, I knew my presence was needed, to hold the family together, to offer wisdom and reassurance. But as I listened, my eyes drifted to the window, where I had just witnessed our neighbor, a respected official, accepting a bribe from a stranger. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act against adharma, no matter the cost. The teachings of my faith echoed in my mind, urging me to report the wrongdoing, to uphold truth and justice. Yet, my family\u2019s crisis demanded my full attention, my love, my time. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I could not give to the other. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where my duty truly lay."}
