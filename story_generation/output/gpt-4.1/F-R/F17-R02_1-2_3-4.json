My father caught my eye, nodding toward the empty seat beside him, a silent reminder of the importance of being present, of honoring the rituals that had shaped us for generations. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Mrs. Carter, confirming our appointment. She needed to talk, she wrote, her words heavy with the weight of her struggle. As a priest, I knew my role was to be there for her, to offer comfort and guidance when she needed it most. But as a child, I felt the pull of my family\u2019s expectations, the unspoken demand to be part of this moment, to uphold the values they cherished. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the call of my vocation, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
