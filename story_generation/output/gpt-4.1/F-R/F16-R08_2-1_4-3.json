My spouse had asked me to help with the chores today, and the laundry basket was overflowing. I knew the kids would need clean clothes for school tomorrow, and my partner was counting on me to share the load. I set the basket down and reached for my most comfortable clothes\u2014an old pair of shorts and a tank top, perfect for a day spent folding and sorting in the heat of our small apartment.\n\nBut as I caught my reflection in the mirror, a wave of discomfort washed over me. Even though it was just my immediate family at home, I felt the tug of my faith, the expectation to dress modestly, even in private spaces. I hesitated, torn between the ease of movement and comfort I craved for the chores, and the quiet voice inside reminding me of my commitment to Islamic guidelines. My spouse\u2019s request echoed in my mind, but so did the teachings I\u2019d grown up with. I stood there, laundry at my feet, wrestling with the choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
