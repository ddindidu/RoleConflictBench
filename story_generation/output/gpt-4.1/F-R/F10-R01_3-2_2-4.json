I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from Mom, asking if I\u2019d eaten, if I\u2019d slept, if I\u2019d remembered to water the plants. I usually replied right away, sending her photos of my lunch or a quick voice note. She worried if I didn\u2019t. But today, I was sitting across from Maria in my office at church, her eyes red and voice trembling as she poured out her fears about her son. She needed me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be fully present. My phone vibrated again. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle persistence, her need to know I was okay, and Maria\u2019s desperate hope that I could help her find peace. I wanted to be the attentive daughter, the reliable pastor, but in this moment, I couldn\u2019t be both. My heart ached as I stared at my phone, torn between the two people who needed me most."}
