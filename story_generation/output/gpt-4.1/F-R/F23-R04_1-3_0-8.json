The school bell would ring in fifteen minutes, and my stepchildren would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014no more missed pickups, no more feeling like an afterthought. But just as I reached for my keys, a man entered the prayer hall, his eyes red and shoulders trembling. He barely managed to say, \u201cImam, please, I need you,\u201d before breaking down. As an imam, I knew my duty: to offer comfort, to listen, to be present for those in pain. Yet, as a step-parent, I\u2019d sworn to be reliable, to show up when it mattered. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to neglect. My mind raced, torn between the children who needed to feel secure and the grieving soul who needed solace. I stood frozen, the expectations of two worlds colliding within me, unsure which path to take."}
