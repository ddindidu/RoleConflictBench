I knew how much these gatherings meant to them\u2014how hard we\u2019d all worked to blend our families, to make these moments feel real. I promised I\u2019d be there, even as my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the church council: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014tonight\u2014to organize shelter, comfort, and prayer. My heart twisted. As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to lead, to offer hope in crisis. But as a step-sibling, I was expected to show up, to help build trust and belonging. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my new family and the urgent needs of my church. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the ache of not knowing how to be enough for everyone."}
