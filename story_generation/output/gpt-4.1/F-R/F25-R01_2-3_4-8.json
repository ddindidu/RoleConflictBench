I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks planning for the church was set for the same weekend. As a pastor, I was expected to guide our community leaders, helping them wrestle with the deeper meanings of faith and scripture. The congregation was counting on me to be present, to teach, to inspire. My heart pounded as I imagined disappointing either my family or my church. The two worlds tugged at me, each demanding loyalty, each certain of its importance. I stared at the calendar, torn between the traditions that shaped my childhood and the calling that defined my present."}
