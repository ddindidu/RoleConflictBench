My children would be finishing school in twenty minutes, and I had promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just as I always tried to be. They\u2019d been looking forward to telling me about their day, and I knew how much it meant to them to see me waiting, smiling, among the other parents. \n\nBut just as I reached for my car keys, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time member of our congregation. His message was urgent\u2014he needed to talk, now, about his family\u2019s struggles. As an imam, I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, especially in moments like this. The community expected me to be available, to offer comfort and wisdom when it was needed most.\n\nI stood in the doorway, torn. My children\u2019s faces flashed in my mind, their trust in me as their father. At the same time, I felt the weight of Brother Ahmed\u2019s plea, the responsibility I carried as his imam. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
