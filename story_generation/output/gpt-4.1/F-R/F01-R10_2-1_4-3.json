The whole family gathered, waiting for me to say something, to celebrate with him. My daughter had even baked a cake, and everyone was eager for my blessing and praise. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed with a message from work. A colleague mentioned that someone had cut in line for a promotion, bending the rules. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always believed in dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. My mind raced: should I call my boss and speak up, or should I stay here, present for my family, giving my grandson the attention he deserved? The weight of both roles pressed on me. My family expected my warmth and presence, but my conscience tugged at me, urging me to uphold the values I\u2019d lived by. I sat there, torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which duty to honor first."}
