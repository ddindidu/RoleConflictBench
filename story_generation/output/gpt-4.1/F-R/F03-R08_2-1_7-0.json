My parents sit together in the living room, their faces drawn and voices subdued. I know they\u2019ve had a tough week, and as their son, I feel a deep responsibility to be there for them, to offer comfort and listen to whatever weighs on their hearts. At the same time, I had planned to spend this rare, peaceful evening reciting and reflecting on the Quran, something I\u2019ve been neglecting lately and feel spiritually hungry for. The expectation to nurture my faith is just as strong as the pull to support my parents. I sit on the edge of my bed, torn between the warmth of the living room and the quiet sanctuary of my prayer mat, my heart aching with the pressure of choosing between these two parts of myself."}
