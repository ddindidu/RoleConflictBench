She told me that my grandson was struggling, really struggling, and she needed me to call him, maybe even visit. As a grandparent, I\u2019ve always believed in being present, checking in, making sure everyone feels loved and supported. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was nearly time for Sunday worship. My church community expects me there, and I know how much I need that time for prayer and fellowship. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family needing me in one way, my faith community in another. My heart ached, torn between the comfort I could offer my grandson and the spiritual nourishment I find in church. I stared at my phone, wrestling with what to do next, feeling the pull of both worlds and not knowing which to choose."}
