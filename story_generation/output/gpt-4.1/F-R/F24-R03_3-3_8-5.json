The convent van was waiting to take me to the cathedral, where I was to lead the prayer vigil\u2014an honor I had prepared for with weeks of devotion. My heart pounded with the weight of expectation; the sisters trusted me to represent our faith, to be present, serene, and unwavering.\n\nThen, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my stepbrother, Mark, distracted by his phone, stepping off the curb, oblivious to the rush of oncoming cars. Instinct screamed at me to call out, to run and pull him back, to be the protective sibling I promised our parents I would be. But the van door slid open, and Sister Agnes beckoned urgently. The city\u2019s eyes would be on me at the vigil, and the convent needed me to be there, on time, composed.\n\nTorn between the sacred duty I had embraced and the family bond I could never shed, I felt my breath catch, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
