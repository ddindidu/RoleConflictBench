My daughter called, her voice bright, reminding me how much the kids missed our weekly chats and how much it meant to everyone that I kept our family close, especially during the holidays. At the same time, I glanced at my notes for the Jewish study session I\u2019d planned with my grandchildren. Passing on our traditions, teaching them about our history and values\u2014this was my sacred duty, too. The study slot could be moved, but I worried about losing momentum, about the lessons feeling less important if I shifted them for convenience. My heart tugged in two directions: the joy of simply being together as a family, and the responsibility to nurture their Jewish identity. I sat at my desk, phone in hand, torn between the easy laughter of a family gathering and the quiet seriousness of our study, unsure which path would best honor both the grandfather and the Jew in me."}
