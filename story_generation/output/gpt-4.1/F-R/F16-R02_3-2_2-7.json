She reached for my hand, her grip tight, silently pleading for comfort. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to hold her, to listen and reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. In less than an hour, I was expected at the church to lead the weekly religious education class\u2014a commitment I\u2019d made to the children and their families, who counted on me to guide them in faith. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the parish secretary, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife needed me, truly needed me, but so did my parish. I could feel myself being pulled apart, torn between the vows I made at the altar and the promises I made at the pulpit. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to figure out how to be present for everyone who depended on me, knowing that tonight, I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
