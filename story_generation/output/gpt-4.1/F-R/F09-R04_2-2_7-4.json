The fridge hummed quietly, half-empty, and I felt the weight of every coin I counted. As a mother, I knew my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure there was food on the table and the children\u2019s needs were met. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: \u201cFriday Khutbah \u2013 1:00 PM. You are the sole speaker.\u201d The mosque had already announced my topic, and the community expected me to deliver guidance and inspiration. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s anticipation, their trust in my words. Yet, a job opportunity for a few hours of work\u2014enough to cover groceries for the week\u2014was offered at the same time as the sermon. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my family against the trust of my community, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
