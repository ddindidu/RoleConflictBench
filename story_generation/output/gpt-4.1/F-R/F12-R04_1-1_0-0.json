He spoke lightly, but I could sense the fatigue behind his words. As his wife, I wanted to be present, to offer comfort and let him know I cared. My hand reached for his, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Maghrib prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even though tonight, the group would be small and another brother was available to step in. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, perhaps hoping for a moment of connection, while my mind raced with the responsibility I held at the mosque. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt my heart caught in the middle, torn between being the supportive wife he needed and the reliable imam my community expected."}
