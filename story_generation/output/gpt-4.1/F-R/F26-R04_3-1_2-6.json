I really need your advice.\u201d She sat beside me, clutching my hand, her words tumbling out about a problem at school, her confusion and fear clear in every sentence. My heart ached to comfort her, to draw from my years of experience as a mother and grandmother, to offer the gentle wisdom she needed.\n\nJust as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed from the mosque, his message simple: \u201cImam, if you have a moment, I could use your advice about something important.\u201d As the imam, I knew my community relied on me for spiritual guidance, and I had promised to be available whenever needed. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s immediate need for comfort, and my duty to my community member seeking counsel. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me, torn between the love of my family and the responsibility of my faith. My mind raced, heart heavy, as I tried to decide whom to help first."}
