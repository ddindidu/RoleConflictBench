My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they were both carrying burdens they didn\u2019t want to share, and as their daughter, I felt the weight of responsibility to comfort them, to be their source of strength and reassurance. But that same evening, I received a message from a friend, revealing a secret about someone in our church community\u2014a secret that, if left unaddressed, would go against everything I believed as a Christian. My faith demanded honesty and integrity, even if it meant difficult conversations and uncomfortable truths. Yet, I could see how much my parents needed peace, not more conflict or worry. The thought of bringing this issue to light, knowing it might upset them further, twisted my heart. I sat in my room, torn between my duty to support my parents and my commitment to live out my faith, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
