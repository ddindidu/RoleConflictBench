As his step-sibling, I felt the urge to sit beside him, to listen, to just be there\u2014no sermons, no advice, just quiet support. But the collar around my neck felt heavier than usual. As a pastor, I was expected to offer words of comfort, to guide him spiritually, to remind him of faith and hope. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s voices in my head, echoing the expectation that I should always have the right scripture, the right prayer, ready for any pain. But he was my brother, too, and I knew sometimes words\u2014especially religious ones\u2014could feel hollow or even intrusive. I hesitated, torn between the gentle silence of a sibling and the comforting authority of a pastor. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which part of me he needed most."}
