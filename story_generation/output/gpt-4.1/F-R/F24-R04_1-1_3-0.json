My stepmother chimed in, her eyes hopeful, \u201cIt would be wonderful if you could join us this time.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my mind was already racing. As the imam, I was expected to lead the daily prayers at the mosque, even though the congregation was small and another qualified worshipper could easily step in. The community looked to me for consistency and guidance, and I knew some would quietly judge my absence, even for a day. My family, on the other hand, longed for my presence, especially during these rare moments when we could all be together. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my faith community and my desire to be a true part of my new family. The conversation at the table faded into the background as I wrestled with the impossible choice forming in my heart."}
