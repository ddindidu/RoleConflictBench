He needed me\u2014just me, his sibling\u2014to listen, to reassure him, to be present in his pain without judgment or advice. My heart ached for him, and I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and drive to his apartment, to sit with him in silence if that\u2019s what he needed. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. It was a member of my congregation, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. As their pastor, I was expected to offer wisdom, to be calm and composed, to set aside my own turmoil and focus on their spiritual needs. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother needed my undivided love; my parishioner needed my undivided attention. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between the pull of family and the call of my vocation, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
