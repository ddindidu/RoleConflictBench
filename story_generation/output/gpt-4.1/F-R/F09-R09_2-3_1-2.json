Tomorrow was the open class at school\u2014Eli had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes shining with excitement every time he mentioned showing me his art project. I knew how much it meant to him for me to be there, to sit in the front row and wave when he looked up. But as I glanced at the Torah portion spread out on the table, my stomach twisted. His bar mitzvah was only a month away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew, his confidence wavering with every mistake. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a Jewish mother pressing down on me: to guide him, to help him connect with our traditions, to make sure he was ready for this milestone. Yet, the school expected me to be present, to support Eli in his academic life just as much as his spiritual one. I could feel the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding all of me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
