He was devastated, and I could hear the tears he was trying to hide. As his sibling, I knew he needed me to be there for him, to listen, to comfort, to remind him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But just an hour earlier, I had promised to help at the church\u2019s community dinner, where I was supposed to greet guests and offer a warm smile to everyone who walked in\u2014showing kindness, as my faith teaches me.\n\nMy brother\u2019s pain tugged at my heart, but so did the thought of letting down the people at church who were counting on me. I wanted to be the sibling who dropped everything to support family, but I also wanted to be the Christian who showed love to strangers, just as Jesus would. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, wrestling with the fear of disappointing someone no matter what I chose."}
