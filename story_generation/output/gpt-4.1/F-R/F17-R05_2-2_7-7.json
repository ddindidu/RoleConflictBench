My father sighs heavily from the living room, the weight of his day pressing down on him. I know they need me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to be their child who offers comfort and presence. But my phone buzzes again: a reminder about the bar mitzvah I am to officiate in just a few hours. The family has been planning this for months, and I am their rabbi, the one who must guide their child through this sacred milestone. I feel the pull in both directions\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for support, the congregation\u2019s expectation for leadership and celebration. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot be fully present for both. I stand in the hallway, torn, the weight of my roles pressing in from all sides, unsure which path to take."}
