It was a message from my mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially on weekends. As her daughter, I felt the weight of her expectation to communicate, to reassure her that I was safe and well. But as I glanced down at my outfit, I realized my scarf had slipped, and my sleeves were pushed up from the walk over. I needed a moment to adjust, to make sure I was dressed modestly before entering the prayer hall, as my faith required. My heart pounded with the pressure of both roles\u2014my mother\u2019s need for connection and my responsibility as a Muslim to present myself properly for worship. I hesitated, torn between quickly texting my mom back or taking the time to fix my appearance before stepping inside. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I stood frozen, wrestling with which expectation to meet first."}
