My parents spoke with pride about our traditions, reminding me how important it was to honor our ancestors by following every custom exactly as they had. I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectations settle on my shoulders. Later that evening, I overheard my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, crying quietly outside. She had just lost her husband and was alone, but my family had always insisted that we keep to ourselves during festival preparations, believing it was bad luck to interact with those in mourning. As a Christian, I felt a deep urge to comfort her, to show the love and kindness Jesus taught us to give freely. But I could almost hear my parents\u2019 voices in my head, warning me not to break tradition. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of compassion and the cold grip of expectation, unsure which path I should take."}
