My stepmother\u2019s messages blinked insistently on the screen: \u201cHow was your day? Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d She expected me to share every detail, to reassure her that I was safe and happy, even though I was no longer a child. I knew she worried, especially since I joined the convent, and I tried to answer her every day, never leaving her waiting.\n\nBut tonight, Sister Maria knocked on my door, her voice urgent. \u201cThe family next door lost everything in the fire. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes\u2014can you help?\u201d My heart twisted. The sisters needed all hands, and our vows called us to serve those in need without hesitation. Yet, as I slipped my phone into my pocket, I felt the weight of my stepmother\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. If I left now, I\u2019d miss our nightly call, and she\u2019d worry, maybe even feel abandoned. But if I stayed to message her, I\u2019d be turning away from the suffering just outside our walls. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I couldn\u2019t give to both."}
