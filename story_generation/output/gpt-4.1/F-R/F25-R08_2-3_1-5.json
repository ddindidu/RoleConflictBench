It was my stepmother, calling for our usual Friday check-in. She always said these calls made her feel included in my life, and I knew how much it meant to her, especially since I moved out. But I was already running late for Jumu\u2019ah, and the imam\u2019s voice was echoing through the speakers, calling everyone to prayer. I glanced down at my clothes\u2014long sleeves, loose pants, and a scarf, just as I always wore for worship. My stepmother, though, never really understood why I dressed this way, and she often asked me to video call so she could see my face and my hair, like I used to before I started covering. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to honor my stepmother\u2019s wishes and the responsibility to uphold my faith. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between answering her call and stepping into the prayer hall, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
