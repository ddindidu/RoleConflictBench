Her voice trembled, and I could hear the weight she carried. She needed me\u2014her daughter\u2014to listen, to comfort, to be present as she poured out her heart about Dad\u2019s health and her own fears. I glanced at the clock. In half an hour, I was supposed to gather my children for our weekly study of Torah stories, something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never compromise on. Passing down our traditions felt sacred, a thread connecting generations. But now, my mother\u2019s pain pressed on me, raw and immediate. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions: the daughter who wanted to hold her mother\u2019s hand through the phone, and the Jewish parent determined to keep our heritage alive. My mind raced, guilt and love tangled together, as I tried to figure out how to be both things at once."}
