As a father, I knew I was expected to be present, to show up for my child, to guide him and, when necessary, correct him. The school expected me to respond firmly, to ensure this wouldn\u2019t happen again. But as a Christian, I was taught to show love and kindness, to forgive, to see the good in others\u2014even when they made mistakes. I wanted to comfort my son, to remind him that everyone deserves compassion, even when they\u2019ve done wrong. Yet, I also felt the weight of responsibility to teach him that his actions have consequences, that hurting others is never acceptable. My heart twisted as I tried to reconcile these roles\u2014how could I be both the firm father and the loving Christian in this moment? The principal\u2019s expectant gaze pressed on me, and I felt the tension rise, unsure which path to take."}
