My father sighs heavily as he sorts through bills, his shoulders slumped. I know they\u2019ve both been working extra hours, and lately, the house feels heavy with their exhaustion. As their son, I feel a pull to stay home, to offer comfort, maybe cook dinner or just sit with them so they know they\u2019re not alone in their worries.\n\nBut tonight is also the community memorial service at the temple. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to help set up, chant, and support others in their grief. The abbot mentioned how important it is for everyone to attend, especially those who are seen as role models in the community. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in on me\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for support, and my spiritual community\u2019s need for my presence. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the two worlds that define me, unsure which path to take tonight."}
