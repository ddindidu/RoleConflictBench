I had promised myself to finish reading the Quran by the end of the month, but I was already a few days behind. Each evening, after iftar, I would retreat to my room, Quran in hand, determined to catch up. Tonight, just as I opened the holy book, my phone buzzed. It was my younger sister, her voice trembling as she asked if I could come over\u2014she was feeling overwhelmed with her studies and needed someone to talk to.\n\nAs her brother, I knew she counted on me, especially during tough times. Our parents always said we should support each other, no matter what. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of my spiritual commitment, especially during this sacred month. The guilt gnawed at me\u2014if I went to her, I\u2019d fall even further behind in my recitation. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I sat on the edge of my bed, torn between the two roles that defined me, unsure which path to take."}
