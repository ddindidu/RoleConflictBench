My daughter had called, her voice bright with excitement, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me. As a grandparent, I knew how important it was to be present, to share stories and laughter, to make memories that would last. But as I walked to the corner store that morning, I saw Mrs. Evans, my elderly neighbor, struggling with her groceries. She looked so frail, and I remembered the words of Jesus about loving our neighbors, about kindness in small, everyday moments. She asked if I could help her organize her apartment this Saturday\u2014the same day as the family gathering. My heart twisted. My family expected me to be there, to be the loving grandparent they cherished. But my faith called me to serve, to show compassion, especially to those who needed it most. I stood on the sidewalk, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both love and duty pressing in on me."}
