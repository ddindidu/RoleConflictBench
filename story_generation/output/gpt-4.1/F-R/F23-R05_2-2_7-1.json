The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down, the expectation to keep our home running, to make sure there was enough for groceries, for rent, for her school trip next month. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Shabbat was approaching, and as the rabbi, I was expected to prepare a sermon that would inspire and guide my congregation. They looked to me for wisdom, for comfort, for leadership. Yet, my mind was clouded with worry about our finances, unable to focus on the sacred texts or the message I wanted to share. The demands of both worlds pulled at me\u2014my family needed security, my community needed spiritual nourishment. I felt torn, caught between the urgent needs of my home and the sacred duties of my calling, unsure how to honor both when there simply wasn\u2019t enough of me to go around."}
