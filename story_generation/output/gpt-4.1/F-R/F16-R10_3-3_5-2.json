My spouse and I have relatives arriving in a few hours, and every corner must gleam. I\u2019m expected to help\u2014dusting, arranging cushions, chopping vegetables, making sure everything is perfect. My partner\u2019s eyes meet mine, silently asking for help with the mountain of chores. But as I reach for the broom, I glance at the clock. It\u2019s almost time for my daily puja. As a devout Hindu, I never skip my morning rituals: the chanting, the offerings, the incense. Each step is sacred, and missing even one feels like a betrayal of my faith. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations. If I leave the chores, my spouse will feel abandoned, maybe even resentful. If I delay my prayers, guilt will gnaw at me all day. The sounds of cleaning and the call of the temple bell pull me in opposite directions, and I stand frozen, torn between devotion to my partner and devotion to my faith."}
