Lately, everyone\u2019s been talking about how important it is to keep our family traditions alive\u2014stories, songs, the way we greet each other, even the food we eat. My parents look at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019ll join in, listen, and learn. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle, and I know they\u2019ll be discussing verses I haven\u2019t read yet. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of needing to recite and reflect on the Quran, to not fall behind, to show respect for my faith and my community. My heart pounds as I sit between my family\u2019s laughter and the clock ticking toward the study circle. I want to be the child who honors my family\u2019s wishes, but I also want to be the Muslim who grows in faith. The two worlds pull at me, and I can\u2019t ignore the ache in my chest as I wonder which part of myself I\u2019ll have to let down tonight."}
