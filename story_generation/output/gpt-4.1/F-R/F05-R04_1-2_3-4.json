She\u2019d worked late all week, and I\u2019d promised to help more at home. The laundry was my job this time, and it had been piling up for days. I could hear the kids arguing in the next room, and I knew she needed a break. But my phone buzzed with another reminder: I was the only imam scheduled for tomorrow\u2019s Friday sermon. The topic\u2014\u201cPatience in Daily Life\u201d\u2014had been announced to the whole community. People would be coming with expectations, and I still hadn\u2019t finished my notes. My mind raced between the needs of my family and the responsibility to my congregation. I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides. Should I sit down and fold the laundry, or retreat to my study and prepare the khutbah everyone was waiting for?"}
