Today was Friday, and as a Muslim, I knew how important it was to dress modestly for the congregational prayer. I had chosen a long, loose dress and a scarf, making sure I followed the guidelines I\u2019d grown up with. But as I glanced down, I remembered my stepmother\u2019s words from that morning\u2014she wanted me to wear the new dress she\u2019d bought for the family gathering after prayer, a dress that was beautiful but didn\u2019t quite cover me the way I was used to. She said it was important to fit in with the family, to show respect for their traditions, especially since I was still the \u201cnew\u201d member. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how much it meant to her. Now, standing here, I felt torn between honoring my faith and not disappointing my stepmother. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which door to walk through\u2014one that led to the prayer hall, or one that led back to my family."}
