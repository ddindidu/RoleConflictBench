He was having a rough day, his voice shaky over the call as he asked if I could come over. As his sister, I knew he needed me, and I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen and comfort him like I always had. But as I glanced at the small altar in the corner of my room, I remembered I hadn\u2019t performed my daily puja yet. Lately, I\u2019d been rushing through it, just whispering a mantra under my breath between chores, but today was special\u2014my mother had reminded me to do the full ritual for an auspicious day.\n\nThe incense sticks lay untouched, the diya unlit. I felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectations as a Hindu, to honor our traditions properly, especially on days like this.
