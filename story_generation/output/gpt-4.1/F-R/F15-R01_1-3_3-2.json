He\u2019d just snapped at his sister, and I knew I needed to step in, to teach him about kindness and respect\u2014those daily lessons that shape who he\u2019ll become. But my phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with a message from a church member in crisis. She was waiting for my call, desperate for spiritual guidance as she faced a decision that could change her life. My heart tugged in two directions: my son needed me here, now, to model patience and discipline, to be the parent he deserved. But as a pastor, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would be there in their darkest moments. I stared at the phone, torn, the demands of both roles pressing in, each urgent, each important, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
