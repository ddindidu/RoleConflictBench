My son-in-law entered, excitement in his eyes, and announced that my granddaughter had won a school award. They wanted the whole family to gather, to celebrate her achievement together. I felt a surge of pride and joy, knowing how much these moments meant to them\u2014and to me.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was expected at the church for the daily prayer service. It was not mandatory, but many in the community found comfort in my presence, and I knew some would be disappointed if I missed it. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, the sense of duty to my faith and my flock.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter\u2019s beaming face, then at the clock again. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet sanctuary of the church, each calling me in a different direction."}
