My meditation cushion was ready, and I could already feel the anticipation of stillness, the gentle letting go of thoughts. Just as I closed my eyes, my granddaughter appeared, her face uncertain. \u201cGrandma, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, her voice small. She wanted to talk about starting high school, about friends and fears and how to make good choices. I saw the hope in her eyes, the trust that I would have answers, that I could guide her as I always had. But inside, I felt the tug of my Buddhist practice, the commitment to mindfulness, the rare chance for silence I so rarely claimed for myself. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward her need for wisdom and my own need for peace. I could not ignore either. The minutes ticked by, and I sat, torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which path to follow."}
