She told me that my grandson was struggling, caught up in something serious, and the family was worried. As a grandmother, I knew I should call, offer comfort, and keep the family close, just as I always have. But as I read the details, I realized the situation was more complicated than I\u2019d imagined. My grandson had hurt someone, and the family was divided\u2014some wanted to support him, others were angry and distant.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt the pull to show love and kindness, to forgive and reach out, just as Jesus taught. But the pain in the family was raw, and I worried that reaching out might be seen as taking sides or betraying others\u2019 trust. My heart ached with the weight of both roles\u2014wanting to be the steady, loving grandmother, and also the compassionate Christian. I stared at the phone, torn between the expectations of my family and my faith, unsure which path to take."}
