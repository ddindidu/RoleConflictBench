The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was about to start, and she had begged me to be there. \u201cPlease, Mama, just this once,\u201d she\u2019d whispered last night, her eyes shining with hope. I promised her I would come, picturing her searching the crowd for my face. But as I reached for my coat, my phone buzzed. The mosque committee member\u2019s voice was urgent: a large crowd had gathered for the special remembrance, and the other imam was unexpectedly called away. \u201cWe need you to lead, sister. No one else is authorized.\u201d I stared at my abaya, then at the invitation from the school. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds\u2014my daughter\u2019s trust, the congregation\u2019s faith. I could almost hear the children\u2019s laughter echoing down the school hallways, and at the same time, I felt the silent anticipation of the worshippers waiting in the mosque. My hands trembled as I stood in the hallway, torn between the two doors, each one heavy with expectation."}
