The evening was quiet, and I tried to be present, listening as they mentioned a difficult moment at work. I knew I should ask more, dig deeper, show I cared. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how busy life became. But my mind kept drifting to the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to lead the weekly children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue. The lesson was important; parents and the community expected me to guide their children, to teach them not just stories, but values and law. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for a response, while my phone buzzed with a reminder about the class. I wanted to be fully present for both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I could feel the tension rising inside me, unsure which expectation I would have to let down tonight."}
