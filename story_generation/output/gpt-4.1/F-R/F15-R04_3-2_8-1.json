The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. My family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure we didn\u2019t lose our home. I needed to find extra work, maybe take on a few more tutoring sessions or help with community events that paid a little. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and everyone expected me to lead the daily prayers for the next two weeks. I knew how much the community relied on me, especially now, during these uncertain times. My heart twisted as I thought of my children sleeping in the next room, trusting me to provide for them, while my congregation looked to me for spiritual guidance and stability. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt caught in a storm of responsibility, unsure which way to turn."}
