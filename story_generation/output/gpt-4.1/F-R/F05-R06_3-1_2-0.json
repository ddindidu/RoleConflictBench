She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to soothe her, my presence to anchor her through the storm she was facing. As her husband, I felt the weight of her pain pressing on me, the expectation to be her rock, to never falter. But as I reached for her, my phone buzzed with a message from a friend, asking for help with a situation that challenged my Christian values. I knew what was right according to my faith, but it would mean leaving her side, even for a short while, when she needed me most. My heart twisted, torn between the vows I made to her and the commitment I made to God. I could feel the tension building inside me, the fear of failing her as a husband or failing my faith as a Christian. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to decide."}
