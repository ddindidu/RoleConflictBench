My husband had mentioned he needed his work clothes clean for tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s school uniform was buried somewhere in the pile. As a wife, I knew the expectation: the family relied on me to keep things running smoothly, to make sure everyone had what they needed. But tonight was also the temple\u2019s routine evening chant, a ceremony I had promised myself I would attend regularly. As a Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to participate, to nurture my spiritual practice and support the community. The clock ticked closer to the start of the chant. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the hum of the washing machine and the gentle rhythm of the temple bells. I stood in the hallway, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, torn between the needs of my family and the call of my faith."}
