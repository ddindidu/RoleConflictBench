But today, as I sat cross-legged before the small altar in my apartment, the lamp flickering, I felt the weight of another expectation. As a Hindu, I\u2019m supposed to offer daily prayers, light the lamp, and chant the mantras my mother taught me. I closed my eyes, trying to focus, but my phone buzzed with a message from my father: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you.\u201d Guilt twisted inside me. If I replied now, I\u2019d break the flow of my prayers, but if I waited, I\u2019d worry them. Both roles tugged at me\u2014my parents\u2019 need for connection, my faith\u2019s call for undisturbed devotion. I sat there, torn, the lamp\u2019s flame wavering as if reflecting my own uncertainty."}
