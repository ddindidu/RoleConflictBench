The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a parent pressing down. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. But as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I was due at synagogue in less than an hour. Tonight, I was scheduled to chant my Torah portion, something I\u2019d practiced for weeks, something my community expected of me. My heart pounded as I looked at my son\u2019s guilty face, torn between the urgent need to address his behavior and the sacred commitment waiting for me. I could feel the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and for a moment, I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
