As a grandmother, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, to offer comfort when the family is hurting. My heart aches for my grandson, and I feel the pull to call him right away, to be the steady presence he needs. But tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle, a commitment I have kept for years. We are set to discuss a chapter I have not yet read, and I know my presence and participation are expected. The teachings remind me to cultivate mindfulness and compassion, to deepen my understanding through study and reflection. I sit in my quiet room, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the quiet call of my spiritual path. My hands tremble as I hold my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
