The school had sent a reminder about the open class\u2014my stepdaughter\u2019s first since I joined the family. She\u2019d asked, \u201cWill you come?\u201d with hope in her eyes. I knew how much it meant to her, to have me there, to show I cared. But the same day, my family was traveling to the temple for Navratri. It was a tradition I\u2019d never missed, a time when we all gathered, prayed, and celebrated together. My parents expected me to be there, to help with the rituals, to honor our gods. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cThis is your duty.\u201d I felt torn, pulled between the promise I\u2019d made to my stepdaughter and the devotion I owed to my faith and family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, making it hard to breathe. I wanted to be present for both, but I knew I couldn\u2019t. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could split myself in two."}
