As his step-parent, I knew I needed to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces, but every time I tried to gently correct him, he seemed to push back harder, his face clouding with frustration. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a church member. There had been a fire in their home, and they needed immediate support and counseling. As a pastor, I was expected to be there for my community, to offer comfort and guidance in times of crisis. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the responsibility to guide my stepson in this moment, and the urgent call to serve my congregation. My heart pounded as I stood in the cereal aisle, torn between the child who needed my steady hand and the family who needed my compassionate presence."}
