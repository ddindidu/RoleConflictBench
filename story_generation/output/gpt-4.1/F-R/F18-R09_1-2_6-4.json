The sun was dipping low, and our stomachs rumbled in unison. We\u2019d planned to grab a snack on the way home, but as we neared the corner, I realized the only food vendor nearby was the small kosher cart\u2014one I knew was safe for us to eat from. But the line was long, and my brother was already complaining about feeling faint. He wanted to stop at the convenience store across the street, where the food wasn\u2019t kosher, but it would be quick and easy.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was okay, and not let him go hungry. But as a Jew, I was expected to keep kosher, to honor the rules that shaped our family\u2019s life. My brother\u2019s pleading eyes made my heart twist. I stood there, torn, the sounds of the street fading as I wrestled with what to do next."}
