My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the other room, reminding me that the grocery money was running low again. As a parent, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down\u2014my family needed me to provide, to keep the lights on and food on the table. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a message from the parish blinked on the screen: a family was pleading for a last-minute, mandatory preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament, scheduled for tomorrow. As the priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present and unwavering in my commitment to their spiritual journey. But the session would take hours, and I had been offered a rare, well-paying side job at the same time\u2014money that could cover our groceries for the week. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between my duty to my family\u2019s well-being and my calling to serve my parishioners. The expectations from both sides felt impossible to reconcile, and I sat there, paralyzed, unable to choose."}
