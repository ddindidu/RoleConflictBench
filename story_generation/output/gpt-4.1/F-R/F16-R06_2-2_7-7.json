I knew something was wrong, and as a partner, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask about their day, to share my own worries from work, and to be honest about the stress I\u2019d been carrying. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how hard. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a message from a friend at church. She was struggling, her words heavy with pain, and I knew she needed someone to listen, to show her the love and kindness my faith calls me to give.\n\nI felt torn. My spouse needed me here, present and attentive, but my friend needed me too, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the teachings that shaped my heart. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
