The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and my son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. As a father, I knew what was expected: to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is never acceptable, no matter how small the temptation. I wanted to take him home, sit him down, and talk through the consequences, to make this a lesson he\u2019d never forget.\n\nBut tonight was Shabbat, and the synagogue service would begin in less than an hour. As a Jewish man, I was expected to be there, to join the prayers, to be part of the community. My absence would be noticed, but not critical\u2014still, I felt the weight of tradition and belonging pressing on me. I glanced at my son, then at my watch, feeling the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
