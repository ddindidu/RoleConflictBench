Their laughter filled the room, and I felt the familiar warmth of belonging. My younger brother looked at me, eyes bright, \u201cYou\u2019ll come too, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I smiled, feeling the tug of family expectation\u2014how much it meant to them that I join, how much I missed these moments myself.\n\nBut in the quiet of my heart, I remembered the commitment I\u2019d made as a nun. I had set aside this weekend for spiritual reading and contemplation, a rare afternoon of solitude I\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks. My superior had encouraged us to deepen our spiritual practice, and I knew how important it was to honor that call. The two worlds pulled at me\u2014one of laughter and shared memories, the other of silence and sacred reflection. I felt the tension rise inside me, torn between the joy of being a sister and the peace of my spiritual path, unsure which voice to follow."}
