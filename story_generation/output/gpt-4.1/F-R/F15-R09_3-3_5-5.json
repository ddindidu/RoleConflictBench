My heart pounded with the weight of what I needed to do as a parent\u2014teach him right from wrong, show him that stealing is never acceptable, no matter how tempting. But now, as we faced the buffet table, another dilemma pressed in. The food looked delicious, but I couldn\u2019t find any kosher certification, and I knew the expectation from my Jewish upbringing: I should not eat, nor let my child eat, anything unverified. Yet, the other parents were already filling their plates, and my son\u2019s eyes were wide with hunger and embarrassment. I felt the eyes of the community on me, expecting me to participate, to blend in, to not make a scene. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to comfort my child, to discipline him gently, to uphold our faith, and to not alienate ourselves from the group. The conflicting demands twisted inside me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which role to honor first."}
