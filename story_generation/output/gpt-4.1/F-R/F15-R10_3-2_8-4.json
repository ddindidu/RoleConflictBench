As a parent, I knew my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure we never missed a payment, never risked our home. Every rupee counted, and I had been working extra hours, cutting corners wherever I could. But today, at work, I saw something that gnawed at my conscience\u2014a close friend was being blamed for a mistake he didn\u2019t make, and the management was ready to fire him. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak the truth and protect the innocent, even if it meant personal risk. But if I spoke up, I might anger my boss, jeopardize my job, and put my family\u2019s financial security in danger. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty as a parent against my responsibility to uphold what is right. The two roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which path to choose."}
