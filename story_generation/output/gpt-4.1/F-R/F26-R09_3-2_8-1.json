She was struggling, her voice tight with worry when we spoke. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be present, to check in every day, to offer comfort and stability to my family. But as I glanced at the calendar, I was reminded that Passover was only days away. My grandchildren still hadn\u2019t learned the Four Questions, and I\u2019d promised myself I would teach them the blessings and stories that my own grandmother had passed down to me. \n\nI felt torn. My daughter needed me, perhaps more than ever, but so did my grandchildren. The weight of tradition pressed on me\u2014I wanted them to feel the beauty and meaning of our heritage, to carry it forward. Yet, the urgency of my daughter\u2019s crisis made every moment feel precious and fleeting. My heart ached as I tried to balance the need to nurture my family\u2019s spirit and their immediate emotional needs, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
