My mom had texted me earlier, just a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d I knew she expected me to reply, to keep in touch and let her know I was okay. I started typing a quick response, but then I heard a commotion outside. Peeking through the window, I saw my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, struggling with her groceries, her face tight with frustration. I remembered the words from last Sunday\u2019s sermon\u2014how we\u2019re called to show love and kindness, to be there for others in their moments of need. My heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be the good child, to keep my parents from worrying, but I also felt the pull to help Mrs. Lee, to live out my faith in a real, tangible way. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending that reassuring text and rushing outside to help. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
