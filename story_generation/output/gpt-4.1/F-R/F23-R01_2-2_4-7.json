As her step-parent, I knew I should step in, teach her about respect and discipline, especially in public. But as a pastor, my mind was tangled with the sermon I was preparing for Sunday\u2014one about grace, forgiveness, and understanding the struggles behind every action. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s expectant silence, waiting for my words on moral choices. Yet here I was, torn between correcting her with firmness or showing the gentle patience I preached. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding immediate discipline, the other urging compassion and reflection. I felt the eyes of strangers and imagined the unseen eyes of my congregation, both expecting me to embody the values I teach. My hands trembled on the shopping cart as I wrestled with what to do next, caught between the parent I was supposed to be and the pastor I was called to be."}
