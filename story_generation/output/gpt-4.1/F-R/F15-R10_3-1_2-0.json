The principal\u2019s call still echoed in my ears\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate. As a parent, I was expected to go inside, face the teachers, and show my child that I would stand by him but also hold him accountable. I knew I needed to be present, to listen, to guide him through this mistake.\n\nBut as I waited, I realized I hadn\u2019t performed my daily puja. My faith as a Hindu taught me to begin each day with a full ritual\u2014lighting the lamp, offering flowers, chanting prayers. Lately, I\u2019d only managed to whisper a short mantra under my breath between errands, feeling guilty for not honoring my tradition properly. Now, with this crisis, I felt torn. My heart ached with the weight of both roles: the parent my child needed, and the devotee my faith expected. I closed my eyes, the school\u2019s entrance looming ahead, and felt the pressure of these two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
