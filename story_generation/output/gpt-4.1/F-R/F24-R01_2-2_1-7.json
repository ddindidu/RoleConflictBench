Instinctively, I wanted to go to him, to sit beside him on the couch and just listen, to be the step-sibling he needed\u2014someone who would support him, no matter what. But my laptop was open on the table, the blinking cursor waiting for me to finish my sermon for Sunday. The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and unwavering faith from me. I was supposed to teach them about forgiveness, about turning the other cheek, about making moral choices even when it\u2019s hard. But right now, my brother needed me to just be there, not to preach or offer lessons, but to understand. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my brother\u2019s silent plea for comfort, and the congregation\u2019s unspoken demand for wisdom. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
