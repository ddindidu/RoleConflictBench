My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me to help prepare the special dishes for our annual holiday gathering. This tradition, passed down through generations, was sacred to my family. As their daughter, I was expected to be present, to honor our ancestors and keep our customs alive.\n\nBut my phone buzzed urgently. Sister Maria\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cThe Nguyen family lost everything in the fire. We\u2019re gathering supplies and food now. Can you come?\u201d As a nun, my heart was bound to serve those in need, to be present for the suffering, especially in moments of crisis.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family needed me to uphold our traditions, to be the dutiful daughter. My community needed me to embody compassion, to act swiftly and selflessly. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the call to serve beyond our walls, my hands trembling as I tried to decide where I truly belonged."}
