I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way their voice wavered just a little. I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of notes waiting on my desk, the invitation from my teacher to summarize the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. It was an honor, and I wanted to do it justice, to reflect deeply and prepare well. Yet here I was, torn between the warmth of my partner\u2019s need and the quiet pull of my spiritual commitment. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each deserving it. My heart ached with the knowledge that, tonight, I could not give myself wholly to both."}
