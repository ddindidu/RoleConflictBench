He didn\u2019t say anything, just slumped onto the couch, shoulders shaking. I knew something had happened at school\u2014he\u2019d been having a rough time with his friends lately. As his step-sibling, I felt the urge to sit beside him, to listen, to offer comfort like Mom always said we should. But I glanced at the clock. It was nearly sunset, and I hadn\u2019t started my evening puja yet. The incense, the chanting, the offerings\u2014my family\u2019s tradition, my own promise to myself, demanded I begin now. If I delayed, I\u2019d miss the auspicious time, and guilt gnawed at me. I stood frozen, torn between the living room and the prayer room, my heart pounding with the weight of both worlds. My stepbrother\u2019s quiet sobs filled the silence, and I felt the pressure of two sets of expectations pulling me apart, unsure which path to take."}
