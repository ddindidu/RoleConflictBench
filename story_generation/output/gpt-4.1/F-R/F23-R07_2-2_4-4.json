My heart aches for the calm, the gentle hush of breath and presence. But here I am, in the supermarket, watching my stepson dart between aisles, giggling as he weaves dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. Other shoppers frown. I feel their eyes on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline, to show I am a responsible parent. My mind races: Should I raise my voice, set a firm boundary, risk his resentment? Or do I breathe, recall my Buddhist practice, and try to guide him gently, mindful of his feelings and my own rising frustration? The minutes slip away. I want to be the calm, compassionate presence I strive for in meditation, but I also want to be the parent who teaches right from wrong. The two roles pull at me, each demanding something different, and I stand frozen, torn between the need to act and the wish to simply be."}
