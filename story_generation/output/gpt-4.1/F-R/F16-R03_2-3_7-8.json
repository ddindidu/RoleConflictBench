He\u2019d been quieter than usual, and I knew he needed me to listen, to share my own worries as we always promised. But my mind kept drifting to the letter from Mother Superior, folded neatly in my pocket. She\u2019d entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the retreat\u2014an honor, but also a responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual preparation. My husband reached for my hand, his voice trembling as he began to talk about his struggles at work. I wanted to be present, to communicate openly as a loving spouse should, but my thoughts tangled with scripture passages and the weight of guiding my sisters in faith. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the sacred silence I needed and the honest conversation he deserved. The clock ticked, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the attentive partner he needed and the devoted nun my community expected."}
