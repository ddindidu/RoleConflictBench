My family had gathered for this special moment\u2014he\u2019d been working on it for weeks, and tonight he wanted to launch it in the backyard, surrounded by all of us. I felt the warmth of being a grandparent, the pride in his accomplishment, and the joy of being present for these milestones.\n\nThen my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue president: a beloved congregant had passed away unexpectedly, and the family was requesting that I officiate the funeral service as soon as possible. They needed comfort, guidance, and my presence as their rabbi. I could already picture their grief, the expectation that I would be there to help them through this loss.\n\nI looked at my grandson\u2019s eager face, then at the message on my phone. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who wanted me to share in their happiness, and toward my community, who needed me in their sorrow. I sat there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
