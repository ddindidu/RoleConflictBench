He\u2019s been saving his allowance, but he\u2019s counting on me to make up the difference. I know how much it means to him, and I want to keep my word, but the cost tugs at my conscience. Our budget is tight this month, and I worry about making ends meet. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder: it\u2019s time to start preparing my sermon for Shabbat. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, and wisdom\u2014something meaningful that will resonate with them. I feel the weight of their trust, the responsibility to offer them my best. But my mind is scattered, torn between the needs of my family and the demands of my calling. \n\nI stare at the blank page in front of me, my thoughts drifting between sermon ideas and the image of my son\u2019s face lighting up with joy. The pressure builds inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I wonder how I can possibly fulfill both."}
