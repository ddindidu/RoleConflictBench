He was determined to try a new skateboard trick, and I knew he expected me to be there, to look out for him like a real sibling should. But my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. My colleagues, men and women, would all be there, and I was anxious about dressing modestly enough to meet my Islamic values while still fitting in at work. \n\nAs my stepbrother called out for me to watch, I felt torn. If I stayed, I could make sure he was safe, but I\u2019d have to rush to the office, risking not having time to change into my modest clothes. If I left early to prepare, I\u2019d be letting him down, not being the supportive sibling he needed. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
