My daughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d called me last night, her voice bubbling with excitement. As a grandparent, I knew how much it meant to her that I listen, encourage, and keep in touch, especially now. She wanted to share every detail, and I wanted to be there for her, to show her that her happiness mattered to me.\n\nBut I was on my way to the temple, traveling across states for the annual festival. As a Hindu, it was my duty to participate in the rituals, to offer prayers and immerse myself in the ceremonies that connected me to my faith and ancestors. The festival demanded my full attention\u2014days of fasting, chanting, and being present with the community.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my daughter, and I felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to call her, to hear her stories, but I also knew that soon, I\u2019d be in the thick of the festival, my time and focus claimed by tradition. I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of family and the pull of my faith, unsure which voice to answer first."}
