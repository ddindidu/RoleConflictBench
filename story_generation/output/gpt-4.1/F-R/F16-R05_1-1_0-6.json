My partner was at the kitchen table, scrolling through emails, and greeted me with a tired smile. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, voice light but eyes shadowed. I set my bag down, ready to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to talk tonight, eager to secure a date. I knew how important these milestones were, how much it meant to them to have their rabbi\u2019s blessing. Yet, I could see my partner\u2019s shoulders tense, waiting for me to sit, to ask about their day, to be the spouse they needed. My mind raced, torn between the sacred trust of my community and the quiet, daily trust of my marriage. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
