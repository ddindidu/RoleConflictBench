My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and the family needed me at the hospital. As a grandfather, my heart ached to be by their side, to comfort my daughter and hold my grandson\u2019s hand. Yet, as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from the mosque committee. Today was not just any Friday; it was the mosque\u2019s fiftieth anniversary, and people from neighboring towns had come, hoping to hear my sermon. The community expected guidance, inspiration, and my presence at this milestone. I could picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to step onto the minbar. My mind raced, torn between the desperate need of my family and the sacred trust of my community. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I found myself standing in the hallway, keys in hand, unable to move, caught between two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
