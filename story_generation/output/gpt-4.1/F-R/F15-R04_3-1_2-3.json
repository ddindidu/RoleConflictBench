My son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me immediately. As a parent, I felt a surge of shame and worry\u2014my child needed me, needed guidance and discipline, and I knew I should be there for him, especially now. But as the imam, I was also expected to deliver the Friday sermon in less than an hour. The congregation looked to me for spiritual guidance, and many had come specifically to hear my words. There was a guest speaker prepared to step in, but I knew some community members would be disappointed if I wasn\u2019t the one on the pulpit. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my son\u2019s need for a present, responsible parent, and my community\u2019s trust in their imam. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which path to take."}
