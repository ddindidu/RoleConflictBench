My stepmother\u2019s eyes found mine, her smile expectant. \u201cYou should lead the puja this year,\u201d she said, her tone gentle but firm. It was a chance to prove I belonged, to honor the family\u2019s traditions and show respect for the values they held dear. I wanted to make her proud, to finally feel like I was truly part of this family.\n\nBut as I glanced around, I saw my friend, Ravi, standing awkwardly near the doorway. He\u2019d been invited, but some of my step-relatives had made him feel unwelcome, whispering about his background. My heart twisted. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what was right, to treat everyone with fairness and compassion. The urge to speak up for Ravi, to challenge the unfairness, burned inside me.\n\nYet, I knew that causing a scene would disrupt the ceremony and disappoint my stepmother, maybe even threaten the fragile acceptance I\u2019d worked so hard to earn. I felt torn, caught between honoring my new family and staying true to my beliefs."}
