The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow over every purchase and plan. As a mother, I feel the weight of responsibility\u2014my children\u2019s security, our home, the future I want to build for them. I know I should spend this evening reviewing our finances, maybe even picking up a few extra hours of consulting work online. Every dollar counts right now.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: tonight is the adult education class at the synagogue. As the rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be there, to guide the discussion, to answer questions about Torah and Jewish law. Some of the regulars have already emailed me, excited for tonight\u2019s topic. They look to me for wisdom, for connection, for a sense of community.\n\nI feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My family needs me to be practical, to focus on our financial stability. My congregation needs me to be present, to teach and inspire. I stare at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wonder how I can possibly be enough for both."}
