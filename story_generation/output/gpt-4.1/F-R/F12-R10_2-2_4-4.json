My husband had reminded me this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school event, and I\u2019d promised to get the laundry done before dinner. As I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed with a message from Priya: \u201cThey\u2019re blaming me for the mistake at work. I\u2019m scared, can you help?\u201d My heart clenched. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to not turn away when someone is treated unfairly. Priya needed me to speak up for her, maybe even go to her office right now. But the pile of laundry in front of me was a promise to my family, a responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides\u2014my duty as a wife to care for my family, and my duty as a Hindu to uphold dharma and support my friend. I stared at the laundry, my mind racing, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which path to take."}
