He\u2019d been promised it for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014how much he wanted to feel like he belonged, like I was really his parent. But the price tag gnawed at me. Money was tight, and I was supposed to make sure we stayed afloat. At the same time, Sunday was coming, and I hadn\u2019t missed a service in years. My faith taught me to honor commitments, to be present in worship and serve the community. But if I bought the Nintendo, I\u2019d have to skip church to pick up extra hours at work. The guilt pressed in from both sides\u2014my stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes, my church family\u2019s expectation of my presence. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which promise I was about to break."}
