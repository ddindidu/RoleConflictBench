My daughter had just announced her promotion, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate. I could see the anticipation in their eyes, the unspoken hope that I would join them, share stories, and be present for this special moment. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my old friend at the temple. He wanted to meet and discuss the profound sermon we\u2019d both heard last week\u2014a rare chance for deep spiritual reflection, something I cherished as a Buddhist. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the warmth and joy of my family, the quiet call of spiritual growth. My heart tugged in two directions, each demanding my presence, each promising fulfillment. I sat there, torn, unsure which path to follow, feeling the tension rise within me as I tried to honor both the grandfather and the Buddhist within."}
