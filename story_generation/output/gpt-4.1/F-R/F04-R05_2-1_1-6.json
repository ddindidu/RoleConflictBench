They wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next June. It was over a year away, but they were eager to secure a date. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to be available for these milestones, to guide and celebrate with my community. I started to type a reply, promising to check my calendar, when my phone buzzed. It was my sister, Leah. Her voice trembled as she told me about her recent diagnosis\u2014something serious, something that would require months of treatment. She needed me, not just as her brother, but as her anchor, her support through the uncertainty ahead. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the congregation expecting my commitment, my sister needing my presence. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, the wedding date circled in red, the months Leah would need me blurring together. I closed my eyes, torn between the vows I\u2019d made to my family and to my faith, unsure how to honor both."}
