My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the guest room still needed fresh sheets and the bathroom hadn\u2019t been cleaned. The pressure to make our home spotless pressed on my shoulders, and I could feel my own frustration simmering. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member, Sarah, who was struggling with grief and needed to talk. She asked if I could call her soon, saying she felt lost and alone. My heart ached for her, knowing how much she relied on my support as her pastor. But the house was still a mess, and my spouse was counting on me to help. I stared at the phone, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my congregation, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
