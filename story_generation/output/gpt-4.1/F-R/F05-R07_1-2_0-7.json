She tells me about her day\u2014nothing dramatic, just the usual office frustrations, but I can hear the fatigue in her voice. I know she expects me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe even to sit with her over tea and let her unwind. I want to be there for her, to show her she\u2019s not alone in her stress.\n\nBut tonight is also the weekly Buddhist study circle. We\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t read yet, and I promised myself I\u2019d be prepared. The group expects me to participate thoughtfully, to reflect and share insights. I feel the tug of my commitment to spiritual growth, the quiet discipline I\u2019ve tried to cultivate.\n\nStanding in the hallway, I feel split. My wife\u2019s needs are immediate and real, but so is my promise to the sangha and to myself. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, each demanding my presence in a different way. I hesitate, caught between the warmth of the kitchen and the quiet call of the Dharma, unsure which path to take tonight."}
