It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what they expect\u2014some sign that I\u2019m thinking of them, that I care. This weekend, though, I\u2019m supposed to lead a study session for the kids at the synagogue. It\u2019s my turn to teach them about Shabbat traditions, and I\u2019ve spent the whole week preparing stories and activities. The lesson could be moved to another day, but the kids look forward to it, and I know how important it is to pass on our history.\n\nAs I sit with my phone in hand, I see a message from my mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Miss you.\u201d I feel a pang of guilt. If I call her now, I\u2019ll be late for the study session. If I wait until after, she\u2019ll be asleep. I want to be a good son, to keep that connection alive, but I also feel the weight of my responsibility to the community and to the next generation. My heart aches as I try to decide which part of myself to honor first."}
