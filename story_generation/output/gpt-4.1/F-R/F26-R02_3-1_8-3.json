As a grandmother, I felt the familiar ache to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and advice, to remind them that family stands together in hard times. I promised I\u2019d call back soon, but as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014a parishioner, Mrs. Evans, asking if I might have time to talk in the coming days. She didn\u2019t say why, but I could hear the uncertainty in her message. As a priest, I know how important it is to be available, to offer guidance and a listening ear, especially when someone reaches out, even tentatively. I sat at my kitchen table, torn. My family needed me now, but so did my flock. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I found myself staring at the phone, unsure which call to return first."}
