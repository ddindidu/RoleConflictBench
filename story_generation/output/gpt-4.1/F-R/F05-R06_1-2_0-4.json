My wife was sitting on the couch, scrolling through her phone, her shoulders a little more slumped than usual. She looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in her eyes. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, her voice light, as if she didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of it. I knew she appreciated it when I sat with her, listened, and helped her unwind after days like this.\n\nBut the clock was ticking, and I could already picture the familiar faces at church, the warmth of the community, and the sense of duty I felt as a Christian to be present, to worship, and to serve. I wanted to be there, to keep my commitment, but I also wanted to be here, to offer my wife the comfort she needed. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the tension rising in my chest as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, unsure which way to turn."}
