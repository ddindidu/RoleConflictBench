Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I smiled, feeling the familiar warmth of her concern, but I didn\u2019t have time to reply. The community was reeling from last night\u2019s storm\u2014families displaced, homes flooded, and grief hanging heavy in the air. As pastor, I was expected to be everywhere at once: comforting the bereaved, coordinating volunteers, and offering prayers. My mind raced with logistics, but my heart tugged toward my parents, who waited for my daily call, expecting stories and reassurance. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but worried, if I didn\u2019t respond soon. Yet, the church doors opened, and a line of anxious faces looked to me for hope. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the son my parents needed and the pastor my community depended on, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
