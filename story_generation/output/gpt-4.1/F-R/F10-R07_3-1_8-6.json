She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I felt the weight of her need for comfort settle on my shoulders. I wanted to be fully present, to listen and reassure her, to be the daughter she needed in that moment. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mei, my friend from the temple. She was eager to talk about the sermon we\u2019d just heard, about impermanence and letting go, and she hoped I could help her process her thoughts. I knew our conversations always ran deep, requiring my focus and reflection. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my mother\u2019s pain and my friend\u2019s spiritual searching. I could feel the tension rising inside me, the pressure to be everything to everyone, and I wondered how I could possibly choose without letting someone down."}
