She needed me\u2014she was going through a breakup and wanted to talk, to have me by her side. As her brother, I\u2019ve always promised to be there for her, no matter what. But tonight, her call came just as I was about to begin my evening puja, the most important part of my daily Hindu rituals. I follow a strict schedule: lighting the lamp, chanting mantras, offering flowers and incense, all at the exact time every day. Missing even a single step or delaying the ritual fills me with guilt and anxiety, as if I\u2019m letting down not just myself but my faith and family tradition. My phone buzzed again\u2014my sister, needing comfort. My heart ached, torn between the duty of a brother and the discipline of my faith. I stood in the hallway, the puja room glowing softly, my sister\u2019s pain echoing in my mind, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
