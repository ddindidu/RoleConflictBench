Other shoppers glance over, some with smiles, others with frowns. I know I should step in, guide him, remind him about respect and self-control\u2014values I promised his father I\u2019d help instill. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder for tonight\u2019s synagogue service. It\u2019s a routine one, not a holiday, and I know the minyan will be fine without me. Still, I feel the tug of obligation; my Jewish identity is rooted in these rituals, in showing up, in being counted. I glance at my stepson, then at the time. If I correct him now, we\u2019ll be late for the service. If I rush him out, I\u2019ll miss the chance to teach him, to be the parent he needs. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014my community\u2019s, my family\u2019s, my own. I stand frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
