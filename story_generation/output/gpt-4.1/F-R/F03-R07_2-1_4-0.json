They\u2019re gathered in the living room, preparing for our annual ancestor remembrance\u2014a tradition my parents insist we never miss. My mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, calls me to join them, reminding me how important it is to honor our family\u2019s past. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a message from the temple: a reminder about the evening chant, a ritual I\u2019ve promised to attend as part of my commitment to the Buddhist community. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family expects me to be present, to show respect for our heritage, while my Buddhist practice calls me to the temple, to join in the collective recitation and find peace in the teachings. My heart aches with the tension\u2014if I choose one, I disappoint the other. I close my eyes, torn between the warmth of home and the serenity of the temple, unsure which path to take tonight."}
