My father\u2019s sighs echoed from the living room, heavy and frequent. I knew they needed me\u2014my presence, my words, my comfort. As their daughter, I felt the weight of their unspoken expectation: to sit with them, listen, and offer reassurance. But I had set aside these ten minutes for myself, a rare window in the day to practice mindfulness and meditation, as my Buddhist practice encouraged. I craved the stillness, the gentle focus on my breath, the peace that came from turning inward. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, guilt gnawed at me. If I retreated to my room now, would I be abandoning them when they needed me most? If I stayed, would I be neglecting the commitment I made to my own spiritual well-being? My heart tugged in both directions, torn between the daughter they needed and the Buddhist I aspired to be."}
