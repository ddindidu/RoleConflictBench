He grinned at me, skateboard in hand, ready to try a trick he\u2019d only seen online. As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of flashcards on the kitchen table\u2014Passover was just days away, and Mom had asked me to help Max and my little stepsister learn the blessings. It was important to her, and to me, that they understood our traditions, that they felt connected to our Jewish heritage. But Max was so excited, and I didn\u2019t want to be the nagging sibling who ruined his fun. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I pull him away from the ramp to practice the blessings, or let him go, risking his safety but giving him the freedom he craved? My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and the kitchen, caught in the middle of what I owed to my family and my faith."}
