Mom always says I should look out for him, make sure he\u2019s safe, especially since he\u2019s younger and still learning the ropes of our neighborhood. I glance at him, making sure he\u2019s not too close to the curb, listening for the cars that sometimes speed by. \n\nBut today, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d use the ten minutes after school for mindfulness, a quiet window to meditate and breathe, just as my Buddhist teacher suggested. I can already feel the tension in my shoulders, the day\u2019s noise clinging to me. I crave that silence, that space to let go. \n\nYet, as we walk, my brother chatters about his day, asking questions, wanting my attention. I feel torn\u2014should I focus on him, keeping him safe and feeling heard, or should I try to slip into that mindful state, even as the world bustles around us? My mind tugs in both directions, guilt and longing mixing in my chest, as I wrestle with what I owe to him and what I owe to myself."}
