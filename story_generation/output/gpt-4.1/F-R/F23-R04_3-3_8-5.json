My stepdaughter peeked in, her eyes hopeful, asking if we could go out this weekend. I forced a smile, knowing every cent counted right now. As a step-parent, I felt the unspoken expectation to keep our family afloat, to provide stability after so much change in their lives. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the mosque committee. This Friday\u2019s Khutbah wasn\u2019t just any sermon; it marked the mosque\u2019s fiftieth anniversary. People were coming from other towns, eager to hear my words. The community expected inspiration, wisdom, and presence. My mind raced: I needed hours to prepare, but I also needed to find extra work, maybe a weekend shift, to cover the looming payment. The two worlds pulled at me\u2014my family\u2019s security and my community\u2019s trust. I stared at the calendar, heart pounding, torn between the demands of home and the pulpit, unsure which duty I could afford to let down."}
