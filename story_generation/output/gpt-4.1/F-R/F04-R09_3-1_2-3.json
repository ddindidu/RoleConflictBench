She\u2019d just broken up with her boyfriend, and I could see she\u2019d been crying for hours. I sat beside her, wanting to be the brother she needed\u2014someone to lean on, someone who\u2019d do anything to make her feel better. She reached for a box of cookies on her nightstand and offered me one, her eyes pleading for me to join her in this small comfort. I knew those cookies weren\u2019t kosher; she\u2019d bought them on a whim, not thinking about the ingredients. \n\nAs a Jew, I\u2019ve always tried to keep kosher, especially at home where our pantry is full of snacks I can eat without worry. But in that moment, the expectation to support my sister felt just as strong as my commitment to my faith. She needed me to share this with her, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart pounded as I stared at the cookie in her hand, torn between being the brother she needed and the Jew I strive to be."}
