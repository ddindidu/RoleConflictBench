The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow over every purchase and plan. I know I need to pick up extra shifts at work, maybe even take on a weekend job, just to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. But as I glance at the calendar, my heart sinks\u2014my son\u2019s bar mitzvah is only weeks away. He\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion, and every evening he looks to me for guidance, for the stories and songs that connect him to our heritage. I want to be there, to help him find pride and meaning in our traditions, to pass on the values my parents gave me. But the numbers on the page don\u2019t lie, and the clock ticks louder each day. I feel torn, pulled between the need to secure our future and the responsibility to nurture his Jewish identity. My chest tightens as I wonder how I can possibly be both the provider and the teacher he needs right now."}
