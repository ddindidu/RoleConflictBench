The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow. As a father, I knew I had to find a way to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. My wife\u2019s gentle reminder echoed in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t fall behind, not now.\u201d I was already planning extra hours at the office, maybe even a side job, anything to keep us afloat.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmad, a long-time congregant. His message was urgent\u2014he needed to meet soon, his family was falling apart, and he trusted me as his imam to guide him through this crisis. I could hear the desperation in his voice, the expectation that I would be there, offering counsel and comfort.\n\nMy heart twisted. I wanted to be present for Ahmad, to fulfill my duty as an imam, but every hour spent with him was an hour I couldn\u2019t use to secure my family\u2019s future. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stared at my phone, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
