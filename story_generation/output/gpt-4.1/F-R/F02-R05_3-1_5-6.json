My heart sank as I realized what had happened\u2014my son had slipped the cookies into his pocket, thinking I wouldn\u2019t notice. As a father, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with love but also with firmness. My mind raced with the right words, the right lesson, the right balance between compassion and discipline.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a young couple, eager to know if I could officiate their wedding next year. As their rabbi, I was expected to respond promptly, to be present for their joy, to offer reassurance and guidance.
