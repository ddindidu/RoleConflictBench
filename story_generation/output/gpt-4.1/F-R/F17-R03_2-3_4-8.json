My hands trembled as I unfolded the letter from my mother, her words heavy with reminders of our family\u2019s traditions\u2014how I was expected to help prepare for the annual festival, to honor our ancestors as we always had. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, insisting that I not forget where I came from. Yet, just this morning, Mother Superior had called me into her office, her eyes kind but resolute. She asked me to lead the daily reflections for the upcoming retreat, a task that would require my full attention and presence, hours of preparation and prayer. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing against the sacred duties I had vowed to uphold. My heart ached with longing for home, for the comfort of familiar rituals, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual calling, the trust my community had placed in me. The two worlds seemed to pull me in opposite directions, and I sat in the quiet, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
