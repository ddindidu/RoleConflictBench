The incense curls in the air as I chant, beads slipping through my fingers, each mantra a thread connecting me to my faith. But today, as I kneel before the altar, I hear the clatter of dishes in the kitchen\u2014my stepson, Aryan, is awake early, already rummaging for breakfast. I remember his mother\u2019s words: \u201cHe needs guidance, especially now. Teach him respect, discipline, the right way to greet elders.\u201d I know I should go to him, show him how to set the table, remind him to wash his hands, to say \u201cgood morning\u201d properly. But my prayers are only half-finished, and I have always believed that skipping a ritual is disrespectful, that discipline in faith is as important as discipline in life. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the altar, and toward the boy who is waiting, perhaps needing me more than ever. The incense burns lower, and I sit frozen, torn between the sacred and the everyday, wondering which duty I must answer first."}
