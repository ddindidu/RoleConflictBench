My brother had flown in from out of state, and my parents were beaming, eager for us all to be together. As the aroma of my mother\u2019s brisket filled the kitchen, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple in the congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to set the date based on my availability, and they needed an answer soon. My mother called me to join everyone in the living room, her voice warm but expectant. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family, wanting me fully present, and my community, looking to me for guidance and support at a pivotal moment in their lives. I could hear my brother joking with my father, and I longed to sink into the comfort of being just a sister. But the responsibility of being a rabbi tugged at me, reminding me that my answer would shape someone else\u2019s family story. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between two homes."}
