My heart pounded with shame and worry. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. I could already hear my own mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that discipline and honesty are the roots of good character.\n\nBut as a Jewish mother, I also felt the weight of another responsibility. Passover was only days away, and I had promised myself that this year, my children would finally learn the blessings and the story of our people\u2019s freedom. I wanted them to feel the pride and connection to our heritage, to understand the values of justice and redemption that our traditions teach.\n\nNow, I was torn. Should I focus on the immediate lesson of honesty and discipline, or should I set aside this moment to prepare them for the holiday, hoping the spirit of our traditions would guide them? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which path to take."}
