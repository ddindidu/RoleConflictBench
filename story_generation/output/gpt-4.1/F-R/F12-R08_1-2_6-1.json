He asks about my day, his eyes gentle, expecting me to share openly, as we promised each other we would. I want to tell him everything\u2014the small frustrations at work, the funny moment with a colleague\u2014but my mind is elsewhere. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my Quran reading. The guilt tugs at me, reminding me of the spiritual commitment I made to myself, to Allah. I glance at the Quran on the shelf, feeling its silent call. My husband waits, unaware of the storm inside me. I know he values our honest conversations, and I want to be present for him, to nurture our bond. But the weight of my unfinished recitation presses on my heart, making it hard to focus. I wrestle with the urge to excuse myself and catch up on my reading, torn between being the attentive wife he needs and the devoted Muslim I strive to be. The moment stretches, and I\u2019m caught in the tension, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
