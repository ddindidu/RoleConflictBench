It was Sunday evening\u2014our family\u2019s sacred time for weekly calls. My mother\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I could almost hear her gentle voice, eager for news, for reassurance that I was well. I knew she waited for these calls, counting on them to bridge the distance between us. But tonight, the mosque was unusually full. A special remembrance had drawn a crowd, and I was the only imam present. The congregation looked to me, expecting guidance, comfort, and leadership in prayer. My heart pounded as I glanced from the phone to the waiting faces. I felt the weight of my mother\u2019s hopes and the community\u2019s trust pressing on me at once. I wanted to be a good daughter, to honor my parents with my attention and care, but I was also their imam, responsible for their spiritual needs. The call kept ringing, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me."}
