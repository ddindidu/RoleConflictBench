The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry scattered, and dust gathering in corners. She looked at me, expectation clear in her eyes, and I knew she needed my help to make everything perfect. As a spouse, I wanted to share the load, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in this. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was leading the weekly meditation group at the temple in just two hours. As a Buddhist, I valued this time deeply, not just for myself but for the community that relied on me to guide them in mindfulness. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of home and the quiet responsibility of my spiritual practice. I could feel the tension in my chest, the pull of two worlds that both mattered so much. I stood in the kitchen, hands trembling slightly, wondering how I could possibly be present for both."}
