He needed me to listen, to be patient, to help him feel understood\u2014something I always tried to do as his sister. I could see how much he needed me to be present, to set aside my own judgments and just be there for him, building the trust and respect we\u2019d worked so hard to maintain.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Mei, my friend from the Buddhist center. She was eager to talk about the sermon we\u2019d both attended that morning, wanting to reflect on the teachings and deepen our understanding together. I knew how important it was to engage in spiritual study, to nurture my own growth and support hers as well.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. My brother\u2019s voice grew louder, desperate for my attention, while Mei\u2019s words on my screen reminded me of my commitment to my spiritual path. Both needed me, both expected my presence, but I could not be in two places at once. My heart ached as I sat between them, torn by the weight of their needs and my own."}
