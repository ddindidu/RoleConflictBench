He\u2019d just found out his dad\u2014my stepdad\u2014was seriously ill, and he was falling apart. As his step-sibling, I knew I should be there for him, offering comfort and a listening ear. But earlier that day, I\u2019d seen Sarah, a girl from my church group, crying alone in the hallway. Remembering what I\u2019d learned about loving others as Jesus did, I felt compelled to reach out to her, too. Now, both needed me at the same time. Jake expected me to be his anchor, the one person he could lean on in our blended family. But my faith called me to show kindness to Sarah, to not ignore someone in pain. My heart twisted as I stared at my phone, torn between the brother who needed me and the stranger I was called to love. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
