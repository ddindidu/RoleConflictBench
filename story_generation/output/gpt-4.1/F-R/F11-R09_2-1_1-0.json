I really need to talk.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious, and I could hear the strain in his words. As his sister, I knew I should be there for him, especially when he was struggling. But tonight was also the weekly slot I\u2019d set aside to teach my kids about our Jewish traditions\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t skip, to give them the roots and stories I\u2019d grown up with. I\u2019d already rescheduled the lesson once this month, and I worried about losing momentum, about letting my children see that our heritage could be set aside. Yet, my brother\u2019s need felt urgent, and the thought of letting him down gnawed at me. I sat at the kitchen table, torn between the pull of family support and the responsibility of passing on our faith, my heart heavy with the weight of both roles."}
