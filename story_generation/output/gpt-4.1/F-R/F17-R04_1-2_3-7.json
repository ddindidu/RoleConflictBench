My family gathered around, laughter echoing as we prepared for our annual tradition\u2014an evening of stories, prayers, and shared memories. As the eldest child, I was expected to lead the family in upholding these traditions, honoring my parents and the values they cherished. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket.
