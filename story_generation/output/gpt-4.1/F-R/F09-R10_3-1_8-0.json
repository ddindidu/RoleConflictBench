As a mother, I know I must ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. The numbers don\u2019t add up easily, and I find myself calculating, recalculating, searching for ways to save. My son tugs at my sleeve, asking for help with his homework, and I force a smile, my mind still racing with worries about the upcoming payment.\n\nIn the midst of this, I remember my duty as a Hindu. I should be lighting the lamp, offering flowers, and chanting the full morning prayers. But lately, I only manage to quietly repeat a short mantra under my breath as I rush through chores. Guilt gnaws at me\u2014my faith asks for devotion, but my family needs my time and focus. I feel torn, as if I am failing both as a mother and as a Hindu. The expectations pull me in opposite directions, and I sit there, heart heavy, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
