My husband called from the kitchen, reminding me that his relatives would arrive in an hour, and the house still needed dusting and the table set. As a wife, I felt the pressure to make everything perfect, to show that our home was warm and welcoming. I wanted to move freely, to roll up my sleeves and get things done quickly, but as a Muslim, I knew I should dress modestly, even at home, since my husband\u2019s male cousins would be among the guests. \n\nI glanced at my comfortable t-shirt and loose pants, perfect for a day of chores, but not appropriate with non-mahram men around. The thought of wearing my abaya and hijab while scrubbing floors and carrying trays made me anxious; it would be hot and cumbersome. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a gracious, efficient wife and my commitment to my faith. I could hear laughter from the living room as my husband chatted on the phone, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
