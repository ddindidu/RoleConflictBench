Her voice cracked, and I could see how much she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d come to rely on. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the comfort she rarely asked for, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was the church secretary\u2014someone was waiting in the chapel, desperate for spiritual guidance, their world unraveling. As a priest, I knew the weight of that call: I was expected to be present, to offer hope and counsel to those in crisis. My heart pounded as I looked at my stepmother, her eyes pleading for support, while my mind raced with the knowledge that someone else, a stranger, was waiting for me to help them find peace. I felt torn, the expectations of family and faith pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
