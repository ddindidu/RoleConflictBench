As a daughter, I felt the weight of her expectation to check in, to be present even from a distance. But my mind was elsewhere, tangled in thoughts of Hajj. My friends from the mosque were planning their pilgrimage this year, and every conversation reminded me of my own longing\u2014and my guilt. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of Hajj, the spiritual fulfillment it promised, and the duty it represented. Yet, I was just starting my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone save for a journey across the world. I felt torn, pulled between my mother\u2019s gentle reminders and the ache in my heart to fulfill my religious obligation. The pressure built inside me, a silent struggle between being a good daughter and a devoted Muslim, unsure which voice to answer first."}
