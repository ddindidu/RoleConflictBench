My daughter had called twice already, reminding me how much the little ones missed their grandfather. I could almost hear their giggles through the phone, and my heart ached with longing to be with them, to fulfill my promise of regular connection. Yet, as the imam of our mosque, I faced another pressing duty. Tonight, a special remembrance had drawn a large gathering, and I was the only one authorized to lead the prayers. The community looked to me for guidance, for comfort, for the words that would bind us together in faith. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders, just as the voices of my family echoed in my mind. Torn between the warmth of my family and the solemn responsibility to my congregation, I sat in my study, hands trembling, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
