Everyone\u2019s bringing something.\u201d I could almost hear my sister\u2019s voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much it meant to her that we all be together. As the oldest, I was expected to show up, to help set the table, to laugh and share stories, to be present. But my laptop screen glowed with the unfinished sermon I needed to deliver tomorrow. The congregation was struggling with a difficult issue, and I knew they were looking to me for guidance, for clarity rooted in faith. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders, the responsibility to teach and shepherd them well. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the comfort and belonging of my family, and the calling to serve my church. I could feel the tension building inside me, the guilt of possibly letting someone down no matter what I chose. I closed my eyes, wishing for a way to be both the sister my family needed and the pastor my congregation expected."}
