My younger brother looked at me, his eyes bright. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d My heart squeezed with longing; I missed these moments, the laughter, the warmth. But as my mother smiled at me, I glanced at my phone. A reminder flashed: the monthly food drive at the convent was today. As a nun, I was expected to be there, helping to prepare meals for the homeless, a commitment I had never missed. The sisters counted on me, and the people we served needed us. My family\u2019s hopeful faces tugged at me, but so did the quiet call of duty and compassion from the convent. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
