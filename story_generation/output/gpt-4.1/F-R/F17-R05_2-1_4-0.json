My mother\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe must never let go of our traditions.\u201d Lately, every meal is a lesson, every conversation a reminder of the customs that have shaped us for generations. As their child, I feel the weight of their hopes, the unspoken expectation that I will carry our heritage forward, unchanged.\n\nBut as a rabbi, I am already thinking ahead to my next Shabbat sermon. The congregation looks to me for guidance, for words that resonate with their lives today. I know some of them struggle with the very traditions my family holds sacred. They need understanding, maybe even change. My mind races with ideas\u2014should I speak about the importance of tradition, or about adapting to new realities?\n\nThe two roles pull at me, each demanding loyalty. My heart aches with the fear of disappointing my family or failing my community. I stare at the blank page, torn between honoring the past and guiding the present, unsure which voice to follow."}
