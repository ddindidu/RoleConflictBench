He had just gotten the call\u2014his mom, my stepmom, was in the hospital again, and this time it sounded serious. I wanted to be there for him, to listen, to comfort him, to show him that I was more than just a step-sibling\u2014I was family. But my stomach rumbled, reminding me that I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. The only kosher vendor in this small town was about to close, and if I missed it, I\u2019d have nothing to eat until tomorrow. My stepbrother, lost in his grief, didn\u2019t notice the time.

The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
