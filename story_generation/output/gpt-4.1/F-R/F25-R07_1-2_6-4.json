It was almost time for the weekly group meditation, the one hour I set aside to practice mindfulness and reconnect with myself. As a Buddhist, I knew how important it was to be present, to let go of distractions, and to cultivate inner peace. But just as I was about to leave my room, I heard my stepmother\u2019s voice, soft but strained, drifting down the hallway. My dad had been quiet all evening, and I could sense the tension between them. I knew they expected me to check in, to ask if everything was okay, to be the emotional glue that sometimes held our patchwork family together. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the calm sanctuary of meditation and the unspoken responsibility to support my parents. I stood frozen, torn between honoring my spiritual practice and fulfilling my role as a caring step-child, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
