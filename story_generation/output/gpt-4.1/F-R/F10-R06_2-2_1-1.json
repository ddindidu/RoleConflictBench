It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my way of showing I care, of being a good daughter. Tonight, though, my heart pounds as I stare at my phone. Earlier today, I witnessed a friend at church being unfairly treated by someone in our community. As a Christian, I know I should stand up for what\u2019s right, speak the truth, and support those who are wronged. But my parents have always told me to avoid conflict, to keep my head down and not get involved in other people\u2019s problems. I know if I tell them what happened, they\u2019ll worry, maybe even scold me for thinking about getting involved. But if I stay silent, I feel like I\u2019m betraying my faith and my friend. The phone rings in my hand, my parents\u2019 expectations and my Christian values pulling me in opposite directions. I close my eyes, torn between being the dutiful daughter they want and the Christian I strive to be."}
