The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, and I kept an eye out for cars, just as Mom always asked. My brother chatted about his day, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014earlier, a member of my congregation had called, desperate for advice. She was waiting for me at the church, her voice trembling with fear and uncertainty. As her pastor, I knew she needed spiritual guidance, someone to help her navigate a decision that could change her life. But as a sibling, I was responsible for my brother\u2019s safety, especially since he was only ten. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me: the urge to rush to the church and be present for someone in crisis, and the duty to keep my brother safe until we reached home. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the expectations of family and faith."}
