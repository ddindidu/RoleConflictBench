My granddaughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d called me last night, her voice bubbling with excitement. She wanted to share every detail, and I promised I\u2019d call her back today to hear all about it. My daughter had also texted, reminding me how much it meant to the family that I stayed involved, especially during these big moments.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the parish hall, leading the planning meeting for our adult faith formation series. The committee depended on me to guide the discussion and set the tone for the season. I knew how important it was to the community, and I could already picture the eager faces waiting for me.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family needed me to be present, to celebrate and support. My parish needed me to lead, to inspire and organize. I stared at the phone, caught between two calls, both equally urgent, both equally dear."}
