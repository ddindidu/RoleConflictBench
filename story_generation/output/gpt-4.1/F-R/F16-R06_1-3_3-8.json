We\u2019d both had long weeks, and I knew how much it would mean if I just folded it all before dinner. But as I reached for a towel, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a friend in crisis, asking if I could come over. She sounded desperate, her words heavy with pain. As a Christian, I believe in showing love and compassion, especially when someone is hurting. I could almost hear the words from Sunday\u2019s sermon echoing in my mind: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d But I also remembered the look on my spouse\u2019s face last night, the quiet frustration about always being the one to finish the chores. My heart twisted, caught between the call to serve at home and the call to serve beyond it. I stood there, laundry in hand, torn by the demands of love in two different forms, unsure which path to take."}
