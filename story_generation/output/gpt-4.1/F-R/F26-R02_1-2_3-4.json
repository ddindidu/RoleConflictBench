My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren were looking forward to our evening together\u2014board games, stories, laughter. As a grandparent, I cherished these moments, knowing how quickly they slipped away. But just as I was setting out the board games, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Clara, a member of my congregation. She was in distress, asking if she could come by tonight to talk about her ongoing struggles. As her priest, I knew how much she depended on my guidance, especially during these difficult times. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s eager anticipation, Clara\u2019s desperate need. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my grandchildren\u2019s hugs and the solemn responsibility to offer comfort and counsel. The clock ticked on, and I stood in the hallway, caught between two doors, each one calling me in a different direction."}
