My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed me, how they wanted to play carrom and hear my stories. As a grandparent, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to nurture those bonds and create memories. Yet, as the sun dipped lower, I felt the familiar tug of my other devotion\u2014my evening puja. My daily rituals are not just habits; they are sacred, a thread connecting me to my faith and ancestors. The incense, the chanting, the offerings\u2014each step must be done with care and cannot be rushed or skipped. The family expected me at the table, laughing and sharing, but my heart also knew the peace and discipline of my prayers. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the joy of my family and the sanctity of my spiritual practice. The clock ticked on, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
