She had just started her new job, and her excitement leapt from the screen. As her grandfather, I know how much it means to her that I listen, encourage, and share in her joy. My children always say I\u2019m the glue that keeps us close, and I try to live up to that, never missing a chance to connect. But as I read her message, I glanced at the clock\u2014almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I have always set aside this quiet part of my day to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar, a practice that grounds me and honors my faith. The family expects my presence, but my heart feels the pull of my spiritual duty. I hold the phone in one hand, the matchbox in the other, torn between the warmth of my granddaughter\u2019s news and the sacred stillness waiting for me at the altar. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand in the hallway, uncertain which path to take first."}
