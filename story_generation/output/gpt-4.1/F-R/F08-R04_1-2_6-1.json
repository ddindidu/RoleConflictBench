The kids miss you so much.\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of my grandchildren\u2019s laughter, the familiar comfort of family gathered together. But as I hung up, my gaze drifted to the prayer schedule pinned to the fridge. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation had already asked if I would lead the daily prayers. They needed me, especially during these days when the community felt the absence of their usual leader. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s longing for connection, my community\u2019s need for guidance. The expectations tugged at me from opposite directions, each one rooted in love and duty. I closed my eyes, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s embrace and the solemn responsibility of standing before my congregation."}
