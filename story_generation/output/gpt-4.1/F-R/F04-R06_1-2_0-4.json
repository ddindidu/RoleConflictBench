She\u2019s been working so hard, and the whole family is gathering to celebrate her achievement. As her brother, I know how much it would mean to her for me to be there, cheering her on, taking photos, and sharing in her joy. But the graduation ceremony is at the same time as the weekly church service. As a Christian, I\u2019ve always been taught the importance of worship and being present in the church community, especially since I help lead the youth group. Missing a service feels like letting down my faith and the people who count on me there. I can feel the tension building inside me\u2014my sister\u2019s happiness on one side, my commitment to my faith on the other. Both expect my presence, my support, and my loyalty. I sit on my bed, invitation in one hand, Bible in the other, heart heavy as I try to figure out what to do."}
