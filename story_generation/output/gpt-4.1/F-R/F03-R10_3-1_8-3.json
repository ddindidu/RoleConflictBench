She looked at me, her eyes searching for comfort, and I knew she needed me to be strong, to reassure her that everything would be alright. I wanted to give her my full attention, to be the son she could lean on. But my phone buzzed with a message from work\u2014a colleague had just cut in line for a promotion, bypassing the fair process. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and not ignore wrongdoing, no matter how small. My mind raced between my mother\u2019s pain and the injustice at work. I felt torn, my heart heavy with the weight of both roles. Should I focus on being the supportive son my parents needed, or should I address the ethical issue that gnawed at my conscience? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which path to take."}
