It was my sister, her voice trembling. She needed me\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she wanted to talk, right now. As her brother, I knew I should drop everything and be there, listen, maybe even drive over. That\u2019s what we always promised: to support each other, no matter what.\n\nBut the sermon weighed on me. The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and I was nowhere near finished. I could already picture the disappointed faces if I showed up unprepared, the subtle sighs, the sense that I\u2019d let them down as their pastor. Yet, how could I turn away from my own sister in her hour of need? My heart twisted, torn between the pulpit and my family, between the words I needed to write and the comfort I needed to give. I stared at my phone, paralyzed, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
