He\u2019s been working late all week, and I know he\u2019s counting on me to help keep things running smoothly at home. I sigh, gathering a handful of socks, when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Priya\u2014her voice trembling in the audio note. She\u2019s being blamed at work for something she didn\u2019t do, and her manager is refusing to listen. My heart aches; as a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to protect those who are wronged. I want to call her, to offer support, maybe even go with her to talk to her manager. But the laundry sits there, a testament to my role as a wife, the expectation that I\u2019ll do my part. I feel torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
