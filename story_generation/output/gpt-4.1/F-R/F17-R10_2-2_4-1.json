Lately, my parents had become even more insistent that I be present, reminding me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s customs, especially now that my grandparents were growing older. But at the same time, as a practicing Hindu, I had promised myself to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar at dusk\u2014a ritual that brought me peace and a sense of connection to something greater.\n\nTonight, the timing clashed. My family called me to join them just as I was about to begin my prayers. I could hear their voices, warm and expectant, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual duty, the quiet altar waiting for me. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the laughter of my family and the silent glow of the lamp. I wanted to be the devoted child they hoped for, but I also longed to honor my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds."}
