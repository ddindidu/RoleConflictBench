She was upset, feeling I hadn\u2019t been there for her lately, and she wanted to talk things through, to clear the air and rebuild the trust between us. I knew how important it was to communicate openly, to listen and show her the respect she deserved as my sister. But just as I was about to call her back, Mother Superior knocked on my door, her face grave. The neighboring family\u2019s house had burned down, and the convent was organizing immediate relief\u2014gathering food, clothing, and comfort for them. As a nun, I was expected to put the needs of the suffering first, to serve the community without hesitation. My heart pulled in two directions: the urgent call of charity and the quiet plea of my sister for understanding. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
