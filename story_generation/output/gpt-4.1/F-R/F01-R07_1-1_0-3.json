The house was finally quiet, and I felt the familiar anticipation of slipping into stillness. Just as I closed my eyes, my granddaughter appeared, her face clouded with uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, her voice small. She wanted to talk about starting high school, about friends and fears and fitting in. I saw the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for guidance, for the kind of wisdom only a grandfather could offer. Yet, inside me, the Buddhist in me tugged gently, reminding me of my commitment to mindfulness, to honoring this sacred window of peace I had carved out for myself. My heart ached with the pull of both roles\u2014one urging me to be present for her, the other to be present with myself. I felt the weight of her expectation and my own, both pressing in, both impossible to ignore."}
