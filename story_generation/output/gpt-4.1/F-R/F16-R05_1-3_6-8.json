I nodded, trying to focus, but my phone buzzed insistently. I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the synagogue president. A beloved congregant had just passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My spouse paused, sensing my distraction, and asked if everything was alright. I wanted to be present, to listen and respond with the openness our relationship deserved. But my mind raced with the weight of my rabbinic duty, the expectation that I would comfort the grieving and guide the community through loss. I felt torn, caught between the sacred trust of my congregation and the intimacy of my marriage. My spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to share what was on my mind, while my phone vibrated again, a reminder of the family waiting for my call. I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which need to answer first."}
