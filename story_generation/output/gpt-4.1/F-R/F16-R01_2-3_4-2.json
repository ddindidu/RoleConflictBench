My spouse had reminded me twice already that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d handle it tonight. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was a member of my congregation, her voice trembling as she asked if I could talk. She was facing a crisis, desperate for guidance, and I could hear the urgency in her words. I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to help her find her way through a decision that could change her life. Yet, the laundry sat unfinished, and I could almost feel the disappointment that would come if I let my family down. My heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, and I stood there, torn, the phone in one hand and a shirt in the other, not knowing which responsibility to answer first."}
