The living room needed dusting, the kitchen was a mess, and the guest room still had sheets to change. She looked at me, expectation clear in her eyes\u2014she needed my help, not just as her husband, but as her partner in making our home welcoming. I nodded, but my mind was already drifting to the mosque. Today was Friday, and though we had a guest speaker ready to deliver the Khutbah, the congregation still expected me to be present, to lead, to offer guidance. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the mosque committee, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s anxious glances, the unmade beds, the echo of my community\u2019s trust in me\u2014all pulling me in different directions. I stood in the hallway, mop in one hand, sermon notes in the other, heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
