My daughter calls out, \u201cMom, come see! Daniel has something to show everyone!\u201d I know how important these moments are\u2014being present, laughing, sharing in their joy. But as I stand, I catch sight of Daniel\u2019s Torah portion open on the counter, untouched. His bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he still stumbles over the Hebrew. I promised myself I\u2019d help him, pass on the melodies and meanings my own grandfather taught me. Yet now, the family expects me to join them, to be the doting grandparent, while my heart aches with the responsibility to guide Daniel in our traditions. I feel torn, pulled between the warmth of family togetherness and the weight of our heritage. My hands tremble as I hover in the doorway, unsure which role to step into first."}
