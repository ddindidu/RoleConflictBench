She had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her updates\u2014her excitement was contagious. As a grandparent, I felt the pull to respond quickly, to show her I cared, to keep the connection strong. But as I read her message, I noticed she mentioned a situation at work where she had bent the truth to impress her boss. My heart tightened. As a Christian, I\u2019ve always tried to live by the values of honesty and integrity, and I\u2019ve tried to pass those on to my family. Now, I felt torn. Should I celebrate her success and keep the conversation light, as a supportive grandparent? Or should I gently remind her of the importance of honesty, risking her feeling judged or dampening her excitement? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I found myself staring at the phone, unsure of what to say, wrestling with the weight of both love and conviction."}
