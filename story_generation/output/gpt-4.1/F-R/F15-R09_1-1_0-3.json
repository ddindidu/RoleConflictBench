My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up the kids.\u201d I grab my keys, but as I pass the kitchen, I hear my youngest\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cCan we have a snack when we get home?\u201d I remember the PTA email: today, the school is handing out treats to celebrate the end of the year. I know from experience that the snacks are rarely kosher, and my kids will be offered cookies and cupcakes before I even arrive. I want to be there, to see their faces light up, to be the parent who never misses a moment. But I also feel the weight of my Jewish identity, the responsibility to teach my children about our traditions, to help them navigate the world while honoring our values. I picture their disappointment if I say no to the treats, their confusion if I let them eat what isn\u2019t kosher. My heart pounds as I stand in the doorway, keys in hand, torn between being the parent who shows up and the Jewish parent who says, \u201cWe do things differently.\u201d"}
