I felt a warm pride, imagining the family gathered, laughter echoing, my grandson\u2019s face beaming as he looked for me in the crowd. This is what I always wanted\u2014to be present, to share these milestones, to be the heart of our family.\n\nBut as she spoke, my mind drifted to the envelope tucked away in my drawer, the one with the money I\u2019d saved for years. My friends from the mosque were finalizing their Hajj plans, and this year, I finally had enough to join them. The call to pilgrimage tugged at my heart, a duty I\u2019d longed to fulfill, a journey that could not be postponed forever.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family needed me here, but my faith called me elsewhere. I stared into my tea, the voices around me fading, caught between the love of my family and the longing to answer Allah\u2019s call."}
