The store manager\u2019s stern gaze burned into me, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as his step-parent. I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with fairness and firmness, but not push him away. My mind raced with what to say\u2014how to discipline him without shaming him, how to show him that stealing is wrong, but that he\u2019s not a bad kid.\n\nAt the same time, another layer of frustration gnawed at me. We had plenty of kosher snacks at home, treats I\u2019d carefully chosen to honor our Jewish values. I\u2019d explained the importance of keeping kosher, of gratitude and self-control, but here he was, reaching for something forbidden in more ways than one. Was it my failure as a step-parent, or as a Jew, that he didn\u2019t understand? My heart pounded as I knelt beside him, torn between the urge to scold, to comfort, to teach, and to protect. I could feel the expectations of both roles pressing in, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to listen to first."}
