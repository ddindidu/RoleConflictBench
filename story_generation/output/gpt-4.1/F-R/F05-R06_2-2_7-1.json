I knew I should open up, share the stress that had been gnawing at me since my boss asked me to cover up a mistake at work. As a husband, I wanted to communicate openly, to let her in on my struggles and fears, just as she had always done for me. But as a Christian, I was torn. The request from my boss went against everything I believed in\u2014honesty, integrity, living by the truth. If I told her, I\u2019d be dragging her into my moral dilemma, burdening her with the weight of my conscience and the risk to my job. If I kept silent, I\u2019d be failing her as a partner, shutting her out when she needed me to trust her. My hands trembled as I reached for my coffee, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice between being the open, supportive husband she expected and the faithful Christian I aspired to be."}
