She looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance as she spoke about the promotion she\u2019d been offered\u2014one that would mean longer hours and more travel. She needed me to listen, to help her weigh the options, to remind her she was capable. I reached for her hand, wanting to be fully present, but my phone buzzed with a message from a young couple in the congregation. They were planning their wedding for next summer and wanted to know if I could officiate. I knew how important it was for them to secure a date, how much trust they placed in me as their rabbi. My wife\u2019s voice wavered, and I saw the vulnerability in her expression. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014her need for my undivided support, their need for my commitment. My heart pounded as I tried to be both the husband she needed and the rabbi they expected, torn between answering her now or responding to them before they lost hope."}
