My children are still asleep, their faces peaceful, unaware of the bills stacked on the kitchen table. As a parent, I know I should take the extra shift at the factory today\u2014the money is tight, and every hour counts toward groceries and rent. But today is also the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a sacred event I\u2019ve promised to help prepare for all year. The monks are counting on me; my presence is part of my commitment to the Buddhist community, a way to nurture my spirit and give back. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. If I go to work, I let down my spiritual family and miss a chance to teach my children about compassion and tradition. If I go to the monastery, I risk falling behind on bills, maybe even skipping a meal or two at home. My heart aches as I sit at the edge of the bed, torn between duty to my family\u2019s needs and the call of my faith."}
