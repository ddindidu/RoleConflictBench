It\u2019s important to us.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her, to my dad, to everyone gathered\u2014preserving the tradition, showing unity as a new family. But as I glanced at the long table, my stomach twisted. The platters were beautiful, but none bore the kosher certification I needed. I could already hear my grandmother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of keeping kosher, of honoring our Jewish heritage even when it\u2019s hard. My stepmother caught my eye, smiling with pride and expectation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my new family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my own need to stay true to my faith. My hands trembled as I reached for the prayer book, torn between the warmth of belonging and the quiet ache of compromise."}
