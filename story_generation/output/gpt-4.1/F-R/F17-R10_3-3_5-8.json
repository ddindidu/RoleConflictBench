My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family\u2019s traditions. This year, I was expected to lead the ceremony, reciting the prayers and guiding everyone through the rituals, just as my grandfather once did. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut my heart was torn. Just yesterday, I had arrived in this city after a long, exhausting journey, determined to participate in the grand festival at the temple\u2014a festival that only happens once every twelve years. As a Hindu, I knew how important it was to immerse myself in every ritual, every offering, to honor my faith and connect with the divine. Yet, the family ceremony was scheduled at the same time as the main temple procession. I could feel my chest tighten as I imagined disappointing my family or missing the spiritual experience I had traveled so far for. The voices of duty and devotion clashed inside me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unable to choose."}
