There was trouble in the family\u2014my son-in-law\u2019s job was at risk, and my daughter needed me to come over, to help with the children, to be the steady presence I always tried to be. But as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. Passover was only days away, and I had promised my grandchildren we would learn the blessings together, just as my own grandmother had taught me. They were excited, waiting for me to share the stories and songs, to pass on the traditions that mean so much to me. I felt pulled in two directions: the urgent need to support my family in crisis, and the deep responsibility to nurture their Jewish identity. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be the grandmother they needed and the Jewish teacher I longed to be, all at once."}
