She had reminded me just this morning how our customs were the glue that held us together, especially now, when the world seemed to be changing so quickly. I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I honor these rituals, that I be present and participate fully. But as I sipped my coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in tears, struggling with a family crisis, asking if I could meet her right away. As a pastor, I felt the weight of her need, the expectation that I would be there, offering comfort and guidance. My heart pulled in two directions: the warmth and duty of my family\u2019s embrace, and the call to serve someone in pain. I stared at the phone, feeling the pressure build inside me, torn between the roots that grounded me and the calling that defined me."}
