My father, usually so quick with a joke, barely looked up from his newspaper. They\u2019d both been quieter lately, their exhaustion seeping into the air between us. I wanted to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to offer the comfort I knew they needed from their daughter. But as I glanced at the clock, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue was starting soon. I was the rabbi, and even though the class was optional and drop-in, I knew some of my congregants looked forward to these evenings, hungry for connection and learning. I could almost hear their voices in the empty classroom, waiting for me to bring Torah to life. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my parents\u2019 silent plea for support, and toward my community\u2019s expectation that I would be there, ready to teach. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
