My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted me to come in for a meeting during the same time as our church\u2019s weekly service. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up for him, to prove I was there even when things got hard. But as a Christian, I was expected to be present at church, to worship and support the community, especially since I\u2019d just joined the outreach committee. I could already imagine the disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes if I missed another service, and the questions from the congregation. At the same time, I pictured my stepson, anxious and alone, needing someone to stand by him. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each pulling me in a different direction, and I felt torn, unsure which path to take."}
