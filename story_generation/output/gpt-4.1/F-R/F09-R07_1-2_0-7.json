My phone buzzes with a reminder: the children finish school in half an hour, and I promised to pick them up today. I picture their faces, searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019ll be there like I always am. At the same time, my Buddhist study group is meeting tonight, and we\u2019re finally discussing a chapter I\u2019ve been longing to explore. The group expects my presence and participation; I\u2019ve missed the last two sessions, and I know how much I need this time for reflection and spiritual growth. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward my children\u2019s expectant smiles and the quiet sanctuary of the sangha. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the world of motherhood and the path of spiritual seeking, uncertain which call to answer."}
