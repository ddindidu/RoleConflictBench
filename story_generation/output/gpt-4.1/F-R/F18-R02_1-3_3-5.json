It felt good to be present, to be the brother they could count on for these moments. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. A message from the church: someone was waiting for me, desperate for guidance, their world unraveling. I could almost hear the tremor in their voice through the text. My family\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to chime in, to help decide our plans. But my mind was already at the church, picturing someone alone in the pews, needing comfort only I could give. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s warmth and laughter, the silent plea for help from a stranger. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
