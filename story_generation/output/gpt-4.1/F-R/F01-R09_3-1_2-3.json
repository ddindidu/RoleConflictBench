He sat at the kitchen table, fidgeting with a bag of chips he\u2019d brought from his friend\u2019s house. \u201cSaba, can I talk to you?\u201d he asked, voice trembling. I nodded, heart swelling with the familiar urge to protect and guide him, to offer the wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over decades. He poured out his troubles, and I listened, searching for the right words to comfort him.\n\nAs he spoke, he tore open the bag and offered me some. I recognized the brand\u2014definitely not kosher. I glanced at the pantry, stocked with matzo and kosher snacks, but Eli\u2019s gesture was so earnest, so trusting. He wanted to share, to connect, to feel understood. My role as his grandfather urged me to accept, to show him I was with him, no matter what. But my Jewish faith, the traditions I\u2019ve kept all my life, told me to gently refuse, to uphold the laws I\u2019ve taught him since he was small. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, my heart caught between love and loyalty, unsure which path to follow."}
