He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted me to come in tonight to discuss what happened. As a father, I knew I had to be there for him, to show him right from wrong, to support and guide him through this mistake. But tonight was also the community Quran study circle, a gathering I\u2019d committed to for weeks. We were set to discuss verses I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a Muslim to participate, to deepen my understanding and connection with my faith. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my son needed me, but so did my spiritual community. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure how to honor my duties as a father and as a Muslim without letting someone down."}
