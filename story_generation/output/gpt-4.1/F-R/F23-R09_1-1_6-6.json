My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes flash in my mind\u2014he\u2019s been talking about that Nintendo for weeks, and his mother promised he\u2019d get it if his grades improved. They did, and now it\u2019s on me to make good on that promise. But the price tag stings; money\u2019s tight, and I\u2019m supposed to be the one keeping us afloat, not splurging on expensive gifts. \n\nAt the same time, tonight is Shabbat. I can already hear the familiar melodies in my head, the comfort of the synagogue, the sense of belonging. I know the congregation will manage without me, but I also know how much it means to my parents\u2014and to me\u2014that I show up, week after week. It\u2019s not just about faith; it\u2019s about tradition, about being present. \n\nI feel pulled in two directions: the responsibility to my new family, to keep my word and make my stepson feel loved, and the commitment to my faith, to show up and be counted. My chest tightens as I realize I can\u2019t do both."}
