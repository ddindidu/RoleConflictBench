The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a shadow over every decision. As a parent, I felt the weight of ensuring my family\u2019s financial stability, calculating every expense, wondering if I could pick up extra work or cut back on groceries. But tonight, I was also Pastor, invited to a community gathering where I was expected to share wisdom and teach religious principles. As I casually mentioned a story from scripture, I saw the eager faces around me, waiting for guidance, for hope. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the loan. My words faltered. How could I preach about faith and trust when anxiety gnawed at me? The congregation expected certainty, but my family needed security. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I could meet without failing the other."}
