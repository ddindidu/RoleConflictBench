My mother chimed in, her eyes hopeful, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since we all did something together.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my mind was already racing ahead. The High Holidays were approaching, and as the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would resonate with the entire congregation. The pressure was immense; people looked to me for guidance, inspiration, and comfort during these sacred days. My father turned to me, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right? We can\u2019t do it without you.\u201d I nodded, but inside, anxiety twisted in my chest. How could I be present for my family, sharing laughter and stories on the trail, when I knew I should be pouring over texts, crafting words that mattered? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, longing to fulfill both roles but unsure how to choose."}
