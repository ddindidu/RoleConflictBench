She was starting high school next week, nervous about making friends and finding her place. As her grandmother, I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation to share wisdom from my own tangled journey through life. I wanted to give her all the time she needed, to listen and guide her gently.\n\nBut the church bells echoed faintly from down the street, a reminder of my other promise\u2014to my faith and my community. As a Christian, I was expected to be present at Sunday worship, to join in prayer and fellowship, to set an example of devotion for my family. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My heart tugged in two directions: toward the granddaughter who needed me now, and toward the sanctuary where I was also needed. I wrestled with the guilt of possibly letting someone down, unsure which role should take precedence this morning."}
