I nodded, heart swelling with the familiar ache of wanting to protect her from the world\u2019s sharp edges. She led me to a quiet corner, her voice trembling as she confided in me about a decision she faced, one that could change her life. She needed my wisdom, my comfort, the kind of guidance only a grandmother could give.\n\nBut as I listened, the aroma of the communal meal drifted over. Plates were being passed around, piled high with food I couldn\u2019t be sure was kosher. My family and friends expected me to join in, to share in the meal as part of our community. Yet my faith demanded I hold back, that I honor the laws I\u2019d kept all my life. My granddaughter\u2019s hand squeezed mine, her need for reassurance clear. I felt torn\u2014between the role of the nurturing grandmother, present and supportive, and the observant Jew, steadfast in tradition. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught in the silent struggle of choosing which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
