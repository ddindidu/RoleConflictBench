They\u2019d been looking forward to it all week\u2014homemade cookies, stories, laughter. As a grandmother, I knew how much these moments meant, how much my presence mattered. Just as I was setting out the plates, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from the congregation, her voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014her marriage was unraveling, and she didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As her pastor, I was her anchor, the one she trusted for comfort and guidance. I could hear the desperation in her voice, the silent plea for me to be there, right now. My chest tightened. My family expected me to be present, to cherish these rare hours together. But Sarah needed me, too, and I knew how much she depended on my support. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call of love I could answer without letting the other down."}
