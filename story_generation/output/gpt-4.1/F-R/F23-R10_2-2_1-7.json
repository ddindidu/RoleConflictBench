The school\u2019s open class for Riya was scheduled for the same afternoon as my family\u2019s puja for Navaratri. As a step-parent, I knew how much it meant to Riya that I be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on as she read her essay. She\u2019d asked me twice already if I was coming, her eyes hopeful, her voice uncertain. I wanted to show her I was committed, that I belonged in her life.\n\nBut as a Hindu, my family expected me at the ceremony. My mother-in-law had already called, reminding me to wear the new saree and arrive early to help with the preparations. Missing the puja would be seen as disrespectful, a sign that I was neglecting my roots and responsibilities. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, making it hard to breathe. I imagined Riya\u2019s disappointed face, my family\u2019s disapproving glances. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, wishing I could split myself in two, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I cared about would be hurt."}
