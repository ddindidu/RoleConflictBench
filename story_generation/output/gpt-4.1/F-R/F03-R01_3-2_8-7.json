My mind was deep in scripture when my mother sat across from me, her eyes red and voice trembling. She spoke about her fears\u2014about Dad\u2019s health, about feeling alone, about doubts she\u2019d never voiced before. She reached for my hand, searching for comfort, for her son to listen and reassure her. But as she spoke, my mind kept drifting to the sermon deadline, the congregation\u2019s expectations, the weight of needing to offer clear, unwavering guidance. I felt torn\u2014my mother needed her son\u2019s warmth and understanding, but my church needed their pastor\u2019s wisdom and certainty. The words of comfort I wanted to offer her tangled with the lessons I was preparing for others. I could feel the pressure mounting, the impossible pull between being the son she needed and the pastor my congregation expected."}
