My heart swelled with the familiar urge to guide him, to share the lessons life had etched into me. I wanted to sit with him, listen, and help him find his footing. But just then, my phone buzzed urgently. The mosque committee member\u2019s voice was hurried: \u201cImam sahib, the congregation is waiting. No one else can lead the prayer tonight.\u201d I glanced at my grandson, his hope hanging in the air, and then at the clock, knowing the community was counting on me to fulfill my duty as their imam. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for my wisdom, and my community\u2019s need for my leadership. I felt torn, caught between the love of a grandfather and the responsibility of an imam, unsure which call to answer first."}
