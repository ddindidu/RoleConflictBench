The Shabbat service was only two days away, and I hadn\u2019t even started my sermon. My mind spun with possible themes, but nothing felt right. Just then, my partner walked in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. They sat across from me, voice trembling as they described the impossible choice their boss had given them\u2014take on a new project that could mean a promotion, or stay with their current team and risk stagnation. They needed me, not as a rabbi, but as their spouse, to listen, to reassure, to help them sort through their fears.\n\nBut the weight of my congregation pressed on me too. They expected inspiration, guidance, a message that would carry them through the week. I could feel the clock ticking, the pressure mounting. My partner\u2019s hand reached for mine, seeking comfort, while my mind drifted to the empty sermon page. I wanted to be fully present for them, but the demands of my calling tugged at me, splitting my heart in two."}
