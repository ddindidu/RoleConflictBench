She sat down across from me, her voice trembling as she began to share her worries about Dad\u2019s health and the mounting bills. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to hold her hand and reassure her that things would be okay. But the clock on the wall reminded me that the auspicious time for my daily puja was slipping away. As a Hindu, I was taught that these rituals must be performed with devotion and punctuality, especially today, an important festival. My heart ached as I watched my mother\u2019s face, torn between the urge to comfort her and the pull of my faith. I wanted to be the daughter she needed, but I also felt the weight of my spiritual duty. The incense stick in my hand trembled as I sat there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
