As a grandmother, I knew I should call her, offer comfort, and maybe invite her over for tea and a snack\u2014just like my mother used to do for me. I glanced at the pantry, stocked with kosher treats, and felt a small sense of pride in keeping our traditions alive. But then I remembered how my granddaughter sometimes found our dietary rules restrictive, and how she\u2019d once confided that she felt awkward refusing my food. \n\nI wanted so much to be there for her, to show her love in the way I knew best, but I also felt the weight of my Jewish identity, the importance of keeping kosher in my home. The expectation to nurture my family clashed with the expectation to uphold my faith. My thumb hovered over her contact, my mind racing with questions. Should I invite her over and risk making her uncomfortable, or should I find another way to reach out? The two parts of myself\u2014grandmother and Jew\u2014pulled me in different directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure of what to do next."}
