Relatives were coming in the afternoon, and the house needed to be spotless. I could see the stress in my spouse\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for help as they juggled cleaning, cooking, and organizing. I knew I was expected to pitch in, to share the load and make sure everything was perfect for our guests.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for church. I hadn\u2019t been able to attend regularly, and I missed the sense of peace and community I found there. My faith calls me to worship, to be present with others and with God, especially on Sundays. Yet, the thought of leaving my spouse alone with all the work filled me with guilt. I felt torn, pulled between my commitment to my marriage and my devotion to my faith. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand and a dust rag in the other, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
