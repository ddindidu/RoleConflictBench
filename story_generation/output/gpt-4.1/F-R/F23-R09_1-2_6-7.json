Max had been counting down the days, his excitement bubbling over every time he mentioned the game he\u2019d play first. I wanted to keep my promise, to show him that I could be counted on, that I was really part of this family. But the cost gnawed at me\u2014money was tight, and I\u2019d already stretched the budget thin.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the synagogue. I was scheduled to chant Torah this Shabbat, something I\u2019d committed to months ago. It wasn\u2019t just about showing up; it was about honoring my faith, my community, and the tradition that anchored me. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Max\u2019s hopeful eyes, the congregation\u2019s expectation, my own longing to belong in both places. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be enough for everyone, knowing that whatever I chose, something would have to give."}
