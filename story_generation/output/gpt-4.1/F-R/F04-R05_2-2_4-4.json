My younger sister texts me too, sending a picture of the table she\u2019s setting, plates already gleaming. I know how much it means to them when I show up\u2014not just as a guest, but as a brother, a son, a part of the family\u2019s fabric.\n\nBut as I hang up, my phone buzzes again. The synagogue\u2019s education director is confirming that I\u2019ll be teaching the children\u2019s Torah class tonight. It\u2019s the weekly class, the one I promised to lead, the one the parents count on. I picture the eager faces of the kids, the parents who trust me to guide their children, the responsibility I carry as their rabbi.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expects my presence, my laughter, my stories. My congregation expects my guidance, my teaching, my commitment. I sit at my desk, torn, the clock ticking closer to evening, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer."}
