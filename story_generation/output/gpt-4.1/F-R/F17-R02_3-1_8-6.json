She looked at me, her eyes searching for reassurance, for the kind of comfort she\u2019d always given me when I was small. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to hold her hand and promise her things would be okay. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was starting in fifteen minutes. As a priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for my parishioners and help shape their spiritual journeys. I could already imagine the team waiting for me, expecting guidance and vision. My heart ached as I glanced between my mother\u2019s tearful face and the clock ticking on the wall. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full presence, each impossible to ignore."}
