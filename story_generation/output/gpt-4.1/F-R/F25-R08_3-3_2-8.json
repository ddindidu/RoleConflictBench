She wanted to know how I was feeling, what I\u2019d eaten, if I\u2019d taken my medication. Ever since I moved in, she\u2019d made it clear that daily updates were important to her, a way to build trust and closeness. I tried to respond quickly, sharing every detail, even when it felt exhausting. \n\nBut now, as I sat with the Hajj application in my lap, my heart pounded. My doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis might be your last chance to travel far.\u201d As a Muslim, performing Hajj was a dream, a duty I\u2019d waited my whole life to fulfill. The trip would mean days without regular contact, maybe even spotty reception. I imagined my stepmother\u2019s worry, her disappointment if I broke our routine. \n\nI felt torn, caught between her need for connection and my own spiritual longing. My fingers hovered over the phone, unsure whether to type out my plans or keep them to myself, afraid of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
