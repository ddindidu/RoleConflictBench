Tonight, I\u2019m sitting on my bed, phone in hand, listening to my mom\u2019s voice as she asks about my classes and if I\u2019m eating well. She always worries, and I know it comforts her to hear about my meals. But this week, my roommate\u2019s family sent a care package\u2014homemade cookies and snacks, none of them kosher. I haven\u2019t told my parents about it, and now my mom is asking what I\u2019ve been snacking on. I hesitate, feeling the weight of her expectation that I\u2019ll be honest and open, the way a good son should. At the same time, I feel the tug of my Jewish identity, the commitment to keep kosher, and the guilt of even considering eating something outside those boundaries. My mom\u2019s voice is gentle, but I can sense her waiting for my answer. I want to reassure her, to share everything, but I\u2019m caught between being the son who tells all and the Jew who keeps faith with tradition. My heart pounds as I search for words, torn between two parts of myself."}
