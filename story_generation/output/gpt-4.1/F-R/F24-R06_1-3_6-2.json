The street was quiet, the sun dipping low. Suddenly, a group of older kids blocked our path, laughing and jeering. One of them shoved my stepbrother, hard. My heart pounded. I remembered Mom\u2019s words: \u201cLook out for each other. You\u2019re family now.\u201d I wanted to protect him, to stand up and fight back. But then, another voice echoed in my mind\u2014my Sunday school teacher, reminding us to turn the other cheek, to forgive, to show love even to those who hurt us. The boys taunted us, daring us to react. My stepbrother looked at me, fear and anger in his eyes, silently begging me to do something. I felt torn in two\u2014my loyalty to him pulling me one way, my faith pulling me another. My fists clenched, my mind raced, and I stood frozen, caught between the urge to defend my brother and the call to live out my Christian values."}
