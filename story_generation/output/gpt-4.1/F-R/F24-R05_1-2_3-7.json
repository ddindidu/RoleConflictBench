I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging, the gentle tug of family expectation. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the bar mitzvah I was to officiate on Saturday, a ceremony I\u2019d helped plan for months. As a rabbi, I knew how much this day meant to the family, how my presence was not just expected but essential. My stepbrother nudged me, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d I looked at him, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The joy of being included, the duty of spiritual leadership\u2014both pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to find words, caught between the promise of family and the sacred trust of my congregation."}
