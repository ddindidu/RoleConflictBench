He sits at the table, fidgeting with his spoon, eyes searching mine for answers about why we say \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cplease.\u201d As his mother, I know this is my moment to guide him, to teach him the small courtesies that shape a kind and disciplined heart. But my mind keeps drifting to the stack of Buddhist texts on my desk, the ones I promised my teacher I would summarize for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. The expectation weighs on me: to be a diligent student, to reflect deeply and share insights with the sangha. Yet here I am, torn between the gentle urgency of my son\u2019s learning and the quiet call of my spiritual path. My heart aches with the pressure of both roles\u2014wanting to be fully present for my child, yet also to honor my commitment to the teachings. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wonder how I can possibly meet both demands tonight."}
