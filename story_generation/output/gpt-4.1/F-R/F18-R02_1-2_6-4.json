The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, and I kept a watchful eye on him, as I always did. Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d I was his older sibling, his protector, and I took that seriously. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the appointment I\u2019d scheduled with Mrs. Carter, a parishioner who\u2019d confided in me about her ongoing struggle with anxiety. As her priest, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. The meeting was in fifteen minutes, and the church was in the opposite direction from home. My brother glanced up at me, trusting, unaware of my inner turmoil. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I walk him home as promised, or leave him to hurry to the church, where someone else was counting on me? My heart pounded as I tried to decide which responsibility mattered more in this moment."}
