The street is familiar, but I can\u2019t help glancing over my shoulder, making sure he\u2019s safe. Mom always says, \u201cLook out for each other,\u201d and I take that seriously. But my mind keeps drifting to the monastery. The festival starts at dawn tomorrow, and the monks asked for volunteers to help set up before sunrise. As a Buddhist, I feel a deep responsibility to support the community, especially for this once-a-year event. I promised I\u2019d be there early, but my brother\u2019s been anxious lately, and Mom asked me not to leave him alone in the mornings. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches at the thought of letting down the monks, but I can\u2019t ignore my brother\u2019s need for comfort and safety. Each step home, I wrestle with the weight of both promises, unsure which path honors who I am."}
