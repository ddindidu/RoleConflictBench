As the eldest son, it was my duty to uphold our family\u2019s traditions, to honor our ancestors by guiding the ceremony with reverence and care. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was expected at the temple to conduct the daily prayer service\u2014a commitment I had never missed since becoming a priest. The community relied on me for spiritual guidance, and even though tonight\u2019s service was optional, I knew some would come seeking comfort and connection. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each carrying its own expectations. I felt torn, caught between the legacy of my family and the needs of my congregation, uncertain which path to follow as the evening shadows lengthened around me."}
