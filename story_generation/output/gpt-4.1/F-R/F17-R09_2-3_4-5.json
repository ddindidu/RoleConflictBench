My mother had spent the car ride reminding me how important it was to show respect for our family\u2019s traditions, especially now, when everyone was together after so long. Plates of steaming food were passed around, and I could see my cousins piling their plates high, laughing and nudging each other. But as the platters came closer, I realized none of the dishes had kosher certification. I glanced at my father, who gave me a reassuring smile, but I could feel the weight of his expectation too\u2014he always said that keeping kosher was a way to honor our faith. My stomach twisted. If I ate, I\u2019d be part of the family celebration, just like my parents wanted. But if I refused, I\u2019d be following what I\u2019d been taught about being Jewish, even if it meant standing out. The voices around me faded as I stared at the food, caught between the warmth of belonging and the quiet pull of my beliefs."}
