My mom keeps reminding me how important it is to show up, to be part of the family, to make my stepbrother feel welcome. But earlier today, I saw him at school, teasing a new kid in the hallway. I wanted to step in, to say something, but I hesitated. Now, as I get ready for dinner, I feel this knot in my stomach. As a Christian, I know I should show love and kindness, even to those who hurt others. I want to reach out, maybe talk to my stepbrother, or at least not ignore him. But I\u2019m also angry and disappointed, and I don\u2019t want to pretend everything is fine at dinner. My family expects me to be cheerful and present, but my faith tells me to be honest and loving, even when it\u2019s hard. I stand in front of the mirror, torn between keeping the peace at home and following what I believe is right."}
