The house buzzed with urgency\u2014her parents and siblings would arrive in a few hours, and every corner needed to shine. She glanced at me, her eyes asking for help with the guest room, and I nodded, feeling the weight of our shared responsibility. My phone vibrated on the counter. It was Brother Ahmed, his message urgent: \u201cImam, can you meet today? I really need to talk. It\u2019s about my family.\u201d I knew his struggles had been building for weeks, and as his imam, I was expected to offer guidance and comfort, especially now. But the house was far from ready, and my wife was counting on me to be present, to share the load. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the needs of my family at home and the needs of my community. The clock ticked louder, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
