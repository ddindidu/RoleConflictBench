My stepmother had texted earlier, asking if I could call her and Dad this weekend. \u201cWe miss you,\u201d she wrote, \u201cjust want to hear your voice.\u201d I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I\u2019d moved out and started my work as a pastor. But just as I was about to hit send, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was a member of my congregation. Their house had been damaged in the storm last night, and they needed help, comfort, and guidance. I was expected to organize support, offer prayers, and be present for them, right now. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the caring step-child my parents hoped for, but my congregation needed me, too. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn, unable to give fully to either side. I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to make first."}
