The quiet of the afternoon was a rare gift, and I had been looking forward to this time of spiritual reading and reflection all week. My heart longed for the peace that came with these moments, the gentle whisper of God\u2019s presence. Just as I closed my eyes to pray, my phone buzzed. It was my daughter\u2014her message urgent. My grandson had fallen ill, and they needed me at home. My mind raced. As a nun, I was expected to devote myself to prayer and contemplation, especially during these precious hours. But as a grandmother, my family needed my comfort and support. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling at my heart. I sat frozen, torn between the silence of the chapel and the cries of my family, unsure which call to answer."}
