We\u2019d argued again\u2014this time about her skipping out on helping me prepare for Shavuot. As her brother, I wanted us to talk it out, to listen and rebuild the trust that felt so fragile lately. But as the oldest in a Jewish family, I also felt the weight of making sure she learned the blessings and traditions before the holiday arrived. Our parents expected me to guide her, to pass on what I\u2019d learned, but she pushed back, saying I was too strict, too focused on rules. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to keep our traditions alive. At the same time, I remembered my promise to myself to be a better brother, to respect her feelings and not just lecture. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I felt stuck\u2014torn between being the brother she needed and the teacher my family expected."}
