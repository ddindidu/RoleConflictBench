She\u2019d just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, and I could hear her crying from her room. As her brother, I knew she needed me\u2014she always turned to me in moments like this, and I\u2019d always promised to be there for her, no matter what. I wanted to rush in, sit beside her, and let her lean on me, just like we did when we were kids.\n\nBut as I reached for her doorknob, I remembered I was still in my shorts and sleeveless undershirt, the way I usually dressed when lounging at home. Even though it was just family, I\u2019d been taught to dress modestly, especially around my sister, in line with our Islamic values. I hesitated, torn between the urge to comfort her immediately and the nagging feeling that I should change into something more appropriate first. The seconds stretched, my hand hovering in the air, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014between being the brother she needed right now and the Muslim I was raised to be."}
