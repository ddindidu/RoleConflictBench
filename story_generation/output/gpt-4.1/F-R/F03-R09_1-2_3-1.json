I nod, feeling the weight of his words. As a son, I want to honor my parents, to show them that their traditions matter to me, that I am part of this family\u2019s story.\n\nBut as a Jew, I know I have another responsibility now. My own children are growing, and the upcoming holiday is just days away. They still don\u2019t know the blessings, haven\u2019t learned the melodies or the meanings behind the words. I should be teaching them, passing on what was given to me. Yet, every time I try, I feel torn\u2014my parents expect me to be present, to participate fully in our family\u2019s way, while my children need me to guide them, to make the traditions their own.\n\nThe pressure builds inside me, a knot of guilt and longing. I want to be a good son, but I also want to be a good Jewish parent. The holiday approaches, and I am caught between the voices of my past and the needs of my future, unsure which path to follow."}
