She asks about my day, her eyes searching for more than the usual, and I know she wants me to open up, to share not just the events but the feelings behind them. I want to give her that, to be the husband who listens and speaks honestly. But my mind keeps drifting to the blank page in my study, the one waiting for the first words of my next Shabbat sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014something meaningful, and I know I should be brainstorming, letting ideas percolate. Instead, I\u2019m here, nodding, half-present, torn between the need to be a good husband and the pressure to fulfill my duties as a rabbi. My wife\u2019s voice grows softer, and I sense her disappointment. Guilt gnaws at me. I want to be fully here, but the weight of both roles presses in, and I wonder how I can possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations, including my own."}
