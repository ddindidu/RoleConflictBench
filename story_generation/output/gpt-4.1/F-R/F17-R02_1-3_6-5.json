I asked her, as I often do, if everything was alright at home. She smiled, but her eyes darted away, and I could feel the heaviness in the room. I wanted to stay, to press gently, to be the child who listens and supports, who helps carry the weight she tries so hard to hide. But just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the church. Someone was waiting for me, desperate, in the sanctuary. They needed guidance, comfort, a steady presence. I could hear the urgency in the message, the kind of pain that can\u2019t wait. My heart twisted. My mother needed me, but so did this stranger. I felt torn, the expectations of being a good child and a devoted priest pulling me in opposite directions. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, unable to move, caught between the home I grew up in and the sanctuary I serve."}
