My husband had already mentioned, gently but pointedly, that he was running out of clean work shirts. I knew he\u2019d been picking up extra chores lately, and I felt the weight of my promise to share the load. But just as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She sounded desperate, her words trembling with anxiety about her mother\u2019s illness. As a pastor, I knew she needed comfort, someone to listen and offer hope. My heart ached for her, but my mind spun with guilt\u2014if I called her now, the laundry would wait another day, and my husband\u2019s patience might wear thin. I sat on the edge of the couch, phone in one hand, a crumpled shirt in the other, torn between the needs of my home and the needs of my flock, feeling the tension pull me in two directions at once."}
