My daughter reminds me, \u201cDad, don\u2019t forget, everyone\u2019s counting on you to say the blessing at dinner.\u201d I know how much these gatherings mean\u2014my grandchildren look forward to my stories, my presence, my listening ear. But this year, my son-in-law\u2019s brother is bringing his new partner, and I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s outspoken about beliefs that clash with my Christian values. I want to welcome her, to show kindness, but I worry about the conversations that might arise, the jokes or comments that might challenge my faith. My family expects me to be warm and open, to keep the peace and make everyone feel at home. Yet, as a Christian, I feel the weight of living out my values, not just in private but in every word and action. I sit at my kitchen table, phone in hand, heart heavy, wondering how I can be both the loving grandfather my family needs and the faithful Christian I strive to be."}
