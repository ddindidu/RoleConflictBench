My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes echoed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days, trusting my promise. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of providing, of keeping my word, of making him feel secure and loved in this new family. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder about the bar mitzvah I was to officiate in just a few hours. Months of preparation, a family\u2019s joy and spiritual milestone, all depending on my presence and guidance as their rabbi. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides\u2014my stepson\u2019s happiness, my congregation\u2019s trust. If I left now to buy the Nintendo, I\u2019d be cutting it dangerously close for the ceremony. If I delayed the purchase, I\u2019d break a promise and risk his trust. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
