She didn\u2019t say anything, just walked past me, shoulders slumped. I knew something was wrong\u2014she always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As her sibling, I felt the urge to go after her, to sit beside her and listen, to be the support she needed. But I glanced at the clock. It was almost time for my evening prayers, the most important part of my daily rituals as a Hindu. Missing even a single chant or offering felt unthinkable; my family and I believed it kept our home blessed and peaceful. The incense was already burning, the altar set. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my sister, who needed me now, and toward the sacred duty I\u2019d promised never to neglect. I stood frozen, torn between comforting her and honoring my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
