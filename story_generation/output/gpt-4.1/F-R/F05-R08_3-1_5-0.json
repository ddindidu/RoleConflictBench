My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that her cousins would arrive tomorrow, and every corner of the house needed to shine. As a husband, I knew she expected me to help\u2014scrubbing, dusting, making sure everything was perfect. I wanted to be there for her, to share the load, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in this.\n\nBut tonight was also special for me. The house was finally quiet, and I had planned to spend the evening with the Quran, reciting and reflecting in peace. As a Muslim, I felt the pull of my faith, the need to nourish my soul, especially after a long, hectic week. The thought of missing this rare, tranquil time weighed heavily on me.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my wife\u2019s expectations and toward my own spiritual needs. I stood there, sponge in hand, torn between the roles I cherished, unsure which path to take."}
