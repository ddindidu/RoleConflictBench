She\u2019d sent a simple, \u201cHow are you, sweetheart?\u201d on Friday night, and now it was Sunday afternoon. I knew she expected more than my usual, \u201cBusy, but good!\u201d She wanted to hear my voice, to know I was really present, not just a daughter in name but in heart. But as I started to type, my email pinged\u2014a young couple from the congregation, newly engaged, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to meet soon, to talk about dates and dreams. I felt the weight of their hope, the honor of being asked to guide them through such a sacred moment. My mind spun with the calendar, the meetings, the sermons, the family I so rarely saw. I wanted to be the rabbi they needed, the daughter my parents missed. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between calling home and replying to the couple, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
