Family dinner tonight to celebrate?\u201d My heart leapt with pride\u2014she\u2019d worked so hard for this. I was about to reply when my calendar notification flashed: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session, the one before their Beit Din, was tonight. They\u2019d been preparing for months, and I was their guide, their rabbi. I knew how much this session meant; it was the last chance to answer questions, to calm nerves, to ensure they felt ready for this life-changing step.\n\nBut my sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014how many times had I missed her milestones because of synagogue duties? She\u2019d always said, \u201cWe support each other, no matter what.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the brother who should be at the table, raising a glass, and the rabbi who should be at the study table, offering wisdom and reassurance. My phone sat in my hand, the two worlds colliding, and I felt the ache of wanting to be fully present in both, knowing tonight I could only choose one."}
