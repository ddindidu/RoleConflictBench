She wanted honesty, clarity\u2014she needed to know if we could manage, if I was hiding any worries. As her husband, I owed her openness, but my mind kept drifting to the clock. In less than an hour, my family would gather at the temple for the puja, expecting me to arrive early, dressed in my kurta, ready to help with the rituals. Missing it or arriving late would be seen as disrespectful, especially during this important festival. My phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me to bring the offerings. My wife\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for answers, while my heart pounded with the weight of both worlds. I wanted to be the honest partner she deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t let my family down. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, my sincerity, and my time. I sat there, torn, feeling the pressure build as the minutes slipped away."}
