I kept an eye on her, remembering what Mom always said: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d The street was familiar, but the sky was already turning orange, and I knew we were running late. My mind kept drifting to the small brass lamp waiting at home, the one I was supposed to light before dusk as part of our daily prayers. It was my turn today, and I could already hear my grandmother\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t let the sun set before you offer your prayers.\u201d\n\nBut my sister wanted to stop at the corner shop for a snack, and she begged me to come with her. If I said yes, we\u2019d be even later, and I\u2019d miss the time for the ritual. If I said no, she\u2019d have to walk the last block alone, and I\u2019d be breaking my promise to always look out for her. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my sister, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
