Someone had cut in line, ignoring the quiet protests of others. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small things. I felt I should have spoken up, but I hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene. The guilt lingered, gnawing at me.\n\nThat evening, I noticed my wife seemed distant, her eyes clouded with worry. As a husband, I knew I should communicate openly, share my own concerns, and encourage her to do the same. But I hesitated again, unsure if I should burden her with my own moral struggle when she clearly had her own worries. Should I open up about my day, risking making her feel worse, or should I focus on her, setting aside my own ethical discomfort? The expectations of being a good husband and a good Hindu pulled me in different directions, and I sat there, caught between the urge to speak and the need to listen, unsure which role to honor first."}
