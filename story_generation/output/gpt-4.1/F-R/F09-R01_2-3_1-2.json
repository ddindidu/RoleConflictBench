The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was circled in bright red, a promise I\u2019d made weeks ago. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for the class play every night, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, clapping in the front row. But just as I was about to leave, my phone rang. It was a member of my congregation, her voice trembling with fear and desperation. She was facing a crisis, her choices weighing heavily on her soul, and she needed guidance\u2014now. I could hear the urgency in her voice, the kind that couldn\u2019t wait. My daughter\u2019s expectant face flashed in my mind, but so did the responsibility I carried as a pastor. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, the weight of their expectations pressing down on my chest. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the call of my child and the call of my faith, not knowing which door I would walk through."}
