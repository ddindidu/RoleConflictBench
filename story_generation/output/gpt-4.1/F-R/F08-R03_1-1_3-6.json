My daughter\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see you, Mom. The kids miss you.\u201d I picture my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces, their laughter, the warmth of their hugs. Yet, as I set the bread aside, my eyes fall on the worn pages of my prayer book. This afternoon was meant for quiet reflection, a rare stretch of solitude for spiritual reading and contemplation\u2014something my heart has been yearning for all week. The convent is peaceful, and I feel the gentle pull of silence, the expectation that I devote myself to God in these moments. But the tug of family is just as strong, the sense that I must be present, nurturing, a loving grandmother. My heart aches as I stand between these two worlds, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of both callings, uncertain which path to follow as the afternoon sun streams through the window."}
