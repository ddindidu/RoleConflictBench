I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom always reminded me, \u201cYou\u2019re the older one, keep him safe.\u201d Halfway down Maple Street, we saw Jamie, a classmate, sitting alone on the curb, head in hands. I remembered what Pastor Lee said last Sunday: \u201cShow love to those who are hurting, just as Jesus would.\u201d I wanted to stop, to ask Jamie if he was okay, maybe offer to walk with him. But Ethan tugged at my sleeve, whispering, \u201cLet\u2019s go. He\u2019s always weird. Mom said not to talk to strangers.\u201d I hesitated, torn. My stepbrother needed me to keep him safe, to get him home on time, but my faith told me to reach out, to show kindness. My heart pounded as I stood between Ethan and Jamie, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
