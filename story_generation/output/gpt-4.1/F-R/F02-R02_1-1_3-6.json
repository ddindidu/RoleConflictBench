He was supposed to be learning table manners, and I had promised myself to be patient, to guide him gently. \u201cRemember, napkin in your lap,\u201d I reminded, trying to keep my voice calm. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another reminder about the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for my community. The meeting was starting in ten minutes, and I was supposed to be there, ready with ideas and encouragement. My son looked up at me, eyes wide, waiting for my attention, while my mind raced with lesson plans and parishioner needs. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my son needing a father\u2019s guidance, my parish needing a priest\u2019s leadership. I gripped the edge of the table, torn between the call to nurture my child and the call to shepherd my flock, heart pounding as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once."}
