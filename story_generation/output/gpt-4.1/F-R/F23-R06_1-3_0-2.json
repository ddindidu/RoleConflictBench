The school bell would ring in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019d promised the kids I\u2019d be there waiting, just like every Friday. Being their step-parent meant showing up, being present, and building trust\u2014especially after all the changes they\u2019d been through. But as I turned onto Main Street, my phone buzzed with a message from my church group: a close friend was in trouble, caught in a situation that demanded immediate help, and they needed someone to stand up for what was right, to act with the integrity and compassion my faith calls me to.\n\nMy heart pounded. If I went to help, I\u2019d let the kids down, maybe even break the fragile trust we\u2019d built. But if I ignored the call for help, I\u2019d be turning my back on the values I hold most dear. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I sat at the red light, torn, praying for guidance, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
