My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014she\u2019s been patient, but I know she\u2019s tired of shouldering the chores alone. I promised I\u2019d help tonight, that we\u2019d finally tackle the mess together after dinner. I want to keep that promise, to show her she\u2019s not alone in this partnership.\n\nMy phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue president: \u201cSad news. Mr. Goldstein passed away. The family needs you to officiate the funeral tomorrow morning. They\u2019re devastated and want to meet with you tonight.\u201d My heart sinks. I know how much the Goldsteins need comfort, guidance, and tradition right now. As their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be present, to lead, to support them in their grief.\n\nI look at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s quiet hope for a shared evening, the congregation\u2019s urgent need for their rabbi. I close my eyes, torn, the demands of husband and rabbi pulling me in opposite directions."}
