The family\u2019s faces lit up with excitement, and I could see how much this moment meant to her. As a grandparent, I knew how important it was to support her, to celebrate milestones and be present for these moments. But as a Christian, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. My faith teaches me about the sanctity of marriage, about living according to certain values. I wanted to be loving and accepting, but I also felt the weight of my beliefs pressing down on me. My daughter looked at me, searching for approval, and I could feel everyone\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for my reaction. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to embrace her and the fear of betraying my convictions. The room felt smaller, the air heavier, as I struggled to find the right words, torn between my love for my family and my commitment to my faith."}
