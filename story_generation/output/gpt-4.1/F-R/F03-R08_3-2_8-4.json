She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. I wanted to stay, to offer the comfort she sought, but my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, and everyone would be there, including my boss and colleagues from different departments. I had already laid out my clothes, carefully choosing an outfit that met Islamic guidelines for modesty, but I knew it would stand out among my peers. I could almost hear the questions and see the curious glances. My parents expected me to be their anchor, but my faith expected me to represent my beliefs with dignity, even if it meant feeling out of place. As my mother squeezed my hand, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
