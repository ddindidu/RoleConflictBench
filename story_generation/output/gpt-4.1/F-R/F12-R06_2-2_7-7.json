As his wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was wrong, and share my own worries from work. We\u2019d always promised to be open with each other, to talk through our struggles.

I felt torn\u2014my heart ached for Sarah, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the tension in my own home. The expectations pressed in on me: be a supportive wife, be a caring Christian.
