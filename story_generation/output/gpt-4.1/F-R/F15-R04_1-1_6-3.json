He\u2019d done well in school, and I\u2019d told him I\u2019d buy it if he kept his grades up. But the price tag gnawed at me\u2014money was tight, and I worried about making ends meet. As a parent, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy, but I also felt the weight of every dollar spent.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee. The guest speaker for Friday\u2019s sermon had arrived early and was ready to deliver the Khutbah if I needed to step aside. It was a rare chance to use the time for family or work, but as the imam, the community expected me to lead, to be present and visible, especially on Fridays. I felt torn\u2014my heart pulled between my son\u2019s happiness and my duty to the congregation. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, wrestling with what to do next."}
