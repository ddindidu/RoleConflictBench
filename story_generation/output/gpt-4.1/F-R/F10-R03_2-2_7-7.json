They had always leaned on me for comfort, and now, more than ever, they needed my presence\u2014my words, my listening ear, my gentle touch. But as I reached for my mother\u2019s hand, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner was in crisis, desperate to meet with me tonight. As a nun, I was expected to be available, to offer guidance and spiritual support, especially in moments of doubt. My heart twisted. My parents\u2019 silent plea for comfort pulled me one way, while my calling as a nun tugged me in another. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest, knowing that wherever I went, someone would be left waiting, someone\u2019s need unmet. I stood in the hallway, caught between the world I was born into and the one I had chosen, unable to move."}
