The open class at Lily\u2019s school was circled in bright red, a reminder from my wife that I promised to be there. Lily had been practicing her lines for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d sit in the front row, cheering her on. But just below that, in my own handwriting, was the note for the annual religious holiday\u2014our most sacred day, when the whole community would gather and look to me for guidance, comfort, and tradition. As a priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for every family, to embody faith and stability. I could already hear the disappointment in Lily\u2019s voice if I missed her big moment, and I could feel the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders. Both needed me, both deserved my presence. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the demands of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which promise I would have to break."}
