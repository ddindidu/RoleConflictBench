I feel the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. As his mother, I know I should pull him aside, explain why his behavior isn\u2019t acceptable, and guide him toward better choices. But today is our weekly slot for studying Jewish traditions\u2014a time I cherish, when I pass down stories and values from our heritage. I had planned to shift the lesson to later, but now, if I stop to discipline him, we\u2019ll run out of time before dinner. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I seize this teachable moment about behavior, or protect our sacred study time? My heart aches as I wrestle with the expectations of being a good mother and a devoted Jewish parent, knowing I can\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
