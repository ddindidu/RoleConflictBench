I nodded, trying to listen, but my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and everyone expected me to lead the evening prayer. I glanced at the clock; there was barely enough time to get ready and reach the mosque. My wife paused, waiting for my response, and I realized she needed more than a nod\u2014she wanted me to really hear her, to share in her day, to be present. But the weight of the community\u2019s expectation pressed on me. I was their imam, and tonight, they needed me. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my congregation and the promise I\u2019d made to always be open and attentive with my spouse. I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
