As her stepmother, I feel the weight of shaping her into a kind, respectful person. Today, I had planned to spend the morning with her, guiding her through daily manners\u2014gentle reminders, patient corrections, and, hopefully, a few moments of laughter. But as I set the table, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monthly food drive at the convent. As a nun, my sisters expect me to be there, hands busy with boxes, heart open to the hungry. The community counts on my presence, my commitment to serve. I glance at Anna, her eyes searching mine for approval, and then at the clock, ticking away the minutes.
