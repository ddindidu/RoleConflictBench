As a priest, I knew how important this was for them\u2014my role demanded I guide them through this sacred milestone, and I could already imagine their disappointment if I said no. \n\nBut just as I was about to call them, a client from the food pantry approached my volunteer desk. She leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and confided a deeply personal struggle, trusting me to keep it private. I could see the relief in her eyes as she unburdened herself, and I knew my role as a volunteer required absolute confidentiality and presence. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder about the Martinez family. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. How could I be fully present for this woman in need, while also fulfilling my duty to the family awaiting spiritual guidance? The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which call to answer first."}
