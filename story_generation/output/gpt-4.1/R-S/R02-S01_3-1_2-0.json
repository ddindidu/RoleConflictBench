Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and the church would soon be filled with expectant faces, all looking to me for guidance and inspiration. As a priest, I knew how much this day meant to the community\u2014my presence was not just expected, it was essential. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in less than an hour. I had promised to help serve breakfast, and though I knew others could cover for me if I was late, I hated the thought of letting the team down. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my congregation needed their priest, but the shelter relied on its volunteers. I stood in the vestry, vestments in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which path to take."}
