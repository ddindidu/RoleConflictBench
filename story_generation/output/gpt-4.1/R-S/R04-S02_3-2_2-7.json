Today, the mosque was fuller than usual\u2014a special remembrance had drawn a large crowd, and I was the only one authorized to lead. My heart pounded, not just from the responsibility, but from the phone vibrating in my pocket. The radio station was waiting; in five minutes, I was supposed to be live on air, speaking about the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into as an activist. The community expected me to be their voice, to educate and inspire, especially now when momentum was building. Yet here, in the mosque, the congregation looked to me for spiritual guidance, for calm and leadership in this sacred moment. I could not be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the pulpit and the microphone, between the expectations of faith and the demands of justice. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, and tried to steady my breath, knowing I had to choose."}
