My mind was already racing with the day\u2019s agenda\u2014calls to make, emails to send, and a crucial vote in the state assembly that could change everything for the cause I champion. But first, I moved to my small altar, hands trembling slightly as I lit the lamp and arranged the flowers. The familiar scent of incense calmed me, and I closed my eyes, reciting the prayers my mother taught me. \n\nJust as I finished the first mantra, my phone buzzed urgently. A fellow activist\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cThe vote is happening now. We need you to call the undecided rep\u2014your voice could tip the balance.\u201d My heart pounded. I looked at the flickering flame, the half-finished ritual, and then at my phone. The expectation to honor my faith, to complete my daily puja, clashed violently with the demand to act immediately for the cause I believed in. I stood frozen, torn between the sacred rhythm of my tradition and the pressing call to action, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
