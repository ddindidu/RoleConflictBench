Tonight\u2019s adult education class was on a topic I loved\u2014Jewish ethics in modern life. A few regulars had already arrived, eager to discuss and learn. As their rabbi, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to guide the conversation, to honor their commitment to Jewish learning. Yet, as I set out the handouts, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. I had planned to vote after the class, but a sudden announcement warned of possible delays at the polling station due to technical issues. \n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My role as a rabbi demanded I be here, teaching Torah, supporting my community. But as a citizen, I was expected to vote, to participate in shaping our society. Both roles mattered deeply to me, but the timing now felt impossibly tight. I could see the eager faces waiting for me, and I could almost hear the polling station\u2019s doors closing in my mind. I stood in the hallway, torn, heart pounding, unsure which duty to fulfill first."}
