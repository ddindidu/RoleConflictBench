My phone buzzed\u2014an unknown number. I hesitated, then answered. \u201cThis is Jamie from Senator Lee\u2019s office. The Senator\u2019s available for ten minutes to discuss the bill you\u2019ve been advocating. Can you talk now?\u201d My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been working toward for months, a chance to make real change. But the church service started in fifteen minutes, and I was supposed to help lead the opening prayer. Pastor Miller had reminded me last night how important it was to be present, especially as a role model for the youth group. I stared at my reflection, torn. My church family expected my commitment, my presence, my faith in action. But the activist in me knew this call could be the breakthrough we needed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my loyalty, each asking me to choose."}
