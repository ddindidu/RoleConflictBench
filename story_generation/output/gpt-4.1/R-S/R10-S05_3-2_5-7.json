The official demanded money, his voice low but menacing, and I saw the fear in the man\u2019s eyes. As a Hindu, I am taught to stand up for dharma, to act against injustice and protect those in need. My heart pounded with the urge to intervene, to call out the wrongdoing and help the man. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the court session I was due to attend in less than thirty minutes. As an advocate, punctuality is not just a courtesy; it is my duty to my client, whose case could be jeopardized by my absence. The weight of both roles pressed on me. If I stopped to help, I might fail my client. If I walked away, I would betray my conscience and my faith. I stood frozen, torn between the call of justice in the street and the demands of justice in the courtroom, my mind racing as the seconds slipped away."}
