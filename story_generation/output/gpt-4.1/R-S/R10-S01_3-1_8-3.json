As a Hindu, it was my duty and joy to participate in every ritual, to offer prayers and join the community in celebration. The air was thick with incense and anticipation. But as a volunteer, I was also responsible for guiding a group of newcomers, many of whom were unfamiliar with our customs. During a break, we sat together under a banyan tree, sharing stories. The conversation turned to family traditions, and someone asked about the personal lives of the people we were helping. It was innocent curiosity, nothing sensitive, but I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My role as a Hindu called me to be open and welcoming, to share and connect. Yet, as a volunteer, I was bound to protect the privacy of those in my care. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I could feel the tension rising as I weighed my next words, caught between honoring my faith and upholding my responsibility."}
