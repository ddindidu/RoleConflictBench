My phone buzzed with a message from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to be present for these milestones, to offer guidance and support. I started to type a polite reply, but just then, a woman across from me leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. She confided a deeply personal struggle, trusting me as a volunteer to keep her words private. My mind raced\u2014should I pause and respond to the couple, knowing how much these dates mean to families? Or should I give my full attention to this woman, honoring her vulnerability and the confidentiality expected of me here? I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence in a different way, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
