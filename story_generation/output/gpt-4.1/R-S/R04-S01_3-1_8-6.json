He approached me quietly, voice trembling, asking if I could spare a moment. He had just lost his father, and he needed someone to talk to, someone to help him make sense of his grief. My heart ached for him; as an imam, I knew my duty was to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for him in this moment of pain.\n\nBut as I listened, my phone buzzed with a new email from the volunteer coordinator. She reminded me that, if I had time today, I should reorganize the food pantry supplies according to the new system she\u2019d outlined. I glanced at the clock\u2014there was only a short window before the next group of volunteers arrived, and the coordinator had stressed the importance of following her instructions to keep things running smoothly.\n\nI felt torn, standing between Brother Ahmed\u2019s sorrow and the pressing expectations of my volunteer role. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me as I tried to figure out how to be present for both needs at once."}
