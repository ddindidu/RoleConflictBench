My faith teaches me to center myself in God\u2019s presence before anything else, to seek guidance and strength for the day ahead. But today, I\u2019m also scheduled to volunteer at the community kitchen, and the coordinator sent a message last night reminding us that every shift must start exactly on time\u2014no exceptions. The roster is tight, and if I\u2019m late, someone else will be left scrambling. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me: my commitment to live out my Christian values, which for me includes this quiet time with God, and my responsibility as a volunteer to be reliable and punctual. As I sit with my Bible open, I keep glancing at the clock, my heart racing. If I cut my prayer short, I\u2019ll make it on time, but I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m neglecting my faith. If I stay, I risk letting down the team. The tension inside me grows, torn between honoring my spiritual discipline and fulfilling my promise to serve others."}
