Sunday\u2019s sermon weighed on me\u2014I wanted to guide my congregation in making moral decisions, to remind them of compassion and honesty, to teach the principles I hold dear. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of tax documents on the corner of my desk, organized but unfinished. As a citizen, I knew my duty: pay taxes on time, support the community, follow the rules that keep us safe. And this weekend, the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic. They needed volunteers, and I\u2019d been asked to help. I felt the pull\u2014my congregation expected a thoughtful, prepared sermon, but my neighbors needed hands at the clinic. I couldn\u2019t ignore my civic responsibilities, but I also couldn\u2019t let down those who looked to me for spiritual guidance. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt the tension growing, unsure how to honor both roles without failing one."}
