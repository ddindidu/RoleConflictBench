As a pastor, I felt a gentle nudge to share a story from scripture about helping travelers, hoping it might inspire kindness in our discussions. The room quieted as I spoke, and I saw a few nods, but also a couple of raised eyebrows\u2014some people here preferred to keep religion and civic matters separate. \n\nJust then, the city newsletter was passed around, and I noticed the survey about the bus routes. As a citizen, I knew I should fill it out thoughtfully, offering feedback that could help everyone, regardless of their beliefs. But I could sense the tension in the room\u2014had I overstepped by bringing faith into a civic conversation? Was I being true to my calling as a pastor, or was I making it harder for others to see me as an impartial, engaged citizen? My hands trembled slightly as I held the survey, caught between the expectations of my faith and my duty to the community."}
