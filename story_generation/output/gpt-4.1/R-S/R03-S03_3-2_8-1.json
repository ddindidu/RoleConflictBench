The Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading the community\u2019s daily meditations during our retreat, a responsibility I felt both honored and anxious to fulfill. I needed quiet, focus, and a clear mind to prepare words that would guide others in their spiritual journeys.\n\nBut tonight, the city outside was alive. A group of neighbors had planned a late-evening music gathering in the courtyard, their laughter and melodies drifting through the open windows. As a citizen, I knew the building\u2019s quiet hours had begun, and the noise was likely disturbing others\u2014especially Mrs. Lee, who lived just below and often complained about sleepless nights. I felt a tug of duty to respect the law and the rights of my neighbors, perhaps even to speak up or call for quiet.\n\nYet, as a nun, I was called to patience, understanding, and compassion, to avoid conflict and seek peace. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself torn, heart pounding, unsure which path to follow."}
