The familiar comfort of the mosque\u2019s quiet anticipation surrounded me, and I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations\u2014modesty, humility, and respect for sacred space. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The radio station\u2019s producer reminded me that my live segment, where I would speak about our campaign for social justice, was about to begin in five minutes. I had promised my activist group I\u2019d use this platform to reach thousands, to educate and inspire. But the show was video-streamed, and I knew the station expected me to appear in a way that was \u201crelatable\u201d to the general public\u2014no headscarf, no abaya, just me in casual, Western clothes. My heart pounded as I stared at the prayer hall\u2019s entrance, torn between the sacred duty of Jummah and the pressing call to activism. The expectations of my faith and my cause pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which door I would walk through."}
