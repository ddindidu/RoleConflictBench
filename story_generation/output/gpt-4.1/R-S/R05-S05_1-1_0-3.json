My calendar blinked with reminders: \u201cBegin sermon prep for Shabbat\u2014three weeks out,\u201d and, just below it, \u201cMinor hearing: 2:00 PM.\u201d As a rabbi, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my congregation relied on me to offer wisdom, comfort, and inspiration. The pressure to craft a meaningful sermon, even weeks in advance, gnawed at me. I wanted to give them something real, something that would linger in their hearts.\n\nBut as an advocate, I owed my client my full attention, even if today\u2019s hearing was minor. They trusted me to represent them, to be present and prepared, no matter how small the stakes seemed. I glanced at my notes for the case, then at the blank page where sermon ideas should be blooming. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the pulpit and the courtroom. I felt the tension coil in my chest, the sense that I was about to let someone down, no matter which path I chose in the next hour."}
