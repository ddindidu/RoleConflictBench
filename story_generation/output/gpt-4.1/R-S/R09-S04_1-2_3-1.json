The polling station closes in two hours, and I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. My mind races through the options: I could stop at the caf\u00e9 on the corner, but I know they don\u2019t serve kosher food. At home, the pantry is stocked with everything I need\u2014matzah, tuna, even some leftover kugel. But if I go home to eat, I might not make it back to the polling station in time. My community expects me to uphold kosher laws, and I feel the weight of that responsibility. At the same time, voting is not just a right but a duty, and I promised myself I\u2019d have my say in this election. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations\u2014my faith, my civic responsibility. The minutes tick by, and I stand on the sidewalk, torn between the demands of my heritage and my role as a citizen, feeling the pressure build inside me."}
