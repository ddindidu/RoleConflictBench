The official\u2019s voice was brisk: \u201cThere\u2019s a mismatch in your registration. You\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form before we close in ten minutes.\u201d My mind raced. As a voter, I knew I had to follow every instruction, no questions asked, to ensure my vote counted. But as a Hindu, raised to value honesty and dharma, I noticed a man quietly slipping ahead in the line, bypassing others who had waited patiently. My conscience pricked me\u2014should I speak up, uphold fairness, and risk missing my chance to vote? Or should I ignore the small injustice, focus on my civic duty, and let it go? The expectations pressed in from both sides: the official\u2019s urgency, the silent call of my principles. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands, torn between the rules of the polling booth and the deeper rules of my heart."}
