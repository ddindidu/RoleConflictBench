As a Hindu, it was my duty and joy to join the rituals, offer prayers, and celebrate with my relatives. The air was thick with incense and the sound of bells, and I felt a deep sense of belonging as I helped prepare the offerings. But as I was tying my prayer thread, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place near my apartment would close in two hours, and today was the last chance to vote on a measure that could change my neighborhood. As a citizen, I knew I should be there, casting my ballot and making my voice heard. My community expected me to be engaged, to care about our shared future. I stared at the train schedule, calculating if I could make it back in time, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My heart ached at the thought of missing the festival\u2019s main ceremony, but my mind raced with the responsibility I owed to my fellow citizens. I stood there, torn, unable to move, caught between two parts of myself."}
