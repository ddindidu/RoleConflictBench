As a citizen, I prided myself on being organized and timely, always paying my taxes and following public health guidance. This weekend, the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic, and I\u2019d signed up to help. But then, a friend called, desperate for support. She\u2019d made a mistake, one that went against everything I believed as a Christian\u2014she\u2019d lied to her employer and wanted me to cover for her. My faith demanded honesty and integrity, but my friend pleaded for compassion and loyalty. I felt torn. The community needed volunteers at the clinic, and my taxes needed to be filed, but my friend needed me, too. The expectations pressed in from all sides: to be a good Christian, to be a responsible citizen, to be a loyal friend. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to do next, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone\u2014or some part of myself\u2014down."}
