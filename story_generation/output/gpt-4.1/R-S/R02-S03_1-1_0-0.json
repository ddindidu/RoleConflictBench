As a priest, I was expected to lead the daily prayer service, even though it was optional. Some in the community cherished these moments of reflection, and I knew my presence mattered. My mind rehearsed the verses I would recite, the gentle encouragement I would offer.\n\nAs a citizen, I prided myself on respecting the laws and the shared spaces of our town. I noticed a crumpled coffee cup on the grass, just a few steps from the trash bin. The no-littering signs were clear, and I felt a pang of responsibility. I glanced at my watch\u2014if I stopped to pick it up, I might be late for the service. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be failing in my duty to care for our public spaces. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, torn between the call to serve my congregation and the call to serve my community."}
