The sisters and I had planned for weeks, gathering donations and preparing meals for the shelter. As a nun, I know my place is with them, serving those in need, especially today when every pair of hands matters. But as I hurried to the convent, I remembered my civic duty\u2014today is also Election Day. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told my registration had a mismatch. The official\u2019s voice was firm: I must fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station closes in ten minutes. My mind raced. If I stay, I might miss the food drive, letting down my sisters and the hungry. If I leave, I neglect my responsibility as a citizen, my voice unheard. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each vital in its own way. I stood frozen, torn between the call to serve and the call to vote, my heart aching with the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
