This afternoon, Mrs. Kim, a longtime member of our congregation, scheduled an appointment to talk about a struggle she\u2019s been facing. I prepared myself to listen with compassion and offer whatever counsel I could. Just before her appointment, I was volunteering at the local food pantry, helping distribute groceries. While chatting with another volunteer, the conversation drifted to Mrs. Kim\u2014she\u2019s well-known in our small community. The volunteer mentioned how Mrs. Kim seemed down lately, and I nodded, careful not to reveal anything. But as the conversation continued, I felt the weight of my dual roles. As a priest, I wanted to be open and supportive, but as a volunteer, I was bound to respect the privacy of everyone I served, including Mrs. Kim. My mind raced with the expectations placed upon me: to be a confidant, a guide, and yet also a guardian of trust and confidentiality. As Mrs. Kim arrived for her appointment, I felt the tension between my roles tightening, unsure how to balance the demands of both without betraying either."}
