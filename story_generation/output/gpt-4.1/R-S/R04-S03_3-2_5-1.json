Today\u2019s Friday sermon was special\u2014families had come from distant towns, eager to hear my words on our shared milestone. I had spent days preparing, knowing how much this moment meant to everyone. Yet, as a resident of this apartment building, I was also just another citizen, bound by the rules that kept peace among neighbors. The youth group had planned a late-evening celebration with music, hoping to continue the day\u2019s joy. But the building\u2019s quiet hours began at ten, and I noticed Mrs. Rahman\u2019s windows wide open, her young children already in bed. I could sense the tension rising within me: the community expected a memorable, uplifting event, but as a citizen, I was responsible for respecting the law and my neighbors\u2019 right to quiet. My heart pounded as I stood between these worlds, feeling the pull of duty and belonging, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
