As a Muslim, I am expected to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing a loose scarf. Today, though, the office is hosting a function\u2014everyone will be there, including senior partners and clients. The unspoken expectation is to blend in, to look professional in the way my colleagues do: tailored suits, crisp blouses, nothing that stands out. \n\nBut I am also an advocate, and my client\u2019s case is on the agenda. I need to be at my sharpest, to command respect and attention, to represent them with confidence. I know how people look at me when I wear my hijab and long sleeves\u2014sometimes with curiosity, sometimes with skepticism. I worry that my appearance might distract from my arguments, that my client might feel uneasy, that my colleagues might see me as less assertive. \n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My hands hover over a navy suit and a long-sleeved abaya, my heart pounding as I try to reconcile who I am with what is expected of me."}
