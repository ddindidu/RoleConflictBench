The line of people waiting for help was long, and I tried to offer a warm smile to each. As I handed a form to Mrs. Evans, she leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cFather, I need to tell you something, but please, don\u2019t let anyone else know.\u201d Her eyes darted around the busy hall. I nodded, listening as she shared a deeply personal struggle, her words tumbling out in a rush. I felt the weight of her trust settle on my shoulders.\n\nBut as the clock ticked closer to the hour of the main weekly service, I felt another weight pressing in. The congregation would be gathering soon, expecting me to lead them in prayer, to be present and attentive. My mind raced\u2014if I stayed to support Mrs. Evans, I\u2019d be late for the service, letting down the community. If I left, I\u2019d betray her trust and the promise of confidentiality I\u2019d made as a volunteer. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
