She was nervous, her Beit Din appearance only hours away, and I knew how much this meant to her. My role as her rabbi was clear: to guide, to teach, to be present. The phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an unknown number, but the area code was familiar. I answered, and the producer\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe need you on air in fifteen minutes. There\u2019s misinformation spreading fast, and you\u2019re the voice people trust.\u201d My activist heart leapt; this was the moment to set the record straight, to speak for those who couldn\u2019t. But Miriam was counting on me, and the community expected me to uphold my rabbinic responsibilities.

My hands trembled as I looked from the phone to the Torah, torn between two callings, each pulling me in a different direction."}
