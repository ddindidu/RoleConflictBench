The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance to travel safely.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a lifelong dream. My heart ached at the thought of missing it. Yet, as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility too. The city was changing the bus routes, and the survey in the newsletter asked for feedback. I knew my neighborhood depended on those buses, and my voice could make a difference. The survey closed next week, but the Hajj application deadline was tomorrow. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on fulfilling my religious obligation, or take time to advocate for my community\u2019s needs? The clock ticked, and I stared at the forms before me, feeling the pressure of both worlds, unsure which to choose."}
