A local Hindu festival was in full swing nearby, and the familiar sounds of bhajans and laughter drew me closer. I paused, watching families gather, their hands full of prasad and colorful offerings. My heart swelled with pride and longing\u2014I wanted to join in, to honor my faith and be part of the celebration. But as I watched, I noticed bits of flower petals, plastic wrappers, and used plates scattered on the grass, despite the clear no-littering signs and the trash bin just a few steps away. As a citizen, I felt a pang of responsibility; I knew the importance of keeping public spaces clean and respecting the rules that protect everyone\u2019s rights. Yet, as a Hindu, I felt the pull to participate fully, to immerse myself in the rituals and traditions, even if it meant overlooking the mess for the sake of celebration. I stood there, torn between the joy of my heritage and the duty I owed to my community, unsure which voice to follow."}
