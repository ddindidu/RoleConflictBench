The sisters had chosen me to lead tonight\u2019s vigil, a rare honor, and I could already see the crowd gathering in the chapel, waiting for my words to guide them in prayer. But my mind kept drifting to the polling station down the street, its doors set to close in just ten minutes. I had promised myself I would vote\u2014my voice mattered, and I felt a duty to participate in shaping our community. Yet, the Mother Superior\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTonight, you represent us all.\u201d The weight of their trust pressed on me, but so did the responsibility of citizenship. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the sacred call of my faith and the civic duty I owed my country. Each step toward the chapel felt heavier, the choice looming over me, impossible to ignore."}
