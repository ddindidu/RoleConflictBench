As a priest, I was expected to lead the main weekly service, a sacred time when the community gathered for prayer and guidance. My congregation relied on me for spiritual comfort, and I knew how much this service meant to them. Yet, as I prepared my sermon, my phone buzzed with a message from a fellow activist. The protest downtown had begun, and the turnout was smaller than hoped. \u201cIf you\u2019re free, we need more voices,\u201d the message read, accompanied by a shaky live-stream of determined faces. My heart pounded. I believed deeply in the cause\u2014justice and compassion were at the core of my faith. But if I left now, I\u2019d let down my parishioners, who expected my presence and leadership. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray my activist friends and the values I preached. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the pulpit and the protest, unable to move."}
