As a priest, I am expected to lead the main weekly service, a sacred time when the entire community gathers, looking to me for guidance and comfort. The church would be full, and my absence would be noticed, perhaps even felt as a spiritual void. Yet, as a volunteer at the local shelter, I am the only one assigned to unlock the doors and start breakfast for the people already waiting outside in the cold. They depend on me for warmth and a meal, and if I am late, they will be left standing in the chill, hungry and disappointed. Both roles demand my presence at the same hour, and I can feel the tension building inside me. I imagine the congregation waiting in the pews, and at the same time, I see the hopeful faces at the shelter\u2019s door. My heart aches as I realize I cannot be in two places at once, and I am torn between my duty to my faith community and my promise to those in need."}
