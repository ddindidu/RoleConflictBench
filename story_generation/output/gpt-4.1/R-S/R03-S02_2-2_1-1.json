As a nun, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort, to serve. Sister Maria\u2019s gentle hand on my shoulder reminded me, \u201cThey need you now.\u201d But my phone buzzed with urgent messages from my fellow activists\u2014the protest march was about to begin, and I was supposed to lead the first chant. The city\u2019s eyes would be on us, and my absence would be noticed. I could almost hear the crowd gathering, feel the energy building, the cause demanding my voice. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the immediate suffering of the family before me, and the broader injustice we were fighting against. I stood frozen, torn between the quiet call of compassion and the loud cry for justice, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
