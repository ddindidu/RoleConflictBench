As an activist, everyone expected me to lead the march, to raise my voice first and loudest. The organizers were already looking for me, urging me to take my place at the front. But just as I was about to step forward, I saw my friend across the street, surrounded by a group of people arguing heatedly. I could see the distress on their face, the unfairness of the accusations being thrown at them. My heart twisted\u2014my Hindu upbringing taught me to stand up for what is right, to protect those who are wronged, no matter the cost. Yet, the crowd behind me was growing restless, waiting for my signal to begin. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to act. My mind raced, caught between the duty to my friend and the responsibility to the cause."}
