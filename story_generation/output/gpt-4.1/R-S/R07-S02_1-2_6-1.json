She wants to talk about compassion, about letting go of anger, and I know this is important\u2014spiritual study and reflection are at the heart of my Buddhist practice. But my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. The protest march is about to begin, and I\u2019m supposed to be at the front, megaphone in hand, leading the first chant for justice. My fellow activists are counting on me to show up, to be a voice for those who can\u2019t be there.
