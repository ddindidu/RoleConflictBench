As a priest, I was expected to guide my parishioners, especially the children, through their spiritual milestones. Today, a family had pleaded for a final, mandatory preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014an event that would shape the child\u2019s faith journey. They were anxious, relying on me to provide comfort and assurance, and I knew how much this meant to them.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was also an advocate, and my client\u2019s hearing was scheduled for the same time. The case was complex, with disputes that could alter the course of my client\u2019s life. They depended on my expertise and presence in the courtroom, trusting me to defend their rights and interests.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. I could feel the expectations from the family and my client pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached at the thought of letting either down. I stared at my calendar, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting, and I would have to live with that choice."}
