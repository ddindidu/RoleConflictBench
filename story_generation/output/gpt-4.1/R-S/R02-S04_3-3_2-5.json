Today was the holiest day of our calendar, and the church would soon fill with faces seeking comfort, guidance, and tradition. As their priest, I was expected to lead them, to be present, unwavering, and focused. Yet, tucked in my pocket was my voter registration card, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the reminder that today was also the last chance to cast my ballot. The polling station would close before the evening service ended, and I was required to bring my ID in person\u2014no exceptions, no extensions. My congregation needed me, but so did my civic duty. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I paced the vestry, torn between the sacred and the civic, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left undone."}
