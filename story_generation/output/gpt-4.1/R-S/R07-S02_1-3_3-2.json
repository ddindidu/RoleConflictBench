My phone was off, and I had promised myself these ten minutes\u2014just ten\u2014to practice mindfulness, to let the world\u2019s noise fall away. I felt the tension in my shoulders begin to melt, the gentle rhythm of my breath anchoring me to the present. But then, muffled shouts and hurried footsteps broke through the silence. Someone tugged at my sleeve, voice urgent: \u201cThe police are blocking the exits. We need you to help coordinate\u2014now.\u201d My heart pounded. As an activist, I was expected to act, to protect and guide others, especially in moments of crisis. But as a Buddhist, I was supposed to remain calm, to cultivate peace within myself before facing the chaos outside. The demands clashed inside me\u2014one voice urging me to stay, to finish my meditation, the other insisting I get up, take charge, and help. I opened my eyes, torn between the stillness I craved and the action I owed."}
