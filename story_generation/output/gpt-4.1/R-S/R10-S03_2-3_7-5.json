My family\u2019s voices echoed from the living room, laughter and the scent of incense drifting down the hall. Today was the puja for my cousin\u2019s engagement, and my parents had reminded me all week how important it was to be there on time, dressed properly, to honor our traditions. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: the polling place for the ballot measure about our neighborhood\u2019s redevelopment would close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, to be a responsible citizen, to have a say in what happens to our block. My heart pounded as I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I was late, the disapproving looks, the whispered questions about my priorities. Yet, skipping the vote felt like letting down my community, ignoring my duty as a citizen. I stared at my reflection, torn between the expectations of my faith and my responsibility to the city I call home, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
