I slipped my rosary into my pocket, feeling the familiar tug of duty. The sisters would soon gather in the chapel, their voices rising in unity, and I was expected to be among them, present in body and spirit. Yet, my phone vibrated with a reminder: a minor court hearing was about to begin downtown, where I was to represent a client who had no one else. The case wasn\u2019t urgent, but my presence would mean the world to her. I stood in my small room, torn between the sacred rhythm of prayer and the call to advocate for justice. The convent expected unwavering devotion, the court demanded my professional commitment. My heart pounded as I weighed the silent disappointment of my sisters against the trust my client had placed in me. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
