As a Muslim, I always made sure to dress modestly in public, but at home, surrounded by my immediate family, I allowed myself to relax. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with frantic messages from my fellow activists: the police had started blocking the exits at our protest downtown, and panic was spreading. They needed me to help coordinate a safe response, and quickly. My heart pounded as I realized I\u2019d have to rush out the door, but I wasn\u2019t dressed according to my faith\u2019s guidelines for public modesty. The activist in me knew every second counted, that my presence could help keep people safe. But the Muslim in me felt the weight of my religious commitment, the importance of representing my faith with dignity. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call to action and the deep-rooted values that shaped my identity, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
