The rituals were long and meaningful, each chant and offering connecting me to my heritage. My relatives expected me to stay until the final aarti, to show respect and devotion. But as the sun dipped lower, I glanced at my watch and felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The polling station would close in just a couple of hours, and I still had errands to run before I could even think about heading there. My parents reminded me how important it was to honor our traditions, while my friends messaged me, urging me not to waste my vote. I felt torn, the weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and my sense of civic duty on the other. The temple bells rang louder, but so did the ticking clock in my mind. I stood at the threshold, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
