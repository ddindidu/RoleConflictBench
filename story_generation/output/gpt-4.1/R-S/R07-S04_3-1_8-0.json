My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTomorrow, please share your summary of the Four Noble Truths with everyone.\u201d I felt honored, but also anxious. I wanted to do justice to the teachings, to reflect deeply and prepare something meaningful. I opened my notebook, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but I knew I needed to go. Civic duty tugged at me; voting was a responsibility I took seriously. Yet, every moment spent away from my notes felt like a betrayal of my commitment to the sangha and my teacher. I tried to focus on the Dharma, but thoughts of candidates and issues crept in. I felt torn, pulled between the quiet call of spiritual reflection and the urgent, practical voice of democracy. My heart raced as I weighed the expectations: to be a mindful Buddhist, and a responsible citizen."}
