Just moments ago, I had witnessed a bribe being slipped under the table\u2014an act that went against everything I believed in as a Hindu, where dharma and truth are sacred. My heart pounded with the urge to speak up, to confront the wrongdoing and uphold the moral path. But then, my phone vibrated again. A notification flashed: my recent post about environmental justice was going viral. As an activist, this was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for\u2014a chance to educate thousands, maybe even spark real change. I knew I needed to respond quickly, to ride the wave and share crucial information. Yet, the weight of the corruption I\u2019d just seen pressed on me. Should I focus on exposing the injustice before me, or seize the fleeting opportunity to amplify my cause online? My mind raced, torn between the immediate call to moral action and the broader responsibility to my movement."}
