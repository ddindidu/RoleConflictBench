The polling station is a twenty-minute walk away, and the line is rumored to be long. My wallet, with my ID, is tucked safely in my backpack, but my mind is on the small kosher vendor I spotted earlier\u2014the only place I can eat without breaking the dietary laws I\u2019ve followed since childhood. The vendor is about to close, and if I stop to eat, I might miss my only chance to vote. If I go straight to the polls, I\u2019ll be hungry for hours, maybe until tomorrow, and the thought of eating non-kosher food is unthinkable. My community expects me to uphold our traditions, and I feel the weight of that responsibility. But I also know how important this election is, and I\u2019ve always believed in my duty as a citizen. The pressure builds inside me, my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I stand frozen on the sidewalk, torn between honoring my faith and fulfilling my civic duty."}
