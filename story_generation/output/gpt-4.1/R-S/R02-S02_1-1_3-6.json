My phone buzzed with notifications\u2014my latest post about housing justice was gaining traction, and I knew this was the moment to engage, to educate, to push the conversation further. Every second counted; the world was watching. Just then, Mrs. Alvarez, a gentle soul from my congregation, poked her head in. \u201cFather, do you have a moment? Or maybe we could schedule a chat soon?\u201d Her eyes were hopeful, and I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately. As a priest, I was called to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. But as an activist, I felt the weight of opportunity\u2014this viral moment could spark real change. My heart pounded as I looked from her expectant face to the glowing screen. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t give it to both at once. I felt torn, the expectations of my calling and my cause pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which voice to answer first."}
