The regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation looked to me, expecting I would lead the prayer as usual. Their trust in me was clear in their hopeful eyes, and I felt the weight of their expectation settle on my shoulders. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was also the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center across town, where a line of people would already be waiting for the doors to open and the service to begin. If I stayed to lead the prayer, the people at the center would be left outside, disappointed and possibly in need. If I left now, the congregation would be confused and perhaps even upset, their spiritual routine disrupted. My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between two communities, both relying on me, both deserving of my presence."}
