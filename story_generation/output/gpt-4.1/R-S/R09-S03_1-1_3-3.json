The pantry behind me was neatly organized, every item carefully checked for kosher certification. I took pride in keeping my home in line with my Jewish values, making sure every meal and snack respected the laws I\u2019d grown up with. \n\nBut as I scrolled through the newsletter, I saw the city was asking for feedback on new bus routes. The survey was open for just a few more days, and they wanted input from all residents. I knew how important it was to participate, to help shape the community and make sure everyone\u2019s needs were heard. \n\nYet, the survey included a section about local food vendors at bus stops\u2014most of which weren\u2019t kosher. They wanted suggestions for new vendors, and I felt torn. Should I advocate for kosher options, knowing it might seem like I was pushing my own needs above others? Or should I stay silent, blending in as just another citizen, even if it meant my dietary needs\u2014and those of others like me\u2014would be overlooked? My finger hovered over the survey link, heart pounding, caught between my Jewish identity and my civic responsibility."}
