My family awaited me at the temple, garlands in hand, their faces bright with anticipation. The festival was important\u2014my presence was expected, not just as a son, but as a Hindu who honored tradition. The air was thick with incense and the sound of bells, and I felt the weight of my role as I joined the rituals, hands folded, mind reciting prayers.\n\nBut my phone buzzed persistently in my pocket. A client, anxious and confused, needed urgent legal advice. I had promised to be available, to provide clarity and guidance, even in casual moments. My mind split\u2014one part anchored in the sacred chants, the other racing through statutes and precedents. I could see my family\u2019s eyes on me, expecting devotion, while my client\u2019s messages demanded my professional attention. The pressure built inside me, a silent storm, as I stood at the crossroads of duty and devotion, torn between the temple\u2019s sanctity and the call of my profession."}
