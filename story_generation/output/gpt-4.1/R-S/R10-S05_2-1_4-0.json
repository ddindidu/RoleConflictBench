As a Hindu, I felt a deep moral obligation to stand up for what was right, to speak out against injustice and support my friend in his time of need. My heart ached with the urge to intervene, to offer comfort and guidance rooted in dharma and compassion.\n\nBut as an advocate, I knew my professional duty was to provide clear, accurate legal advice, not to let personal feelings cloud my judgment. During our casual conversation, he pressed me for legal guidance, hoping I would assure him of a clear path forward. I hesitated, aware that giving specific advice outside a formal consultation could be risky and unethical. The expectations of my faith and my profession pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn between the urge to act as a moral ally and the responsibility to uphold the standards of my legal practice. My mind raced, caught in the tension of wanting to do right by my friend and needing to honor my role as an advocate."}
