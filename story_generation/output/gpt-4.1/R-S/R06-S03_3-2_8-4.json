As a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014this was my chance to listen, ask questions, and help shape the future of my community. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, to be informed and engaged, just as a good citizen should. But then my phone buzzed. It was a message from a friend, someone I knew was struggling deeply. She needed to talk, right now. As a Christian, I believed in showing love and kindness, being present for those in need, just as Jesus taught. My heart ached with the tension. If I ignored her, I\u2019d be turning away from someone who needed compassion. If I missed the forum, I\u2019d be neglecting my civic duty, letting my community down. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the stress rising, torn between two roles that both mattered deeply to me."}
