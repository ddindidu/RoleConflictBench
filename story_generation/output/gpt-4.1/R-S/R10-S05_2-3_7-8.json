Today was the day of my cousin\u2019s wedding, a sacred ceremony my family had been preparing for months. As a Hindu, I was expected to be there, dressed in traditional attire, participating in the rituals and sharing in the joy. My mother had laid out my kurta, and my father reminded me of the auspicious hour. But as I checked my phone, a message from my senior partner flashed on the screen: the court had advanced the hearing for my client\u2019s case. My presence was non-negotiable; the outcome could change a life, and my reputation as an advocate was on the line. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectations, the sacredness of the ceremony, and the professional duty that demanded my punctuality and focus. My heart pounded as I stood between my kurta and my suit, torn by the impossible choice, knowing that whichever path I took, I would be letting someone down."}
