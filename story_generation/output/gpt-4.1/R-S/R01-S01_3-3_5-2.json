As their pastor, I knew I needed to be there, to comfort them, to organize help, to pray with them in their moment of fear. But as I reached for my keys, my phone buzzed again: a reminder that I was the only volunteer scheduled to open the food pantry today. People would already be lining up outside, some of them elderly, some with children, all depending on me to unlock the doors and start the service. I could picture their faces, waiting in the cold, counting on me to be reliable. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two urgent needs\u2014my congregation\u2019s crisis and the community\u2019s hunger. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my responsibility. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, and for a moment, I just stood there, keys in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
