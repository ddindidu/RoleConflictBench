The parish hall buzzed with anticipation for the adult faith formation planning meeting, a cornerstone of my priestly duties. I was expected to guide the team, set the vision, and ensure our classes would inspire and educate. But as I gathered my notes, my phone vibrated\u2014a reminder that I was also scheduled as the sole volunteer to unlock the community center across town. People would already be waiting outside, some of them elderly, relying on me to open the doors and start the service they depended on. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d abandon my team and risk derailing months of preparation. If I stayed, I\u2019d leave a line of vulnerable people in the cold, disappointed and possibly in need. Both roles demanded my presence, both groups expected reliability and care. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two callings, each pulling me in a different direction."}
