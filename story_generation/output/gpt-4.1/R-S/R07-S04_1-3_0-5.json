Tonight is the monthly ritual, and as a Buddhist, I am expected to join the community, to bow, to chant, to be present in body and spirit. Yet, in my pocket, my voter ID card feels heavy. The polling station is only open for another hour, and this is my only chance to cast my vote\u2014my civic duty, my voice in the world outside these temple walls. My teacher\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cBe where you are needed.\u201d But where am I needed most? The temple expects my devotion, my presence among the faithful. The country expects my participation, my proof of identity. I feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My feet hesitate on the temple steps, my mind pulled in two directions, heart pounding with the knowledge that I cannot be in both places at once."}
