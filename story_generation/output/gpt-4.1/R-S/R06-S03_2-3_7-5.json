My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a friend from church, saying she was overwhelmed and needed someone to talk to. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and my heart ached for her. I wanted to be there, to listen, to show her the love and kindness Jesus taught. But then I glanced at the clock. The polling place down the street would close in two hours, and there was a ballot measure that could change our neighborhood. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to vote, to have my voice heard, to help shape the community for everyone\u2019s good. I felt torn\u2014Sarah needed me now, but so did my city. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which call to answer first."}
