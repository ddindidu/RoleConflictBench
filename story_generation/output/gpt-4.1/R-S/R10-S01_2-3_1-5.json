As a Hindu, this ritual is sacred\u2014a moment to connect with the divine and seek blessings for the day ahead. Today, however, my mind is restless. I have a shift at the community health center, where I volunteer to sort confidential medical files. The expectation is clear: respect the privacy of every person whose story is written in those records.\n\nBut as I light the lamp, my phone buzzes with a message from my aunt. She\u2019s worried about a neighbor\u2019s health and asks if I can find out anything during my shift. The request tugs at my sense of duty to family and community, values deeply rooted in my faith. Yet, as a volunteer, I am bound by strict confidentiality. The weight of these opposing expectations presses on me\u2014my heart aches with the desire to help, but my conscience warns me of the trust placed in my hands. I sit before the altar, incense curling in the air, torn between the roles that define me, unsure of which path to follow."}
