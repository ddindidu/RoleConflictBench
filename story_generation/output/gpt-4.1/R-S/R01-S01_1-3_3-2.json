She\u2019s been struggling since her husband passed, and as her pastor, I\u2019ve made it a point to check in on her. Today, her message was different\u2014short, almost desperate. I could sense she needed someone to talk to, maybe even someone to pray with her. But I glanced at the clock and felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I was the only volunteer scheduled to open the pantry, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to let them in and start the service. If I stopped to visit Mrs. Lee, I\u2019d be late, leaving those families in the cold. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning someone who needed pastoral care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen in my hallway, torn between the needs of my congregation and my commitment to serve."}
