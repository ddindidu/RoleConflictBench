Miriam\u2019s son, his voice trembling, told me his mother passed away this morning. The family needs me to officiate the funeral\u2014soon, before relatives fly back home. I know how much it means to them, how much comfort a familiar face and familiar prayers can bring in grief. My calendar is already full, but this is what I do as a rabbi: I show up, I guide, I hold space for sorrow.\n\nBut my laptop pings with a reminder. The activist group I helped organize is about to send a crucial petition to our state senator, urging a vote on a bill that could change lives. They need my signature\u2014my name carries weight in the community. The deadline is minutes away. If I don\u2019t add my voice now, the opportunity will be lost, and I\u2019ll have let down those who count on me to speak out for justice.\n\nI stare at the screen, torn. My phone buzzes again\u2014Miriam\u2019s family, needing reassurance. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully theirs."}
