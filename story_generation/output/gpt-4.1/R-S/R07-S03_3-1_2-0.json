Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I\u2019d been preparing for with the sangha for weeks. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to help with the altar, to chant, to serve tea to the elders. The abbot had asked for volunteers to arrive early, and I\u2019d promised I would be there before dawn.\n\nBut as I hurried through the park, my mind already on the festival, I unwrapped a small rice cake for breakfast. The wrapper crinkled in my hand. I glanced around\u2014no one else was there, but the city\u2019s no-littering signs were clear, and the trash bin was a few steps off the path. I hesitated. If I stopped to dispose of the wrapper properly, I\u2019d be late for the festival preparations, letting down my fellow Buddhists. If I tossed it aside, I\u2019d be breaking the law and disrespecting the community I lived in. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between my devotion to the monastery and my responsibility as a citizen."}
