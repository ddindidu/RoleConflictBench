I had been looking forward to this moment all week\u2014a chance to sit in the sunlit chapel, open my worn prayer book, and lose myself in spiritual reflection. As a nun, these moments are precious, a time to deepen my faith and listen for God\u2019s voice. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. It was Maria, one of the women I help as a volunteer at the shelter. She sounded lonely, so I invited her to join me for tea in the garden.\n\nWe talked about her day, her hopes, and her struggles. The conversation was light, but I felt the familiar tension rising. As a volunteer, I must always respect the privacy of those I help, never prying or letting my curiosity lead. Yet, as a nun, I am called to offer guidance and spiritual companionship, to listen deeply and sometimes gently probe. Maria\u2019s words hovered on the edge of something deeper, and I felt torn\u2014should I ask more, risking her trust, or hold back, possibly missing a chance to help? The sun dipped lower, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
