The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I was still at the church, tidying up after evening prayers. Just as I was about to leave, Mrs. Carter approached me, her eyes hesitant. \u201cFather, do you have a moment? I was hoping we could talk soon. I\u2019ve been feeling lost lately.\u201d Her voice trembled, and I could see the weight she carried. As a priest, I knew my calling was to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for those in need, no matter how small the request seemed. But as a citizen, I had a duty to vote, and the clock was ticking. If I stayed to talk, even briefly, I might miss my chance to cast my ballot. If I left, I\u2019d be turning away someone seeking solace. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between my responsibilities to my faith and my country, unsure which path to take."}
