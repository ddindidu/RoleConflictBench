The convent was quiet, and I had been looking forward to this afternoon all week\u2014a rare stretch of time for uninterrupted spiritual reading and reflection. My heart longed for the stillness, the gentle rhythm of prayer and study that nourished my soul. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. A reminder flashed: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need everyone on time today. The roster is tight.\u201d I knew the guests would be waiting, and my absence would mean more work for the others. Guilt pressed in from both sides. Was I neglecting my spiritual duties by leaving my study unfinished? Or was I failing my commitment to serve those in need? My hands trembled as I closed the Bible, torn between the peace I craved and the responsibility I had promised."}
