The imam\u2019s words from last Friday echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you have the means, do not delay your Hajj.\u201d But I was still early in my career, my savings barely enough for rent, let alone a pilgrimage. Yet, the sense of duty pressed on me, a constant reminder of my faith and the journey I owed to God.\n\nToday, though, another responsibility loomed. The polling station would close in two hours, and I still had groceries to buy for my mother. Voting was not just a right\u2014it was a trust, a way to shape the future for my community. My friends expected me to show up, to be counted, to stand for what we believed in.\n\nAs I hurried through the crowded market, my mind raced. Should I rush home, drop everything, and head to the polls, even if it meant postponing my plans to save for Hajj? Or should I focus on my long-term goal, knowing that every penny counted? The weight of both worlds pressed on my shoulders, and I felt torn, caught between two paths that seemed to pull me in opposite directions."}
