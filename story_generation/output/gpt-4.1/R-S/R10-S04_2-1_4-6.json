As a Hindu, I was raised to believe in dharma\u2014doing what is right, standing up for justice. In front of me, my friend Priya, whose last name started with \u201cK,\u201d was told by an official to move to a new line for voters A\u2013M. The new line was much longer and slower, and I could see the frustration on her face. She whispered to me that it felt unfair, that the officials were making arbitrary decisions. My heart ached to speak up, to question the official and defend her, as my faith taught me to do.\n\nBut as a voter, I was expected to follow the instructions of the election officials without question, to keep the process orderly and respect their authority. The room was tense, and I could feel the eyes of others on me, waiting to see if I would comply or protest. My sense of justice battled with my duty as a citizen to follow the rules. I stood there, torn, my conscience pulling me in two directions, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
