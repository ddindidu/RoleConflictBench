As a Buddhist, I cherish these weekly group meditations\u2014an hour to practice mindfulness, to let go of the world\u2019s noise. But today, my mind refuses to quiet. I remember the stack of tax documents waiting at home, organized but unfinished, and the email from the community center asking for volunteers at the free vaccine clinic this weekend. As a citizen, I know my responsibilities: pay taxes on time, help keep my community safe, show up when needed. The expectation to be present, to serve, tugs at me. Yet, the sangha expects my presence too, and I long for the peace that comes from sitting with them. My heart feels pulled in two directions\u2014toward stillness and service, inward and outward. I close my eyes, but the tension lingers, a knot in my chest, as I wrestle with which role to honor first."}
