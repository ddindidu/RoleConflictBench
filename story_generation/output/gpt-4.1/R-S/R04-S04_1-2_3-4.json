Today, I was not just the imam expected to deliver the Friday sermon, but also a voter, responsible for fulfilling my civic duty. The community anticipated my presence on the pulpit, waiting for words of guidance and unity. Yet, my heart raced with anxiety, knowing that my only chance to retrieve my valid ID from home was this morning\u2014without it, I couldn\u2019t vote tomorrow. The guest speaker, already prepared, could step in for me, but would the congregation understand my absence? Would they see it as neglecting my spiritual responsibility? At the same time, if I missed this window to get my ID, I\u2019d forfeit my voice in shaping our future. The expectations clashed within me: the sacred trust of leading prayer versus the civic obligation to participate in democracy. I stood in the mosque\u2019s quiet office, torn, the call to prayer echoing in my ears as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
