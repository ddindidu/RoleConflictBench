She spoke softly, her eyes darting around, trusting me with her secret. As a volunteer, I knew I was expected to keep her words confidential, to respect her privacy above all else. But just a few feet away, I saw my friend Raj being spoken to harshly by another volunteer. The injustice of it stung me. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to act with dharma and protect those who are wronged. My heart pounded as I realized that to defend Raj, I might have to reveal something Mrs. Sharma had just told me, something that could explain the tension but would break her trust. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn between my duty to protect a friend and my promise to respect a client\u2019s privacy."}
