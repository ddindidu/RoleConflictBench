The coordinator had sent a reminder last night\u2014everyone needed to be there right as the doors opened, no exceptions. As I reached for my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her message was urgent: she was overwhelmed with her son\u2019s recent troubles and needed to talk. I could hear the strain in her voice when I called her back. As her pastor, I knew how much she relied on me for support, especially in moments like this. But as a volunteer, I also knew the pantry was short-staffed today, and my absence would leave them scrambling. My heart ached, torn between the call to shepherd someone in need and the commitment I\u2019d made to serve the community in another way. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
