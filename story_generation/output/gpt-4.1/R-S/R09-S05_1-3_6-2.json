As a Jew, attending synagogue on Friday evenings was more than a tradition\u2014it was a commitment to my faith and my community. I knew the congregation would manage without me for one night, but I also knew how much my presence mattered to my own sense of belonging and spiritual grounding.\n\nJust as I was about to shut down my computer, my client\u2019s email flashed across the screen. The subject line read: \u201cURGENT\u2014Need Advice Tonight.\u201d She was in the middle of a legal crisis, and my guidance could mean the difference between swift resolution and costly delay. As her advocate, I was expected to be available, to provide clear, accurate advice when it mattered most.\n\nI stared at the screen, heart pounding, torn between the sanctuary\u2019s quiet promise and the pressing needs of someone who depended on me. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my presence, each carrying its own kind of responsibility. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
