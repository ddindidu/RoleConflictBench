As a rabbi, I was supposed to be at the synagogue soon, leading an adult education class on the wisdom of the prophets. I could already picture the expectant faces, the open books, the quiet hunger for meaning. But here, in the street, the air was thick with urgency. A fellow protester, eyes bright with conviction, tugged at my sleeve and whispered, \u201cWe need to make a statement\u2014step past the barricade with us. Show them we won\u2019t be silenced.\u201d\n\nAs a citizen, I knew the law was clear: the barricade marked the limit. Crossing it would be trespassing, disrespecting the city\u2019s rules and the rights of others to safety and order. Yet, as a rabbi, I felt the weight of moral leadership\u2014should I stand with those demanding justice, even if it meant breaking the law? My heart pounded as I looked from the synagogue\u2019s distant spire to the tense faces around me, torn between my duty to teach and my responsibility to the community, between the law of the land and the call for justice."}
