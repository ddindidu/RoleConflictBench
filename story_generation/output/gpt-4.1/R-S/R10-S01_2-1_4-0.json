I was supposed to be there in fifteen minutes, and punctuality was something the coordinator always emphasized. But right in front of me, I saw my friend, Priya, being cornered by a group of classmates, their words sharp and unfair. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to protect others from injustice, and to act with compassion and courage. My heart pounded with the weight of my dharma, urging me to intervene, to speak up for Priya.\n\nYet, the clock ticked on. I knew the kitchen could manage without me for a little while\u2014there were plenty of volunteers today\u2014but I also knew that being late would let down the team and set a bad example. The expectations of my roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension coil in my chest. I glanced at Priya, then at the time, torn between my duty to her and my commitment to the kitchen, uncertain which responsibility should come first."}
