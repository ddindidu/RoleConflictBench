It was a young couple, voices trembling with excitement, asking if I could officiate their wedding next spring. I could hear the hope in their words, the trust they placed in me to guide them through one of life\u2019s sacred moments. I promised to check my schedule and get back to them soon. As I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a producer from a major news network. They needed me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. My activist side knew how crucial this moment was; the community was counting on me to speak truth, to educate, to defend. But as a rabbi, I also knew the importance of being present for my congregants, of honoring commitments, even those not yet set in stone. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between two callings, unsure which to answer first."}
