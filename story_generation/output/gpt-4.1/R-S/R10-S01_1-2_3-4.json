My mind was still replaying the moment from earlier that morning, when I\u2019d seen a coworker quietly cut in line at the coffee shop. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014even in small matters. I\u2019d felt a tug to speak up, to gently remind them of fairness, but I hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene.\n\nNow, as I greeted the next client, she leaned in and whispered a private concern about her living situation, her eyes darting nervously. As a volunteer, I\u2019m expected to respect her privacy, to keep her words confidential. But her story hinted at something that might affect others in the program, and my sense of right and wrong flared up again. Should I honor her trust and keep silent, or should I act on what I\u2019d heard, risking her confidentiality for the sake of a greater good? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the expectations of my faith and my duty as a volunteer, unsure which path to follow."}
