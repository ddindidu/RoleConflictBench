As a Christian, I knew how important it was to attend church service, to worship and be present with my community. Pastor Linda had even asked me to help set up for the fellowship hour after the service. But as a volunteer at the local food pantry, I was also scheduled for the morning shift\u2014the same time as church. The coordinator had sent a reminder last night: \u201cWe need everyone on time. The doors open at nine sharp, and we\u2019re short-staffed.\u201d I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me. My church family counted on my presence and participation, but the pantry relied on me to help serve breakfast to families in need. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I leaned. I wanted to be faithful to my church, but I also couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting down the people who depended on the pantry. My heart ached as I stared at the clock, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to decide."}
