Her eyes were red, her hands trembling. As her pastor, I knew my role was to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. She poured out her worries\u2014her son\u2019s troubles, her own loneliness. I nodded, murmured prayers, and tried to be present for her. But as the clock ticked, my phone buzzed with reminders: the advocacy meeting was about to start across town. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my clients and colleagues depended on me to be there, to fight for their rights. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my compassion and time, the other my reliability and action. My heart ached as I glanced between Mrs. Carter and the clock, torn by the impossible choice between being the shepherd she needed and the advocate my clients expected."}
