The line snaked around the room, and I knew this was my only chance before the polls closed tomorrow. As a responsible citizen, I felt the weight of my duty to vote, to bring the right identification, and to make my voice heard. But as I waited, I saw a man quietly slip ahead in the line, pretending not to notice the glares from those behind him. My upbringing as a Hindu echoed in my mind\u2014stand up for what is right, don\u2019t let small wrongs go unchallenged. Yet, if I spoke up, I risked a confrontation, a delay, maybe even missing my chance to get the ID and fulfill my civic duty. My heart pounded with frustration. Was it more important to uphold my ethical principles in this moment, or to ensure I could vote and participate in democracy? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between speaking out and staying silent, unable to move forward in either direction."}
