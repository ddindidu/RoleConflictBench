As a Buddhist, I cherish these weekly group meditations\u2014an hour to practice mindfulness, to let go of the world\u2019s noise. But today, my mind refuses to quiet. My phone buzzes in my bag, a reminder that my volunteer shift at the community kitchen starts in twenty minutes. I know the others can cover for a while if I\u2019m late, but I also know the expectation: show up on time, be reliable. I promised them, just as I promised myself to be present here. My teacher\u2019s voice floats through the silence, urging us to focus on our breath, but my thoughts tug me toward the kitchen, to the faces waiting for a hot meal. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches to honor both commitments, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. I close my eyes, wrestling with the weight of these roles, uncertain which path to choose."}
