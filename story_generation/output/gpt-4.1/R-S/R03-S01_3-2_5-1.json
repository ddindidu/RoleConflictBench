Today, I am to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral\u2014a great honor, and one my sisters expect me to fulfill with devotion and grace. The Mother Superior pressed my hands last night, her eyes shining with pride. \u201cYou represent us all,\u201d she whispered. But as I smoothed my habit, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed. Please be on time. The shelter opens at eight sharp.\u201d I know how much they rely on me; the guests count on a warm meal and a kind word, and the team can\u2019t manage without every pair of hands. My heart pounds as I picture the faces at the shelter, and then the expectant crowd at the cathedral. Both need me, both expect me to give my all. I stare at my reflection, torn between the sacred call of prayer and the urgent need for service, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
