As a rabbi, I know I should be brainstorming ideas for my upcoming Shabbat sermon\u2014something meaningful, something that will resonate with the congregation. The pressure to inspire and guide weighs on me, and I feel the familiar anxiety of wanting to do justice to my role. Yet, tonight is also the night my friends and I have planned to rehearse music for a community event. The only time everyone could gather was late, and I promised to host. \n\nBut as the clock ticks closer to our start time, I remember the building\u2019s quiet hours. My neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, always leaves her windows open, and she\u2019s mentioned before how sound carries at night. As a citizen, I\u2019m expected to respect the rules and the peace of those around me. The thought of disturbing her, of possibly breaking the law, gnaws at me. I feel torn\u2014between my commitment to my faith community and my responsibility to my neighbors. The weight of both roles presses in, and I find myself frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
