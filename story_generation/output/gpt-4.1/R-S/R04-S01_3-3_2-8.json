The congregation had gathered for a special remembrance, their eyes searching for guidance. As the imam, I knew I was the only one present authorized to lead the prayer. The weight of their expectation pressed on me; they needed me to step forward, to fulfill my duty and uphold the sanctity of the gathering. Just as I was about to move, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: a new directive had come down, outlining mandatory procedures that had to be implemented immediately. If I didn\u2019t act, the service risked being shut down. My mind raced\u2014how could I be in two places at once? The congregation waited, trusting me as their spiritual leader, while the coordinator depended on me to follow the rules and protect the service. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the sacred trust of my community and the pressing responsibility of my volunteer role, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
