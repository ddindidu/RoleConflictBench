My client, Mr. Harris, had just left after explaining his side of a complicated property dispute. As his advocate, I was expected to represent him zealously, to use every legal tool at my disposal to secure his victory. But as a Christian, I was taught to value honesty, integrity, and compassion above all else. The evidence he provided was technically admissible, but I knew it painted an incomplete picture\u2014one that could unfairly harm the other party.\n\nThe pressure weighed on me. My client trusted me to fight for him, to do whatever it took within the law. Yet, my faith whispered that justice was more than just winning; it was about truth and fairness. I could feel the tension in my chest, the pull between my professional duty and my personal convictions. I stared at the file, knowing that whatever I chose next would define not just my career, but the kind of person I was striving to be."}
