My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTomorrow, please share the essence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings with the sangha.\u201d I felt honored, and a little anxious\u2014I wanted to do justice to the wisdom I\u2019d received. I opened my notebook, ready to reflect, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was the activist group\u2019s coordinator. \u201cA major network needs you on air now. There\u2019s misinformation spreading, and you\u2019re the voice people trust.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew how much this moment mattered for our cause, how many people might be swayed by what I said\u2014or didn\u2019t say. But the temple session was tomorrow, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to prepare. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. The calm I\u2019d cultivated all morning slipped away, replaced by a storm of responsibility. I closed my eyes, searching for clarity, but all I found was the impossible pull of two paths, each demanding all of me, right now."}
