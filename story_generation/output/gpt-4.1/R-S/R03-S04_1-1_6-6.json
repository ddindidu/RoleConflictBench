My heart was eager for the silence, the gentle turning of pages, the chance to reflect and listen for God\u2019s voice. But today was also election day, and I had promised my community I would fulfill my civic duty. At the polling station, I joined the line, rosary in my pocket, mind still half in prayer. Suddenly, an official called out: \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name began with \u201cB.\u201d The new line was longer, slower, but the instructions were clear.\n\nI hesitated, torn. As a nun, I felt compelled to honor my commitment to spiritual discipline, to return quickly to my sacred reading. But as a voter, I was expected to obey the officials, to respect the process and set an example of integrity. The minutes ticked by, my heart pulled between obedience to my faith\u2019s rhythm and obedience to civic order. I stood there, wrestling with the weight of both callings, uncertain which voice to heed."}
