As imam, the community expects me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them spiritually and address their concerns with wisdom. But today, an invited guest speaker stands ready, his own sermon prepared, and I know the congregation would welcome his words if I step aside. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my law office. My client\u2019s case, a complex dispute that could change her life, is about to be called in court. As her advocate, I am expected to be present, to argue her case with diligence and care. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the duty to my congregation, who look to me for spiritual leadership, and the responsibility to my client, who trusts me with her future. My heart pounds as I stand at the threshold, torn between the pulpit and the courtroom, knowing that whichever path I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
