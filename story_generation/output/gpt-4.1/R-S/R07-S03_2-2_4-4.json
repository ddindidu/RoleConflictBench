The gentle chime signals the start of our weekly group meditation, and I close my eyes, focusing on my breath. As a Buddhist, I know how important it is to nurture mindfulness, to be present, to let go of distractions. But today, my mind is anything but still. My phone, silenced in my bag, vibrates with reminders\u2014the online candidate forum for my district is streaming right now. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to stay informed, to listen, to participate in the decisions that shape our community. I promised myself I\u2019d watch, maybe even submit a question. The expectation to be a mindful Buddhist tugs me one way, the duty to be an engaged citizen pulls me another. My heart pounds with guilt and indecision. I want to honor my spiritual practice, but I also want to be a responsible member of society. The tension coils in my chest as I sit, torn between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
