As a citizen, I knew how important it was to participate, to give feedback that could shape our community. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her voice trembling over the line as she asked if I could meet her right away. She needed spiritual guidance, someone to help her navigate a decision that could change her life. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The city expected my input as a responsible resident, but Sarah needed me as her pastor, her confidant. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my community and the call to serve someone in deep need. I stared at the survey, then at my phone, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
