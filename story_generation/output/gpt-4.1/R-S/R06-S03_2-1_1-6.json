I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get them done early this year, as a responsible citizen should. But my phone buzzed with a message from the church group: the free vaccine clinic at the community center needed volunteers this weekend. They were short-handed, and the pastor reminded us that serving others was a way to live out our faith.\n\nI felt the weight of both expectations pressing in. As a Christian, I knew I should help those in need, especially when it came to health and compassion. But as a citizen, I also felt the duty to keep my financial responsibilities in order, to pay my taxes on time, and not let things slide. My mind raced with the possible consequences of neglecting either role. I wanted to be both a good Christian and a good citizen, but right now, it felt impossible to be both at once. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between the call to serve and the call to fulfill my civic duties."}
