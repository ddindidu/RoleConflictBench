The air was thick with the scent of incense and marigold, and I could see my family and neighbors gathered, their faces lit with joy. My mother waved, beckoning me to join the aarti, her eyes full of hope that I would honor our traditions, even if just for a moment. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was in less than thirty minutes, and my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and preparation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my community expecting my presence, my profession demanding my discipline. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the pull of my faith and the call of my duty, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
