I\u2019d planned to grab a quick bite at the small kosher vendor nearby, the only place I could eat without breaking the dietary laws I\u2019ve followed since childhood. But as I started to slip away, shouts erupted\u2014police were blocking the exits, and panic rippled through the crowd. As an activist, people looked to me for guidance, expecting me to help coordinate a safe, calm response. My phone buzzed with messages from fellow organizers, pleading for direction. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the vendor, knowing it would close soon and I\u2019d have nothing kosher to eat for the rest of the day. The weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressed on me from both sides: uphold my faith, or fulfill my responsibility to the movement. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the hunger gnawing at my conscience and the urgent calls for leadership echoing in my ears."}
