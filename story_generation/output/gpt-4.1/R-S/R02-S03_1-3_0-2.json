As a priest, I was expected to lead the daily prayer service in just a few minutes, a routine that brought comfort to many in our community. But as a citizen, I was also aware of the barricades set up by the city\u2014clear boundaries meant to protect public property and maintain order during the demonstration. Suddenly, a fellow protester grabbed my arm, urging me to step past the barricade, insisting that my presence would lend moral weight to their cause. My heart pounded. I felt the eyes of my congregation on me, expecting me to uphold my spiritual duties, while the crowd around me demanded solidarity and action. The law was clear, but so was the need for compassion and justice. I stood frozen, torn between the sacred call to prayer and the civic responsibility to obey the law and respect public property, my mind racing with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
