As a rabbi, I know I must begin preparing my sermon for Shabbat, searching for a message that will resonate with my congregation weeks from now. The responsibility weighs on me; I want to offer words that inspire, comfort, and challenge. Yet, as I reach for a pen, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey on bus routes is closing soon. As a citizen, I feel a duty to participate, to lend my voice to decisions that shape our community\u2019s daily life. I know my feedback could help neighbors who rely on public transit, and I want to be an engaged, responsible member of the city. But the hours in the evening are few, and my mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the sacred work of sermon-writing and the civic obligation to contribute. I feel the tension rising, the pressure of both roles demanding my attention, each important in its own way. I stare at the survey link and my sermon notes, heart pounding, uncertain which call to answer first."}
