My notes for the Friday sermon were spread before me, the topic\u2014\u201cJustice and Compassion in Our Community\u201d\u2014already announced and eagerly awaited by the congregation. As imam, I knew the weight of this responsibility; the community looked to me for guidance, and missing the khutbah would be unthinkable. Just as I began to rehearse, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from my activist group: the state legislature was holding a surprise, tie-breaking vote on a bill we\u2019d fought for months. The only undecided representative was taking calls for the next hour\u2014this was our last chance to sway the outcome. My heart pounded. If I left now to make the call, I\u2019d let down my congregation. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray the cause and the people who depended on my advocacy. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
