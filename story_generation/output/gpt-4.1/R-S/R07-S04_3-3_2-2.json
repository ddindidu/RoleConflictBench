The abbot\u2019s gentle voice echoes in my mind, reminding me how important it is to serve the community, especially today, when the festival only happens once a year. My fellow volunteers glance at me, expecting me to stay and help with the final preparations. Yet, my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the polling station will close in ten minutes. I promised myself I would vote, believing it\u2019s my duty as a citizen to have a say in our country\u2019s future. My heart pounds as I look at the clock, feeling the weight of both responsibilities. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my Buddhist community, who count on my presence. If I stay, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote, betraying my civic duty. The pressure builds inside me, torn between the quiet call of compassion and the urgent demand of democracy, as the minutes slip away."}
