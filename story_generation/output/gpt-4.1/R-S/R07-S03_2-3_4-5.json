The bell rings, signaling the start of our weekly group practice. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to cultivate mindfulness, to let go of distractions and focus on the breath. But today, my mind is anything but still. I keep thinking about the ballot measure that could change the character of my block\u2014something I care deeply about as a citizen. The polling place is just a few blocks away, and the deadline is looming. I know my neighbors are counting on me to participate, to make my voice heard, to fulfill my civic duty. Yet here I am, torn between the calm of the sangha and the urgency of the outside world. My heart pounds with the weight of both expectations, the silence of the hall pressing in as I wrestle with the choice: stay and honor my commitment to mindfulness, or leave and cast my vote before it\u2019s too late."}
