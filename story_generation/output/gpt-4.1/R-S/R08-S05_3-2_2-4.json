As a Muslim, I am expected to join the community study circle, where we will discuss Quranic verses that I haven\u2019t yet read. I know the importance of reciting and reflecting on the Quran, especially in a group setting where my participation is valued. Yet, as an advocate, my client\u2019s case is at a critical juncture. The legal documents are spread across my desk, and the hearing is tomorrow. My client\u2019s future may hinge on my preparation tonight. I feel the pull of my faith, the desire to deepen my understanding and fulfill my spiritual duties. At the same time, I feel the professional obligation to represent my client with diligence and care. My mind races with the expectations from both sides\u2014my community waiting for my insights, my client relying on my expertise. The clock ticks, and I sit at my desk, torn, the Quran on one side, case files on the other, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
