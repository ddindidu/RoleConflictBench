The clock ticked closer to noon, when Mrs. Evans would arrive, seeking comfort for the burden she\u2019d carried for months. She needed me to listen, to offer solace and spiritual guidance, to help her find peace in her struggle. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the law firm. My client, Mr. Patel, was in crisis. His legal issue had escalated overnight, and he needed my advice now, before the court\u2019s deadline. As a priest, I was expected to be present, patient, and compassionate, to give my undivided attention to those in pain. As an advocate, I was expected to be precise, prompt, and unwavering, to provide clear legal counsel without delay. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence at the same moment. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between the spiritual needs of one and the legal urgency of another, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
