As a priest, I am expected to offer comfort and guidance to anyone in need, and tonight, just as the choir was about to begin, a young woman burst into the sanctuary, her face streaked with tears. She pleaded for spiritual support, her voice trembling with desperation. I could see she needed me\u2014right now, not later. But as a citizen, I also knew the city\u2019s noise ordinance was strict; the church\u2019s windows were open, and our neighbor, who had complained before, was home. The music would surely carry, disturbing the peace and possibly leading to a fine or strained relations. My heart pounded as I stood between the woman\u2019s pain and the choir\u2019s eager faces, torn between my duty to her and my responsibility to the community. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which role I could honor without betraying the other."}
