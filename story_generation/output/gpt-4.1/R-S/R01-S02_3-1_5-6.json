As their pastor, I knew my place was with them\u2014offering comfort, organizing meals, and gathering the community for support. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen. The post I\u2019d written about environmental justice was exploding online. Hundreds of people were commenting, asking questions, and waiting for my voice to guide the conversation. This was the moment I\u2019d been working toward as an activist\u2014an opportunity to educate and inspire real change. But the faces of my grieving parishioners haunted me. They needed me now, in person, not as a distant voice on the internet. My heart pounded as I stood in the church office, torn between the urgent needs of my flock and the rare chance to reach thousands with my cause. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
