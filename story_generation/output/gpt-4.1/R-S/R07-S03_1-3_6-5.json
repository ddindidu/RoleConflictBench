My friend, also a Buddhist, called and asked if we could talk about the teachings we\u2019d just heard\u2014how to let go of attachment, how to cultivate compassion. I felt the pull to join her, to deepen my understanding and honor my commitment to spiritual growth. But as I reached for my phone, a notification flashed: \u201cPolling place closes in two hours.\u201d I remembered the ballot measure that could change the face of our block, the flyers urging us to vote, the neighbors who\u2019d asked for my opinion. As a citizen, I knew I should go, cast my vote, and maybe even talk to others about the issues. My mind spun between the quiet call of reflection and the urgent buzz of civic duty. I wanted to be present for my friend, to nurture my spiritual path, but I also felt the weight of responsibility to my community. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each shaping who I am."}
