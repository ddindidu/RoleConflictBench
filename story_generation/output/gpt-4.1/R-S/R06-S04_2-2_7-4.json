It\u2019s my only chance\u2014work and family keep me busy, and the polls close before I\u2019m free again. As I\u2019m about to leave, I get a call from Sarah, a friend from church. She\u2019s in tears, her voice trembling. Her mother\u2019s in the hospital, and she\u2019s scared to go alone. I remember the words of Jesus: love your neighbor, show kindness. My heart aches for her, and I know she needs someone now, not later.\n\nBut the clock is ticking. If I go to Sarah, I\u2019ll miss my window to get the ID, and I won\u2019t be able to vote. If I go home for the ID, I\u2019ll leave her to face her fear alone. I feel torn in two\u2014my duty as a Christian pulling me one way, my responsibility as a voter pulling me the other. My hands shake as I grip my car keys, standing in the driveway, paralyzed by the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
