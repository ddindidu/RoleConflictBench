The congregation expects me to lead the prayers, deliver a moving sermon, and be present for every ritual. The church will be packed, and my absence would be unthinkable. Yet, as a citizen, I know the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers are desperately needed. The city has also sent reminders about tax documents, and I promised myself I\u2019d get them sorted early this year. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my parishioners need spiritual guidance, but my neighbors need practical help. I can\u2019t ignore the call to serve in the clinic, especially when public health is at stake. My mind races, torn between the sacred duties of my faith and the civic responsibilities I hold dear. The expectations from both sides are clear, but I am caught in the middle, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
