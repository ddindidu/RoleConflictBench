Every Thursday, I teach the kids at the synagogue about our traditions\u2014stories of resilience, the meaning behind the holidays, the melodies of ancient prayers. The parents trust me to pass on what matters most, and the children look forward to our time together. But today, my volunteer shift at the shelter starts at exactly the same time. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need everyone on time. No exceptions. The doors open and people are waiting.\u201d I know how much the shelter relies on us, especially on days like this when the roster is thin. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my community\u2019s hope that I\u2019ll nurture the next generation, and the urgent need to serve those who have no one else. My stomach knots as I try to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the stories I\u2019m meant to tell and the hands I\u2019m meant to hold."}
