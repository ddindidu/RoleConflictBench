The rabbi\u2019s eyes met mine, hopeful and pleading. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan,\u201d he said softly. The funeral prayer couldn\u2019t begin without me. I glanced at my watch\u2014court was in forty minutes, across town. My client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality; the judge had warned there would be no delays. As an advocate, I was expected to be reliable, to fight for justice without fail. But as a Jew, I was needed here, to honor the dead and support my community. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I could feel the expectations of my colleagues, my client, the rabbi, and the mourners all at once. My mind raced, torn between duty to my faith and duty to my profession, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
