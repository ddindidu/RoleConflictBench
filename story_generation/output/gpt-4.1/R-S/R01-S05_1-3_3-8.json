As a pastor, I\u2019d always made it a point to check in on my congregation, especially those who seemed to be struggling. Today, I\u2019d heard that Mrs. Carter was feeling especially low, and I knew how much a simple visit or a few kind words could mean to her. But as an advocate, I was also expected at the courthouse in less than an hour. The case I was working on was at a critical juncture, and my presence was not just expected\u2014it was essential. If I was late, it could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the court session, but my heart tugged me toward Mrs. Carter\u2019s house. I could picture her sitting alone, waiting for someone to show they cared. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my keys, torn between the courtroom and the quiet living room where someone needed me just as much."}
