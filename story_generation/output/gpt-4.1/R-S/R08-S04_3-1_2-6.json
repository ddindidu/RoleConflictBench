As a Muslim, I promised myself I would recite and reflect on the Quran before the community study circle tonight. The group will discuss verses I haven\u2019t yet read, and I feel the weight of expectation\u2014how can I contribute meaningfully if I haven\u2019t prepared? Yet here I am, a voter, clutching my ID, determined to fulfill my civic duty. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name falls in that range. The new line is longer, slower, but the instructions are clear. I hesitate, torn between following the rules and my desire to finish quickly so I can get home, read the verses, and not let my community down. My heart pounds with anxiety. I feel the pressure of both roles\u2014my faith urging me to honor my commitment, my responsibility as a voter demanding obedience to the process. I stand frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice, the expectations of my faith and my country pulling me in opposite directions."}
