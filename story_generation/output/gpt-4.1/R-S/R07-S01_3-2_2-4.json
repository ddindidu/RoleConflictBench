This morning, I arrived early, ready to serve, but as a volunteer at the check-in table, I was also responsible for welcoming guests and assisting those in need. As the line grew, an elderly woman approached, her hands trembling as she filled out her form. She leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal struggle, trusting me to keep it private. My mind raced\u2014monks were calling for help with the altar, and the abbot\u2019s eyes searched for me. I felt the weight of my Buddhist duty to the community, but also the sacred trust of confidentiality as a volunteer. The festival\u2019s bells echoed, urging me to join the ceremony, yet I couldn\u2019t abandon her vulnerability. Torn between the expectations of my faith and my promise to those I serve, I stood frozen, heart pounding, unsure which path to follow."}
