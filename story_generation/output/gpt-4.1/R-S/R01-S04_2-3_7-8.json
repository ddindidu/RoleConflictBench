Tomorrow\u2019s message was about honesty\u2014how we must act with uprightness, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. I wanted my words to ring true, to inspire my flock to live out their faith in every corner of their lives.\n\nBut now, here I was at the polling station, the clock ticking down. The election official\u2019s voice was firm: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form due to a registration issue. Please follow the instructions exactly, or your vote may not count.\u201d I glanced at the form, realizing it asked for information I wasn\u2019t sure I could provide truthfully.

The expectations clashed inside me, my conscience caught between the pulpit and the polling booth, the minutes slipping away as I wrestled with what to do."}
