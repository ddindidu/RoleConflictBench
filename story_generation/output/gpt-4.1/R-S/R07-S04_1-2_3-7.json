My breath slowed, thoughts drifting like clouds. Just as I settled into the stillness, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to return my mail-in ballot today. I had planned to meditate first, but the sense of civic duty tugged at me. I opened the ballot envelope, only to find a smudge on my signature. Almost immediately, an email from the election office popped up: \u201cPlease re-sign your envelope to ensure your vote counts.\u201d\n\nI felt torn. As a Buddhist, I value these moments of silence, the discipline of sitting with my breath, letting go of distractions. But as a voter, I know the importance of following every instruction, making sure my voice is heard and my ballot is valid. The poll worker\u2019s request felt urgent, but so did my commitment to mindfulness. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety rising. If I interrupted my meditation, was I betraying my practice? If I waited, was I risking my vote? I sat there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer first."}
