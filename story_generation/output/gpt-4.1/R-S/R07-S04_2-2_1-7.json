As a Buddhist, I am expected to join the community in honoring those who have passed, to chant and offer prayers with everyone else. My absence would be noticed, perhaps even questioned, as these rituals are not just tradition but a way to show respect and unity. Yet, earlier today, I went to vote, fulfilling my civic duty. At the polling station, the worker noticed my signature on the ballot envelope was smudged. She asked me to re-sign it, explaining that otherwise, my vote might not count. But I remember the Buddhist precept about honesty and integrity\u2014signing again feels like I\u2019m tampering, even if it\u2019s just to clarify my intent. The poll worker insists it\u2019s the right thing to do, but my conscience wavers. Now, as the temple bells ring, I feel torn\u2014between the expectations of my faith and the demands of my role as a responsible voter. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I stand at the threshold, uncertain which path to take."}
