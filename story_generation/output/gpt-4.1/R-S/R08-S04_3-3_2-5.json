As a Muslim, I promised myself to recite and reflect on the Quran with my community. The study circle gathers tonight, and we\u2019re set to discuss verses I haven\u2019t yet read. I feel the gentle but firm expectation from my friends and my own conscience: to come prepared, to honor the words of Allah, to be present in both mind and spirit.\n\nBut tonight is also the last chance to vote. The polls close soon, and I must bring my ID\u2014no exceptions. This is my only window to participate, to have my voice counted in a decision that will shape our future. I sense the civic duty pressing on me, the responsibility to stand up for what I believe in, to not let this moment slip away.\n\nI stare at my Quran, the ID card in my hand, torn between two obligations. My chest tightens as I imagine disappointing my study circle, or missing my chance to vote. The clock ticks, and I wrestle with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both faith and citizenship pulling me in opposite directions."}
