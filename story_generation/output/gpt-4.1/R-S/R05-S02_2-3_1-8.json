My congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014especially this week, when so many are seeking comfort. I\u2019m deep in thought, searching for the right words, when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the news network. They want me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into as an activist. My community needs truth, and I know my voice could make a difference. But the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. If I go, I\u2019ll have little time to finish my sermon, risking the spiritual nourishment my congregation relies on. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, with facts that could shape public understanding. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the pulpit and the platform, between the sacred and the urgent, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
