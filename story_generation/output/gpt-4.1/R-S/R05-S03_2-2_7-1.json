Months of preparation had led to this evening, and as the rabbi, I was expected to guide the ceremony and ensure the celebration honored tradition. The family had arranged for music and dancing to follow, a joyous expression of community. But as the band began to set up, I glanced at the clock\u2014quiet hours for the building would begin soon, and the neighbor in the adjacent apartment had already opened her windows, likely hoping for a peaceful night. As a citizen, I knew I was responsible for respecting the building\u2019s rules and my neighbor\u2019s right to quiet. Yet, as a rabbi, I felt the weight of the family\u2019s expectations and the importance of this milestone. My heart pounded as I imagined the disappointment if the music were cut short, and the frustration if the neighbor\u2019s evening was disturbed. Torn between honoring sacred tradition and upholding civic responsibility, I felt the tension coil inside me, uncertain which role I could bear to let down."}
