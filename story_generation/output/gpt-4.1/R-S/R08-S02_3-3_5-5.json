The familiar comfort of the prayer hall called to me, a space where I could reconnect with my faith and community. Just as I was about to step inside, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from my activist group: the state legislature was holding a surprise vote on a bill we\u2019d been fighting for, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to use my voice and influence to sway the vote. My heart pounded. I knew the importance of this moment for the cause I believed in, but I also knew that my faith required me to be present, both physically and spiritually, for the Friday prayer. I glanced at the prayer hall, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The expectations of my faith and my activism clashed inside me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between two parts of myself."}
