In five minutes, I\u2019d be live, speaking to thousands about the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into. The community expected me to be clear, passionate, and unwavering. Just then, Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation, appeared at my office door, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed guidance\u2014her marriage was crumbling, and she was desperate for spiritual counsel. As her pastor, I was her shepherd, expected to listen, comfort, and offer wisdom rooted in faith. But the clock was ticking. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the broadcast and let down the movement that counted on my voice. If I left, I\u2019d abandon someone in spiritual crisis. My mind raced, torn between the pulpit and the protest, between the quiet pain of one and the urgent call of many. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, and I stood frozen, unable to move."}
