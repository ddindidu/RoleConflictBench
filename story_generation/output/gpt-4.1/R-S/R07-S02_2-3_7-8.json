We\u2019re set to discuss a chapter on compassion\u2014a topic I\u2019ve been looking forward to, a chance to deepen my understanding and share quiet reflection with others. But the screen flashes with a message from the activist group: a major news network wants me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounds. The study circle expects my presence and thoughtful engagement; I promised to lead tonight\u2019s discussion. Yet, the activist in me knows how crucial it is to seize this moment, to speak truth when the world is listening. I feel torn, the weight of both communities pressing on me. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the demands of both roles swirl inside me, each urgent, each right in its own way."}
