A family from our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014right now. I could hear the panic and heartbreak in their voices, and I knew my presence would bring comfort. As a pastor, I\u2019ve always promised to be there in moments like these, to offer support and prayer when it\u2019s needed most.\n\nBut as I grabbed my coat, I glanced at the clock. The polls would close in just under two hours, and I hadn\u2019t voted yet. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election; my vote mattered, and I wanted to be a responsible citizen. The polling station was across town, and with traffic, I\u2019d have to choose: rush to the family and risk missing my chance to vote, or cast my ballot and delay my visit, leaving them to face their crisis alone for a little longer.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between my duty to my community and my responsibility as a voter."}
