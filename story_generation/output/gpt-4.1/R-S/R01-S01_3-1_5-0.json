It was Mrs. Kim, her voice trembling\u2014her husband had just passed away unexpectedly. As a pastor, I knew my place was with her, offering comfort and prayer, helping her navigate the first shock of loss. But as a volunteer, I was expected to be at the pantry in ten minutes, ready to help with the morning rush. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. I knew the other volunteers could cover for me if I was late, but I also knew my absence would be noticed. The pantry coordinator had stressed the importance of punctuality, especially during these busy weeks. Yet, how could I turn away from someone in such deep pain? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full commitment. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the call of duty and the call of compassion, unsure which path to take."}
