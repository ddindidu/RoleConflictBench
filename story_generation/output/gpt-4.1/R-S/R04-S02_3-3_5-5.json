As imam, I know how much this moment means to them\u2014my words are expected to inspire, to unite, to mark this day with spiritual significance. My phone vibrates in my pocket. A fellow activist\u2019s message flashes on the screen: the vote is happening now, the one we\u2019ve worked for all year. The undecided legislator is taking calls for the next thirty minutes only. My heart pounds. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to act, to be the voice that tips the scale for justice. But as imam, I\u2019m expected to be present, to lead, to guide. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to ignore. I stand at the threshold of the prayer hall, torn, the call to action and the call to prayer echoing equally in my mind."}
