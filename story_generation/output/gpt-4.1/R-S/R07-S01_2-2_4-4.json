My mind is supposed to be still, focused on my breath, but it keeps drifting to the community center where I volunteer. Today, our weekly group meditation overlaps with my shift at the check-in table. I promised myself I\u2019d be present for both, but now I\u2019m torn.\n\nEarlier, as I helped a client fill out forms, she leaned in and whispered a private concern, her eyes pleading for understanding. She asked me not to tell anyone. The weight of her words lingers with me, even as I try to return to my breath. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be mindful, to let go of distractions, but her story tugs at my heart. I want to honor her trust, but I also feel the urge to seek guidance from my meditation group, who value openness and sharing.\n\nThe bell rings, signaling the start of meditation, but my mind is anything but calm. I wrestle with the expectations of both roles, feeling the tension between being present for myself and being present for someone in need."}
