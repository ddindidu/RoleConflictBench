As a volunteer, I knew I had to respect her privacy, never prying or sharing anything she told me. But as the conversation drifted, I felt the familiar tug of my other role. It was almost noon, the time I usually set aside for my daily mantra. Normally, I would find a quiet corner, light a small lamp, and recite the verses with full attention. But here, surrounded by people, I could only repeat the mantra silently in my mind, without the ritual\u2019s comfort.\n\nI worried\u2014was I neglecting my faith by not performing the full ritual? At the same time, I feared that if I excused myself or seemed distracted, I might break the trust I\u2019d built with Mrs. Sharma. The expectations pressed in from both sides: my faith asking for devotion, my volunteer role demanding presence and confidentiality. My mind raced, torn between honoring my spiritual practice and fulfilling my promise to those I serve. I sat there, mantra echoing in my thoughts, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
