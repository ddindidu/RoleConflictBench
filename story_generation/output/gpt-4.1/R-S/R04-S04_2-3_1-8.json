The election official\u2019s voice was firm: \u201cYou must fill out this provisional ballot form before we close in ten minutes.\u201d I nodded, but my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the mosque committee. Our regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation was gathering for Maghrib. They were counting on me to lead the prayer, as I always did when needed. My heart pounded. The mosque was only a short drive away, but if I left now, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. If I stayed, the congregation would wait, growing anxious and disappointed. As an imam, I felt the weight of their trust, their need for guidance and stability. As a citizen, I felt the urgency of my civic duty, the importance of my voice in this election.
