The children sat at the table, their books open, eyes expectant. The holiday was only days away, and they still stumbled over the blessings. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIt\u2019s your duty to pass this on.\u201d I wanted to give them the warmth and wisdom of our traditions, to see their faces light up with understanding.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014my client\u2019s name flashing insistently. Their case was spiraling, and they needed my guidance now, not later. As an advocate, I owed them clarity, precision, and my full attention. Their livelihood, maybe even their freedom, depended on my advice. I could hear the urgency in their last message, the trust they placed in me.\n\nI stood between the table and the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My children\u2019s hopeful eyes, my client\u2019s desperate call. I closed my eyes, torn, the expectations of faith and profession pulling me in opposite directions."}
