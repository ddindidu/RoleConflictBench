I set my phone aside, opened the Quran, and let the familiar verses calm my mind. As I recited, I felt a deep sense of peace, grateful for the chance to reflect and reconnect with my faith. Suddenly, the building\u2019s alarm blared, shattering the silence. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning; outside, water was already pooling along the curb. I could hear neighbors in the hallway, voices tense and hurried. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on the elderly couple next door, make sure everyone was safe, maybe even help organize an evacuation. But as a Muslim, I felt the pull to continue my recitation, to honor this sacred time I had set aside for spiritual growth. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each urgent in its own way. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between the tranquility of my faith and the immediate needs of my community, unsure which call to answer first."}
