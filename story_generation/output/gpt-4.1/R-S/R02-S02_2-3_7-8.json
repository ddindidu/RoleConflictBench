Their parents trusted me to guide them, to nurture their faith and answer their questions. I glanced at my notes, ready to begin, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was the news network\u2014there had been a breaking story, and misinformation about our cause was spreading fast. They needed me on air, now, to set the record straight and reach thousands who might otherwise be misled.\n\nMy heart pounded. The children waited, eyes bright, expecting stories and lessons. Their parents expected me to be present, to lead with patience and care. But my fellow activists counted on me to speak out, to seize this rare chance to educate the wider public and defend our work. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each too important to neglect. I stared at my phone, torn, as the children\u2019s voices faded into the background and the news anchor\u2019s words echoed in my mind."}
