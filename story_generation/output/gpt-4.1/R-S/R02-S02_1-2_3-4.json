I\u2019d love to talk sometime soon, if you\u2019re free.\u201d Her eyes were gentle, but I could sense a heaviness behind her words. As a priest, I knew my calling was to be present, to offer comfort and guidance whenever my parishioners reached out, no matter how small the request seemed.\n\nJust as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed. It was a legislative aide\u2014one I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks about the housing bill. \u201cI have ten minutes now if you want to discuss your concerns,\u201d the message read. As an activist, I\u2019d promised my coalition I\u2019d seize any chance to push for change, and this was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for.\n\nI felt my chest tighten. Mrs. Evans was waiting at the door, hope flickering in her eyes, while my phone vibrated insistently in my hand. Both roles demanded my presence, my voice, my care\u2014right now. I sat frozen, torn between the needs of one soul and the needs of many, unsure which call to answer first."}
