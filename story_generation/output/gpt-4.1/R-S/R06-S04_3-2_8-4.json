I\u2019d forgotten my ID, and the only chance to get it was now\u2014tomorrow, I\u2019d be out of town. As I turned to hurry home, I noticed an elderly woman struggling with her walker, her groceries spilling onto the sidewalk. She looked up, eyes pleading for help. My mind raced. As a Christian, I knew what Jesus would do\u2014He\u2019d stop, show love, and help her. But as a voter, I felt the weight of my civic duty, the importance of my voice in this election, and the strict rule: no ID, no vote. The minutes ticked by, and I felt torn in two, the expectations of my faith and my responsibility as a citizen pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I stood frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
