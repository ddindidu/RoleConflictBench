As her pastor, I felt compelled to offer her comfort, to listen and provide the spiritual guidance she sought. She confided in me about her loneliness, and I suggested we end the evening with uplifting music\u2014something to lift her spirits and bring the group together. But as the clock ticked past ten, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours. As a citizen, I knew I was expected to respect the law and my neighbors\u2019 right to peace. Through the open windows, I could see Mr. Lee across the courtyard, his lights still on. The group looked to me, waiting for my lead, while Sarah\u2019s eyes pleaded for solace. My heart tugged in two directions: the call to comfort a troubled soul, and the duty to honor the rules that keep our community harmonious. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
