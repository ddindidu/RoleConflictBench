My friend\u2019s message flashes on the screen: \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Can you come?\u201d I glance at the calendar on my wall, where I\u2019ve circled the dates for Hajj next year\u2014a dream I\u2019ve carried since childhood. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of that obligation, the longing to stand in Mecca, to fulfill a pillar of my faith. But I know I haven\u2019t saved enough yet; every extra expense pushes that dream further away.\n\nYet, as an activist, I feel another pull. The protest is small, and our cause\u2014justice for the marginalized\u2014needs every voice. I know my presence matters, that showing up is part of who I am. But travel, even across the city, means spending money I should be saving. My heart pounds with the tension. I want to be true to my faith, to honor my commitment to Hajj, but I also want to stand with my friends, to fight for what\u2019s right. The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit frozen, torn between two parts of myself, unsure which path to take."}
