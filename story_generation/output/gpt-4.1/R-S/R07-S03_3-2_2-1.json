Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I cherished for its sense of unity and peace. As a Buddhist, I was expected to help with the preparations\u2014arranging flowers, lighting incense, and chanting with the others. The abbot had asked for my help specifically, knowing I was always reliable. But as I left my apartment, I remembered the music event my friends had planned for tonight. They\u2019d rented the community room, and I\u2019d promised to bring my guitar and lead a few songs. The problem was, the event would run late, and our building\u2019s quiet hours started at ten. Last year, a neighbor complained when music drifted through her open window. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the rules and my neighbor\u2019s right to peace. But as a Buddhist, I felt the pull of my community\u2019s expectations, the joy of shared ritual, and the promise I\u2019d made to my friends. My heart felt heavy, torn between honoring my spiritual commitments and my civic responsibilities, unsure which path would bring the least harm."}
