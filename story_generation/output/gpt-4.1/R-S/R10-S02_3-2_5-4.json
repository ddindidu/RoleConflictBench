Just moments ago, I had witnessed my supervisor quietly accepting an envelope from a contractor\u2014money exchanged for a promise to overlook safety violations. My heart pounded with outrage and a deep sense of duty; as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and courage in the face of wrongdoing. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to confront my supervisor or report the act immediately.\n\nBut then my phone vibrated again. It was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks, finally available for a brief call. As an activist, I knew this was my chance to push for the policy changes I\u2019d been fighting for, to speak for those who had no voice. The entire campaign depended on this conversation, and missing it could mean losing momentum for months.\n\nI stared at the closed office door, then at the flashing screen of my phone, torn between the urgent call to justice in my faith and the pressing demands of my activism. My breath caught in my throat as I realized I could not do both at once."}
