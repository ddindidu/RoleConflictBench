Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year\u2014our sanctuary would be filled with hundreds, all expecting me to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and guidance. My vestments felt heavier than usual, the weight of tradition and faith pressing on my shoulders. As I rehearsed the opening hymn, my phone buzzed urgently. The major news network was on the line, asking me to go on air immediately to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019d devoted years to as an activist. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for\u2014a chance to reach millions, to set the record straight, to defend those who had no voice. But the congregation was gathering, counting on me to be present, to shepherd them through this sacred day. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the pulpit and the platform, between the expectations of my faith community and the desperate need of the movement I championed."}
