The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my mind: I was to lead the daily reflections for the retreat, a responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual focus. I felt honored, but also anxious\u2014preparing meaningful reflections required hours of prayer and study, and the retreat began tomorrow.\n\nYet, today was also election day. As a citizen, I believed deeply in my duty to vote, to have a say in the world beyond our convent walls. I had set aside my ID, but now I couldn\u2019t find it. I could fetch another card later, but that would mean leaving the convent grounds, disrupting my preparation and the sacred silence I was meant to uphold.\n\nThe expectations pressed in on me: the community needed my spiritual leadership, but my conscience tugged at me to fulfill my civic responsibility. I stared at the scattered papers on my desk, my heart torn between the quiet call of faith and the urgent voice of democracy, unsure which path to follow."}
