She needed to talk\u2014her son was considering dropping out of college, and she was desperate for guidance. As her pastor, I knew she expected me to listen, pray, and offer wisdom rooted in faith. I promised to meet her at the church office, my mind already turning over scripture and words of comfort.\n\nBut today is also Election Day. I\u2019d planned to vote before noon, and I\u2019d set my wallet aside with my driver\u2019s license and voter card. As I rushed out, I realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home, but I had a backup card in my car. I could still vote later, but the polling place would close early this year.\n\nStanding in the church hallway, I felt the weight of both roles. Mrs. Carter needed my full attention, but I also felt the civic pull to vote, to be a responsible citizen. My congregation expects spiritual leadership; my country expects participation. I stood there, keys in hand, heart pounding, torn between the needs of one soul and the call of many."}
