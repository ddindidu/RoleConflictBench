The abbot has asked me personally, reminding me how much my presence means to the sangha. Yet, as an advocate, my clients rely on me to be present and punctual at our morning meetings\u2014today\u2019s session is especially important, with a court date looming and last-minute evidence to review. My colleagues expect unwavering commitment, and my absence could jeopardize a case we\u2019ve worked on for months. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the quiet call of incense and chanting, the urgent buzz of legal arguments and deadlines.
