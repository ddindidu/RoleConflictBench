The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I was still at the church. I had promised myself I would vote today\u2014my civic duty, my voice in the world. But as I reached for my coat, I saw Mrs. Evans sitting alone in the last pew, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. She\u2019d lost her husband last month, and I knew she came here for comfort, for the words only a pastor could offer. My congregation expected me to be present, to provide spiritual guidance, especially in moments like this. Yet, as a citizen, I was expected to show up at the polls, to participate in shaping our community\u2019s future. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. My feet felt rooted to the floor, torn between the sanctuary and the polling station, between the needs of one soul and the call of many."}
