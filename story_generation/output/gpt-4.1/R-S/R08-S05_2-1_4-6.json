As a Muslim, I always strive to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing my hijab. Today, though, the office was hosting a function\u2014one of those events where everyone mingles, laughs, and, inevitably, notices what you wear. My colleagues, both men and women, would be there, and I knew some would expect me to blend in, to look \u201cprofessional\u201d in the way they defined it: tailored suits, maybe a skirt, nothing that would draw attention.\n\nBut as an advocate, punctuality is non-negotiable. I had a routine meeting right before the function, and there would be no time to change in between. My suit, pressed and ready, hung beside my abaya. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my faith\u2019s call for modesty, my profession\u2019s demand for conformity and timeliness. My heart pounded as I imagined the glances, the questions, the possibility of being late if I tried to change. I stared at my reflection, torn, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to decide."}
