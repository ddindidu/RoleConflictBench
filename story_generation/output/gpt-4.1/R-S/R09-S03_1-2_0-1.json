Passing on our Jewish traditions felt like a sacred duty, and I\u2019d promised the kids a special session with music and songs, something to make the history come alive. But as I set up the speakers, I glanced at the clock. It was already past the building\u2019s quiet hours, and I could see Mrs. Feldman\u2019s window open across the courtyard. The city ordinance was clear: respect your neighbors, keep the peace. I imagined her, tired after a long day, hoping for silence. My heart twisted. The children were excited, waiting for the music, but I couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility as a citizen. The law was there for a reason, and I didn\u2019t want to be the neighbor who disregarded others\u2019 comfort. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should honor tonight."}
