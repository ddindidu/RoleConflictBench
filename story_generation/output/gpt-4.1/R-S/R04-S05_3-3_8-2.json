A young man entered, his eyes red and voice trembling. He had just lost his father and needed spiritual guidance, someone to help him make sense of his grief. As an imam, I knew my community expected me to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in these moments of pain. I listened, heart heavy, as he poured out his sorrow.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed insistently. It was my legal client, facing an urgent deadline. She was counting on me, her advocate, to provide clear, accurate legal advice that could not wait. The law demanded precision and timeliness; her future depended on my response.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. My community needed my compassion, my client needed my expertise. I could not be in two places at once, yet both expected me to be fully present. My mind raced, emotions tangled, as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
