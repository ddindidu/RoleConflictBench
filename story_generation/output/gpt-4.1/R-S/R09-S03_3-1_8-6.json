The city had set up a free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend, and I\u2019d volunteered to help, knowing how important it was for public health. As a citizen, I felt a duty to contribute, especially after the past year\u2019s struggles. \n\nThen my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan,\u201d he said, his voice urgent. \u201cThere\u2019s a funeral prayer this afternoon. Can you come?\u201d I knew how vital it was in our tradition to ensure the deceased received proper prayers, and how much the family would rely on the community. \n\nBut the vaccine clinic was short-staffed, and I\u2019d promised to be there. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my Jewish identity urging me to the synagogue, my civic responsibility calling me to the clinic. I felt the weight of both communities\u2019 expectations pressing in, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
