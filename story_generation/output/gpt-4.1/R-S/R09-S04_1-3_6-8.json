The sun was setting, and Shabbat would begin soon. As a Jew, I was expected to be at synagogue for the Friday evening service, a tradition I rarely missed. My family and community valued this commitment, and I felt their expectations weighing on me. But as a voter, I had a civic duty to cast my ballot. The election official explained that, due to a registration error, I needed to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closed in ten minutes. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to synagogue on time, but my vote would go uncast. If I stayed, I\u2019d fulfill my responsibility as a citizen, but I\u2019d arrive late to the service, disappointing those who counted on my presence. The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between two worlds, each asking for something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
