The sun was dipping low, and I knew I had only a couple of hours before the polling station would close. But as I stepped into my home, the familiar scent of incense greeted me, and I remembered my daily ritual\u2014lighting the lamp and offering prayers at the altar. My mother always said, \u201cNo matter how busy, never skip your prayers. It keeps our home blessed.\u201d Yet, the news all week had been urging everyone to vote, to not waste this chance to shape our future. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me. If I rushed through my prayers, would I be disrespecting my faith? If I delayed, would I miss my chance to vote? My heart pounded as I stood between the altar and the door, torn by the demands of my beliefs and my duty as a citizen, unsure which path to take first."}
