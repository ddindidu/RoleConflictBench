The family can\u2019t imagine anyone else leading the service.\u201d I assured her I\u2019d be there, feeling the weight of their grief settle on my shoulders. As I gathered my notes, my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that today was Election Day, and the polls would close in two hours. I\u2019d put off voting, thinking I\u2019d have time, but now I realized I\u2019d need to bring my ID and go immediately if I wanted my voice to count. My congregation expected me to be present in their darkest hour, to offer comfort and tradition. But as a citizen, I felt the responsibility to participate in our democracy, especially with so much at stake. My heart pounded as I stared at my rabbinic robe and my wallet, feeling torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each with consequences if I failed."}
