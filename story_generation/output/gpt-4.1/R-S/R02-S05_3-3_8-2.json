As a priest, I was expected to guide families through the sacred milestones of faith, and today, the Martinez family needed me. Their daughter\u2019s sacrament was just days away, and they pleaded for a final, mandatory preparation session\u2014one that only I could lead. The children\u2019s trust, the parents\u2019 hope, the community\u2019s faith in my guidance pressed heavily on my shoulders.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my legal client, panic clear in every word. As their advocate, I was their lifeline, the one who could untangle the legal knots threatening their livelihood. They needed precise, immediate advice\u2014any delay could cost them dearly. The law demanded my clarity and presence, just as the church demanded my compassion and leadership.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds. My heart pounded with the knowledge that I could not be in two places at once, that someone would be let down. The expectations of faith and justice warred within me, and I closed my eyes, torn between the sacred and the urgent, knowing I had to choose."}
