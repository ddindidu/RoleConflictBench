Our regular backup imam was away, and everyone looked to me to lead the prayer, as I had done so many times before. Their trust in me was clear, and I felt the weight of their expectation settle on my shoulders. Yet, in my pocket, my voter card pressed against my leg, a silent reminder that today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but I knew the lines could grow long as the day wore on. I wanted to fulfill my civic duty, to have my voice heard, but the congregation needed me now, at this very moment. My heart pounded with the pressure of both responsibilities, torn between my role as a spiritual guide and my duty as a citizen. I stood at the threshold, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the pull of both worlds and the fear of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
