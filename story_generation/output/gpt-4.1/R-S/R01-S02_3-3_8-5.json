My notes were ready, and I could feel the weight of expectation\u2014these people looked to me to guide them through the intricacies of our faith, to help them wrestle with questions that mattered deeply to their souls. Just as I began to speak, my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. A text from the activist network flashed on the screen: the crucial vote was happening now, and the undecided representative was waiting for a call that could tip the balance. My heart pounded. As a pastor, I was expected to be fully present, to shepherd these leaders through sacred teachings. But as an activist, I was needed\u2014right now\u2014to fight for justice in the public square.
