It was Friday evening, and the familiar pull of Shabbat services tugged at me. My family expected me to be there, and I felt the weight of tradition\u2014of being counted in the minyan, of honoring my heritage. But my phone buzzed again with another message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cAll hands needed. New safety procedures must be implemented tonight, or we risk shutting down the shelter.\u201d The urgency in her words pressed on me. I knew the shelter relied on volunteers like me to keep its doors open, especially now. I stared at the synagogue\u2019s glowing windows, then at the shelter\u2019s address on my phone. Both communities needed me, but in different ways. My heart pounded as I tried to reconcile the quiet sanctity of prayer with the immediate, practical demands of service. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down\u2014my community, my faith, or the people who depended on the shelter for warmth and safety."}
