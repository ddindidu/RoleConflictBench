Sunday was only two days away, and I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014guidance, clarity, hope. Just as I found the right passage, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator at the community kitchen where I serve every Saturday. The message was urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, no exceptions, or the kitchen would be shut down. The guidelines, though well-intentioned, clashed with the message I was preparing\u2014one about compassion and flexibility in the face of rigid rules. As a pastor, I wanted to teach understanding and grace; as a volunteer, I was expected to enforce strict compliance. My mind spun with the tension between what I believed and what I was being asked to do. I stared at my sermon notes, then at the coordinator\u2019s message, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which voice to follow."}
