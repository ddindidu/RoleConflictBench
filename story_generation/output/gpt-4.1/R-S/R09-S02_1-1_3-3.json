I\u2019ve just finished preparing a kosher lunch, double-checking every label, every ingredient, as I always do. It\u2019s a comfort, a ritual that grounds me in my Jewish identity. But the phone\u2019s screen flashes with a message from my activist group: \u201cLast chance to sign the petition before it goes to the senator. We need your voice!\u201d My heart pounds. I know how important this policy change is, how much I\u2019ve pushed others to act quickly, to seize every opportunity. But my hands are sticky with dough, and I remember the rabbi\u2019s words about not mixing sacred acts with secular ones, about intention and mindfulness. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014my community expects me to honor tradition, to pause and wash, to keep the kitchen a place of holiness. My fellow activists expect urgency, commitment, and immediate action. I stare at the phone, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, unsure which expectation I will let down."}
