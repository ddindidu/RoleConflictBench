My mind was focused on scripture, seeking wisdom for the meeting I\u2019d promised a parishioner\u2014she was struggling, her faith shaken, and I knew she needed my full attention and compassion. Just as I was preparing to meet her, the shrill wail of the flood alarm pierced the silence. Outside, rain battered the windows, and I could see water pooling in the street, creeping higher with every minute.\n\nAs a nun, my heart urged me to stay, to offer spiritual guidance and comfort to the woman waiting for me. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: the city needed everyone to act, to help neighbors evacuate, to follow emergency protocols, to ensure safety. My mind raced with the conflicting demands\u2014should I remain a spiritual anchor in this moment of crisis, or join the community effort to protect lives and property? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, uncertain which call to answer first."}
