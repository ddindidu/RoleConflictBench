My scripture lies open before me, the words inviting me into deep reflection, as is expected of me as a nun. Yet, my mind is restless. Mrs. Alvarez, a longtime parishioner, has asked to meet with me this afternoon. She\u2019s struggling with her faith, and I know she needs my full attention and spiritual guidance. At the same time, as a citizen, I\u2019ve promised myself to help at the free vaccine clinic this weekend\u2014our community is short on volunteers, and public health is at stake. My tax documents are spread across my desk, needing review before the deadline, another civic duty I cannot ignore. The weight of these expectations presses on me: the parish needs my spiritual presence, the community needs my practical help, and the government expects my compliance. I feel torn, my heart pulled in different directions, unsure how to honor both my vows and my responsibilities as a citizen."}
