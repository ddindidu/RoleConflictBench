I\u2019d promised myself to keep this time sacred, to pass on the stories and values that shaped generations before us. Just as I began to speak, the city\u2019s emergency sirens blared, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. Through the window, I saw water creeping up the street, neighbors hurrying to move cars and sandbag doorways. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on the elderly next door, join the volunteers forming a human chain to divert water. But as a Jewish parent, I felt the weight of my promise to my children, the importance of continuity, of not letting our traditions slip away, even for a week. My heart pounded as I looked from my children\u2019s expectant faces to the chaos outside, torn between the urgent call to community action and the quiet, persistent duty to my family\u2019s heritage."}
