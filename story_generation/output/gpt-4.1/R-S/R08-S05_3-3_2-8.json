As a Muslim, I am expected to recite and reflect on the Quran, especially before our community study circle. The group gathers tonight to discuss verses I haven\u2019t yet read, and I know my absence or lack of preparation will disappoint those who look to me for insight and sincerity. At the same time, as an advocate, my presence is crucial at a high-stakes court proceeding scheduled for the same evening. The outcome of this case could hinge on my arguments, and my colleagues and client are counting on me to be there, prepared and punctual. I feel the tension in my chest as I picture the study circle waiting for me, and the courtroom expecting my arrival. Both roles demand my full attention, both are rooted in values I hold dear. I sit at my desk, torn, the Quran open before me and my legal briefs stacked to the side, wrestling with the impossible choice between spiritual duty and professional responsibility."}
