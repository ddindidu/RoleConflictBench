She\u2019d suggested, almost in passing, that if I had time, I could reorganize the supply room before the weekend event. I knew how much she valued efficiency, and I wanted to meet her expectations. But my mind kept drifting to the doctor\u2019s words from earlier that day: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance to travel safely.\u201d The weight of that advice pressed on me. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, and I\u2019d dreamed of it for years. Yet, as a volunteer, I felt responsible for the team and the people we served. I could almost hear the coordinator\u2019s voice, hopeful that I\u2019d take initiative, and at the same time, I felt the pull of my faith, the urgency of fulfilling a lifelong obligation. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
