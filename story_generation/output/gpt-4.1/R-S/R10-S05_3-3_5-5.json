As a Hindu, I was raised to believe in dharma\u2014righteousness, truth, and justice. My parents taught me that turning a blind eye to wrongdoing was as grave as committing the act itself. Today, I witnessed something that shook me: my client, whose future now rests in my hands, confessed to a serious act of corruption that had harmed many innocent people. The law demands I represent him to the best of my ability, to protect his rights and fight for his acquittal. Yet, my conscience screamed at me to expose the truth, to stand up for those who had been wronged. The expectations of my profession clashed violently with the moral code I had lived by all my life. My mind raced with questions\u2014could I defend him and still honor my beliefs? Was I betraying my faith by staying silent, or betraying my duty as an advocate by speaking out? The conflict gnawed at me, leaving me paralyzed, caught between two worlds that refused to meet."}
