As a nun, I am called to serve those in need, and today, the news was urgent\u2014a family next door had lost everything in a fire. Sister Maria pressed my hand, her eyes pleading, \u201cThey need us now. Can you help gather food and clothes?\u201d My heart ached for them, but I glanced at my watch. In less than thirty minutes, I was expected at the community center. As the only volunteer scheduled, I had the keys; people would be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start the day\u2019s service. I could picture their faces, some elderly, some mothers with children, all depending on the routine and reliability I provided. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014compassion for the family in crisis, responsibility to the waiting crowd. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of my vows and my commitment to volunteering pulling me in opposite directions, my hands trembling as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
