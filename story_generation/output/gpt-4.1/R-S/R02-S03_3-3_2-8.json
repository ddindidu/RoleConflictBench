The pews would soon fill with neighbors, all expecting me to lead them in prayer, to be the steady voice guiding them through tradition and hope. As a priest, I felt the weight of their anticipation\u2014this day was sacred, a cornerstone of our faith, and my presence was essential.\n\nBut as the first hymns echoed, the shrill wail of building alarms shattered the peace. A flash-flood warning blared from every phone, and I could see water creeping along the street outside. As a citizen, I knew my duty: to help, to ensure safety, to heed the emergency protocols and perhaps even evacuate. The congregation looked to me, some for spiritual reassurance, others for practical guidance. My heart pounded with the impossible choice\u2014remain as their priest, anchoring them in faith, or act as a responsible citizen, leading them to safety. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between the altar and the door, wrestling with what I owed to each role."}
