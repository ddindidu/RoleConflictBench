As a Christian, I try to keep my moral values at the forefront, reminding myself to be honest, compassionate, and fair in all things. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw the reminder for yet another early morning meeting at the law firm. As an advocate, punctuality is non-negotiable\u2014my colleagues and clients expect me to be present and prepared, no matter what.\n\nBut today is different. It\u2019s the day of our church\u2019s monthly breakfast for the homeless, something I\u2019ve committed to for years. I know how much the community relies on us, and I feel a deep responsibility to serve. Yet, the meeting at the firm is about a crucial case, and my absence would be noticed. My boss has already warned me about missing meetings, and I can\u2019t afford to seem unreliable.\n\nI sit at the kitchen table, coffee cooling in my hands, torn between my faith and my professional duty. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which part of myself I\u2019ll have to disappoint today."}
