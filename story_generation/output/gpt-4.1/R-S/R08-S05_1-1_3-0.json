I wore my usual comfortable clothes\u2014loose pants and a long-sleeved shirt, modest and relaxed, just as my faith encourages. I was looking forward to a peaceful day, but my phone buzzed with a message from a client. She was anxious, asking if she could call for a quick chat about her legal situation. As an advocate, I know how important it is to provide clear, accurate advice, even during informal consultations. I agreed, not wanting to let her down.\n\nAs I prepared for the call, I caught my reflection in the mirror. My scarf was loosely draped, and my attire was more casual than I\u2019d wear to the office. I felt a pang of discomfort\u2014should I change into more formal, professional clothing, as I would for a client meeting? Would my current appearance undermine her trust in my professionalism or my commitment to my faith? The expectations of my roles pressed in on me: to be a modest Muslim at home, and a reliable advocate, always ready to serve. I hesitated, torn between the comfort of my home and the demands of my profession, unsure which expectation to meet."}
