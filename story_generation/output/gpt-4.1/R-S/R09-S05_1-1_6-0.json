As a Jew, I felt the familiar pull to join my community at synagogue, to greet Shabbat with prayer and song. It was a routine service, and I knew my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed by many, but the expectation to attend was ingrained in me\u2014a thread tying me to my faith and family.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a client, anxious and confused about a legal issue that had just come up. As an advocate, I was expected to provide clear, accurate advice, even during casual consultations. I could sense the urgency in their words, the need for reassurance and guidance. I knew that if I left now, I\u2019d be putting my religious commitment first, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my client, who relied on me for support.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. I sat at my desk, torn, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
