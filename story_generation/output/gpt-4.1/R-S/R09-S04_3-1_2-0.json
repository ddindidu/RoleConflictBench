My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was just a week away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew in his Torah portion. As a Jewish parent, I felt the pressure to guide him, to make sure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them. My own parents had always stressed the importance of tradition, of passing down our history, and I wanted to do the same for him.\n\nBut today was also Election Day. I had promised myself I would vote\u2014my civic duty, my voice in the future of our country. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but every time I sat down with my son, I saw the minutes ticking by. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time helping him practice. If I stayed, I risked forgetting or running out of time to vote. The expectations pressed in from both sides: to be a good parent, a good Jew, and a responsible citizen. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
