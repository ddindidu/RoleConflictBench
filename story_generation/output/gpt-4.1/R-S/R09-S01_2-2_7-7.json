As a Jew, I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion at synagogue\u2014a responsibility I\u2019d been preparing for all week. My family and community expected me to be there, to honor tradition and my commitment. But as a volunteer at the local shelter, I\u2019d just received a message from our coordinator: new safety protocols were in place, and every volunteer was required to attend a mandatory training session that overlapped with the service. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone to be consistent. No exceptions.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I missed the training, I\u2019d be letting down the team and possibly putting others at risk. If I missed the service, I\u2019d disappoint my community and break a promise. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
