As a Jewish parent and teacher, I know how important it is for the children to learn the blessings before the festival begins. Their eager faces look up at me, waiting for guidance, and I feel the responsibility to pass on our traditions and values. But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift at the community center starts in twenty minutes. I promised to be there on time, to set an example of reliability, even though I know the others can cover for a little while if I\u2019m late. My heart tugs in two directions: the children\u2019s need for connection to their heritage, and my commitment to serve the wider community. I can almost hear my own voice echoing the importance of both roles, but right now, they feel impossibly at odds. I stand in the doorway, torn, the blessings book in one hand and my volunteer badge in the other, wrestling with which expectation I will have to let down."}
