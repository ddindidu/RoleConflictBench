The call to prayer would sound in ten minutes, and the mosque was already filling with familiar faces. As the imam, everyone looked to me, especially today\u2014our usual backup was out of town, and the congregation expected me to lead. I could see the trust in their eyes, the comfort they found in my presence at the front. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. The food pantry opened in fifteen minutes, and the roster was stretched thin. She\u2019d stressed how crucial it was for everyone to be on time, especially today, when so many families were counting on us. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the pantry and the people waiting in line. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint the congregation and break the rhythm of their prayer. My mind raced, torn between two communities, both relying on me, both expecting me to be present. I stood in the hallway, the sounds of the mosque and the distant hum of the city merging, caught in the impossible space between two callings."}
