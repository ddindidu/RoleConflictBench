As a pastor, I was used to people seeking me out for guidance, but today, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse. Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation, sat across from me, her eyes red from crying. She was facing a life-altering decision, and she needed my spiritual counsel. I could see the desperation in her face, the way her hands trembled as she spoke. My heart ached to help her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she sought.\n\nBut as an advocate, I was also due in court in less than thirty minutes. My client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and presence; missing this session could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding my compassion and time, the other my professionalism and commitment. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turned. I glanced at the clock again, my mind racing, caught between the needs of my congregation and the obligations of my client, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully serve both at this moment."}
