The calendar on my phone blinked a reminder: time to begin preparing my sermon for Shabbat, a task that always demanded my full attention and spiritual focus. Congregants expected inspiration, guidance, and a message that would resonate for weeks. Yet, as I tried to gather my thoughts, another reminder flashed\u2014today was my only chance to swing by my apartment and grab my ID, the one thing I needed to vote in tomorrow\u2019s election. If I missed this window, I\u2019d lose my voice in a decision that mattered deeply to me and my community. My mind tugged in two directions: the sacred duty to my congregation, and my civic responsibility as a voter. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each urgent in its own way, and I sat there, torn, unable to move, wrestling with which role to honor first."}
