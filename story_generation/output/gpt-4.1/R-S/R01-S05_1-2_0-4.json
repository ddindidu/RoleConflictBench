As a pastor, I was used to offering comfort, and today, Mrs. Evans from my congregation had come to me, her eyes red-rimmed, voice trembling. She confided in me about her son\u2019s legal troubles, seeking solace and spiritual guidance. I listened, offering gentle words and a prayer, feeling the weight of her pain settle on my shoulders.\n\nBut as she spoke, my mind raced ahead to my other role\u2014her son was my client, and his case was scheduled for court tomorrow. As his advocate, I was bound to represent him with unwavering loyalty, to keep his confidences and fight for his interests. Yet here, as her pastor, I was expected to provide comfort, perhaps even share hope or insight that might ease her fears.\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides. I felt torn, my heart aching for her as a shepherd, my mind alert to the ethical boundaries of my legal duty. I wrestled with the knowledge I held, the lines I could not cross, and the impossible demands of both callings."}
