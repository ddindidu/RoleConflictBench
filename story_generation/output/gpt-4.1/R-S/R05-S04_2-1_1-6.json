My congregation expects a thoughtful sermon, and I still have notes to review before the service. This morning, I arrived early at the polling station, hoping to vote quickly and return to my preparations. The line was long, but I joined it, rehearsing my message in my mind. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name falls in that range. The new line is much longer and slower, but the official\u2019s voice is firm\u2014these are the rules.\n\nI hesitate. As a rabbi, I teach respect for authority and the importance of following communal guidelines. As a voter, I want to fulfill my civic duty efficiently and return to my congregation\u2019s needs. My heart pounds with anxiety. If I stay, I might finish quickly and have more time for my sermon, but I\u2019d be ignoring the official\u2019s instructions. If I move, I\u2019ll lose precious preparation time, but I\u2019ll be modeling integrity. The expectations of both roles press in on me, and I stand frozen, torn between my responsibilities."}
