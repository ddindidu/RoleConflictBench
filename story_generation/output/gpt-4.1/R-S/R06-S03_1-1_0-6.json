As a citizen, I felt proud to be organized and responsible, knowing my taxes helped fund schools, roads, and the very community center down the street. But as I sorted through receipts, I noticed a deduction I could claim\u2014one that was technically legal, but felt dishonest. My Christian values tugged at me, reminding me to act with integrity, not just legality. \n\nAt the same time, a flyer for the free vaccine clinic caught my eye. The city needed volunteers, and I knew my skills could help. But the clinic was on Sunday morning, right during church service. My church family expected me to be there, to worship and serve alongside them. I felt torn\u2014should I honor my faith community, or step up as a citizen in a time of need? The weight of these expectations pressed on me, and I found myself wrestling with what it truly meant to do the right thing."}
