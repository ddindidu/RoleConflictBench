The bell rings, signaling the start of our weekly group practice. My mind should be still, focused on my breath, but instead, it races. Today is election day, and the polls close in just over an hour. I remember the email: \u201cBring your ID, or you cannot vote.\u201d My wallet is at home, a twenty-minute walk away. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the meditation I\u2019ve committed to, the one hour a week I dedicate to mindfulness and inner peace. But if I stay, I forfeit my chance to vote, to fulfill my civic duty and have my voice heard. The expectation to be present, to let go of worldly concerns, clashes with the urgent responsibility to participate in democracy. My heart pounds, torn between the calm I seek and the action I owe. I close my eyes, but the struggle only grows louder inside me."}
