It was a text from my activist group: \u201cA legislative aide is free to talk about the bill\u2014call now!\u201d My heart raced. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, a chance to push for real change. But I glanced at the Bible open on my desk, the lesson on truthfulness staring back at me. I knew the bill\u2019s details inside out, but I also knew that some of our talking points stretched the truth, painting the opposition in a harsher light than they deserved. As a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to honesty and loving my neighbor, even those I disagreed with. As an activist, I felt the pressure to seize this rare opportunity, to do whatever it took to persuade the aide. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, torn between the call I needed to make and the values I was supposed to uphold."}
