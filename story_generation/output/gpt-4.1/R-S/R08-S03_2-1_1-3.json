I promised myself I\u2019d finish the Quran this month, but I\u2019m already a few chapters behind. Tonight, after iftar, I sit with the mushaf open, determined to catch up. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the city about the bus route survey. They want feedback from residents, and I know how important public input is. I\u2019ve always believed in being an active citizen, and I rely on those buses myself. The survey closes soon, and I want my voice to count.\n\nBut the Quran sits in front of me, its pages waiting. I feel the pressure of my faith, the desire to connect with Allah, especially in these blessed nights. At the same time, I feel the responsibility to my community, to help shape decisions that affect us all. My mind tugs in both directions, guilt and duty swirling together. I stare at the screen, then at the Quran, my heart heavy with the pull of both worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
