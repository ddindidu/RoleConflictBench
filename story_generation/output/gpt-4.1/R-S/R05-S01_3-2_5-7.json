She was anxious, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her rabbi, I felt the weight of guiding her, ensuring she understood every nuance of Jewish law. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter. \u201cReminder: All volunteers must follow the new safety protocol today. No exceptions.\u201d I was scheduled to help serve dinner in an hour, and the coordinator had emphasized how crucial it was to model the new steps for others.\n\nMy mind raced. If I rescheduled Miriam, she might lose confidence before her big day. But if I skipped my volunteer shift or ignored the new safety rules, I\u2019d be letting down the team and possibly putting others at risk. Both roles demanded my full presence, both expected unwavering commitment. I felt torn, the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
