As a Christian, I was expected to be present at every service, to worship and support my church community. But today, my volunteer work at the local shelter demanded my attention. I was responsible for sorting confidential medical files\u2014private stories entrusted to us by people who had nowhere else to turn. The shelter was short-staffed, and my absence would mean a delay in getting help to those who needed it most. Yet, if I missed church, I worried about letting down my congregation and my own spiritual routine. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me. I felt torn between honoring my commitment to God and my duty to protect the privacy of the vulnerable. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with the expectations of both worlds, unsure which door to walk through."}
