The family is waiting in the side room, anxious for their child\u2019s final preparation before tomorrow\u2019s sacrament. I know how much this means to them; as their priest, I\u2019m expected to guide and support them, especially at such a pivotal moment. Yet, as I listen to their questions, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in two hours. I promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014my civic duty, my voice in the community. But the errands ran late, and now time is slipping away. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. The congregation expects my unwavering presence and care, but as a citizen, I\u2019m expected to participate in shaping our future. My heart pounds as I try to focus on the family\u2019s needs, but my mind keeps drifting to the narrowing window to cast my ballot. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
