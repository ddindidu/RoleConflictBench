The community had been anticipating my sermon on justice and compassion, and I knew how much they valued my words each Friday. My phone buzzed\u2014a client, desperate for clarity, wanted to meet right away. As an advocate, I owed her my full attention and precise legal advice, not just the general reassurances I\u2019d given her in passing. But the sermon needed my focus; the congregation expected depth and inspiration, not a rushed message. My mind raced between the two worlds: the spiritual leader who must guide hundreds, and the advocate who must not let a single client down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my undivided presence, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the pulpit and the client\u2019s urgent need, knowing I could not give both my best at the same time."}
