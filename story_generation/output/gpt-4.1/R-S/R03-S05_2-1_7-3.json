I was deep in reflection, preparing for the spiritual study that nourished my soul. Just then, Sister Agnes knocked gently, her eyes troubled. \u201cMaria from the parish is here. She needs to talk\u2014she\u2019s struggling with her faith.\u201d My heart ached for Maria, knowing how fragile hope can be. But my phone buzzed insistently on the desk. The courthouse was expecting me; I was due to represent a client at a minor hearing in less than an hour. The case wasn\u2019t urgent, but my duty as an advocate demanded I be present, to give every client my best, no matter how small the stakes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my calling to guide a soul in crisis, and my responsibility to uphold justice. The expectations of my vows and my profession tangled inside me, each pulling me in a different direction. I closed my eyes, torn, the decision looming before me."}
