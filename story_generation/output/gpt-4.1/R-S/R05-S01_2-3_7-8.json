Months of preparation had led to this day, and as their rabbi, I was expected to guide the young boy through his rite of passage, to offer blessings and wisdom, to be fully present for his family. My tallit felt heavy on my shoulders, a symbol of my commitment.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the volunteer coordinator. The food pantry, where I also served, had just received an urgent directive: new safety procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the city would shut us down. As a volunteer, I was expected to drop everything and follow these instructions, to ensure the service continued for those who depended on us.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pounding. The congregation expected my undivided attention, but the pantry needed me now. Both roles demanded my presence, my leadership, and my care. I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
