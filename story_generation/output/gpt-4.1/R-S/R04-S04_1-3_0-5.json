The mosque feels quiet, the air heavy with the familiar scent of prayer mats. Yet, as a citizen, I know the polling station will close in less than an hour, and this is my only chance to vote. I clutch my ID in my pocket, feeling its weight as a reminder of my civic duty. The community expects me to be present, to guide them in worship, but my conscience urges me not to waste my right to vote\u2014a right so many have fought for. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, torn between the trust placed in me by my congregation and the responsibility I owe to my country. The minutes slip away, and I stand at the threshold, wrestling with the impossible choice between two roles that define who I am."}
