My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Evans would be waiting in my office in less than an hour, hoping for comfort and guidance through her grief. I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would be present, patient, and wise. But here I was, a voter, clutching my ID, inching forward in a line that snaked around the gym. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name, McCarthy, meant I was being asked to switch. The new line looked longer, slower, but the official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014this was the rule. I hesitated, torn. As a priest, I knew I couldn\u2019t be late for Mrs. Evans; she needed me. As a citizen, I felt the pressure to comply, to set an example of following civic instructions. My heart pounded as I stood between two duties, feeling the pull of both, uncertain which to honor first."}
