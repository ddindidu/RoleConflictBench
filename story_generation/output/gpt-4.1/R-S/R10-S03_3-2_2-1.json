As a Hindu, my daily rituals are sacred\u2014each prayer, each offering, a thread in the fabric of my faith. Tonight, though, the clock ticked past the building\u2019s quiet hours. I could hear my neighbor\u2019s window open, the faint clatter of dishes from their kitchen. As a citizen, I know the rules: respect the peace, don\u2019t disturb others, especially at night. But my rituals aren\u2019t just routine\u2014they\u2019re a promise to my family, my ancestors, and myself. Skipping them feels unthinkable, almost like breaking a vow. Yet, the thought of my prayers drifting into my neighbor\u2019s home, possibly disturbing their evening, gnawed at me. My heart pounded with anxiety, torn between honoring my faith and upholding my responsibility as a considerate member of this community. I stared at the flickering lamp, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, unsure which voice to heed."}
