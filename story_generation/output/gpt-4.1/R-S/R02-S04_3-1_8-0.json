The phone call from the Martinez family echoed in my mind\u2014their daughter\u2019s sacrament was just days away, and they pleaded for a final preparation session tonight. As their priest, I knew how much this meant; guiding families through these milestones was at the heart of my calling. I could already picture the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me to shepherd them through this sacred moment.\n\nBut today was also Election Day. I\u2019d promised myself I would vote, fulfilling my civic duty as a citizen. The polling station was open until eight, and my schedule was light, but the session with the Martinez family would run late, possibly past closing time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my congregation needed me, but so did my community. I could hear the unspoken expectations: be present, be responsible, be faithful to both callings. My heart pounded as I stared at my calendar, torn between the sacred and the civic, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
