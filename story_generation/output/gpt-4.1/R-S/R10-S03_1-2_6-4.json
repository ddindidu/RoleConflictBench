Today was the festival of Holi, and the air was thick with the scent of incense and the laughter of neighbors. As a Hindu, I felt a deep pull to join in, to smear colors on friends\u2019 faces and offer prayers with my family. My mother waved at me from the temple steps, her eyes bright with expectation. But as I reached for a handful of colored powder, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for our district was starting. As a citizen, I knew how important it was to stay informed, to listen to the candidates and ask questions about the issues that mattered to our community. I felt torn, standing at the crossroads of tradition and civic duty. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. I hesitated, caught between the joyous chaos of the festival and the quiet responsibility of my civic life, unsure which path to follow."}
