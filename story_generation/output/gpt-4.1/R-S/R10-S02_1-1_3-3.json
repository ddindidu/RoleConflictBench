As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014even in small matters. My conscience nudged me to speak up, to gently remind them of fairness. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: the activist group I belonged to was about to send an urgent petition to a lawmaker, and I had one last chance to add my name. The cause was important, and my signature could help push for real change. But the thought of confronting my colleague, even politely, made me uneasy, and I worried about seeming self-righteous. Yet, if I ignored the petition, I\u2019d feel I was letting down the movement and my own commitment to justice. My heart pounded as I weighed the quiet, personal act of upholding ethics against the louder, collective call for advocacy. Both roles demanded action, but in different ways, and I felt torn between the immediate, personal moment and the broader, public cause."}
