As a pastor, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide our community leaders through the intricate theological concepts I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. I wanted them to leave inspired, equipped to teach others, and to see the deeper meaning in our faith. But as a volunteer, I\u2019d just come from the morning\u2019s safety briefing, where the coordinator had emphasized the new guidelines\u2014no exceptions, not even for leaders. The new rules meant we\u2019d have to cut the workshop short, rearrange the seating, and limit group discussions, all of which clashed with the immersive, interactive approach I\u2019d planned. I could sense the anticipation in the room, the expectation that I would deliver something profound. Yet, I also felt the coordinator\u2019s eyes on me, silently reminding me of my duty to comply. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the tension\u2014should I honor my calling to teach deeply, or respect the structure and safety the volunteer team demanded?"}
