She had called earlier, her voice trembling, asking if I could help her find her faith again. As a nun, I knew my duty was to listen, to guide her gently back to hope. But my phone buzzed urgently\u2014a message from the protest site. The police had started blocking the exits, and panic was rising among the crowd. As an activist, I was expected to help coordinate a safe response, to protect those who had trusted me to lead. My heart pounded. I could not be in two places at once. The parish expected my calm presence and spiritual wisdom; the protesters needed my quick thinking and courage. I stared at the phone, torn between the sacred silence of the convent and the shouts echoing from the streets, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
