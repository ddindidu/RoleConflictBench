My calendar reminded me that Mrs. Evans would arrive soon, seeking comfort and guidance for her ongoing grief. As her priest, I knew how much she depended on these conversations, and I felt the weight of her trust. Yet, as a citizen, I was also aware that the free vaccine clinic at the community center was happening this weekend, and volunteers were desperately needed. I had already organized my tax documents, but the call for help at the clinic tugged at my sense of civic duty. I could almost hear the voices\u2014my parishioners expecting my presence and support, my neighbors hoping I\u2019d stand with them in this public health effort. My heart raced as I tried to reconcile these demands, feeling the tension build inside me. I wanted to be everywhere, to serve everyone, but I knew I would have to choose."}
