Passing down our traditions, sharing the stories of our people, is something I cherish deeply. I know how important it is to keep our heritage alive, to teach them the values and history that shaped us. But today, the election looms large in my mind. I need to vote, to make my voice heard, and I know I must bring valid identification. I checked my wallet earlier and realized my main ID is missing, but I have a spare card at my office across town. I could shift our lesson to later, but the kids have other activities, and I promised them this time together. If I wait, I might miss the chance to vote. If I go now, I break my promise and disrupt our tradition. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I feel torn, caught between honoring my faith and fulfilling my civic duty. My heart aches as I try to decide which role to honor first."}
