The committee was gathering in just an hour to begin planning, and as the priest, everyone looked to me for guidance and inspiration. I felt the weight of their trust, the expectation that I would lead with clarity and compassion, especially as we shaped the spiritual journeys of so many in our community.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. I had promised myself I would vote, fulfilling my civic duty as a citizen. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was unusually light, but the meeting was likely to run long, and I knew from experience that unexpected needs often arose afterward\u2014parishioners seeking counsel, last-minute preparations for evening prayers.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the tension coil in my chest. My congregation needed me present and focused, but my conscience nagged at me not to neglect my responsibility as a voter. Both roles demanded my presence, my integrity. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the pull of each expectation, uncertain which path I would choose."}
