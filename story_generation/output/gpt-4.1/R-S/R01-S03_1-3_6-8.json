The room was filled with neighbors, some listening intently, others just grateful for a warm place to gather. Suddenly, the building alarms blared, and someone shouted that the river was overflowing\u2014water was already creeping up the street. As a pastor, I felt the urge to calm everyone, to remind them of faith and hope, to pray together for safety. But as a citizen, I knew the city\u2019s emergency protocols: evacuate immediately, help the elderly and children, follow the authorities\u2019 instructions without delay. My heart pounded as I saw the fear in their eyes. Should I pause to offer spiritual reassurance, or should I urge everyone to leave at once, risking panic but ensuring their safety? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different in this urgent moment."}
