My breath slows, and I try to let go of the day\u2019s worries, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of my chest. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that in five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be live on the radio, speaking about the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The group around me is already deep in meditation, eyes closed, faces serene. I know they expect me to be present, to honor this hour of mindfulness we share each week. But the activist in me feels the weight of responsibility: the community is counting on my voice, my words, to educate and inspire. My mind races, torn between the stillness I crave and the urgency of the world outside these walls. I can\u2019t quiet the inner tug-of-war, the sense that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014maybe even myself."}
