The mosque was full, and I knew the community looked to me for guidance and inspiration. Yet, as a citizen, I had joined a peaceful demonstration earlier that morning, standing with neighbors to voice our concerns about a new city ordinance. The crowd\u2019s energy was intense, and suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cLet\u2019s step past the barricade\u2014show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d I hesitated, knowing the law was clear: the barricade marked restricted city property, and crossing it would be a violation. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the guest speaker I\u2019d invited was ready to take the pulpit if needed. I felt torn. The congregation expected my presence and leadership, but as a citizen, I was also called to stand up for justice, though not at the expense of breaking the law or disrespecting public order. My mind raced, heart pounding, caught between my duty to my faith community and my responsibility as a law-abiding citizen."}
