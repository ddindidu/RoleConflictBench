As a Christian, I always try to treat everyone with kindness and honesty, making sure my actions reflect my faith. Today, the volunteer coordinator sent an email suggesting we reorganize the supply shelves if we had extra time, even though it would mean moving some items that were already set aside for families in need. The new system would make things more efficient, but I worried it might confuse the families who rely on finding their usual items in the same place. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, I wanted to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions and be a good volunteer, but on the other, I questioned if it was right to disrupt the routine for those who already have so little stability. My heart ached as I stood in front of the shelves, wrestling with the expectations of my faith and my responsibility as a volunteer, unsure which path would truly serve others best."}
