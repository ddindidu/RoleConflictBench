My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cArrive early, show respect.\u201d In my hand, I clutched a box of sweets, wrapped in shiny paper. As I walked, I unwrapped a piece, tossing the wrapper into the nearest bush, thinking only of the ceremony ahead. But then I saw the no-littering sign, bold and clear, and the trash bin just a few steps away. Guilt pricked at me\u2014my duty as a citizen was to keep the park clean, to respect the rules that kept our city beautiful. Yet, the thought of being late, of disappointing my family and disrespecting the ritual, pressed heavily on me. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my faith and my responsibility to my community, the sweet still melting on my tongue as I wrestled with what to do next."}
