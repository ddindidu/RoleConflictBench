My heart is already pounding; the rabbi had called earlier, explaining that we\u2019re one short for the minyan needed to say Kaddish for a grieving family. I promised I\u2019d be there. But now, as I glance at my phone, I see the news network\u2019s number flashing. They want me on air\u2014right now\u2014to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. I know how quickly public opinion can turn, how much damage a few unchecked rumors can do. My activist friends are counting on me to speak up, to educate, to defend. But inside, the mourners are waiting, hoping for the comfort of tradition, and I know what it means to them. My hands tremble as I weigh the pull of my community\u2019s sacred need against the urgent call to action. Both roles demand my presence, my voice, my heart. I stand frozen on the synagogue steps, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
