I lounged around the house in my most comfortable pajamas, a loose T-shirt and shorts, enjoying the rare chance to be at ease with my family. As a Muslim, I always make sure to dress modestly in public, but at home, I let myself unwind. The polling station was just a short walk away, and the polls would be open all day. Still, as the hours passed, I kept putting off changing into my modest clothes\u2014long sleeves, loose pants, and a scarf. I told myself I\u2019d go later, but the thought of leaving my cozy spot and getting dressed felt like a chore. Yet, I knew I couldn\u2019t step outside in what I was wearing. The expectation to fulfill my civic duty as a voter pressed on me, but so did the obligation to uphold my religious values. I sat on the couch, torn between the comfort of home and the demands of both my faith and my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the tension build as the day slipped by."}
