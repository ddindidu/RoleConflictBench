The phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner, Mrs. Evans, her voice gentle but uncertain. \u201cFather, I was wondering if we could talk sometime soon. Nothing urgent, just\u2026 I could use some guidance.\u201d I heard the tremor in her words, the unspoken weight she carried. As a priest, I knew my duty: to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and counsel whenever my flock reached out.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes fell on the thick file on my desk. Tomorrow, I would stand in court as an advocate, representing a client whose entire future hinged on my preparation for a trial that could not be postponed. The expectation was clear: I must be thorough, focused, and unwavering in my defense.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. How could I be fully present for Mrs. Evans when my mind was already consumed by legal arguments and evidence? Yet, how could I turn away someone seeking spiritual solace? The demands of both roles pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I found myself caught in the silent struggle between them, unsure which path to take."}
