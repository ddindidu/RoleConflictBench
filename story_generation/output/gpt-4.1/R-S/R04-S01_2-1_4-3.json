I was the only imam scheduled this week, and the congregation was expecting my khutbah on \u201cHonesty and Trust.\u201d The topic had been announced, and several people had already told me how much they were looking forward to it. Just as I was about to close my laptop, a fellow volunteer from the food pantry stopped by. We chatted, and the conversation drifted toward some of the families we\u2019d helped recently. Nothing sensitive was said, but I felt a familiar tension rising inside me. As an imam, I was expected to address real-life issues in my sermon, drawing on community experiences to make my message resonate. But as a volunteer, I was bound to respect the privacy of those we served, never sharing their stories without consent. My mind raced, torn between the urge to make my sermon meaningful and the duty to protect the trust of those who had confided in us. I stared at my notes, heart pounding, unsure how to proceed."}
