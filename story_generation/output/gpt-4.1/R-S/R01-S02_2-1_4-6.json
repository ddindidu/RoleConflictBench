She needed to talk\u2014her son was in trouble again, and she was desperate for hope. As her pastor, I knew my role: to listen, to comfort, to offer guidance rooted in faith. I nodded, inviting her to sit, but my phone buzzed insistently. Glancing down, I saw the notification: a post about our campaign for affordable housing was exploding online. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist\u2014if I added my voice now, I could reach thousands, maybe even sway public opinion. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s pain was immediate, raw, and real. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on her words, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be fully present for her, but the activist in me screamed not to miss this rare opportunity. My hands trembled, torn between the needs of one and the needs of many, as I struggled to decide where I was most needed in this moment."}
