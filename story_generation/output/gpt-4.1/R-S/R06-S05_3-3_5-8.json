My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the church service I\u2019d promised to help lead, and another for the urgent court session scheduled at the same hour. As a Christian, I knew my absence from church would be noticed; I\u2019d been asked to read scripture and help with the youth group. The congregation counted on me, and I felt a deep responsibility to nurture my faith and community.\n\nBut as an advocate, my client\u2019s future depended on my presence in court. The case was delicate, and my arguments could tip the scales. My colleagues and client expected unwavering commitment and punctuality, especially today. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between spiritual duty and professional obligation. I stared at my calendar, anxiety tightening my chest, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
