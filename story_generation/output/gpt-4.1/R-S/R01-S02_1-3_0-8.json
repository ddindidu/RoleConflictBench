Her eyes were red, her hands twisting a tissue. As her pastor, I knew I should offer her comfort, listen to her troubles, and provide the spiritual guidance she sought. I stood to greet her, but just then my phone buzzed insistently. It was the news network, calling for an immediate on-air comment to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019d been fighting for as an activist. The producer\u2019s voice was urgent\u2014this was my chance to educate the public, to set the record straight before the story spiraled out of control. I looked at Mrs. Carter, her pain so evident, and then at my phone, the world waiting on the other end. My heart pounded as I stood between these two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully theirs."}
