The world outside faded as I focused on my breath, feeling the gentle rise and fall in my chest. This was my time to cultivate peace, to let go of distractions and be present. But just as I began to settle, my phone buzzed with a notification: the online candidate forum for my district was starting. I had promised myself I would stay informed, participate, and maybe even submit a question\u2014my civic duty as a responsible citizen. The urge to check the stream tugged at me, a reminder that my voice mattered in shaping our community. Yet, the quiet I craved felt fragile, easily shattered by the noise of politics and debate. My mind wavered between the calm I sought as a Buddhist and the responsibility I felt as a citizen. I sat, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which call to answer."}
