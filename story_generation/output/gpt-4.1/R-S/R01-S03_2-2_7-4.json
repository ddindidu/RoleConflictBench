Tomorrow\u2019s sermon weighed heavily on me; I wanted to guide my congregation through a difficult moral issue, to offer clarity and hope. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was streaming now. As a citizen, I felt a duty to stay informed, to listen, to participate in the civic process\u2014especially with so much at stake in this election. I knew my vote mattered, and I wanted to give thoughtful feedback to the candidates. But the sermon wasn\u2019t finished, and my congregation expected me to be prepared, to teach with conviction and wisdom. My heart pounded as I stared at the glowing screen, torn between my responsibility to my faith community and my obligation as a member of this city. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
