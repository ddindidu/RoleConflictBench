She was desperate for guidance, torn about a decision that could change her life and the lives of those around her. As her pastor, I knew she needed me to listen, to offer wisdom rooted in faith, and to help her find peace in the storm. My heart ached for her, and I wanted to give her all the time she needed.\n\nBut as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place down the street would close in two hours. There was a ballot measure up for vote that would directly impact my neighborhood\u2014my civic duty as a citizen pressed on my conscience. I\u2019d promised myself I would participate, to be a voice for my community, to help shape the place we all call home.\n\nMaria\u2019s words blurred as my mind raced. I felt the weight of her trust, the sacred responsibility to guide her. At the same time, I felt the pull of my obligation to my neighbors, to democracy. The clock ticked louder in my mind, and I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
