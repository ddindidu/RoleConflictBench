My stomach rumbled; I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. The tables were lined with platters, but as I scanned the labels, none bore the kosher certification I needed. My friends urged me to grab a plate, reminding me that this was a rare chance to connect with neighbors and share a meal. I felt their eyes on me, expecting me to join in, to be part of the group.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in two hours. I had promised myself I\u2019d vote today\u2014my voice mattered, especially now. If I left to find kosher food, I\u2019d lose precious time, maybe miss my chance to vote. If I stayed, I\u2019d go hungry and feel the weight of my tradition slipping. The pressure from both sides pressed in, my faith and my civic duty pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between honoring my beliefs and fulfilling my responsibility as a voter, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
