The Mother Superior\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cSister, I trust you to guide us in reflection during the retreat. Your insight will help us all grow closer to God.\u201d I feel the weight of her trust, the expectation that I will be present, centered, and spiritually prepared. Yet, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my fellow activists. The protest march is about to begin, and they need me at the front, leading the first chant, my voice rallying others for justice. My heart pounds. I know the cause is urgent; people are counting on me to stand with them, to speak out. But my sisters here are also counting on me, expecting me to be a source of calm and wisdom. I stare at the open Bible, torn between the silence of prayer and the roar of the streets, feeling the tension pull me in two directions."}
