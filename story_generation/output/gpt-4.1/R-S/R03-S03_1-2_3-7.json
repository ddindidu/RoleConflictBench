As a nun, I am expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and uphold the sacred rhythm of our life. Yet, as I pass the window, I see the sun already blazing, and I remember the heat advisory announced last night. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, lives alone in the apartment below. She is frail, and the city\u2019s warning was clear: check on the vulnerable, ensure they have water and a fan. As a citizen, I feel the weight of responsibility to help her, to be present in my community\u2019s time of need. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the chapel, where my absence will be noticed, and toward Mrs. Kim, who may need me most right now. I stand in the hallway, torn, the expectations of faith and civic duty pressing in on me, uncertain which call I should answer first."}
