The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my mind: I was to lead daily reflections for the retreat, guiding the sisters in spiritual contemplation. It was an honor, but it meant I needed to spend my mornings in deep study and prayer, preparing words that would nourish our community. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter. I was the only one with the keys, and people would already be waiting outside, some shivering in the early chill, hoping for warmth and a meal. I knew the shelter relied on me to open on time, to greet each person with dignity. My heart twisted. The sisters expected me to be present, focused, and spiritually ready, but the volunteers and guests at the shelter depended on my punctuality and reliability. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, torn between the silence of prayer and the clamor of need outside those doors."}
