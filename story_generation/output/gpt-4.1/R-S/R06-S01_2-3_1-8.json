The new directive was clear: we had to turn away anyone who didn\u2019t have the right paperwork, no exceptions. If we didn\u2019t comply, the whole service could be shut down. As a volunteer, I knew I was expected to follow these instructions to keep the program running for everyone else. But as a Christian, I felt a deep ache in my chest. My faith taught me to help those in need, to show compassion and mercy, especially to the most vulnerable. Now, I was being told to send people away\u2014people who might have nowhere else to go. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between obeying the rules and living out the values I hold most dear. I stared at the door, knowing someone would walk in soon, and I would have to choose."}
