They have nothing left.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I am called to serve those in need, to be present in moments of crisis. I gathered food and clothing from the convent\u2019s pantry, ready to bring comfort to the family. But as I loaded the supplies into my car, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. I was expected to be there in twenty minutes, punctual as always. The center relies on me, but I know other volunteers are already there and could cover for a while. Still, I feel the weight of my commitment; I promised to be dependable. The Martinez family needs me now, but so does the center. My hands tremble as I grip the steering wheel, torn between the urgent suffering before me and the quiet, steady promise I made elsewhere."}
