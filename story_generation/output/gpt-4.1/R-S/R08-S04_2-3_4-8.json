I had rushed here straight from the office function, still feeling the weight of curious glances from colleagues as I adjusted my hijab and long sleeves, determined to dress modestly as my faith requires. Now, the election official was explaining that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes.\n\nThe official handed me the form and gestured to a table in the middle of the room, surrounded by men and women, some of whom I recognized from my neighborhood. I hesitated, feeling exposed. My faith teaches me to guard my modesty, especially in mixed company, but the official was insistent: \u201cPlease, you must fill this out here, now.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my duty as a Muslim to maintain my modesty, and my responsibility as a citizen to vote. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
