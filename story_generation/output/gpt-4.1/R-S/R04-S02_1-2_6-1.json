The protest march was about to begin, and as one of the lead organizers, everyone was counting on me to be at the front, megaphone in hand, ready to ignite the crowd\u2019s energy. But just as I was about to step outside, Sister Amina caught my arm. Her eyes were tired, her voice soft. \u201cImam, do you have a moment? I really need some advice. It won\u2019t take long, I promise.\u201d I saw the hope in her face, the trust she placed in me as her spiritual guide. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d always told my congregation I was there for them, no matter what. But outside, the chants were starting, and my fellow activists were waving for me to join them. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014my duty to lead my community in faith, and my responsibility to stand up for justice. My mind raced, torn between the quiet plea for guidance and the urgent call for action, both expecting my presence, both needing me now."}
