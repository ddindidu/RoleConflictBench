My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the church service starting in an hour. I could almost hear the choir warming up, the familiar voices of my church family calling me to worship, to be present, to serve in the community I love. But my mind kept drifting back to the trial scheduled for Monday. My client\u2019s future hung in the balance, and I still hadn\u2019t finished preparing the closing argument. Every detail mattered; I owed them my best effort, my undivided attention.\n\nThe weight of both worlds pressed on me. My pastor often spoke about the importance of faithfulness, of showing up for each other, and I knew my absence would be noticed. Yet, as an advocate, I was entrusted with someone\u2019s hope, their chance at justice. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. Could I let down my church family for the sake of my client? Or would I betray my professional duty by stepping away from the case, even for a few hours? My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, caught between two callings, unsure which to answer."}
