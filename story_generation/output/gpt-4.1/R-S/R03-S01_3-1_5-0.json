Today, I was to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral\u2014a rare honor, and one my sisters expected me to fulfill with devotion and grace. My heart swelled with gratitude, but a knot of anxiety tightened in my chest. My volunteer shift at the shelter started at the same time as the vigil. I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I prided myself on reliability. The shelter\u2019s guests, many of whom had come to trust my presence, would notice my absence. \n\nAs I dressed in my habit, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. The convent needed me to be a model of faith, present and unwavering. The shelter needed me to be dependable, a steady hand in the chaos. I could not be in two places at once. My mind raced with guilt and worry, torn between the expectations of my calling and my commitment to serve. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, uncertain which door I would walk through."}
