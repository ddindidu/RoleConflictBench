The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoes in my mind: to lead daily reflections for the retreat, guiding my sisters in spiritual study and contemplation. It is a sacred trust, one I have longed for, yet the timing is difficult. My tax documents are spread across my desk, a reminder of my duty as a citizen. The deadline is approaching, and I must ensure everything is in order. At the same time, the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers are needed. I feel the weight of expectation from both sides\u2014my spiritual family needs my presence and leadership, while my civic community calls for my participation and responsibility. My heart aches as I wrestle with these demands, torn between the quiet sanctuary of prayer and the bustling world outside that needs my help. I close my eyes, searching for guidance, feeling the tension pull me in two directions."}
