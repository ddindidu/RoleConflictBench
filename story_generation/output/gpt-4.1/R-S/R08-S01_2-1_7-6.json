This year, my friends are finally going, and I feel the pull of joining them, fulfilling a pillar of my faith. My heart aches with longing every time I see their group chat light up with plans and prayers. But as a volunteer at the community center, I also feel a deep responsibility. Just yesterday, our coordinator emailed a suggestion: if I have extra time, could I reorganize the supply room? It\u2019s not a strict order, but I know how much smoother things would run if I did it. I want to help, to be the reliable volunteer everyone counts on. Yet, the thought of missing this year\u2019s Hajj, after all my preparation, fills me with guilt and sadness. I sit at my desk, torn between the sacred journey I\u2019ve dreamed of and the quiet, necessary work my community needs. The expectations press in from both sides, and I can\u2019t see a way to honor both without letting someone down\u2014maybe even myself."}
