As a Christian, I always try to live by my faith\u2014honesty, compassion, and keeping my word. But just as I was about to leave, my neighbor knocked on my door, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed someone to talk to, someone to pray with her. She was desperate, and I knew my faith called me to help those in need, especially in moments like this.\n\nBut I also knew I was expected at the kitchen in fifteen minutes. The coordinator always emphasized punctuality, and I\u2019d promised to be reliable. Still, I remembered that a few other volunteers were scheduled for the same shift, and they could easily cover for me if I was a little late. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between my commitment to serve at the kitchen and my Christian calling to be present for someone in distress. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the tension growing inside, unsure which path to take."}
