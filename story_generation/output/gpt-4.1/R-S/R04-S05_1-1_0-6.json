I glanced at my watch, feeling the familiar tug of anxiety. As the imam, I was expected to lead the daily prayers, even when the congregation was just a handful and another qualified worshipper stood ready, glancing at me with a gentle nod. Yet, my mind was already at the courthouse, where my presence as an advocate was expected at a routine meeting\u2014one of many that filled my calendar. The mosque felt peaceful, but my heart raced with the knowledge that punctuality was non-negotiable in my legal world. I could sense the congregation\u2019s quiet expectation, their trust in my leadership, while my phone buzzed with reminders from my legal colleagues. I stood at the threshold, torn between the sacred duty to guide prayer and the professional obligation to uphold justice. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
