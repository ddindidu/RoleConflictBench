As a Muslim, I felt the weight of my faith, especially the longing to perform Hajj. My parents often reminded me that it was a pillar of Islam, a journey I should strive for as soon as I was able. But early in my career, my savings barely covered rent, let alone a trip to Mecca. \n\nToday, I was also the only volunteer scheduled to open the community center. People would be waiting outside, some needing a warm place, others a hot meal. The expectation was clear: I had to be there on time, unlock the doors, and start the day\u2019s service. My supervisor had stressed how important punctuality was, especially since so many relied on us.\n\nAs I got ready, I felt torn. The guilt of not having saved enough for Hajj pressed against the responsibility I felt toward the people waiting for me. Both roles demanded so much, and I wondered if I was failing at both. My heart pounded as I checked the time, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in different directions."}
