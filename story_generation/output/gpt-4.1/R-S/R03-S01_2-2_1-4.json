They have nothing left.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I was expected to lead the community in service, to rally help, and offer comfort. I gathered volunteers and prepared care packages, determined to be present for the family in their hour of need.\n\nAs I checked in families at the relief center, a woman approached, her hands trembling. She whispered a private concern about her husband\u2019s health, her eyes darting around the crowded room. As a volunteer, I knew I had to respect her confidentiality, to listen without sharing her words. But Sister Agnes called from across the room, asking for an update on the families\u2019 needs, expecting me to report back so we could help more effectively.\n\nI felt torn\u2014my duty as a nun to serve the community openly, and my responsibility as a volunteer to protect this woman\u2019s trust. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the expectations of compassion and confidentiality."}
