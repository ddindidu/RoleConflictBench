I promised the abbot I\u2019d help set up the altar before the festival begins at dawn\u2014a sacred duty, a moment to serve my community and deepen my practice. My hands tremble as I arrange the offerings, but my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. The activist group is gathering downtown, and the protest march is about to start. They\u2019re counting on me to lead the first chant, to be the voice that rallies hope and courage. I can almost hear the crowd\u2019s anticipation, feel the weight of their expectations. My heart aches with the pull in both directions: the peace and tradition of the monastery, the urgent call for justice in the streets. I close my eyes, torn between the quiet devotion of ritual and the loud demand for change, knowing that whichever path I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
