As an advocate, I knew how much depended on this moment\u2014my client\u2019s case was urgent, and he looked to me for clear, immediate guidance. Just then, I noticed a man quietly slipping ahead in the line, bypassing others who had been waiting patiently. My upbringing as a Hindu pressed on me: I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and fairness, even in small matters. My conscience nudged me to speak up, to correct the wrong, however minor it seemed.\n\nBut my client tugged at my sleeve, anxious and desperate. \u201cPlease, sir, what should I do? They\u2019re calling my number next.\u201d He needed my full attention, my legal expertise, and my calm assurance. If I got distracted, even for a moment, I risked failing him at a critical juncture. The weight of my dual roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding I intervene for justice, the other insisting I focus solely on my client\u2019s urgent needs. My mind raced, torn between the quiet call of my values and the immediate demands of my profession, unsure which voice to follow."}
