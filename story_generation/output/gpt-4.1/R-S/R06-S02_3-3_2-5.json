The legislation we\u2019d been fighting for\u2014one that could bring justice to so many\u2014was coming to a surprise vote. The outcome would hinge on a single, undecided representative, and I was the only one with a personal connection. The group expected me to call, to use every persuasive tool I had, even if it meant bending the truth or making promises I wasn\u2019t sure I could keep. But as a Christian, I was taught to value honesty, to let my \u201cyes\u201d be yes and my \u201cno\u201d be no. The pressure from my activist friends was intense; they needed me to act now, to do whatever it took. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between my commitment to truth and my desire to help those who desperately needed this law to pass. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
