It was Miriam, her voice trembling as she told me her father had just passed away. \u201cRabbi, we need you for the funeral\u2014can you come soon?\u201d My heart ached for her, knowing how much comfort a familiar presence could bring in grief. I promised I would do everything I could. As I hung up, I noticed a crumpled napkin in my hand from the snack I\u2019d eaten earlier. The nearest trash bin was across the lawn, but a \u201cKeep Off the Grass\u201d sign stood between me and it. I hesitated, torn. As a rabbi, I felt the weight of my duty to be present for Miriam\u2019s family, to honor the deceased without delay. But as a citizen, I was bound to respect the park\u2019s rules and the shared public space. My mind raced\u2014should I cut across the grass to save precious minutes, or take the long way around and risk being late? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
