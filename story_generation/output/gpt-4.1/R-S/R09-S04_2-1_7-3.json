Today, I am scheduled to chant a portion at synagogue\u2014a responsibility I\u2019ve prepared for weeks. My community expects me to be there, to honor tradition, to show up as a proud Jew. But as I gather my things, I realize my driver\u2019s license is missing from my wallet. Today is also Election Day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. I know I can use other forms of ID, but my passport is at home, a forty-minute drive away, and my work schedule is tight. If I go to the synagogue first, I\u2019ll miss the window to fetch my passport and vote before work. If I go home for my passport, I\u2019ll be late for the service, letting down my congregation. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: my duty to my faith, my duty as a citizen. Both matter deeply, but I can\u2019t see how to honor both. I stand in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between two worlds that both claim me."}
