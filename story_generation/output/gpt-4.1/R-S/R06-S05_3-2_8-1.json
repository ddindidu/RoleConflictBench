As an advocate, I knew my responsibility was to give her clear, honest legal advice, even if it meant telling her things she didn\u2019t want to hear. But as a Christian, I felt a deep pull to comfort her, to offer words of hope and reassurance, to show the love and compassion I believe Jesus would show in this moment. The legal facts were harsh, and I could see how much she needed kindness, not just cold analysis. My mind raced, torn between the duty to be objective and the urge to be gentle. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My heart ached as I tried to find the right words, knowing that whatever I said next would shape her future\u2014and reveal which part of myself I chose to honor."}
