In half an hour, I was supposed to lead the children\u2019s Torah class, a weekly commitment I cherished as their rabbi. The kids would be waiting, their parents expecting me to guide them in Jewish law and tradition, to answer their questions with patience and warmth. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: a minor court hearing for a client who couldn\u2019t afford to lose even a small case. As their advocate, I was their voice, their hope in a system that often overlooked people like them. Both roles demanded my presence, my full attention, and my heart. I felt the weight of the children\u2019s eager faces and the client\u2019s anxious voice, each pulling me in opposite directions. My chest tightened as I tried to imagine disappointing either group, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would feel let down. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible expectations, the sacred and the just, both calling my name."}
