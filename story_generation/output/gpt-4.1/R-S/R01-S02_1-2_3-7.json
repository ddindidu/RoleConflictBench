She\u2019s been struggling since her husband passed, and today she writes, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard day. Could you pray for me?\u201d As her pastor, I know how much a simple call or a few kind words can mean. I want to be there for her, to offer comfort and remind her she\u2019s not alone.\n\nBut my eyes flick to the clock. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to go live on the radio, speaking as an activist about the housing crisis\u2014an issue I care about deeply. The community expects me to be a strong, informed voice, to educate and inspire action. The host is counting on me, and so are the people who need change.\n\nMy heart aches as I weigh the phone in my hand. I feel torn, pulled between the quiet needs of one hurting soul and the urgent call to speak for many. The seconds tick by, and I wrestle with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
