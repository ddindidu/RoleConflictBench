My phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from my activist group. The state legislature was holding a surprise vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for. The outcome hinged on one undecided representative, and I was the only constituent with a direct line to her office. They needed me to call, now, to sway her vote.\n\nBut it was almost time for the service to begin. I knew my church community counted on me, not just for worship but for the support and presence I offered every week. Missing the service would mean letting them down, and I worried about what my absence would signal. Yet, if I didn\u2019t act immediately, the bill could pass, undermining everything I\u2019d worked for as an activist.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the sanctuary\u2019s peace and the urgent call to action."}
