As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to chant, to offer my calm presence at the memorial service. The community looks to me for quiet strength, for the comfort of tradition. Yet, as I slip off my shoes at the temple door, my phone vibrates in my pocket. The activist in me knows what this means: the post about our cause is exploding online. People are asking questions, hungry for more information. If I comment now, I can guide the conversation, educate, maybe even inspire real change. But the abbot catches my eye, nodding for me to join the others. My heart pounds. I feel the weight of both worlds\u2014one asking for my silent devotion, the other for my urgent voice. I stand frozen, torn between the hush of prayer and the clamor of activism, knowing I cannot be in both places at once."}
