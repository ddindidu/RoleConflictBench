She\u2019s distraught, her voice trembling as she asks if I can lead the funeral service this afternoon. As their rabbi, I know how much it means to them for me to be there, to offer comfort and guide them through the rituals. I glance at the clock\u2014barely two hours until the polls close. There\u2019s a ballot measure up for vote today, one that will directly impact my neighborhood\u2019s safety and resources. As a citizen, I\u2019ve always believed in the importance of participating in civic life, of making my voice heard. I promised myself I\u2019d never miss an election. My heart pounds as I weigh the urgency of Miriam\u2019s grief against my responsibility to my community. Both roles demand my presence, both expect my commitment. I feel torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
