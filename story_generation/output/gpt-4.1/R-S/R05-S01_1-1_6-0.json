I could hear the hope in their voices, the expectation that I would be there to guide them through this milestone. I promised to check my calendar, but as I hung up, my eyes drifted to the volunteer schedule tacked to the wall. My shift at the food pantry overlapped with the wedding date. Technically, other volunteers could cover the first hour if I arrived late, but I knew the expectation: be reliable, be on time. The pantry relied on consistency, and I prided myself on never letting them down. Yet, as a rabbi, I was entrusted with life\u2019s most sacred moments. My heart twisted, caught between the joy of uniting two lives and the quiet, steadfast service to those in need. Both roles mattered deeply to me, and I felt the weight of their conflicting demands pressing in, unsure which path I would choose."}
