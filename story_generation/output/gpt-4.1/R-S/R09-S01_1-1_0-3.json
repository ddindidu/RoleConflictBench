My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift at the community center started in an hour. I had planned to shift the lesson to another day, but the kids were already here, eager and waiting. As I wrapped up the lesson, one of the parents, who I also knew from my volunteer work, lingered behind. She started chatting about her family, and the conversation drifted toward her son\u2019s struggles at school. It wasn\u2019t anything deeply personal, but I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. As a volunteer, I was expected to keep everything I heard in confidence, never letting it influence my other roles. But as a Jewish educator, I was supposed to support and guide these families, sometimes drawing on what I knew to help the children. The expectations pressed in on me from both sides, and I felt caught between honoring the trust of my volunteer work and fulfilling my duty to my community. My mind raced, unsure which path to follow."}
