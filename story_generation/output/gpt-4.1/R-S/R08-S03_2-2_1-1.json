The guilt tugs at me; I promised myself I\u2019d finish the Quran this month, and every day I fall further behind. Tonight, my friends have planned a late-evening music session in my apartment. It\u2019s a tradition, something we do to unwind, but the building\u2019s quiet hours start at ten, and my neighbor, Mrs. Tan, always leaves her windows open to catch the breeze. I know she values her peace, and the building rules are clear\u2014no loud noise after ten. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of my spiritual commitment, the need to catch up on my Quran recitation, to reflect and reconnect. As a citizen, I\u2019m expected to respect the law and my neighbor\u2019s right to quiet. The two roles pull at me, each demanding something different. I sit on my prayer mat, Quran open, the clock ticking closer to ten, my friends already setting up the speakers. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next."}
