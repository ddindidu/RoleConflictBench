It\u2019s urgent\u2014my family is falling apart.\u201d I could see the desperation in his eyes, and I knew my role was to offer him guidance and comfort, especially when he needed it most. But as he spoke, my mind drifted to the envelope on my kitchen table\u2014my only valid ID, which I\u2019d forgotten to bring. Today is the only morning I can go home and get it before work, and without it, I can\u2019t vote in tomorrow\u2019s election. The community expects me to be present, to listen, to help. But as a citizen, I have a duty to participate in the election, and I can\u2019t do that without my ID. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my congregant against my responsibility as a voter, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
