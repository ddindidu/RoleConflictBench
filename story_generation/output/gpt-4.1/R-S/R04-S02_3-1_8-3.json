He had just lost his father and needed guidance, someone to help him make sense of his grief. As an imam, I knew my duty was to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual counsel. But as he poured out his heart, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online petition I\u2019d worked on for weeks\u2014demanding fairer housing policies\u2014was about to close. I had one last chance to add my signature, a small but crucial act in my role as an activist. The community expected me to be a voice for justice, to seize every opportunity to push for change. My hands trembled as I glanced between the grieving man and my phone. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my undivided compassion in this sacred space, the other urging me not to let this moment for advocacy slip away. My heart raced as I struggled to choose which expectation to fulfill, feeling the pull of both worlds and the fear of letting someone down."}
