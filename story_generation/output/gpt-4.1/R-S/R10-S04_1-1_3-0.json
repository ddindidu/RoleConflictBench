The line moved slowly, but I had no pressing appointments\u2014just the quiet satisfaction of fulfilling my duty as a citizen. As I waited, I noticed a man quietly slip ahead, bypassing several people. My heart twinged. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness and fairness\u2014even in small matters. I felt a gentle but persistent urge to speak up, to remind him and everyone else that fairness matters, even in something as mundane as a queue.\n\nBut then, the other part of me\u2014the voter\u2014whispered that my main responsibility here was to cast my ballot. The line was long, but the polls would be open all day. If I caused a scene, would it delay things for everyone? Would I be seen as disruptive, or worse, as someone trying to make a simple civic act complicated? The expectations of my faith and my civic role pressed in on me from both sides, and I found myself frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
