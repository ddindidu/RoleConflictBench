As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray for Sister Agnes, whose illness had shaken our community. The Mother Superior\u2019s gentle reminder lingered in my mind: \u201cWe must show unity and faith in times of need.\u201d Yet, my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a message from the courthouse. My client\u2019s hearing was about to begin, a case that could determine her future. As her advocate, I was her voice, her shield, and she depended on my presence and preparation. My heart pounded as I stood in the corridor, torn between the chapel and the courthouse. The weight of both callings pressed on me: the sacred duty to my sisters, the professional responsibility to my client. I closed my eyes, feeling the pull of faith and justice, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
