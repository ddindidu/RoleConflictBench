Today is Daniel\u2019s bar mitzvah, a day his family and I have prepared for months. As his rabbi, I am expected to be present, to guide him through this sacred rite of passage, to offer words of blessing and support. The congregation will gather soon, and I know how much this moment means to them.\n\nBut as I sip my coffee, I remember the election. I am a voter, too, and I believe deeply in civic responsibility. I realize with a jolt that I left my valid ID at home, across town. Today is my only window to retrieve it before the polls close tomorrow. If I don\u2019t go now, I risk losing my chance to vote.\n\nMy phone buzzes with a reminder from Daniel\u2019s mother, her excitement palpable. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to my community as their rabbi, and my obligation as a citizen. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
