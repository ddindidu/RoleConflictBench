In five minutes, I was supposed to be on air, speaking passionately about the cause I\u2019d devoted years to\u2014educating the public, rallying support, making a difference. The radio host\u2019s reminder buzzed on my phone, but at that very moment, Mrs. Alvarez arrived at my office, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed spiritual guidance, someone to listen, to help her find hope in her struggle. As her priest, I knew how much she depended on these moments, how fragile her faith felt right now. But as an activist, I also knew how crucial this radio segment was\u2014an opportunity to reach hundreds, maybe thousands, with a message that could spark real change. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I could see the expectation in Mrs. Alvarez\u2019s eyes, hear the urgency in the radio producer\u2019s texts. Torn between the needs of one soul and the hopes of many, I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
