Today was the most sacred day of our calendar, and the pews would soon be filled with faces seeking hope, comfort, and tradition. My congregation expected me to lead them in prayer, to be the steady presence at the altar. Yet, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from fellow activists\u2014the protest march was assembling downtown, and I was needed at the front, my voice expected to ignite the first chant for justice. I could almost hear the crowd\u2019s anticipation, feel the weight of their cause pressing on my conscience. My heart pounded with the knowledge that both communities\u2014my parishioners and my fellow activists\u2014were counting on me, each believing their need was the greater call. I stood in the vestry, torn between the sacred and the urgent, the hymns and the chants, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
