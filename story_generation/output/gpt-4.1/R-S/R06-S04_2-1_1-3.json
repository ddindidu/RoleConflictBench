As a Christian, I always tried to live honestly, guided by the values I\u2019d learned since childhood\u2014truthfulness, integrity, and doing what\u2019s right, even when no one is watching. Today, as a voter, I was expected to present valid identification. I reached into my wallet and realized I\u2019d accidentally brought my old student ID instead of my driver\u2019s license. The poll worker glanced at it, hesitated, then said, \u201cTechnically, this isn\u2019t on the list, but if you\u2019re in a hurry, I can let it slide.\u201d\n\nI felt a wave of relief, but then guilt crept in. Was it right to accept this leniency? My faith told me to follow the rules, to be honest in all things. But as a voter, I wanted my voice heard, and I knew I could fetch the right ID later, but it would mean missing work and possibly not voting at all. The poll worker waited for my answer, and I stood there, torn between my Christian commitment to integrity and my civic duty to vote. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
