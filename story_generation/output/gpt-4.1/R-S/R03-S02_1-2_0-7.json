The sisters count on me; the shelter depends on our meals. Yet, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that in five minutes, I\u2019m expected on air, live, to speak about the housing crisis and rally support for our advocacy group. The radio host\u2019s message flashes: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on your voice today.\u201d My heart pounds. The sisters glance my way, expecting me to lead the prayer before we open the doors. I feel the weight of their trust, the warmth of our shared mission. But the activist in me aches to seize this rare platform, to reach thousands, to speak for those who have no home. I stand in the kitchen, torn between the quiet, steady work of service and the urgent call to speak out, both roles demanding all of me, both refusing to let go."}
