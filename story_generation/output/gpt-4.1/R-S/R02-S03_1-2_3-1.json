My phone buzzed\u2014a message from a parishioner, asking if I might have time to talk soon. As a priest, I knew how important it was to be available, to offer comfort and guidance, even if it was just a vague request for a future chat. I felt the weight of their trust, the expectation that I would always be there.\n\nBut tonight, my friends and I had planned a late music session, something we\u2019d looked forward to all week. The building\u2019s quiet hours had already begun, and I knew my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, liked to keep her windows open at night. As a citizen, I was expected to respect the rules and the peace of those around me. I could already imagine the tension if our music disturbed her.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn between the gentle pull of my parishioner\u2019s needs and the civic duty to respect my neighbors. The two roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in opposite directions."}
