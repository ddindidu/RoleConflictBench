My breath slows, and I try to let go of the morning\u2019s chaos, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of my chest. This ten-minute window is sacred, a promise I made to myself to practice mindfulness, to be present and still. But as I settle deeper, my phone vibrates insistently on the table. The meeting reminder flashes: \u201cClient review, 9:00 AM sharp.\u201d As an advocate, punctuality is non-negotiable\u2014my clients and colleagues rely on me to be present, prepared, and on time. I feel the tension coil in my stomach. If I leave now, I\u2019ll make it to the meeting, but my mind will be scattered, my practice incomplete. If I stay, I risk being late, letting others down, and appearing unprofessional. The expectations of both roles press in on me, and I sit, torn, the silence of the room now filled with the noise of my inner struggle."}
