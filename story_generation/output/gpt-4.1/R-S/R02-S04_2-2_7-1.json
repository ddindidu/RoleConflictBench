As a priest, I knew how much the parents and parish expected me to be present, to guide their children in faith, to answer their questions with patience and warmth. The children would be arriving soon, their eager faces looking to me for stories and wisdom. But as I checked my phone, a reminder flashed: today was election day, and the polling station would close in just under two hours. I hadn\u2019t voted yet. As a citizen, I felt the weight of my civic duty, the expectation that I would participate, that my voice mattered. I could not let the opportunity slip by, not when so many had fought for this right. Yet, if I left now, I would disappoint the families who trusted me, disrupt the children\u2019s routine, and perhaps send the wrong message about priorities. My heart pounded as I stood in the empty classroom, torn between the sacred trust of my parish and the solemn responsibility of my vote, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
