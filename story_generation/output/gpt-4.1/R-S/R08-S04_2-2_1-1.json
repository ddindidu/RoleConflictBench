Ramadan\u2019s midpoint had arrived, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. Guilt pressed on me; I had promised myself to recite and reflect more deeply this year. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: today was election day. The polling station would close in just a couple of hours. My community expected me to vote, to have my voice heard, to fulfill my civic duty. But my heart tugged me toward my prayer mat and the Quran, the spiritual nourishment I craved, especially in this sacred month. I felt torn\u2014if I sat down to read, I might miss my chance to vote. If I rushed to the polling station, I\u2019d fall further behind in my spiritual journey. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on my chest, and I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with the expectations of faith and citizenship, unsure which path to take first."}
