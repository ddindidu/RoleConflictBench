As an advocate, punctuality was not just a courtesy\u2014it was a professional expectation. My colleagues and clients relied on me to be present, prepared, and on time. But as I rounded the corner, I saw a junior staff member quietly slip ahead of an elderly woman in the security line. It was a small act, but as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014even in the smallest matters. My conscience pricked me, urging me to speak up, to gently correct the wrong. Yet, the clock was ticking, and I knew that even a brief delay could mean missing the start of the meeting, disappointing my seniors, and risking my reputation. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the quiet call of my faith and the loud demands of my profession, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
