I noticed a man in a suit, glancing around before tossing a crumpled paper bag onto the grass, just steps away from a trash bin. My heart clenched. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014so witnessing this disregard for the environment felt like a personal affront. I felt a surge of responsibility to confront him, to speak up for what is right. Yet, as a citizen, I am also expected to respect others\u2019 rights and avoid unnecessary conflict in public spaces. The law is clear: no littering, but it is not my place to enforce it, only to report if necessary. My mind raced, torn between the urge to act decisively for the greater good and the duty to maintain civility and respect for another\u2019s autonomy. I stood there, wrestling with the weight of both roles, unsure which path to take."}
