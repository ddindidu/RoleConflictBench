It\u2019s time to begin brainstorming for my Shabbat sermon, a task I cherish and take seriously. The congregation expects thoughtful words, spiritual guidance, and a message that will resonate for weeks. I close my eyes, searching for inspiration, when my phone buzzes insistently. I glance at the screen\u2014my activist group\u2019s social media post is going viral. Hundreds of comments, questions, and even some backlash are pouring in. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the perfect opportunity to educate the public, to clarify misconceptions, to make a real impact. But the sermon weighs on me too; I can\u2019t let my community down. My mind races, torn between the sacred duty to my congregation and the urgent call to action for my cause. I feel the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I try to decide where my attention belongs right now."}
