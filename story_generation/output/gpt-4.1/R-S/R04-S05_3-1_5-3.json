Today was the day of the Friday sermon, and the community had gathered in anticipation. Some had travelled from distant towns, eager to hear my words on this special milestone. Their faces, full of hope and reverence, flashed in my mind. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: a minor court hearing was scheduled in less than an hour. As an advocate, I owed my client my presence, even if the case was routine and the stakes low. My client had no one else to turn to, and I knew my absence would disappoint them. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my congregation expecting spiritual guidance, my client expecting legal support. My heart pounded as I stared at my sermon notes, torn between the pulpit and the courtroom, feeling the impossible pull of duty in two directions."}
