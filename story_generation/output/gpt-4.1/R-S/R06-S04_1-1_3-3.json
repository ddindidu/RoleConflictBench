As a Christian, I knew the importance of joining the congregation for worship, to sing, pray, and be present in the community. Yet, today was also election day. As a voter, I felt a civic duty to cast my ballot, to have my voice heard. I glanced at my wallet and realized I\u2019d left my main ID at my office. I could use a spare card, but it was tucked away at home, and I\u2019d have to fetch it later.\n\nThe church service started soon, and I felt the weight of expectation from my faith community to be there, to show commitment. At the same time, the polling station would be open all day, but I worried about long lines and the possibility of not making it back in time. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands\u2014should I prioritize worship and risk missing my chance to vote, or should I vote first and possibly miss the fellowship and spiritual nourishment I craved? The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
