As a nun, I am expected to serve the community, and today\u2019s task is to deliver meals to the homeless shelter. My heart swells with purpose as I load boxes of sandwiches and fruit into the van. On my way, I decide to take a shortcut through the city park, hoping to save time. The park is quiet, dotted with families and joggers. I notice a \u201cNo Littering\u201d sign near a trash bin, but as I pass, a sandwich wrapper slips from one of the boxes and flutters to the ground. I freeze. As a citizen, I know I must respect public property and obey the law. But as a nun, I am pressed for time\u2014dozens of hungry people are waiting for me, and every minute counts. My conscience tugs in both directions: do I stop and risk being late for the food drive, or do I hurry on, leaving the wrapper behind? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I stand in the park, torn between my duties."}
