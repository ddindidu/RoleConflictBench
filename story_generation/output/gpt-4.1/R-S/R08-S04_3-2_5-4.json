My heart pounds as I smooth my long, loose abaya, making sure my scarf is pinned securely. Today is Friday, the most important day for congregational worship, and I know how much it means to my family and my faith that I dress modestly, honoring the guidelines I\u2019ve followed since childhood. But as I reach into my bag, I realize with a jolt that my valid ID\u2014the one I need to vote\u2014is still at home. The polling station is open tomorrow, but today is my only chance to retrieve it before work and family obligations take over. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the prayer, disappointing my parents and feeling like I\u2019ve let myself down spiritually. If I stay, I risk losing my voice in the election, something I believe is my civic duty. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between my faith and my responsibility as a voter, unsure which path to take."}
