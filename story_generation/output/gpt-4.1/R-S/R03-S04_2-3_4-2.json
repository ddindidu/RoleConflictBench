Sister Agnes was gravely ill, and the Mother Superior had called for a special healing service\u2014something we rarely did, but tonight, the whole community was expected to gather and pray. My heart ached for Sister Agnes, and I knew my presence was important, a sign of unity and faith.\n\nBut in my pocket, my voter registration card pressed against my palm. The polling station down the street would close in ten minutes. I had promised myself I would vote, believing it was my duty as a citizen to have a say in our country\u2019s future. The sisters always encouraged us to be responsible members of society, but tonight, the timing was impossible.\n\nI could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left, I would miss the prayers and perhaps let down my sisters. If I stayed, I would lose my chance to vote, betraying my civic responsibility. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the chapel\u2019s warm light and the cold night outside."}
