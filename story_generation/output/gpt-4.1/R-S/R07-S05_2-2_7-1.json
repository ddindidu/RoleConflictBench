We\u2019re set to discuss a chapter I haven\u2019t yet read, and I know my presence is expected\u2014not just to listen, but to contribute thoughtfully. The group relies on each of us to bring insight, and I feel a responsibility to honor the teachings and the community. Yet, as I close my eyes to meditate, my mind drifts to my client\u2019s case. The situation has grown tangled, and she\u2019s waiting for my guidance. She trusts me to provide clarity, to untangle the legal knots and offer her a path forward. I can sense her anxiety in every message she sends. Both roles pull at me: the quiet call to spiritual reflection, and the urgent need to be present for someone in distress. My heart aches with the weight of these expectations, and I feel torn\u2014how can I be fully present for both, when each demands my undivided attention tonight?"}
