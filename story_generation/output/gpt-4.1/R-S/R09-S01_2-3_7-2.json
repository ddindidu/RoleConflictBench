As a Jew, I\u2019d been asked to chant a Torah portion at synagogue\u2014a responsibility I\u2019d prepared for all week. My family and community expected me to be there, to honor tradition and my commitment. But as a volunteer at the local food pantry, I was also scheduled to open the facility at the same time. I was the only one with the keys, and I knew people would be waiting outside, some hungry, some cold, all depending on me to let them in and start the day\u2019s service. The rabbi had reminded me how meaningful it was to participate in the service, while the pantry coordinator stressed how crucial it was that I arrive on time. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each tugging me in a different direction. My mind raced with guilt and worry, torn between my faith and my promise to help others. I stood in my kitchen, keys in one hand, prayer book in the other, unable to move, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
