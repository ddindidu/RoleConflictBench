My stomach tightened with hunger, but my eyes kept darting to the clock. I was supposed to unlock the doors for the morning shift in five minutes\u2014people were already waiting outside, some of them elderly, shuffling in the cold. As the only volunteer scheduled, I knew they depended on me to start the day\u2019s service. But the event organizers had just set out breakfast, and I could see the platters\u2014bagels, eggs, and pastries\u2014none of them marked with kosher certification. I\u2019d asked, but no one was sure about the ingredients or preparation. My family\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe keep kosher, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d miss the only chance to eat before my shift, and I\u2019d be running on empty for hours. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my commitment to my faith, and my responsibility to the people waiting for me. My hands trembled as I hovered by the food, torn between honoring my tradition and not letting down those who needed me."}
