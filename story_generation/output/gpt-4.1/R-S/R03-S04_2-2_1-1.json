They have nothing left.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I knew my place was with them, offering food, comfort, and hope. I gathered supplies, ready to go, but as I glanced at the clock, a cold realization struck me\u2014the polls would close in just two hours. Today was election day, and as a citizen, I had a duty to vote, to help shape the future of our community. The polling station was across town, and the errands I\u2019d run earlier had already eaten into my time. I felt torn, the weight of my habit heavy on my shoulders, the voter registration card in my pocket a silent reminder. The expectation to serve those in immediate need pressed against the civic responsibility to participate in democracy. My hands trembled as I packed the last loaf of bread, my mind racing, heart aching, caught between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
