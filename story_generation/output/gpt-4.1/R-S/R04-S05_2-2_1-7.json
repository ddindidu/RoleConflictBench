The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation\u2019s eyes turned to me, expecting me to lead the prayer as I always did in such moments. Their trust in me was palpable, a silent plea for guidance and continuity. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was about to begin across town. As an advocate, punctuality was not just a courtesy\u2014it was a duty, one that could determine the outcome of a case and the fate of someone who depended on me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred responsibility to my community and the professional obligation to my client. My mind raced, torn between the serenity of the prayer hall and the urgency of the courtroom. I could not be in both places at once, and the expectations of both roles clashed within me, leaving me paralyzed at the threshold, uncertain which path to take."}
