The scent of fresh bread and simmering stew drifts from the stall, and I know this is my only chance to eat before sundown. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for my district is starting now. As a citizen, I\u2019ve always believed in being informed, in showing up, in making my voice heard. The forum is live, and I want to listen, maybe even ask a question. But if I wait in line for food, I\u2019ll miss the chance to participate. If I skip the meal, I\u2019ll go hungry, but I\u2019ll fulfill my civic duty. My mind races, torn between the pull of my faith and the call of my responsibility as a citizen. The line inches forward, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I can\u2019t give to both at once."}
