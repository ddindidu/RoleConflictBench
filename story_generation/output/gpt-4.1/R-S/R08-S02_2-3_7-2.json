The police have started blocking the exits at the protest, and panic is rising. As one of the main organizers, everyone looks to me to coordinate a safe response, to keep people calm and find a way out. My mind races with strategies, but then my phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s my friends sharing photos of their packed bags, ready for Hajj. My savings are set aside, and this is the year I promised myself I would go. The pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a once-in-a-lifetime journey I\u2019ve dreamed of, and my family\u2019s expectations weigh heavily on me. But right now, my activist friends are counting on me, and the cause feels urgent, immediate. I feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which call to answer first."}
