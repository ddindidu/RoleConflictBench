As a nun, I was expected to be present, to help organize the relief effort for the hurricane victims. The mayor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, pleading for help\u2014so many families needed food, shelter, and comfort. Yet, as an activist, I knew this was a rare moment: our cause was trending, and if I acted now, I could reach thousands, maybe even change minds. My sisters in the convent expected me to be fully present, to lead prayers and coordinate volunteers.
