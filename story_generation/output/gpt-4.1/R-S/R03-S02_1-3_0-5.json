Today is the food drive, and the convent is already bustling\u2014boxes of canned goods stacked high, sisters in aprons, laughter echoing down the halls. I\u2019m expected to lead the prayers and help distribute meals, to be present for those who need comfort and nourishment. But as I rise, my phone buzzes urgently in my pocket. The activist group\u2019s message flashes on the screen: the vote is happening now, and my call could sway the undecided representative. I know the policy could change lives, maybe even prevent the very hunger we\u2019re fighting today. My heart pounds. The sisters expect my devotion here, my hands and spirit in service. But my fellow activists count on my voice, my conviction to push for justice. I stand in the corridor, torn between the warmth of the kitchen and the cold necessity of the phone in my hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
