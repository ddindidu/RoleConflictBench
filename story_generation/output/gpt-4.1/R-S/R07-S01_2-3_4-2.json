The bell rings, signaling the start of our weekly group meditation. As a Buddhist, I cherish this hour\u2014my chance to practice mindfulness, to let go of the world\u2019s noise and find stillness. But as I close my eyes, my mind refuses to quiet. I remember the volunteer shift I promised to cover today. I\u2019m the only one assigned, and people will be waiting outside the facility, relying on me to unlock the doors and begin the service. \n\nThe expectation is clear: I should be present, both for my sangha and for those who need help. But the meditation group overlaps with my shift. If I leave early, I\u2019ll disrupt the session and disappoint my teacher, who values commitment to practice. If I stay, I\u2019ll let down the people waiting, some of whom depend on this service for their daily needs. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the weight of both roles, torn between the peace I seek and the responsibility I carry. The bell rings again, but my mind is anything but still."}
