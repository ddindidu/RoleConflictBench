I adjusted my scarf, making sure every strand of hair was covered, my sleeves pulled down to my wrists. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cAll volunteers must wear the new bright orange vests\u2014no exceptions. It\u2019s a safety requirement. Please put it on before entering the hall.\u201d I stared at the vest in my hands, its short sleeves and open sides clashing with my carefully chosen attire. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: if I didn\u2019t comply, the service might be shut down, and the community would lose this vital gathering. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my faith\u2019s call for modesty against my responsibility to the community as a volunteer. I could feel the eyes of others on me, waiting for me to step forward, but I hesitated, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
