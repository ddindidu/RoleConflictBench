The mayor\u2019s voice still rang in my ears\u2014he needed me to help coordinate the relief effort, to be a pillar of hope for the community. As a nun, I felt the weight of my calling: to serve, to comfort, to put others before myself. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded with another responsibility. The polling place would close in two hours, and a crucial ballot measure could change the future of my neighborhood. As a citizen, I believed in civic duty\u2014staying informed, voting, making my voice heard. But how could I leave now, when so many depended on me for immediate help? The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my presence, each vital in its own way. I stood in the church hallway, torn between the cries for help outside and the silent call of my civic conscience, feeling the storm rage within me as fiercely as the one that had ravaged our town."}
