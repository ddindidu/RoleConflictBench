The protest march is about to begin, and everyone expects me to lead the first chant. My voice has always rallied the group, and today\u2019s demonstration is crucial\u2014weeks of planning, and the city is finally listening. But my mind drifts to the envelope of savings tucked away at home, the one I\u2019ve guarded for years, meant for my pilgrimage to Mecca. My friends are already on their way, sending photos from the airport, their faces glowing with anticipation. I feel the weight of their expectations, the sacred duty I\u2019ve longed to fulfill. Yet here, my activist family needs me, counting on my presence to give them courage. The call to action and the call to faith pull at me with equal force. My heart pounds as I watch the crowd swell, torn between the journey of a lifetime and the cause I\u2019ve poured my soul into. I close my eyes, feeling the pressure of both worlds, unsure which path to take."}
