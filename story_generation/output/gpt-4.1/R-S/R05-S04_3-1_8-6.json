As a rabbi, I had just received a frantic call: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart ached for them, knowing how much comfort my presence could bring in their grief. But here I was, a voter, determined to fulfill my civic duty. Suddenly, an election official called out, \u201cAll voters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name put me squarely in that group. The new line was longer and slower, but the instructions were clear\u2014follow the official\u2019s directions.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The family expected me to be there for them, to guide them through their sorrow. The election officials expected me to comply, to respect the process and not cause disruption. My phone buzzed again with another message from the grieving family. I clutched my ballot, torn between the urgent needs of my community and my responsibility as a citizen, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
