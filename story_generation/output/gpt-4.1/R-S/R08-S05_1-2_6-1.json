As a Muslim, I felt the growing pull to fulfill my obligation to perform Hajj. My parents called last night, their voices warm but tinged with hope, reminding me that the time was right, that I should start planning. But I knew my savings were thin, barely enough to cover rent, let alone a pilgrimage across continents.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from a client whose case had become a labyrinth of legal twists. As an advocate, I was expected to provide clear, thorough advice, to be the steady hand guiding them through uncertainty. The case demanded hours of research, late nights, and unwavering focus\u2014resources I couldn\u2019t spare if I started planning for Hajj now.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My faith called for sacrifice and devotion, while my profession demanded diligence and expertise. I stared at the open case file, heart pounding, torn between the spiritual journey I longed for and the professional duty I could not abandon."}
