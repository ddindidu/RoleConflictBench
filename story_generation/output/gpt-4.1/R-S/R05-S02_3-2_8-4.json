It was Miriam, her voice trembling. Her father had just passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral\u2014today, if possible. I promised I\u2019d be there, feeling the weight of their grief settle on my shoulders. As I hung up, my other phone buzzed. It was a legislative aide from Senator Klein\u2019s office. \u201cRabbi, I have ten minutes right now to discuss the bill you\u2019ve been championing. Can you talk?\u201d My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for\u2014months of organizing, rallying, and writing op-eds had led to this chance. But Miriam\u2019s family was waiting for me to guide them through their loss. I stared at both phones, feeling the expectations of my congregation and my cause pressing in from both sides. My hands shook as I tried to decide which call to answer first, torn between comforting the bereaved and seizing a fleeting opportunity to make real change."}
