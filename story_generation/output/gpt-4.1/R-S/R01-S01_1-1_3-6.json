The coordinator\u2019s email from earlier echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you have time, please try organizing the supplies by expiration date instead of type.\u201d I glanced at the growing line outside, knowing the extra sorting would slow things down, but I wanted to follow her suggestion. Just then, I noticed Mrs. Carter, a regular, sitting alone on the bench, her shoulders slumped. As her pastor, I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself to check in whenever I saw her. My heart tugged me toward her, but my hands were full of cans, and the coordinator\u2019s expectations pressed on me. I felt torn\u2014should I pause my organizing to offer Mrs. Carter a listening ear, or should I keep working, honoring my commitment as a volunteer? The weight of both roles pressed in, and I stood there, caught between the needs of one person and the responsibilities to the many."}
