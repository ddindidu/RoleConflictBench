He clutched my arm, voice trembling, desperate for comfort after losing his mother. My heart ached for him; as imam, I knew my duty was to offer solace, to listen, to guide him through his grief. But just as I led him to my office, the city\u2019s flood alarms blared. Through the window, I saw water creeping up the street, people shouting, cars stalling. As a citizen, I was expected to act\u2014help evacuate, ensure everyone\u2019s safety, follow emergency protocols. My phone buzzed with alerts from the city, urging immediate action. I stood frozen, torn between the man\u2019s pain and the rising danger outside. My mind raced: should I stay and counsel him, fulfilling my spiritual duty, or rush out to help my neighbors and obey the city\u2019s urgent call? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
