But I haven\u2019t read these particular verses yet; I feel unprepared, almost ashamed. At the same time, my role as an advocate demands that I attend our routine legal meeting, which, as always, is scheduled for the same evening. My colleagues expect punctuality and full attention, especially since we\u2019re preparing for a crucial court session. I can sense the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my faith urging me to deepen my understanding, my profession insisting on unwavering commitment. My mind races with guilt and anxiety, torn between the spiritual nourishment I crave and the professional responsibility I cannot ignore. I sit at my desk, the Quran open on one side, my case files on the other, heart pounding as I wrestle with the impossible choice before me."}
