I\u2019ve looked forward to this evening, craving the quiet reflection and shared insights. Yet, today is also election day. The polling station is open until late, and my schedule is unusually light, so there\u2019s no real excuse to miss voting. I know how important it is to participate, to have my voice heard in shaping our community. But the study circle only meets once a week, and missing it means losing a chance to grow spiritually with my friends. I feel the weight of both expectations: the duty to engage in mindful study, and the responsibility to vote. My mind races, torn between the calm I seek in the circle and the civic duty that calls me. I sit in my car, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both matter deeply to me."}
