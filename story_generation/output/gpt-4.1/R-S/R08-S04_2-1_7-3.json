This year, my friends are going, and my name is on the list. The excitement in our community is palpable; everyone expects me to join, to fulfill this pillar of my faith now that I have the means. But the election falls on the same week. As a citizen, I\u2019m expected to vote, to show up with my identification and play my part in shaping our country\u2019s future. The polling station is nearby, and I have all the required IDs, but the timing is tight. If I leave for Hajj, I might miss my chance to vote. If I stay to vote, I might lose my spot for Hajj, and who knows when I\u2019ll get another chance? My heart aches as I weigh the expectations\u2014my faith pulling me one way, my civic duty the other. I sit at my desk, passport and voting card in hand, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
