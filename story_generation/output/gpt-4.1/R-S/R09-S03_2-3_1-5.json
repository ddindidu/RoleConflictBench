The sun is setting, and the holiday is almost here. My children sit at the table, their books open, eyes expectant. They still stumble over the blessings, and I promised myself I\u2019d teach them properly this year. Passing on our traditions is sacred\u2014my parents did it for me, and I want my children to feel the same connection, the same pride. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change our block, and I\u2019ve read the pamphlets, talked to neighbors. As a citizen, I believe in showing up, in making my voice heard. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my children\u2019s eager faces, the urgency of civic duty. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss this precious teaching moment. If I stay, I\u2019ll forfeit my chance to shape our community\u2019s future. My hands tremble as I try to focus on the words of the blessing, but my mind is split, torn between two worlds that both demand all of me."}
