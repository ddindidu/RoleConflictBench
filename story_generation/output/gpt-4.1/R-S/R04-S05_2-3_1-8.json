As the imam, I was the one everyone looked to, especially today, with our regular backup away. The congregation gathered, eyes quietly urging me forward. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was about to begin. As an advocate, my presence was not just expected\u2014it was essential. The case was at a critical juncture, and my absence could tip the scales. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the sacred duty to lead my community in prayer and the professional responsibility to stand by my client in court. Both roles demanded my full presence, both were urgent, and both felt impossible to abandon. I stood at the threshold, the weight of two worlds pressing in, uncertain which path to take."}
