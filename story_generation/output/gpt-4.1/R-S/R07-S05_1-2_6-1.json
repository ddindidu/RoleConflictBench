The phone buzzed\u2014a message from my friend at the temple, inviting me to discuss the profound sermon we\u2019d heard last night. As a Buddhist, I felt the pull to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful conversation about impermanence and compassion. My friend expected my full presence, my thoughtful insights. Yet, as an advocate, my client\u2019s needs pressed urgently. Their case had taken a complicated turn, and they relied on me for clarity and guidance. I could sense their anxiety in every email, their expectation that I would be available, focused, and precise. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one calling for stillness and spiritual connection, the other demanding sharp attention and practical advice. My heart ached with the tension, torn between the quiet wisdom of the Dharma and the immediate, tangible needs of my client. I stared at the phone, feeling the conflict rise within me, unsure which path to take in this moment."}
