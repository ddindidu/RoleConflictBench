The funeral prayer is for Mr. Goldstein, a man I\u2019ve known since childhood. I know how important it is to have a full minyan for Kaddish, to honor the dead and comfort the living. My community expects me to be there, to uphold our traditions.\n\nBut at the same time, my laptop is open to the live stream of the candidate forum. The election is next week, and this is the only chance to hear the candidates answer questions about the new housing policy. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to stay informed, to participate, to send in my questions and vote thoughtfully. My neighbors and friends count on me to be engaged, to help shape our city\u2019s future.\n\nI stare at the screen, torn. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my community\u2019s need for tradition and my civic duty to be present and informed. My hands tremble as I try to decide which expectation I must let down."}
