This year, my friends are going, and I have enough saved. The excitement in our group chat is contagious, and my heart aches to join them, fulfilling this pillar of my faith. But as a volunteer at the community center, I\u2019ve just been briefed on new safety protocols. The coordinator emphasized how crucial it is for all of us to be present and vigilant, especially during the upcoming summer programs when the center is busiest. She looked right at me, reminding us that our commitment keeps everyone safe. I feel torn\u2014my faith calls me to Mecca, but my sense of responsibility to the children and families who rely on us weighs heavily. I can\u2019t shake the guilt at the thought of leaving my team short-handed, but the longing to answer the call to Hajj is overwhelming. My mind races, caught between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each pulling at my heart."}
