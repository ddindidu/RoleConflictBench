She needed to talk\u2014her son was in trouble again, and she didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As her pastor, I knew how much she counted on me for comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. But I glanced at the clock and realized I was already cutting it close for my shift. The pantry coordinator always emphasized punctuality, and I\u2019d promised to set a good example. Still, I also knew the other volunteers could handle things for a while if I was late. My heart ached as I listened to Mrs. Kim pour out her worries, feeling the weight of her trust in me. At the same time, guilt gnawed at me for possibly letting down my fellow volunteers. I stood there, torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
