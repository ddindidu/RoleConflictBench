He clutched my arm, voice trembling, and pleaded for guidance\u2014his mother had just passed away, and he was lost in grief. My heart ached for him; as imam, I knew my duty was to offer comfort, to sit with him and help him find solace in faith. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, panic fluttered in my chest. The polling station would close in less than an hour, and tonight was my only chance to vote. I had promised my family and myself that I would fulfill my civic duty, and I had my ID ready in my pocket. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me: the community expected me to be present in their darkest moments, but my country expected me to show up as a responsible citizen. I stood there, torn, the man\u2019s grief echoing in the quiet mosque, the ticking clock growing louder in my mind."}
