Her family, devastated, asked if I could officiate the funeral service tomorrow. As their rabbi, I know how much it means to them to have me guide them through this moment, to offer comfort and tradition. But as I hung up, my calendar reminded me of the advocacy meeting scheduled at the same time\u2014one of those routine but mandatory sessions where my presence is expected, and my absence is noticed. The advocacy team relies on me to represent our clients, to be punctual and prepared. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the family\u2019s grief, the community\u2019s expectations, the professional responsibility to my advocacy work. My mind races, torn between honoring a life and fulfilling my duty to those who depend on my advocacy. I sit at my desk, heart pounding, knowing I must choose, but not yet knowing how."}
