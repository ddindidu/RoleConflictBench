It was time to start brainstorming for my upcoming Shabbat sermon\u2014a process that always demanded quiet reflection and careful thought. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and a message that would resonate. I felt the weight of their trust, the responsibility to offer something meaningful.\n\nJust as I began jotting down ideas, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service we provided to the community would be shut down. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear, and as a volunteer, I was expected to drop everything and comply, ensuring the program\u2019s survival.\n\nI stared at my notes, then at the phone, feeling the pressure mounting from both sides. My mind raced with the demands of my rabbinic duties and the immediate needs of the volunteer role. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the quiet call of spiritual leadership and the loud urgency of community service, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
