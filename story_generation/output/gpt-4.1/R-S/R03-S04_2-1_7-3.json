Just as I began to lose myself in prayer, Sister Agnes knocked, her voice urgent. A parishioner, Maria, was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. I felt the weight of my calling\u2014my presence and guidance could be the comfort Maria needed. Yet, today is also election day, and I am determined to fulfill my civic duty as a voter. I checked my bag for my ID, only to realize I\u2019d left my main card in my other habit. I could fetch a spare later, but the polling station closes early. The expectations pressed in: the parish needs my spiritual support, but my country asks for my participation. My mind raced, torn between the sacred and the civic, feeling the tension of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
