As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present, to worship with my community, and to help set up for the children\u2019s program. Pastor had reminded us last week: \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s hands and hearts this Sunday.\u201d I felt the weight of that expectation, the sense of belonging and duty.\n\nBut today was also election day. As a voter, I had a responsibility to show up at the polls, to bring my ID and make my voice heard. I\u2019d planned to vote after church, but as I reached for my wallet, I realized my driver\u2019s license was missing. I could use my passport, but it was at home, a thirty-minute drive away. If I left now to fetch it, I\u2019d miss the start of service and let down my church family. If I stayed, I risked not voting at all.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between my faith community and my civic duty, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
