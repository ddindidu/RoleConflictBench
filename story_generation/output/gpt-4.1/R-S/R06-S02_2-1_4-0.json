The familiar comfort of hymns and prayer calls to me, a weekly ritual that grounds my faith and connects me to my community. I know how much my presence matters\u2014Pastor Linda always says the church is a family, and every member is needed. But as I reach for my Bible, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Maya, a fellow activist, live-streaming from a protest downtown. Their voice trembles with urgency: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d My heart pounds. I\u2019ve spent weeks helping plan this demonstration, and I know how crucial numbers are for our cause. Yet, if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the service and let down my church family. I stand frozen, torn between the pews that nurture my spirit and the streets that demand my voice. The weight of both worlds presses on me, each expecting my full devotion, and I can\u2019t ignore the ache of choosing one over the other."}
