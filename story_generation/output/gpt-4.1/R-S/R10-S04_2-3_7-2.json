The family ceremony was about to begin, and my parents had called twice already, reminding me to be on time, to wear the kurta they\u2019d picked out, to show respect for our traditions. I could almost hear the temple bells in my mind, the scent of incense, the warmth of my relatives\u2019 smiles. But as I hurried down the street, I saw the polling station ahead, the line thinning, the officials glancing at their watches. The sign read: \u201cDoors close in ten minutes.\u201d I knew my vote mattered, that it was my duty as a citizen, that people had fought for this right. Yet, my family expected me to be present, to honor our rituals, to not let them down. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations\u2014my community\u2019s trust in my faith, my country\u2019s trust in my voice. I stood at the crossroads, torn between the pull of tradition and the call of civic responsibility, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
