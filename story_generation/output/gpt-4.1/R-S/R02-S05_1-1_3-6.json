The phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner, her voice tentative, asked if I might have time to talk, not now, but sometime soon. She didn\u2019t say what about, but I could hear the weight in her words, the unspoken need for guidance. As a priest, I knew I should make myself available, offer comfort and counsel, even if it was just to listen. But as I glanced at my calendar, the reality of my other life pressed in. I was due at a routine meeting for my advocacy work in less than an hour, and these meetings were frequent, their punctuality non-negotiable. My colleagues expected me to be present, focused, and on time\u2014anything less would be letting them down. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me: the urge to serve my parishioner, to be the compassionate ear she needed, and the obligation to my advocacy team, who relied on my commitment. The expectations of both roles pressed in, and I sat there, torn, the phone still warm in my hand, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
