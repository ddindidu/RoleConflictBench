It was Miriam, her voice trembling as she told me her father had just passed away. She asked if I could officiate the funeral service later today. As their rabbi, I knew how much it would mean to the family for me to be there, to offer comfort and guide them through the rituals. I promised I would do everything I could.\n\nBut as I hung up, I saw an email from the volunteer coordinator at the food pantry. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supplies, asking if I could try it out today if I had time. I\u2019d already committed to my volunteer shift, and I knew the coordinator counted on me to follow her instructions and set an example for the other volunteers.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. The congregation needed me in their moment of grief, but the pantry relied on my consistency and willingness to adapt. My heart ached, torn between the urgent needs of my community and my commitment to serve as a dependable volunteer. I sat in my car, keys in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
