They wanted me to officiate their wedding\u2014over a year from now, but the date was already set. I could hear the hope in their words, the trust they placed in me as their rabbi, to bless the beginning of their life together. I promised to check my calendar, feeling the familiar warmth of being part of such a sacred moment. But as I hung up, my eyes fell on the court summons pinned to my board. The wedding date was the same as the final hearing for a case I\u2019d been working on for months as an advocate. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence; the judge had made it clear\u2014no delays, no absences. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The congregation expected me to be there for their milestones, to guide and celebrate. My client needed my voice in the courtroom, unwavering and on time. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me."}
