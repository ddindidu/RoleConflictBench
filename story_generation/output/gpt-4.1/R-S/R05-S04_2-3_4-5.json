The children are gathering in the classroom, their voices echoing down the synagogue hallway. As their rabbi, I am expected to guide them through Torah, to answer their questions, to be present\u2014especially for the ones who look to me for comfort and wisdom. But my wallet, with my ID, sits on the entry table at home. Today is the last day to vote, and the polls close in less than an hour. If I leave now, I can just make it, fulfill my civic duty, and have my voice counted. But if I go, I abandon my students, disrupt their learning, and fail the trust their parents have placed in me. My mind races with the weight of both responsibilities. I feel the pull of my community\u2019s expectations, the importance of teaching our traditions, and the urgency of participating in the democratic process. I stand frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
