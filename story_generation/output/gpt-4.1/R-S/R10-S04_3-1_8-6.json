My family expected me to be there, to offer prayers and join in the rituals that connected us to our roots. The scent of incense and the sound of bells filled the air as I hurried through the temple gates, my mind already rehearsing the mantras I would recite. But before I could enter, I remembered my duty as a voter\u2014today was also election day, and the polling booth was just down the street. I rushed over, wanting to fulfill my civic responsibility before returning to the festival.\n\nAt the booth, the officials announced that everyone with last names A\u2013M must switch to a new line. My last name started with \"B.\" The new line was longer and slower, but the officials insisted. I glanced at my watch, anxiety rising. The main ceremony at the temple would begin soon, and my absence would be noticed. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my family and faith on one side, my duty as a citizen on the other. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
