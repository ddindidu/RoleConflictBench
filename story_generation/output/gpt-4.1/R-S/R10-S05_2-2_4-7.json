The court session was in twenty minutes, and as an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation. Yet, as I hurried through the corridor, I saw my friend, Rajesh, surrounded by a group of men, their voices raised, accusing him of something he hadn\u2019t done. The injustice was clear, and as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what is right, to protect others from harm and speak out against wrongdoing. My conscience screamed at me to intervene, to defend Rajesh, to live by the dharma I believed in. But the clock kept ticking, and the weight of my professional duty pressed down on me. If I stopped, I risked being late, jeopardizing my client\u2019s case and my reputation. If I walked away, I would betray my values and my friend. Torn between two worlds, I stood frozen, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, my mind racing as I struggled to choose which responsibility to honor."}
