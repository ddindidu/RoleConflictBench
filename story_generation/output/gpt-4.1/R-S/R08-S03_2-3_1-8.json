My heart aches with the knowledge that I\u2019m behind on my daily reading, the verses I\u2019d promised myself to finish slipping further out of reach. I close my eyes, trying to focus, but the wail of sirens outside shatters the silence. Through the window, I see neighbors gathering, water pooling at their ankles as the street transforms into a river. The building\u2019s alarm blares, and I remember the city\u2019s call for citizens to help one another in emergencies\u2014especially now, with the floodwaters rising. My mind races: as a Muslim, I feel the weight of my spiritual commitment, the need to recite and reflect, especially during this sacred month. But as a citizen, I know I\u2019m needed outside, to help sandbag doors, check on the elderly, maybe even offer my apartment as shelter. The Quran rests heavy in my hands, my heart pulled in two directions, torn between devotion and duty as the water keeps rising."}
