The conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was in ten minutes, and I was the one who had guided her through every step. She was nervous, and I knew how much she depended on my presence and reassurance before facing the Beit Din. Teaching Torah, supporting her, was my sacred duty as a rabbi.\n\nBut here I was, standing in the polling station, ballot envelope in hand. The poll worker frowned, pointing to the smudged signature. \u201cPlease re-sign, or your vote might not count,\u201d she said. I remembered the instructions: follow every step exactly, no exceptions. My civic responsibility as a voter was clear\u2014democracy depended on it.\n\nI felt torn. If I stayed to fix the ballot, I\u2019d be late for the study session, possibly letting down someone who trusted me with her spiritual journey. If I rushed out, my vote might be invalid, and I\u2019d be ignoring the rules that keep our elections fair. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I stood frozen, pen in hand, caught between two worlds."}
