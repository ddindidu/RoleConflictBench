The clock ticks closer to the hour when I\u2019ll gather the students, eager faces waiting to learn about mitzvot and tradition. My phone buzzes\u2014a message from the activist group I work with. The petition to the state senator is about to be sent, a crucial push for the policy we\u2019ve been fighting for. They need my signature, now, to show the support of faith leaders. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. The parents expect me to be fully present for their children, to guide them in Jewish law and values. My activist colleagues expect me to stand up, to use my voice and title for justice. I stare at the screen, torn. If I pause to sign, I risk being late, letting down my students and their families. If I ignore the petition, I miss a rare chance to make a difference. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the demands of both callings, knowing I can\u2019t give my whole self to both at this moment."}
