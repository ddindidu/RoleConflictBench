The official\u2019s voice was firm: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form, but we close in ten minutes.\u201d My heart pounded. As a Muslim, I\u2019d been saving every spare dollar for Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. Every expense was carefully weighed, every moment of overtime at work counted. Now, the official handed me a form, explaining there might be a small fee to process the ballot later. My mind raced\u2014should I spend money I\u2019d set aside for Hajj, or risk not voting, betraying my civic duty? I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations: to be a good Muslim, to fulfill the fifth pillar, but also to be a responsible citizen, to have my voice heard. The clock ticked. My hands trembled as I stared at the form, torn between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
