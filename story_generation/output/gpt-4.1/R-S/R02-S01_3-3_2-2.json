The sanctuary was already filling with expectant faces, and I felt the weight of my role as priest\u2014everyone looked to me to lead the prayers, to guide them through this sacred day. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was also the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center across town, where a line of people would be waiting for warmth and breakfast. I pictured them, shivering and hopeful, relying on me to open the doors. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d abandon my congregation at their most important service. If I stayed, I\u2019d leave the vulnerable outside, waiting in the cold. Both groups depended on me, and I felt torn in two, the expectations of priest and volunteer pulling me in opposite directions. I stood frozen, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which door I should walk through."}
