As a pastor, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my congregation trusted me to guide them through the intricacies of faith, to help them wrestle with doctrine and apply it to their lives. The workshop was my chance to deepen their understanding, to challenge them with complex theological ideas that demanded my full attention and preparation.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from Maria, a client in desperate need of legal advice. Her landlord was threatening eviction, and she needed to know her rights\u2014tonight. As her advocate, I was her lifeline, the one she counted on for clear, immediate guidance. She couldn\u2019t afford ambiguity or delay.\n\nI stared at the phone, heart pounding. The demands of both roles pressed in on me: the pastor called to nurture souls with spiritual truth, the advocate bound to defend and protect with legal precision. I felt torn, the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent, each vital. My mind raced, caught between the needs of my flock and the plea of someone in crisis, unsure which call to answer first."}
