As a Christian, I knew how much my presence mattered\u2014not just for worship, but for the sense of belonging and support we all shared. But tonight, my friends had planned a late-evening music session in my apartment, something we\u2019d all been looking forward to for weeks. The problem was, our building\u2019s quiet hours started at ten, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open, sensitive to any noise. As a citizen, I was expected to respect those rules and her right to peace in her own home. The thought of disappointing my friends, or worse, being the reason Mrs. Lee lost sleep, made my stomach twist. I felt torn, caught between my commitment to my faith community and my responsibility to my neighbors. The clock ticked on, and I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
