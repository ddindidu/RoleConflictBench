Tonight was the routine chant, a ritual I cherished as a Buddhist, a time to join my community in reflection and peace. The abbot had reminded me earlier, \u201cYour presence strengthens the sangha.\u201d Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center, where a line of people would already be waiting for warmth and food. The director had stressed, \u201cWe depend on you to open on time\u2014people count on it.\u201d My heart pounded as I glanced between the temple and the road leading to the center. I felt torn, the weight of both communities pressing on me. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down those waiting in the cold; if I left, I\u2019d miss the ritual that grounds my faith. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
