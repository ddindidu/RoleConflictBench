Sunday afternoons always slip away faster than I expect. My church\u2019s evening service starts soon, and I promised myself I\u2019d go this week\u2014I\u2019ve missed too many lately, and I know how much it means to my faith and to the friends who keep asking about me. But today is also election day, and the polling station closes in just a couple of hours. I can\u2019t shake the sense of duty to vote; it\u2019s a responsibility I take seriously, a way to shape the world I live in. My pastor always says to be a light in the world, but what does that mean right now? If I go to church, I might not make it to the polls in time. If I vote first, I\u2019ll miss the worship and the fellowship I\u2019ve been craving. My heart pounds as I sit in my car, torn between two callings, both important, both urgent, and I wonder which part of myself I\u2019ll have to disappoint tonight."}
