As a Hindu, it was my duty to participate fully, to offer prayers and join in every ritual. I traveled for hours to be here, determined not to miss a single moment. But as a volunteer at the local health camp, I was also responsible for sorting confidential medical files. The files were stacked in a small room at the temple, and I was trusted to keep their contents private. \n\nToday, as the festival reached its peak, a respected elder approached me, asking about a neighbor\u2019s health. He was worried, and as a member of the community, I felt the pressure to answer, to show respect and care. But as a volunteer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my community expected openness and support, but my duty as a volunteer demanded strict confidentiality. I stood there, torn, the sounds of celebration echoing outside, my mind racing as I tried to decide what to do."}
