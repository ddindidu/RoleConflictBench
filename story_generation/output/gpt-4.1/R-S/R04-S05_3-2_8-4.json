My phone buzzed with reminders\u2014my client\u2019s case was complicated, and every detail mattered. As I reviewed the documents, a knock interrupted my focus. I opened the door to find a community member, eyes red and shoulders slumped, barely able to speak through his grief. He needed spiritual guidance, right now, to cope with a devastating loss. I could see the pain etched on his face, and I knew my role as imam demanded I offer comfort and counsel, to be present and compassionate in his darkest hour.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. My client was counting on me to be fully prepared, to represent them with diligence and care in a dispute that could change their life. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me\u2014one soul in need of solace, another in need of justice. My heart ached as I stood between these worlds, torn by the urgency of both calls, uncertain which path to take first."}
