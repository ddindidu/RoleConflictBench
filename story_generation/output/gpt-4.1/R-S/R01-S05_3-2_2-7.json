As her pastor, I knew she needed more than just advice\u2014she needed spiritual guidance, a safe space to pour out her fears about the decision she faced. The weight of her crisis pressed on me; she was desperate for comfort, for clarity, and I could not rush this moment. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was in less than thirty minutes. As their advocate, I was expected to be there, prepared and punctual, to defend their rights and ensure their voice was heard. The courthouse was across town, and traffic at this hour was unpredictable. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the sacred trust Maria placed in me and the professional duty I owed my client. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me with every passing second."}
