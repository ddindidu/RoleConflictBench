My fellow Buddhists glanced at me, expecting my voice to join theirs, as I had every week. The community found comfort in our shared rituals, and I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to honor the tradition and support the sangha. Yet, my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the urgent court session scheduled for the same hour. As an advocate, my client\u2019s fate could hinge on my timely arguments; the legal team and the client themselves were counting on me to be there, prepared and focused. My mind raced, torn between the serenity of the temple and the high-stakes tension of the courtroom. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. The chanting began, but my heart pounded with indecision, caught between the call of my spiritual community and the duty to my client."}
