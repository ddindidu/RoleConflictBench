I settled into my small room, the sunlight slanting across my Bible, and let my mind begin to quiet. Just as I opened to the day\u2019s passage, my phone buzzed. A reminder: I was scheduled to unlock the community center for the evening meal service. I was the only volunteer assigned today, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and begin preparations.\n\nMy heart twisted. The sisters expect me to nurture my spiritual life, to deepen my faith through study and contemplation. But the people at the center expect me to be reliable, to show up on time and serve. I could almost hear the quiet disappointment of the sisters if I neglected my spiritual duties, and the anxious voices of those waiting outside if I arrived late. I sat there, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
