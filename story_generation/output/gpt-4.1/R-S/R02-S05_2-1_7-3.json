The church hall was already filling with the laughter of children, their parents waiting expectantly for the weekly religious education class I was to lead. As a priest, I knew how much these families relied on me to nurture their children\u2019s faith, to answer their questions, to be present. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from the courthouse. As an advocate, I was expected to appear at a minor hearing for a client who, though not facing serious charges, still depended on me to represent them with diligence and care. I could picture my client\u2019s anxious face, counting on my presence. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. The parish expected unwavering commitment; my client deserved my best defense. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down. I stood in the hallway, the sounds of the church and the courthouse echoing in my mind, unable to move."}
