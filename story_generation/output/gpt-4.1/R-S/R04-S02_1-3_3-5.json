As imam, I know how much the community looks to me for guidance, especially in these uncertain times. My notes are ready, but so is the guest speaker, waiting in the wings, prepared to step in if needed. Just as I\u2019m about to greet the congregation, my phone buzzes with an urgent message from my activist network: the state legislature is holding a surprise vote on a bill we\u2019ve fought for months. The outcome hinges on one undecided representative, and I\u2019m the only one with a direct line to her office. If I don\u2019t call now, we could lose everything we\u2019ve worked for. My heart pounds as I glance between the pulpit and my phone, feeling the weight of my community\u2019s spiritual needs and the pressing call to action for justice. Both roles demand my presence, both expect my leadership, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The clock ticks, and I stand frozen, torn between the sacred trust of my congregation and the urgent call to advocacy."}
