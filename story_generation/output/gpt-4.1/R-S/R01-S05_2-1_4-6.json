As a pastor, I was used to people coming to me with their burdens, and today was no different. Maria, a longtime member of our congregation, sat across from me, her eyes red from crying. She poured out her heart about her crumbling marriage, her voice trembling with fear and hope. I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for as long as she needed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the advocacy meeting was starting in ten minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. My colleagues and clients depended on me to be there, to represent them, to keep the process moving. Missing a meeting could mean delays or even jeopardizing someone\u2019s case.\n\nMaria\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but so was my responsibility to those waiting at the courthouse. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
