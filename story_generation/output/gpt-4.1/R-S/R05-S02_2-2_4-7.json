In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be on air, speaking passionately about the cause I\u2019ve poured my soul into\u2014educating the community, raising awareness, making a difference. The radio host\u2019s email flashes on my phone: \u201cReady to go live?\u201d But just down the hall, the children are gathering for their weekly Torah class. Their parents trust me to guide them, to teach them the stories and laws that shape our lives. I hear their laughter, their eager voices, and I know how much this hour means to them\u2014and to me, as their rabbi. My activist side urges me not to miss this rare opportunity to reach thousands, to speak truth when it matters most. But my rabbinic heart aches at the thought of letting the children down, of breaking the sacred rhythm of our learning. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I stand frozen, torn between two callings, each demanding all of me, right now."}
