Today, I was to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral\u2014a great honor for our convent, and one I had prepared for with devotion. Yet, as I recited the morning psalms, my mind wandered to the small apartment I\u2019d left behind when I took my vows. My voter ID, tucked away in a drawer, was still there. The election was tomorrow, but today was my only chance to retrieve it. The Mother Superior expected me to be present all day, guiding the sisters and representing our faith. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me, the responsibility to have my voice heard. The thought of slipping away, even briefly, filled me with guilt. I could not reconcile the sacred trust placed in me by my sisters with the obligation I felt as a member of this country. My heart pounded as I tried to pray, torn between the chapel\u2019s quiet sanctity and the world outside, where my other duty waited."}
