The adult education class is about to begin, and a handful of eager faces are already gathering in the study room, waiting for me to guide them through tonight\u2019s lesson. As their rabbi, I know how much they value these sessions\u2014how they look to me for insight, for connection, for a sense of continuity in their Jewish lives. I feel the weight of their expectations, the trust they place in me to be present, to teach, to lead.\n\nBut in my pocket, my voter ID card burns against my leg. I remember the announcement: tonight is the last chance to vote, and the polls will close soon. If I don\u2019t go now, I lose my voice in this election\u2014a civic duty I\u2019ve always taken seriously. I can\u2019t ask someone else to vote for me, and I can\u2019t reschedule the class at the last minute without disappointing those who came, some from far away.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn, the Torah in one hand and my ID in the other, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
