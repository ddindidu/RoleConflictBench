As a Christian, I try to live by these words, letting them guide my actions. Today, the city issued a heat advisory\u2014temperatures soaring, warnings blaring on my phone. As a responsible citizen, I know I should follow public health guidance: stay indoors, avoid unnecessary contact, and look out for vulnerable community members. But Mrs. Evans, my elderly neighbor, lives alone on my floor. I haven\u2019t seen her since yesterday. My Christian heart urges me to check on her, to make sure she\u2019s safe and has water, maybe even bring her a fan. But the city\u2019s guidance is clear: minimize visits, especially to those at risk, to prevent spreading illness. I stand in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between my faith\u2019s call to care and my civic duty to protect. My mind races with what-ifs\u2014what if she needs help, what if I put her in danger? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I hesitate, caught between the door to my apartment and the one to hers."}
