His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew, his confidence wavering. As his parent, I felt the weight of tradition pressing on me\u2014my responsibility to guide him, to ensure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them. My phone buzzed, pulling me back to my other world. A reminder: tomorrow\u2019s hearing. It was a minor case, but my client was nervous, relying on me to represent them with the same dedication I gave to every case. I knew I should spend the evening preparing, reviewing notes, anticipating questions. But my son needed me, too. The expectations from both sides pressed in\u2014my community, my family, my client, my profession. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I leaned. I stared at the Torah, then at my legal pad, heart pounding, unsure which role to step into tonight."}
