My children\u2019s voices echo from the living room, their laughter a reminder that I still haven\u2019t taught them the Four Questions or the blessings for the Seder. My mother\u2019s words ring in my ears: \u201cIt\u2019s your duty to pass on our traditions.\u201d I promised myself I would do better this year, that I would make time to teach them the stories and songs that shaped my childhood.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: a client\u2019s hearing is scheduled for tomorrow morning. It\u2019s a minor case, nothing that will change the world, but I know my client is anxious. As their advocate, I\u2019m expected to be present, prepared, and persuasive\u2014no matter how small the stakes. I feel the weight of their trust, the responsibility to represent them with the same dedication I give to every case.\n\nI stare at my notes for the hearing, then at the Haggadah on the table. My heart aches with the pull of both worlds, each demanding more than I feel I can give."}
