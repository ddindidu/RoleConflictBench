The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my mind: to lead daily reflections for the community during the retreat. It was an honor, but also a responsibility that demanded deep spiritual preparation and undivided attention. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from clients seeking guidance\u2014some desperate, some confused, all needing clear and accurate legal advice. I had promised to be available for casual consultations, to explain their situations in ways they could understand, to be their advocate in a world that often left them voiceless. The expectations pressed in from both sides: the community needed my spiritual leadership, my clients needed my legal clarity. I felt the weight of their hopes and needs, the pull of two worlds that rarely touched. My heart ached with the knowledge that to fully serve one might mean failing the other. I closed my eyes, torn between the silence of prayer and the urgency of a ringing phone, uncertain which call to answer first."}
