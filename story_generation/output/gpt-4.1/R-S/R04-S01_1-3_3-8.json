The congregation was gathering, expecting to hear my voice deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. Yet, as a volunteer, I had just received a message from the coordinator: new, urgent procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service risked being shut down. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear\u2014no exceptions, not even for me. At the same time, the guest speaker I\u2019d invited weeks ago was ready, his sermon prepared, waiting for my signal. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the community\u2019s trust in my leadership as imam, and my duty to uphold the volunteer guidelines. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between stepping up to the pulpit as everyone anticipated, or stepping aside to ensure the service could continue safely. The minutes ticked by, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
