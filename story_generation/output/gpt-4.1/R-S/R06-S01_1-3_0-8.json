The message was clear: we had to follow the new intake procedure, no exceptions, or risk the shelter being shut down. The urgency in her words pressed on me, and I knew how much the community depended on us. But as I read the details, my heart sank. The new process required us to turn away anyone without proper documentation, even if it meant leaving someone out in the cold. As a Christian, I\u2019d always believed in welcoming the stranger, showing compassion, and helping those in need, no matter their circumstances. My faith taught me to see Christ in everyone, especially the most vulnerable. But now, the rules demanded something different\u2014something that felt so wrong to my core. I could feel the tension building inside me, the weight of responsibility for the shelter and the call of my conscience pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the screen, torn between obeying the coordinator\u2019s directive and staying true to the values that shaped who I am."}
