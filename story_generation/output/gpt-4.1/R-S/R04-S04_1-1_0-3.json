It was my duty as imam, and the community looked to me for guidance, even if only a handful gathered each morning. Today, though, my mind was elsewhere. It was election day, and I needed to vote before work. I checked my wallet and realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I could use another card, but it was in my desk drawer, a ten-minute detour. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d miss leading the prayer, but another worshipper, equally qualified, was present. The congregation was small; perhaps they wouldn\u2019t mind. Yet, I felt the weight of their expectation, the trust placed in me. At the same time, I felt the civic responsibility to vote, to have my voice heard. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between my role as imam and my duty as a voter, each demanding my presence, each carrying its own significance."}
