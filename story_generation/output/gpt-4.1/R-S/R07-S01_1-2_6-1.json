It was Tenzin, a friend from the temple. \u201cCan we talk about the sermon from yesterday?\u201d he asked, his voice earnest. I knew how much these discussions meant to him\u2014and to me. Engaging in spiritual study and reflection is at the heart of my Buddhist practice, and I felt a responsibility to be present for him, to deepen our understanding together.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my stomach tightened. My volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes, and the coordinator had sent a firm reminder: \u201cWe need everyone on time. The roster is tight.\u201d I pictured the line of people waiting outside, counting on us to open the doors promptly. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the quiet, contemplative space of spiritual friendship, the other toward the urgent, practical need of the community. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my Buddhist path and my commitment as a volunteer, both demanding my presence, both feeling equally important."}
