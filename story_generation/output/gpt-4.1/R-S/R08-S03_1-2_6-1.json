My parents remind me gently that it\u2019s a pillar of faith, and I feel the weight of their expectations, as well as my own longing to stand in Mecca. Tonight, my friends have planned a late-evening music session in my apartment. It\u2019s a rare chance to unwind, but I\u2019m acutely aware of the building\u2019s quiet hours. As a responsible citizen, I know I should respect the rules and my neighbors\u2019 right to peace, especially since Mrs. Rahman next door always leaves her windows open. The music could easily disturb her. I feel torn\u2014between the spiritual journey I can\u2019t yet afford and the simple act of being a good neighbor. The pressure builds inside me, a knot of guilt and frustration, as I weigh my desire to connect with friends against my duty to respect others. I stand by the window, listening to the city\u2019s hum, caught between who I am and who I\u2019m expected to be."}
