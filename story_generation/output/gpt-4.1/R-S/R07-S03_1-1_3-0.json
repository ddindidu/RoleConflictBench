As a Buddhist, I value these moments of stillness, letting my thoughts settle and my breath guide me. I found a shaded bench, closed my eyes, and began to focus inward. Just as I was sinking into calm, I heard the crinkle of a snack wrapper. Opening my eyes, I saw a man toss his empty bag onto the grass, ignoring the no-littering signs and the trash bin just a few steps away. As a citizen, I know I should speak up, remind him of the rules, and protect our shared space. But as a Buddhist, I strive to avoid confrontation, to let go of judgment, and to maintain my inner peace. My heart pounded with the tension between these roles\u2014should I break my silence and disturb my meditation, or let the moment pass and risk failing my civic duty? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unable to move or speak, caught between the urge to act and the desire to simply be."}
