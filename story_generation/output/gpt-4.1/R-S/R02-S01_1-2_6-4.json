As priest, I was expected to lead with vision and organization, to inspire the team and set the tone for the coming season\u2019s classes. My mind was already racing with ideas and the pressure to make this year\u2019s program meaningful for everyone.\n\nBut before I could gather my notes, I was called to the parish hall, where I also volunteered at our weekly food pantry. At the check-in table, a woman I\u2019d seen before leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. She shared a deeply personal concern, something that weighed heavily on her heart, trusting me as a volunteer to keep her confidence. I could see the relief in her eyes as she spoke, but my mind was torn\u2014her situation was something our faith formation team could address, yet I was bound by the promise of privacy.\n\nThe clock ticked closer to the meeting.
