My client, Mr. Harris, had just left after explaining his case\u2014a complicated property dispute. As his advocate, I was expected to represent him zealously, to use every legal tool at my disposal to secure his interests. But as I reviewed the documents, I realized that some of the evidence he wanted me to present was misleading, bordering on dishonest. My Christian faith teaches me to value truth and integrity above all, to act with honesty even when it\u2019s difficult. Yet, as an advocate, my duty is to defend my client\u2019s position as strongly as possible, within the bounds of the law. The pressure from my firm to win the case was intense, and Mr. Harris was counting on me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, my conscience wrestling with the expectations of my profession. My heart pounded as I stared at the file, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility to my client."}
