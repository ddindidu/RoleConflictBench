My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTomorrow, please share your summary of the Four Noble Truths with the group.\u201d I felt honored, but also anxious\u2014I wanted to do justice to the teachings, to reflect deeply and prepare something meaningful. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started early in the morning. I knew the others could cover for me if I was a bit late, but I also knew how much the team valued punctuality and reliability. I could almost hear my coordinator\u2019s gentle but firm voice: \u201cWe count on you.\u201d The two expectations pressed in on me\u2014one calling me to spiritual depth and responsibility, the other to practical service and dependability. My mind spun with guilt and uncertainty, torn between the quiet of the temple and the bustle of the shelter, wondering how I could possibly honor both commitments without letting someone down."}
