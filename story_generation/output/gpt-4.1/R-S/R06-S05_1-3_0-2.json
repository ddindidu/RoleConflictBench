He needed clear, precise advice\u2014his livelihood depended on it. As an advocate, I was expected to give him the best possible legal counsel, even if it meant finding loopholes or exploiting gray areas in the law. But as a Christian, I was taught to live by a higher moral code, to be honest and upright, even when it was inconvenient. My client\u2019s plan skirted the edge of legality, and while it wasn\u2019t strictly illegal, it felt wrong in my heart. He looked at me, desperate for guidance, trusting me to help him. I could feel the tension building inside me, the pull between my duty to my client and my commitment to my faith. My mind raced, searching for a way to reconcile the two, but the expectations seemed impossible to meet at the same time. I took a deep breath, feeling the conflict twist inside me, knowing that whatever I said next would define not just my career, but my conscience."}
