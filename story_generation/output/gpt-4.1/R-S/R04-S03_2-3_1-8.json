As imam, I was the one everyone looked to, especially today with our backup away. The congregation gathered, eyes turning to me, trusting I would lead them in prayer as always. But just as I stepped forward, the shrill sound of the building alarm cut through the air. Outside, rain battered the windows, and someone shouted that the river was overflowing\u2014water already creeping up the street. As a citizen, I knew my duty: heed the emergency, help neighbors, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Yet, inside, the faithful waited, needing spiritual guidance and calm. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds\u2014one demanding I lead in worship, the other urging me to act for our collective safety. The tension twisted inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and for a moment, I could only stand there, torn, as the storm raged on."}
