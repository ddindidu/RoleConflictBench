He clutched my arm, desperate for comfort after losing his mother. As an imam, I knew my duty was to offer him spiritual guidance, to sit with him, listen, and help him find solace in faith. But as he poured out his grief, my mind flickered to the tax documents waiting at home\u2014this weekend was my only chance to finalize them before the deadline. At the same time, the city was hosting a free vaccine clinic at the community center, and as a responsible citizen, I felt compelled to volunteer, especially with so many vulnerable neighbors relying on community support.
