The congregation was gathering, waiting for my words on justice and compassion\u2014my name printed on the flyers, my topic announced for weeks. As imam, I knew the weight of this responsibility; the community looked to me for guidance, especially on Fridays. My phone buzzed again. The radio producer\u2019s message flashed: \u201cWe\u2019re live in five. Are you ready?\u201d As an activist, this was my chance to reach thousands, to speak for those whose voices were silenced, to educate and inspire action. Both roles demanded my presence, my voice, my heart. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I missed the sermon, I\u2019d let down my congregation; if I missed the broadcast, I\u2019d betray my cause. My chest tightened as I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, each expecting me to lead, each needing me now."}
