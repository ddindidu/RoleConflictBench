My Bible lay open, a passage marked for meditation, but my mind was restless. As a nun, I was expected to devote this hour to spiritual study and reflection, to center myself in prayer and scripture. Yet, my phone buzzed insistently\u2014a reminder that the trial for my client was about to begin. As their advocate, I was expected to be present, prepared, and persuasive; their future depended on my performance in court today.\n\nJust then, Sister Agnes knocked gently. \u201cA parishioner needs you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s in crisis, questioning his faith. He asked for you specifically.\u201d My heart twisted. I knew the weight of such a request; as a nun, I was called to guide and comfort those in spiritual turmoil. But the courthouse clock was ticking, and my client\u2019s fate hung in the balance. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to ignore. I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible space between two callings, unsure which path to take."}
