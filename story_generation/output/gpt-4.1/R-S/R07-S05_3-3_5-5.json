As the leader, everyone expects me to guide the group into stillness, to embody calm and presence. My phone, silenced but insistent in my mind, reminds me that the trial for my client is about to begin. Their future hangs in the balance, and as their advocate, I am expected to be in court, sharp and prepared, ready to defend them. The group looks to me for guidance, trusting I will lead them through the hour of mindfulness. My client, meanwhile, trusts me to fight for them, to be their voice when it matters most. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, the serenity of the hall clashing with the urgency of the courtroom. My breath catches, torn between the stillness I am supposed to cultivate and the action I am supposed to take. I close my eyes, but my mind races, caught in the impossible pull of two worlds that refuse to meet."}
