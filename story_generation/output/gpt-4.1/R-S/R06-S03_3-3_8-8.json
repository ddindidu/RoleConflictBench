I could see panic in their eyes, and I remembered Jesus\u2019 words about loving your neighbor. I wanted to comfort them, offer food, and open the doors to anyone seeking shelter, no matter who they were. But as a citizen, I knew the city\u2019s emergency guidance: only registered residents were allowed in designated shelters, and we were supposed to keep the building secure to prevent overcrowding and chaos. The water was rising fast, and more people were banging on the doors, pleading for help. My heart ached to let them in, to show the compassion my faith demanded, but my mind raced with the warnings from city officials about safety, liability, and order. I stood at the door, torn between the call to love unconditionally and the responsibility to follow the rules meant to protect everyone. The voices outside grew louder, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
