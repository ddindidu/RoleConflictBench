This morning, Brother Ahmed called, his voice trembling, asking if I could meet him privately today. He\u2019s been struggling with family issues, and I know how much he relies on spiritual guidance. I promised I\u2019d find time for him, knowing how much he needs support.\n\nBut as I prepared to leave, the city issued a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor who lives alone on our floor. She\u2019s frail and doesn\u2019t have air conditioning. As a responsible citizen, I know I should check on her, maybe bring her some cold water or help her get to a cooling center. The city\u2019s warnings are clear: look out for vulnerable neighbors during extreme weather.\n\nI stand in my hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding. My phone buzzes with a reminder about Brother Ahmed. I glance at Mrs. Patel\u2019s door, imagining her sitting in the stifling heat. Both roles pull at me\u2014my duty to my faith community and my responsibility as a caring neighbor. I feel torn, uncertain which need is greater, and I hesitate, caught between two urgent calls for help."}
