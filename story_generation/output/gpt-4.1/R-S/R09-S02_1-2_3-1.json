The organizers are waving me over, expecting me to lead the first chant\u2014my voice has always rallied people, and today\u2019s cause is urgent. But my stomach twists with hunger; I haven\u2019t eaten since early morning. I rush to the pantry, grateful for the kosher snacks I keep for moments like this, but the shelves are nearly empty. Only a few crackers remain, not enough to sustain me through hours of marching and chanting. Someone offers me a granola bar from their bag, but I know it isn\u2019t kosher. My activist side urges me to take it\u2014my energy is needed, my presence at the front is crucial. But my Jewish identity, the discipline of keeping kosher, tugs at me just as strongly. I feel the weight of both communities\u2019 expectations pressing in, my hands trembling as I hover between the pantry and the door, torn by the demands of faith and the call to action."}
