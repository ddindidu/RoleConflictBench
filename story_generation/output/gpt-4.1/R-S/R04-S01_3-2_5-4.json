The mosque was filled with people who had travelled from distant towns, all eager to hear my Friday sermon marking our community\u2019s milestone. I could see their anticipation in the way they sat, eyes fixed on the pulpit, waiting for words that would honor our shared journey. But as a volunteer at the check-in table, I was also responsible for welcoming guests and helping them with forms. That\u2019s when a woman, her voice barely above a whisper, confided in me about a deeply personal struggle, trusting me to keep her words private. My mind raced\u2014my sermon was minutes away, and the congregation\u2019s expectations were clear. Yet, the woman\u2019s vulnerability demanded my full attention and absolute confidentiality. I felt torn, the pull of duty to the community clashing with the sacred trust of one individual. My heart pounded as I stood between the pulpit and the check-in table, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
