The gentle hush of the halls seemed to invite me deeper into prayer, and I felt a longing to reconnect with the peace that comes from stillness. Yet, as I opened my worn copy of the scriptures, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a message from a client\u2014her case, already tangled, had taken another complicated turn. She needed guidance, and she needed it now.\n\nAs a nun, I am called to cultivate inner calm and spiritual depth, to be present with God in these precious moments. But as an advocate, I am expected to be available, to offer clear, timely advice, especially when my client\u2019s future may depend on it. The weight of both callings pressed on me. I stared at the phone, torn between the sacred silence I craved and the urgent voice asking for help. My heart ached with the impossibility of being fully present in both worlds at once, and I sat, suspended, unable to move forward in either direction."}
