It was Maria, a longtime member of our congregation. Her voice trembled as she asked if I could meet her right away\u2014her son had run away again, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. As her pastor, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to pray with her, to offer hope. But as she spoke, I glanced at the clock and felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Today was the only day I could get home to pick up my ID before the polls closed tomorrow. If I missed this window, I wouldn\u2019t be able to vote, something I believe is both my civic duty and a way to stand up for the values I preach. Maria\u2019s pain was real and immediate, but so was the responsibility I felt as a voter. I could hear the desperation in her voice, and I could feel the weight of my own convictions pressing in from both sides. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the pastor she needed and the responsible citizen I wanted to be."}
