As a nun, I am called to deepen my faith and be present for those who seek guidance. Just as I began to meditate, Sister Agnes knocked, her voice gentle but urgent: \u201cMaria from the parish is here. She\u2019s in crisis and needs to talk.\u201d I felt the weight of her need\u2014my role as a spiritual guide is never more important than in moments like these.\n\nBut as I rose, my phone buzzed with a city alert: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Rossi, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone on the floor below. As a citizen, I know I should check on her, ensure she has water and her fan is working. The city expects us to look out for one another, especially the vulnerable.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. Maria\u2019s faith wavered, and she needed me. But Mrs. Rossi\u2019s safety could depend on a simple visit. My heart ached, pulled by the sacred duty of my vocation and the civic responsibility I hold as a member of this community."}
