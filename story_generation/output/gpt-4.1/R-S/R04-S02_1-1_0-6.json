Notifications are flooding in\u2014my latest post about our cause is going viral. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, a rare chance to reach thousands, maybe more, with a single comment. My fingers itch to type, to seize the momentum and educate, to fulfill my duty as an activist. But the small congregation is gathering, looking to me to lead the prayer. Another worshipper, fully qualified, is already here and could easily step in. Yet, as the imam, I know the community expects my presence, my voice guiding them in worship, no matter how few attend. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down, the sacred calm of the mosque at odds with the urgent buzz of activism. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the expectations\u2014do I stay and lead, honoring my commitment to the congregation, or do I step aside, just this once, to answer the call of a wider audience?"}
