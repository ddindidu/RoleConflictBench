Her father had just passed, and she was in tears, pleading for me to officiate the funeral tomorrow morning. As their rabbi, I knew how much this meant to her family\u2014how they needed comfort, tradition, and my presence to guide them through grief. Yet, my calendar glared back at me: tomorrow at the same hour, I was due in court as an advocate for a client whose future hung in the balance. The judge had warned that any delay could jeopardize the case. My client, a single mother, was counting on me to be there, to speak for her when no one else would. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one expecting spiritual leadership and solace, the other demanding unwavering commitment and punctuality. My heart ached as I imagined letting either side down, torn between the sacred duty to my congregation and the ethical responsibility to my client. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decided, someone would be left waiting."}
