As a Christian, I\u2019ve always believed in honesty and integrity, values my faith holds dear. But now, the election official was explaining that my name didn\u2019t match the registration list exactly. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form,\u201d she said, her voice firm but rushed. \u201cWe\u2019re closing in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the form. It asked me to affirm, under penalty of law, that I was eligible to vote. I knew I was, but the mismatch made me uneasy. My church teaches that even the appearance of dishonesty is wrong. Yet, as a voter, I\u2019m expected to follow the official\u2019s instructions and trust the process. The line behind me grew restless. I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing against the quiet voice of my conscience. My hands trembled as I held the pen, torn between the expectations of my faith and the demands of my role as a voter."}
