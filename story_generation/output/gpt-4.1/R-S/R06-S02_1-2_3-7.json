My phone buzzes in my hand\u2014five minutes until I go live on the radio to talk about climate justice, a cause that\u2019s become my second heartbeat. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My church community expects me to be present, to worship together, to show my faith not just in words but in action and fellowship. Yet, the activist in me knows how crucial this radio segment is; it\u2019s a rare chance to reach thousands, to educate, to maybe spark change. My pastor\u2019s words echo in my mind about keeping the Sabbath holy, while my activist friends text encouragement, counting on my voice. My heart pounds with guilt and anticipation, torn between the sanctuary\u2019s peace and the urgency of the airwaves. I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the strain of two callings pulling me in opposite directions."}
