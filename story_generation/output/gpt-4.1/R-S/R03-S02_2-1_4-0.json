She\u2019s been ill for weeks, and the community is gathering in prayer, hoping for a miracle. As I slip my rosary into my pocket, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist. \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Police are here. Can you come?\u201d I glance at the clock. The healing service and the demonstration overlap. My heart pounds. The sisters expect me to be present, to pray, to offer comfort and faith. But my activist friends count on me to stand with them, to raise our voices for justice. I feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. I want to be in two places at once, to honor my vows and my convictions. My hands tremble as I stand in the hallway, caught between the chapel\u2019s warm light and the cold urgency of the street outside, unsure which door to open."}
