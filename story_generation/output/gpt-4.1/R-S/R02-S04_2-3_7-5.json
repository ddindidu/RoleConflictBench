As their priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present, to nurture their faith. I glanced at the clock\u20146:30 p.m. The class would last an hour, as always. But tonight, the polls closed at 8 p.m., and I had just realized my ID was at home, a twenty-minute drive away. As a citizen, I was expected to vote, to fulfill my civic duty, and tonight was my only chance. My heart pounded as I weighed the trust the parish placed in me against my responsibility as a voter. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint the children and their families, perhaps even lose their confidence. If I stayed, I\u2019d forfeit my voice in the election, something I always preached was a moral responsibility. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, standing in the hallway, keys in my hand, unable to move."}
