My abaya is neatly pressed, my hijab pinned just right\u2014ready to step into the main prayer hall for Jumu\u2019ah. The imam\u2019s voice echoes, reminding us to leave worldly distractions behind. But my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. I glance down and see the notification: the post about our campaign for refugee rights is exploding online. Hundreds are commenting, asking questions, hungry for more information. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist\u2014an opportunity to educate, to amplify our message, to make a real difference. But the expectation as a Muslim is clear: to enter the prayer hall with full presence, to disconnect from the world and focus on worship, leaving my phone and its demands outside. My heart pounds as I weigh the urgency of my cause against the sanctity of this moment. The doors to the prayer hall open, and I stand frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my full attention."}
