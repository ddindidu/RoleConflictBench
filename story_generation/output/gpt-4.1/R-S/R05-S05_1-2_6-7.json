They wanted me to officiate their wedding\u2014over a year from now, but they needed an answer today. My calendar was open, but I hesitated, glancing at the clock. In fifteen minutes, I had to be at the courthouse, where my client\u2019s future hung in the balance. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; missing the session could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for. Yet, as a rabbi, I was expected to be present, attentive, and supportive, especially at the start of such a significant journey for this couple. My mind raced, torn between the sacred trust of guiding a new family and the urgent responsibility to defend someone in need. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
