The only kosher vendor was a small cart at the far end, and I knew if I didn\u2019t eat now, I\u2019d be running on empty for the rest of the day. But just as I started toward the cart, my phone buzzed with a notification: the activist group I\u2019d been working with was about to send a crucial petition to a lawmaker. They needed my signature\u2014now. I could see the expectation in both worlds: my Jewish identity urging me to keep kosher, to honor the laws that shaped my daily life, and my activist self demanding I seize this fleeting moment to make a difference. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands\u2014if I stopped to eat, I might miss the petition; if I signed now, I might lose my chance at a kosher meal. The pressure of both roles pressed in, each one asking for my loyalty, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I stood frozen between the cart and my phone, unable to move."}
