As a Jewish parent, I felt the weight of tradition pressing on my shoulders\u2014he still stumbled over the Hebrew, and I was supposed to guide him, to make sure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the community center: as a volunteer, I was expected to attend the safety training session that evening. The coordinator had stressed how crucial it was to follow the new guidelines, especially after last week\u2019s incident. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. If I missed the training, I\u2019d be letting down the team and possibly putting others at risk. But if I left my son to practice alone, I\u2019d be failing him at a pivotal moment in his Jewish journey. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out how to honor both commitments, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
