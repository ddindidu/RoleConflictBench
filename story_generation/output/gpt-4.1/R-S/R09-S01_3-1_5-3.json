As a volunteer, I was expected to mingle, to make everyone feel comfortable and included. The people I was helping chatted easily, and I joined in, careful to respect their privacy, steering clear of anything too personal. But as plates were passed around, I hesitated. The food looked delicious, but I knew it wasn\u2019t kosher\u2014there was no certification, and I couldn\u2019t be sure how it was prepared. My Jewish upbringing tugged at me, reminding me of the importance of keeping kosher, especially in public. Yet, as a volunteer, I felt the unspoken pressure to accept what was offered, to avoid drawing attention or making anyone feel awkward. My hands hovered over the serving spoon, my mind racing. If I refused, would I seem ungrateful or distant? If I accepted, would I be betraying my own values? The conversation continued around me, but inside, I was caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
