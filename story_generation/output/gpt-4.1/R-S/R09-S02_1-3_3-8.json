This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist\u2014an opportunity to reach thousands, maybe millions, and correct the dangerous narrative spreading about our cause. I glance at the clock. It\u2019s nearly lunchtime, and I haven\u2019t eaten since early morning. My stomach growls, but I know the studio only stocks generic snacks\u2014none of them kosher. At home, the pantry is full of matzo, tuna, and fruit, all carefully chosen to honor my Jewish commitment to kashrut. I could grab something here, but it would mean breaking a promise I\u2019ve kept since childhood. My mind races: Do I rush out hungry, risking distraction and fatigue on live TV? Or do I eat what\u2019s available, betraying a core part of my identity for the sake of the cause? The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding loyalty, each unwilling to yield. I stare at the phone, torn, the seconds ticking away."}
