The church bell rings in the distance, calling the faithful to Sunday worship. As a Christian, I know I should be there, joining the congregation in prayer and song, feeling the comfort of community and the presence of God. I promised myself I\u2019d go this week, to reconnect and show my commitment. But as a citizen, I can\u2019t ignore the ballot measure that will shape the future of my block. The polling place is just down the street, but it closes in two hours. I feel the weight of responsibility\u2014my neighbors are counting on every vote, and I\u2019ve always believed in participating in civic life. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the church group, while a text from a neighbor urges me to vote. I stand in my hallway, torn, the expectations of faith and citizenship pulling me in opposite directions. My chest tightens as I realize I can\u2019t do both."}
