Today was the day of our monthly food drive, and the sisters were counting on me to help organize and distribute meals at the shelter. The faces of the hungry, the gratitude in their eyes, always reminded me why I chose this life of service. Yet, as I rose to join the others, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the trial scheduled for noon. My client\u2019s fate hung in the balance; I was their only hope in a system that too often failed the vulnerable. The convent expected my presence, my hands busy with charity, but the courtroom demanded my voice, my advocacy. I could not be in two places at once. The weight of both callings pressed on my chest, each tugging me in a different direction, each expecting my full devotion. I stood in the hallway, torn, the echoes of hymns mingling with the distant clamor of justice, uncertain which path to take."}
