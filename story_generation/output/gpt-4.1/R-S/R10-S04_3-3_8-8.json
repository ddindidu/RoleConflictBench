The air was thick with incense, and the sound of bells echoed as I hurried through the crowd, determined not to miss the main ritual. My relatives were waiting, the priest had already begun the prayers, and I could feel the weight of their expectations\u2014this festival was important, and my presence mattered.\n\nBut before I could enter, I remembered my duty as a voter. The polling station was just down the street, and today was the last day to cast my ballot. I rushed over, only to be told by an official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes.\n\nMy heart pounded. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the festival\u2019s most sacred moment, disappointing my family and breaking tradition. If I left, I\u2019d fail in my civic duty, letting my voice go unheard. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between faith and responsibility, unable to move."}
