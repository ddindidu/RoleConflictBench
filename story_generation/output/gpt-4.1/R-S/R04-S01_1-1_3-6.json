Yet, this week, we had a guest speaker, someone respected and prepared, ready to step in if needed. I could sense the anticipation in the air, people glancing at me, waiting for a sign of who would ascend the pulpit. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: a gentle nudge to reorganize the supply closet if I found a spare moment. It seemed simple, but I knew the supplies were a mess, and it would take time and focus to do it right. I stood in the hallway, torn. If I delivered the sermon, I\u2019d fulfill my duty as imam, but the supplies would remain chaotic, and I\u2019d disappoint the coordinator. If I let the guest speaker take over, I could finally tackle the supplies, but would the community feel let down by my absence? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pull of both roles, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
