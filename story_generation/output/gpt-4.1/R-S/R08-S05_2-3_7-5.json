The dates for Hajj were circled in red, a promise I had made to myself and to God. My savings were ready, and my friends had already booked their flights. This was the year I was supposed to fulfill my religious duty, a journey I had dreamed of for so long. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my client was set for the same week. Their entire future hinged on my presence in court, my preparation, my advocacy. I could feel the weight of their trust pressing on my shoulders, knowing how much they depended on me. The expectations from my faith and my profession clashed inside me, each demanding my full commitment. I felt torn, guilt creeping in no matter which path I considered. My heart ached with the fear of letting someone down, whether it was my client or my Creator. I closed my eyes, caught in the storm of conflicting duties, unsure which call I would answer."}
