As a Buddhist, I am expected to join the community in the memorial service, to honor the departed and support grieving families. My presence is not just tradition\u2014it\u2019s a gesture of compassion and solidarity. Yet, my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. My client, desperate and anxious, faces an urgent legal crisis. As their advocate, I am bound to provide clear, timely advice; their next steps depend on my guidance. The weight of both roles presses on me. I feel the pull of the temple, the eyes of elders expecting my participation, the comfort my presence brings. At the same time, I sense my client\u2019s fear, their trust in my expertise, the consequences if I delay. My mind races, torn between the serenity of ritual and the urgency of justice, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
