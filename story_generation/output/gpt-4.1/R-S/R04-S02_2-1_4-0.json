My notes for the Friday sermon are spread before me, carefully prepared for a congregation that expects guidance and inspiration. The topic\u2014justice and compassion\u2014has been announced for days, and I know the community is waiting to hear my words. My phone buzzes urgently. A fellow activist is live-streaming from a protest downtown, calling for more people to join. The demonstration is small, but the issue is pressing, and my presence could make a difference. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. As imam, I am the sole speaker today; the community relies on me to lead them in prayer and reflection. As an activist, I am expected to stand up, visibly and vocally, for justice in the streets. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the pulpit and the protest, knowing that whichever path I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
