My heart ached with longing\u2014I knew that as a Muslim, performing Hajj was a pillar of my faith, a journey I dreamed of but couldn\u2019t yet afford. Early in my career, every paycheck was carefully budgeted, and the cost of pilgrimage felt impossibly out of reach. Lost in thought, I finished my snack and glanced at the crumpled wrapper in my hand. The nearest trash bin was a few steps away, right beside a sign: \u201cNo Littering\u2014Keep Our Park Clean.\u201d As a responsible citizen, I knew I should respect public property and follow the law, but my mind wandered to the sacrifices I was making, saving every bit for Hajj. The wrapper felt heavier than it should, a symbol of the choices and expectations pressing on me from all sides. I stood there, torn between the small, immediate duty to my community and the distant, sacred obligation to my faith, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in different directions."}
