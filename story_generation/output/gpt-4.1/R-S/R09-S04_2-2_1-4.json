The children\u2019s voices echo in the kitchen, reminding me that the holiday is almost here. I promised myself I\u2019d teach them the blessings this year, not just recite them hurriedly at the table. My mother\u2019s words ring in my ears: \u201cPass on our traditions, or they fade.\u201d But as I glance at the clock, anxiety tightens in my chest. Today is the only morning I can swing by home to grab my ID before work\u2014without it, I can\u2019t vote, and the polls close tomorrow. Civic duty tugs at me; my community expects me to show up, to have a say. But if I leave now, the kids will go another day without learning the blessings, and I\u2019ll break my promise to them\u2014and to myself. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the weight of heritage and the call of democracy, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in."}
