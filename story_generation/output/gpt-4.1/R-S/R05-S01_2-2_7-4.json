The family had planned every detail for months, and my presence was essential. As I checked my watch, a woman approached the volunteer check-in table, her hands trembling as she filled out the forms. I recognized her from previous visits. She leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and confided a deeply personal concern, trusting me as a volunteer to keep her words private. My mind raced\u2014she needed support, but the bar mitzvah was moments away, and as the rabbi, I was expected to be present, calm, and focused for the family\u2019s milestone. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the sacred duty to the congregation and the ethical promise to this vulnerable woman. My heart pounded as I stood between the sanctuary and the check-in table, torn by the incompatible expectations of the rabbi and the volunteer within me."}
