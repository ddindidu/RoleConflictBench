The kitchen was already bustling when I slipped out to cast my ballot, determined to fulfill my civic duty before returning to serve. At the polling station, I carefully filled out my ballot, but as I handed it over, the poll worker frowned and pointed out a smudge on the envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she said gently. I glanced at the clock, anxiety prickling at my skin. The food drive was starting, and the sisters would be looking for me to help organize the donations. Yet, as a voter, I was expected to follow every instruction to ensure my ballot was valid. I felt torn\u2014my heart tugged toward the shelter, but my conscience insisted I do this right.
