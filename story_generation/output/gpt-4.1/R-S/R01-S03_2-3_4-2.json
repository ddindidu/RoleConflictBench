As a pastor, I was there to support a member of my congregation\u2014Maria\u2014who had confided in me about her family\u2019s struggles and her desperate hope that this protest might bring change. She clung to my arm, her voice trembling as she pleaded for guidance, her eyes searching mine for reassurance and strength. \n\nBut then, a protest organizer pressed a sign into my hand and urged us to cross the barricade, insisting that real change required bold action. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear: crossing that line was trespassing, a violation of public order. Yet Maria\u2019s hope seemed to rest on my willingness to stand with her, to show her that her pain mattered, that I would not abandon her in this moment. The weight of my collar felt heavier than ever, caught between my duty to support those in need and my responsibility to respect the law and the rights of others. I hesitated, torn, the noise of the crowd echoing the turmoil inside me."}
