Tonight was Shabbat, and my family was already preparing to leave for synagogue. The familiar melodies and the comfort of community awaited me, as they did every week. My rabbi often reminded us of the importance of being present, of keeping the tradition alive through our attendance. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tomorrow\u2019s hearing for my client, a single mother fighting for custody, hinged on my preparation tonight. She trusted me to be her voice, to catch every detail, to give her hope. I could hear my father\u2019s words in my mind\u2014\u201cWe are responsible for each other\u201d\u2014but which responsibility was greater? The synagogue would not miss me for one night, but my client might lose everything if I was unprepared. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the pull of my faith and the weight of my duty as an advocate."}
