As the pastor, I felt a gentle nudge to share a story from scripture, something uplifting about compassion and justice. It was second nature to me, weaving faith into daily life, and I could see a few faces light up as I spoke. But as the story ended, I glanced at my watch and remembered the polling station was open all day. I had promised myself I would vote, fulfilling my civic duty, but now people lingered, asking questions about the story, seeking guidance. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014to be present, to listen, to lead spiritually. Yet, as a voter, I knew I was expected to show up at the polls, to participate in shaping our community\u2019s future. The hours stretched ahead, but the pull between staying with my flock and stepping away to vote gnawed at me. I felt torn, caught between the sacred trust of my congregation and the responsibility I owed as a citizen."}
