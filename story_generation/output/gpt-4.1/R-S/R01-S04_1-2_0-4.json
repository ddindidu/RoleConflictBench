As her pastor, I felt the familiar tug to offer comfort, to sit beside her and listen, to remind her she is not alone. My heart ached to fulfill my calling, to be present for her in her pain. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety twisted in my chest. Today is my only chance to drive home and retrieve my ID before the polls close tomorrow. If I don\u2019t go now, I might lose my chance to vote\u2014a civic duty I value deeply. The congregation expects me to be their shepherd, always available, always compassionate. Yet, as a citizen, I am expected to participate in our democracy, to show up prepared. I stood in the aisle, torn between the quiet suffering of a parishioner and the pressing responsibility of my vote, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
