The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I had promised myself I would vote\u2014my civic duty, my voice in the world. But just as I was about to cross, I saw a man slumped on the sidewalk, groaning in pain, clutching his side. No one else seemed to notice. My mind raced with the teachings I\u2019d grown up with: love your neighbor, help those in need, be the Good Samaritan. But the clock was ticking, and if I stopped, I might miss my chance to vote, to stand up for what I believed was right for my community. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my faith urging me to kneel beside the man, my responsibility as a voter pushing me toward the polling station. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me, as I stood frozen between two roads, each demanding something I could not give to both."}
