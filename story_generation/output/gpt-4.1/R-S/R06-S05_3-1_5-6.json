My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the church service I\u2019d promised to help organize. I could already picture Mrs. Evans\u2019 warm smile and the children\u2019s laughter echoing in the fellowship hall. My heart ached to be there, to worship and serve, as my faith taught me.\n\nBut another notification flashed: a message from my law firm. The advocacy group I represent had called an emergency meeting, scheduled at the same time as the service. The case was urgent, and my presence was non-negotiable. My colleagues depended on me to speak for our client, to ensure justice wasn\u2019t delayed.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My church family expected my devotion and presence, while my professional duty demanded punctuality and unwavering commitment. I stared at my phone, torn between the sanctuary and the courtroom, my faith and my calling, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
