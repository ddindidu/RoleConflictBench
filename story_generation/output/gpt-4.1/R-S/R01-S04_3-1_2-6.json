As her pastor, I was supposed to offer spiritual guidance, to help her find peace in the midst of her crisis. She was desperate for clarity, and I\u2019d promised to pray for her, to be present in her struggle. Now, as a voter, I was expected to follow the election officials\u2019 instructions without question. \u201cIf your last name begins with A through M, please move to the new line,\u201d the official called out. My last name fit the criteria, but the new line was barely moving, while the original one inched forward steadily. Around me, some people grumbled and stayed put, but I hesitated. As a pastor, I preached integrity and respect for authority, but as a voter, I felt the frustration of being shuffled around, possibly delaying my return to the church and the people who needed me. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding obedience, the other urging compassion and presence. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my faith and my civic duty, unsure which line to choose."}
