The sisters and I had prepared baskets of bread and fruit, our hearts set on helping those who have so little. As I carried boxes to the shelter, I passed a street demonstration swelling with voices demanding justice for the homeless. A woman recognized me and called out, \u201cSister, stand with us! We need you!\u201d She pointed to the barricade blocking access to city hall, where officials were rumored to be ignoring our pleas. \u201cIf you cross, they\u2019ll have to listen,\u201d she urged.\n\nMy hands trembled. As a nun, I am called to serve, to stand with the poor and amplify their needs. But as a citizen, I am bound to respect the law and public order. The crowd\u2019s eyes turned to me, expecting leadership, courage. Yet, I felt the weight of my vows and the city\u2019s rules pressing in from both sides. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the barricade, torn between the call to serve and the duty to obey."}
