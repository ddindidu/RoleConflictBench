I set my phone aside, opened the Quran, and let the familiar verses wash over me, eager to reflect and reconnect with my faith. Just as I began to lose myself in the words, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a client, desperate and anxious, facing an urgent legal crisis that couldn\u2019t wait until morning. As an advocate, I knew my responsibility: to provide clear, accurate advice, especially when someone\u2019s future might hinge on my guidance. But as a Muslim, I felt the pull to honor this sacred time, to immerse myself in reflection and spiritual growth. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my client\u2019s trust and need for immediate help, and my own longing to fulfill my religious duty. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my profession and the peace I sought in my faith, unsure which call to answer first."}
