My rabbi called yesterday, reminding me how meaningful it is to lead the congregation, especially now, when so many are seeking comfort and tradition. But as a citizen, I also feel the weight of civic duty. The city is running a free vaccine clinic at the community center, and volunteers are needed. The mayor\u2019s office sent out a call for help, emphasizing how crucial it is for public health. I\u2019ve always believed in doing my part\u2014paying taxes on time, following guidelines, and stepping up in emergencies. My tax documents are ready, but the clinic is only this weekend, the same time as the service. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart aches as I picture the faces at synagogue, waiting for me, and the line of neighbors at the clinic, hoping for reassurance and a shot. I feel torn, pulled by faith and civic responsibility, unsure which expectation I can bear to disappoint."}
