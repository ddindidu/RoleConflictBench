The abbot greets me warmly, his eyes full of hope. \u201cWe need you, especially today,\u201d he says, gesturing to the rows of lanterns and offerings waiting to be arranged. The annual festival is sacred, a time when the whole community comes together, and I know my absence would be noticed. My heart swells with the familiar sense of belonging, the gentle rhythm of chanting already beginning in the main hall.\n\nBut my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the court session scheduled for later this morning. My client\u2019s future depends on my presence and preparation. The legal team expects me to be there, sharp and focused, not distracted or late. I feel the weight of their trust, the pressure to advocate fiercely and professionally.\n\nAs I stand between the temple\u2019s golden glow and the cold logic of the law, anxiety knots in my stomach. Both worlds call to me, each with its own sacred duty. I close my eyes, torn, the expectations of my community and my client pulling me in opposite directions."}
