Today, while volunteering at the community center, I noticed Sarah, a regular visitor, looking more withdrawn than usual. My heart ached for her, and I wanted to reach out, to let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. During a break, a few volunteers gathered for coffee, and the conversation drifted toward how some people seemed to be struggling lately. I felt a strong urge to share my concern for Sarah, hoping others might join me in supporting her. But as a volunteer, I\u2019m expected to respect everyone\u2019s privacy, never discussing their situations without consent. The tension inside me grew\u2014my faith urged me to rally support and show compassion, but my role as a volunteer demanded discretion. I sat there, torn, the words on the tip of my tongue, wrestling with the weight of both expectations."}
