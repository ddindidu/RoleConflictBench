As an activist, I was expected to be at the front, rallying everyone, making sure our message was heard. But as I waited, I saw a colleague quietly slip ahead in the coffee line, cutting in front of an elderly woman. My upbringing as a Hindu pressed on me\u2014the importance of dharma, of standing up for what\u2019s right, even in small moments. I felt a tug to speak up, to gently call out the unfairness, to honor the ethical principles I\u2019d been taught. But the clock was ticking, and the crowd outside was growing restless, waiting for me to lead. If I intervened now, I might be late, letting down my fellow activists and weakening our cause. My heart pounded as I weighed the quiet, personal act of justice against the louder, collective fight for change. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined me, unsure which voice to follow."}
