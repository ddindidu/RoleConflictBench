She was tearful, pleading for me to officiate the funeral tomorrow morning. As their rabbi, I knew how much this meant to her family, how they needed my presence and guidance to help them through their grief. Yet, as I hung up, my eyes fell on the thick file on my desk\u2014the legal brief for Mr. Cohen\u2019s case, scheduled for court at the very same time. As his advocate, I was his voice, the one he trusted to represent him in a dispute that could change his life. Both roles demanded my full attention, my compassion, my expertise. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, my heart torn between the sacred duty to comfort the bereaved and the professional responsibility to defend my client. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that no matter what I decided, someone would be left needing me."}
