My heart swelled with purpose\u2014this was my calling, to guide others in understanding the deeper truths of our faith. The schedule was tight, every session crucial, and I knew my congregation expected me to be present, attentive, and unwavering in my commitment to their spiritual growth.\n\nBut as I glanced at my watch, a cold wave of anxiety washed over me. The polls would close in just a few hours, and tonight was my only chance to vote. I\u2019d forgotten my ID at home, and retrieving it would mean leaving the workshop at a critical moment. As a citizen, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me\u2014my voice mattered, and I owed it to my community to participate.\n\nI could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions: my congregation needed my leadership, but my country needed my vote. My chest tightened as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the pulpit and the polling place, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
