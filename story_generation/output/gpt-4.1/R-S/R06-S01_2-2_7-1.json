The coordinator had sent a firm reminder last night: \u201cPlease be on time\u2014every minute counts.\u201d I know how much they rely on us, especially when the roster is tight. As I was about to leave, I got a text from Sarah, a friend from church. She\u2019s been struggling lately, and today she sounded worse than ever. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d she wrote. My heart ached. As a Christian, I believe in showing love and kindness, being there for those in need, just as Jesus taught. But the clock was ticking, and I knew the pantry couldn\u2019t spare a single volunteer. I stood in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between the urgent need to be present for Sarah and my commitment to the pantry. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising inside, unsure which path to take."}
