In ten minutes, the children would gather in the synagogue classroom, waiting for me to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion. Their parents trusted me to nurture their Jewish identity, to answer their questions with patience and wisdom. I could already picture their eager faces, the way they leaned forward when I spoke about Moses and the commandments. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder of the court session across town. As an advocate, I was expected to be there, sharp and prepared, to speak for a client whose future might hinge on my words. The judge would not wait, and my absence could tip the scales. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. The sacred duty to teach, the urgent call to defend. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I could not split myself in two. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, lesson plan in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
