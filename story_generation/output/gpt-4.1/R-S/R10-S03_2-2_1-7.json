The gentle glow and the scent of incense always bring me peace, grounding me in my faith. But today, a heat advisory blared on my phone, warning everyone to stay cool and check on vulnerable neighbors. I remembered Mrs. Sharma, the elderly woman living alone on my floor. As a responsible citizen, I felt compelled to visit her, make sure she had water, and perhaps help her set up her fan. Yet, the time for my daily puja was slipping away. My family expects me to uphold our rituals, and I feel guilty even thinking of postponing them. But what if Mrs. Sharma needs help right now? The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my devotion to my faith and my duty to my community. I stand in the hallway, torn, the lamp in one hand and my phone in the other, heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
