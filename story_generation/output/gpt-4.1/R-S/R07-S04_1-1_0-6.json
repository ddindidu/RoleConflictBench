The temple\u2019s evening chant would begin soon, and as a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, joining the community in recitation and reflection. The familiar comfort of the ritual called to me, a gentle reminder of my commitment to the sangha. But here I was, a citizen and a voter, determined to fulfill my civic duty. Suddenly, an official announced that voters with last names A\u2013M should move to a new line. My last name started with \u201cK.\u201d The new line was longer and slower, but the official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014these were the rules, and I was expected to comply. I hesitated, torn between the urge to stay in the faster line and the pressure to obey the instructions. My mind raced: if I followed the official\u2019s order, I\u2019d miss the chant and let down my temple community. If I stayed, I\u2019d be disregarding the rules and my responsibility as a voter. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising, caught between two worlds that both mattered deeply."}
