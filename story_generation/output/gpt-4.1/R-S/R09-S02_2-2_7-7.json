The synagogue is already filling with familiar faces, and I\u2019m supposed to chant my Torah portion in just a few minutes. My rabbi caught my eye earlier, nodding encouragement, and I know how much it means to my family and community that I\u2019m here, honoring tradition. But my phone buzzes again\u2014reminding me that the live radio segment starts in five minutes. As an activist, I\u2019ve been fighting for months to get this kind of platform, a chance to reach thousands and educate them about our cause. The host is waiting, the audience is waiting, and my fellow activists are counting on me to speak up. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred pull of my faith and the urgent call of my activism. My hands tremble as I hold my prayer book in one and my phone in the other, torn between the sanctuary\u2019s quiet expectation and the electric promise of the airwaves. I close my eyes, wishing I could split myself in two, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
