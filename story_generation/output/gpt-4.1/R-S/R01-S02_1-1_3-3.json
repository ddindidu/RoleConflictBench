My phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, a quiet member of our congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself to check in on her tonight. As I typed a gentle message, another notification popped up\u2014a reminder from the activist group. The petition to our state senator was closing in ten minutes, and my signature was still missing. They needed every voice, especially from community leaders like me, to push for the policy change we\u2019d worked so hard for.\n\nMy thumb hovered over the petition link, but my mind drifted back to Mrs. Lee. She needed comfort, a reminder that she wasn\u2019t alone. Yet, the cause needed my public support, and I knew my name could make a difference. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one calling for quiet compassion, the other for bold action. My heart pounded as I stared at the two open messages, torn between the gentle duty of a pastor and the urgent call of an activist."}
