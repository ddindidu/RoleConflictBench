The lamp flickers, casting golden shadows on the faces of the deities. This is my time for prayer, a daily ritual that grounds me, connects me to my roots, and brings peace to my restless mind. Just as I close my eyes, my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s a message from Priya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from a protest downtown, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come. The turnout is low.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounds. I know how important this demonstration is\u2014raising awareness about the new housing policy that will displace hundreds. I want to be there, to stand with my friends, to make a difference. But I also feel the weight of my faith, the expectation to complete my prayers without rush or distraction. My family believes this ritual is essential, especially today, an auspicious day on the calendar. I sit frozen, torn between the call of my beliefs and the call of my conscience, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
