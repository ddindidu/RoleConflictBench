It was Mrs. Evans, her voice trembling, telling me her house had been destroyed in the storm last night. As a pastor, I knew my community needed me\u2014people were gathering at the church, desperate for comfort and guidance. I could already picture the anxious faces, the children clinging to their parents, the questions they would ask me about faith and hope in the face of such loss.\n\nBut as an advocate, I was expected at a meeting in less than an hour, and the court session that followed was one I couldn\u2019t miss. My clients depended on me to be their voice, to fight for their rights, and punctuality was non-negotiable. The judge had already warned me about tardiness.\n\nI stood in my office, keys in hand, heart pounding. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my congregation\u2019s pain on one side, my clients\u2019 trust on the other. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
