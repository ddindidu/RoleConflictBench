The committee expected me to lead tonight\u2019s planning meeting, to inspire and organize, to ensure our parishioners would find meaning and growth in the months ahead. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from my client, anxious and confused. Their case had taken a complicated turn, and they needed my legal expertise now, not later. As an advocate, I owed them clarity and guidance, a steady hand through the maze of legal jargon and uncertainty. But as a priest, I was the shepherd, responsible for nurturing the faith of my community. Both roles demanded my full presence, my compassion, my wisdom. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, my mind racing with possible solutions, my heart torn by the knowledge that I could not give both my best at the same time. The clock ticked closer to the meeting, and I stared at my phone, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
