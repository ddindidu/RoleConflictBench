The Torah portion this week was about responsibility, and I had prepared stories and questions to spark their curiosity. As I passed a bench, I noticed a group of children\u2014some from my congregation\u2014finishing their snacks. Wrappers fluttered to the ground, ignored. I glanced at the posted no-littering sign and the trash bin just a few steps away. As a citizen, I felt the urge to remind them to respect public property, to pick up after themselves, to follow the law. But as their rabbi, I worried about embarrassing them in public, damaging the trust I\u2019d worked so hard to build, or making them feel judged right before our class. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to the community against my responsibility as their spiritual guide. I hesitated, torn between speaking up as a responsible citizen and approaching them as a compassionate rabbi."}
