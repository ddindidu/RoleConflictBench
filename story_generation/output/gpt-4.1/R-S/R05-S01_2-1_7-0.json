Today was David\u2019s bar mitzvah, a day his family had anticipated for months. As his rabbi, I was expected to guide him through the ceremony, offer blessings, and be fully present for his big moment. But as I reviewed my calendar, I remembered my commitment as a volunteer at the local food pantry. My shift started just an hour before the ceremony, and I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there\u2014reliable, as always. I knew other volunteers could cover the first part of my shift, but I hated the idea of letting them down or appearing less committed. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the congregation counting on my leadership, the pantry relying on my consistency. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. I sat at my kitchen table, hands wrapped around my coffee mug, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
