The phone buzzes with a message from Mrs. Ramirez\u2014her son\u2019s sacrament is this weekend, and she pleads for one last preparation session tonight. I know how much this means to her family, and as their priest, I\u2019m expected to guide them, to be present, to ensure the children are ready for this sacred step. I glance at my other phone, where a fellow activist is live-streaming from the city square. The protest is small, the cause urgent, and she\u2019s asking for backup. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to show up, to stand in solidarity, to be counted when it matters. My heart pounds as I weigh the needs of my parish against the call for justice outside these walls. Both roles demand my presence, my leadership, my voice\u2014tonight, I cannot be in two places at once. I stare at the clock, feeling the pressure of expectation from both worlds, torn by the knowledge that whatever I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
