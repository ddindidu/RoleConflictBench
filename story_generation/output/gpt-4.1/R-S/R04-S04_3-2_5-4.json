Today marks a milestone for our community, and I am expected to deliver the Friday sermon\u2014one that many have travelled far to hear. As imam, I feel the weight of their expectations; my words must inspire, guide, and unite. Yet, as I prepare, a sharp reminder cuts through my focus: I must vote in the national election, and my only valid ID is at home, a forty-minute drive away. The polls are open tomorrow, but tomorrow is packed with pastoral visits and a funeral. If I don\u2019t retrieve my ID now, I may lose my chance to vote\u2014a civic duty I hold dear. My congregation expects my presence and leadership, but my country expects my participation. I feel torn, my heart pounding with the pressure of both responsibilities. The clock ticks, and I stand at the threshold, wrestling with the impossible choice between my faith community and my role as a citizen."}
