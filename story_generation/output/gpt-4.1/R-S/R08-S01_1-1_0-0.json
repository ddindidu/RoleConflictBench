I\u2019ve been looking forward to this\u2014time to recite and reflect on the Quran, something I promised myself I\u2019d do more often. The words bring me peace, and I feel closest to Allah in these moments. But as I settle in, my phone buzzes: a reminder about my volunteer shift at the shelter. I\u2019m expected to be there on time, to help set up and greet the guests. I know the others can cover for me if I\u2019m a little late, but I also know how much the team values reliability. My heart tugs in two directions. I want to honor my commitment to my faith, to spend this rare, quiet evening in spiritual reflection. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to let down the people who count on me at the shelter. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I sit there, torn, the Quran in my lap and my volunteer badge on the table, unsure which path to take."}
