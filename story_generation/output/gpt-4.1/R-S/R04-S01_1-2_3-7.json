As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Friday sermon, a responsibility I cherished and prepared for all week. Yet today, an invited guest speaker was ready, his notes in hand, waiting for my signal to take the pulpit if needed. At the same time, as a volunteer, I had just been reminded by the coordinator about the new safety steps\u2014every volunteer was expected to enforce them without exception, especially during large gatherings like this.\n\nThe guest speaker, unfamiliar with our new protocols, seemed unsure about the safety measures. The coordinator caught my eye, silently urging me to ensure everyone, including the guest, followed the guidelines. My mind raced: should I step aside as imam and focus on my volunteer duties, guiding the guest through the safety steps? Or should I fulfill my spiritual obligation and deliver the sermon myself, risking a lapse in the new safety procedures? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt a knot of anxiety form in my chest as the congregation began to gather."}
