My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTomorrow, please share the essence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings with the sangha.\u201d I felt honored, but also the weight of responsibility\u2014how could I distill such wisdom clearly? I opened my sutras, ready to reflect, when my phone buzzed. Friends from the neighborhood were at a demonstration downtown, calling for justice. \u201cCome, we need your voice,\u201d one text read. I hurried out, robes tucked under my jacket, and soon found myself among the crowd, chanting for change.\n\nSuddenly, a surge of people pressed forward. Someone grabbed my arm, urging, \u201cLet\u2019s cross the barricade! We have to make them listen.\u201d I froze. As a Buddhist, I should act with mindfulness, avoid harm, and respect the law. As a citizen, I felt the urge to stand up for what\u2019s right, to join others in demanding justice. My heart pounded. Should I step forward, risking arrest and breaking the law, or hold back, possibly betraying my friends and my own sense of justice? The teachings I was to summarize tomorrow seemed both near and impossibly far."}
