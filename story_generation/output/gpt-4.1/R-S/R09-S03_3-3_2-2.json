The demonstration is for a cause I believe in, but the police have set up barricades, and a fellow protester urges us to step over, insisting it\u2019s the only way to make our voices heard. I hesitate, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a citizen to respect the law and public order. But my mind is also with my son\u2014his bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he still struggles with his Torah portion. I promised to teach him about our Jewish traditions, to show him the importance of values and history, of standing up for what\u2019s right. Yet, what lesson do I teach if I break the law in front of him? My heart pounds as I look at his uncertain face, torn between the expectations of my faith and my duty as a citizen, wrestling with what example I should set for him in this moment."}
