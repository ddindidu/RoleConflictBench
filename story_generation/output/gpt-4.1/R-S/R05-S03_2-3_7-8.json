Months of preparation have led to this moment, and the congregation\u2019s eyes are on me, expecting guidance, celebration, and calm. Suddenly, the shrill wail of the building\u2019s alarm pierces the air, and my phone vibrates with a flash-flood warning. Through the stained glass, I see water pooling along the curb, creeping higher. As a rabbi, I am expected to shepherd this family through their sacred milestone, to offer stability and joy. But as a citizen, I know I am responsible for the safety of everyone here, to heed emergency protocols and ensure no one is put in harm\u2019s way. My heart pounds as I weigh the sanctity of this rite of passage against the urgent need to evacuate. The congregation looks to me for reassurance, the family for fulfillment of their hopes, and the city for responsible action. I feel torn, caught between the sacred and the civic, unsure which duty should come first."}
