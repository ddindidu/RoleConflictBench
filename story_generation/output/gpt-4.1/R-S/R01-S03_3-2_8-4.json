Tonight was the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing for\u2014an opportunity to guide our community leaders through the deeper layers of faith, to help them wrestle with questions that matter. As their pastor, I felt the weight of their trust, the expectation that I would lead them with wisdom and conviction. But as I glanced at my phone, a notification flashed: the online candidate forum for our district was starting. As a citizen, I knew my responsibility\u2014to listen, to question, to vote with discernment, to be a voice for justice in our city. Both roles demanded my full attention, both felt urgent, both mattered deeply. I could hear the church hall filling with voices, waiting for me to begin. At the same time, I imagined the forum, the candidates answering questions that would shape our future. My mind raced, torn between the pulpit and the polling place, between shepherding souls and shaping society. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension pull me in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
