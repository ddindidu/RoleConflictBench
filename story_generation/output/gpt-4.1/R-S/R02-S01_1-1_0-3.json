The daily prayers were optional, but I knew some members cherished the quiet ritual, expecting my presence and guidance. As I tidied up, a woman I\u2019d been helping as a volunteer approached, her voice low and hesitant. She began sharing details about her struggles\u2014nothing too sensitive, but personal enough that I felt the weight of her trust. I listened, nodding, aware that as a volunteer, I was expected to respect her privacy, to keep her words safe. Yet, as a priest, I felt a gentle tug to offer her spiritual support, perhaps even mention her in the community\u2019s prayers. But would that betray her confidence? My mind raced, torn between the comfort my prayers might bring and the sacred trust she\u2019d placed in me. The bell chimed, signaling the start of the next prayer service. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of my two roles, unsure which path to take."}
