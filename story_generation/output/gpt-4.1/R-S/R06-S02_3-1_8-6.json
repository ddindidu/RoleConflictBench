She\u2019d just lost her job, and her world was unraveling. As a Christian, I knew this was the moment to show love and compassion, to be fully present and offer comfort, just as Jesus would. My phone buzzed relentlessly in my pocket. A post about our cause\u2014one I\u2019d poured my heart into as an activist\u2014was exploding online. This was the chance to educate thousands, maybe more, to make a real difference. My activist friends expected me to seize the moment, to add my voice and guide the conversation. But my friend\u2019s tear-streaked face kept pulling me back. I felt torn, my heart aching with the weight of both roles. Could I be the friend she needed and the activist my cause demanded? The pressure built inside me, each second stretching the tension tighter. I stared at my phone, then at my friend, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
