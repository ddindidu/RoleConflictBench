Just then, Brother Ahmed, a familiar face from the mosque, waved me over. \u201cImam, I know you\u2019re busy, but if you ever have a moment, I\u2019d love to talk. I\u2019ve been struggling lately.\u201d His words lingered as I continued my stroll, replaying the expectation that I should always be available for guidance, even outside the mosque. \n\nLost in thought, I absentmindedly unwrapped a snack and, without thinking, let the wrapper slip from my hand. It fluttered to the ground near a sign that read, \u201cKeep Our Park Clean.\u201d I froze, torn. As a citizen, I knew I should respect public spaces and set an example. As an imam, I felt the weight of always being watched, expected to embody the highest moral standards. The wrapper seemed to glare up at me, a silent accusation. My mind raced\u2014should I pick it up immediately, or would that make me late for the call I\u2019d promised to return to Ahmed? The expectations pressed in from all sides, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between my roles."}
