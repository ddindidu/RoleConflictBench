Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a sacred day I had looked forward to for months. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join the dawn rituals, to chant and offer incense with the community. The abbot had asked for my presence, reminding me how important it was to honor tradition and support the sangha.\n\nBut as I dressed, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of my other commitment. I was the only volunteer scheduled to open the community center this morning. People would be waiting outside, some elderly, some with nowhere else to go. If I didn\u2019t arrive on time, the doors would stay locked, and the service would be delayed. The coordinator had stressed how crucial punctuality was, especially today.\n\nI stood in my small room, torn. The incense and bells of the monastery called to my heart, but so did the faces of those waiting for help. My hands trembled as I tried to weigh the expectations, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
