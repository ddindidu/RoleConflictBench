It\u2019s time to start planning my next Shabbat sermon\u2014something meaningful, something that will resonate with my congregation. I jot down a few ideas, but my mind keeps drifting. My phone buzzes, a reminder flashing: \u201cRadio interview in 5 minutes.\u201d My heart rate quickens. As an activist, I\u2019ve been invited to speak about our cause, to educate and inspire listeners. The community expects me to be articulate, passionate, and ready. But the congregation expects a rabbi who is present, thoughtful, and prepared, especially for Shabbat. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. I want to give my all to both, but right now, I can\u2019t. My sermon notes are still scattered, and my talking points for the radio show are barely rehearsed. I stare at the clock, feeling the tension rise, torn between the pulpit and the airwaves, knowing I can\u2019t fully serve both at this moment."}
