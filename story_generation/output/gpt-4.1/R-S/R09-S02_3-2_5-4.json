My stomach grumbled, but I knew none of the food was kosher. I\u2019d tried to prepare, but the event ran late, and my emergency snacks were long gone. As I scanned the buffet, my phone buzzed. It was the legislative aide\u2014finally, after weeks of waiting, she had ten minutes to talk about the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into. This was the moment I\u2019d been working toward as an activist, a chance to make real change. But the only quiet spot was at the far end of the room, right next to the buffet, where everyone was eating. I felt the eyes of my colleagues, expecting me to join in, to be part of the community. I felt the weight of my own expectations, too\u2014my commitment to kosher, my promise to my family, my faith. My hands shook as I clutched my phone, torn between stepping away to take the call and risking awkward questions, or staying and missing the opportunity I\u2019d fought so hard for. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which part of myself I could let down."}
