He clutched my arm, voice trembling, and pleaded for guidance\u2014his mother had just passed away. As an imam, I knew my duty was to offer comfort, to sit with him, listen, and help him find solace in faith. My heart ached for him, and I could see how much he needed me in that moment.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone to silence it, I saw a reminder: today was election day. I had planned to vote between prayers, but I realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I could use a backup, but it was in my car, parked a few blocks away. If I left now, I could still make it to the polling station before the midday rush. Yet, if I left, I\u2019d be abandoning someone in deep pain, failing my role as a spiritual guide. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my community and my responsibility as a citizen."}
