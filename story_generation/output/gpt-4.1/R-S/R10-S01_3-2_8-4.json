As a Hindu, I knew how important it was to be present, to join my family in the rituals, to offer prayers and flowers, and to immerse myself in the sacred chants. The air was thick with incense and devotion, and I felt the weight of tradition on my shoulders. But as a volunteer at the check-in table, I was also responsible for welcoming newcomers and helping them with forms. That\u2019s when an elderly woman, her eyes darting nervously, leaned in and whispered a private concern about her family. She trusted me, expecting confidentiality and understanding. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the main ceremony was about to begin, and my family would be waiting for me to join the procession. I felt torn, caught between the pull of my faith and the trust placed in me as a volunteer. The temple bells rang louder, echoing the turmoil inside me, as I stood frozen, unsure which role to honor first."}
