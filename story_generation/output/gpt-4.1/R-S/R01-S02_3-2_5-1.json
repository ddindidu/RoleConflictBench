The voice on the other end trembled\u2014Mrs. Carter\u2019s house had been destroyed in the storm, and she was asking for me. As her pastor, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and rallying the congregation to help. But as an activist, I was expected at the city square, leading the march for climate justice, my voice needed to inspire hundreds. My phone buzzed with texts from fellow organizers: \u201cWhere are you? We need you at the front!\u201d I could almost hear the crowd gathering, feel the energy building. Yet, I pictured Mrs. Carter, alone and frightened, waiting for her pastor\u2019s reassurance. My heart pounded, torn between the pulpit and the protest, between tending to immediate pain and fighting for long-term change. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, unable to move."}
