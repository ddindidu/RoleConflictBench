I bow my head, feeling the familiar calm settle over me as incense drifts through the air. My teacher expects me to be present, to join the community in reciting the sutras, to show my commitment to the sangha. But as I reach for my prayer beads, my phone buzzes in my pocket. A message from my activist group flashes on the screen: \u201cLast chance to sign the petition before it goes to the senator. We need your voice.\u201d My heart pounds. I know how much this policy could help those who suffer, and my friends are counting on me to stand with them. Yet, to pull out my phone now, in the sacred hall, would be disrespectful\u2014an act that goes against the very teachings I try to embody. I feel torn, the weight of both communities pressing on my chest, each expecting my presence, my action, my loyalty. I close my eyes, caught between the hush of the temple and the urgent call for justice, unsure which path to follow."}
