She was a friend from my congregation, but today she was also a client, desperate for guidance about her looming eviction. As a Christian, I felt the pull to comfort her, to offer hope and reassurance, to remind her that God\u2019s love would see her through. But as an advocate, I knew my duty was to be honest, to explain the harsh realities of her legal situation without sugarcoating. She needed to understand the risks, the deadlines, the slim chances of success. My heart ached as I saw her hope flicker with every fact I shared. I wanted to hold her hand and promise everything would be okay, but my professional integrity demanded clarity, not comfort. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I hesitated, words caught in my throat, torn between compassion and candor, unsure which part of me should speak next."}
