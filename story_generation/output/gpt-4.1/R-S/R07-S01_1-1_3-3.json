The gentle hum of the community center faded as I closed my eyes, focusing on my breath, determined to honor my Buddhist practice of mindfulness. Just as I began to settle into stillness, a fellow volunteer, Sarah, poked her head in. She smiled, clearly wanting to chat, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude. I listened as she spoke about her day, and soon, the conversation drifted toward the people we were helping. She mentioned a few names, sharing light anecdotes\u2014nothing sensitive, but I felt a twinge of discomfort. As a volunteer, I was expected to respect the privacy of those we served, to keep boundaries clear. Yet, as a Buddhist, I was supposed to be present, compassionate, and nonjudgmental, not pushing away someone who sought connection. My mind tugged in two directions: the urge to gently steer the conversation away from our clients, and the wish to honor my meditation window. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which expectation to honor in this moment."}
