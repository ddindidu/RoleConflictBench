As a priest, I knew the congregation expected me to lead the daily prayer, even if only a handful would attend. It was a quiet, optional service, but for some, it was a cherished ritual\u2014a moment of peace before the day\u2019s chaos. Yet, as I arranged the hymnals, my mind kept drifting to the election. I realized I\u2019d left my ID at home, and today was my only chance to retrieve it before work consumed my schedule. The polls would be open tomorrow, but if I didn\u2019t get my ID now, I might lose my chance to vote. My parishioners needed me here, but my civic duty called me elsewhere. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each carrying its own sense of responsibility. I stood in the quiet sanctuary, torn between the altar and the ballot box, heart pounding as I tried to decide which duty I would honor first."}
