As imam, the community expects me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them spiritually and address their concerns. But today, an invited guest speaker stands ready, his own sermon prepared, and I know he can take the pulpit if I am absent. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my law office. The trial I\u2019ve been preparing for months is about to begin, and my client\u2019s future hangs in the balance. As their advocate, I am expected to be present, to argue their case with all my skill and conviction. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the congregation\u2019s trust, the client\u2019s hope. My heart pounds as I stand in the mosque\u2019s quiet office, torn between the call to serve my faith and the duty to defend my client. The clock ticks closer to both the sermon and the trial, and I am paralyzed, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
