My heart aches with guilt\u2014I\u2019m behind on my daily reading, and I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight. The words blur as I glance at the clock. My phone buzzes: a reminder for my early morning volunteer shift. I\u2019m the only one with the keys, and people will be waiting outside, relying on me to open the doors and start the day\u2019s service. If I stay up late to recite and reflect, I\u2019ll be exhausted and risk oversleeping, letting down the community that counts on me. But if I go to bed now, I\u2019ll fall even further behind in my Quran reading, missing the spiritual nourishment I crave during this sacred month. The weight of both responsibilities presses on my chest, and I close my eyes, torn between my devotion and my duty."}
