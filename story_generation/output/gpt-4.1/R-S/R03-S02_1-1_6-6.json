My Bible and journal are open, the sunlight slanting across the pages, and I feel the gentle pull toward prayer and reflection. I have longed for this quiet, a chance to listen for God\u2019s voice and deepen my understanding. But my phone buzzes insistently on the desk. I glance at the screen\u2014our cause is trending, a rare and powerful moment. If I add my voice now, I could reach thousands, maybe more, educating them, inspiring them to act. The activist in me aches to seize this opportunity, to fulfill my responsibility to the movement. Yet, the nun in me recoils at the intrusion, feeling the sacredness of this time slipping away. My heart pounds with the tension: to serve the world or to serve my soul. I sit, torn, the weight of both callings pressing in, unable to move forward, unable to let go."}
