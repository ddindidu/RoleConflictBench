She was nervous, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her rabbi, I felt the weight of guiding her, ensuring she understood every nuance of Jewish law. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the community center. I was due to volunteer in half an hour, sorting confidential medical files for our elderly members. The director had stressed the importance of privacy; even a misplaced glance could betray someone\u2019s trust.\n\nMy mind raced. If I rescheduled Miriam, she might lose confidence before her big day. But if I delayed my volunteer shift, the files might be left unsecured, risking someone\u2019s privacy. Both roles demanded my full presence, both carried sacred trust. I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides. How could I honor my commitment as a rabbi and as a volunteer, when each required me at the same moment, in different ways? My hands trembled as I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me now."}
