My phone buzzed with a message from the mayor, pleading for help to organize relief for the hundreds now homeless. As a nun, I felt the weight of my vows\u2014service, compassion, presence. The sisters looked to me, expecting leadership and tireless charity. Yet, as I pulled on my habit, my mind drifted to my other life: the law office, where my client\u2019s case had just taken a complicated turn. She was waiting for my call, desperate for guidance only I could provide. The legal documents on my desk demanded hours of careful review, and my client\u2019s future depended on my clarity and focus. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the suffering outside and the silent plea of the woman who trusted me. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my community needed my hands, my client needed my mind. I stood in the hallway, habit and briefcase in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
