Today was David\u2019s bar mitzvah, a day his family had anticipated for months. As his rabbi, I was expected to guide him through the ceremony, offer blessings, and be present for every moment. The congregation would be watching, and David\u2019s parents had reminded me more than once how much this day meant to them. Yet, as I reviewed my calendar, my heart sank. I was also due in court this morning as an advocate for a client whose future hinged on my presence. The judge had warned that tardiness would not be tolerated, and my client\u2019s anxiety was palpable in every message she sent. Both roles demanded my full attention, my presence, my care. I could not be in two places at once. My phone buzzed with reminders from both sides\u2014texts from David\u2019s mother, emails from my client. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, my stomach twisting with guilt and dread. I stood in my study, prayer book in one hand, legal brief in the other, torn between two worlds that needed me, knowing I could not give myself fully to either."}
