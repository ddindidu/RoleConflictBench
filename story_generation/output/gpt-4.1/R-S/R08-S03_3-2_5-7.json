It was Friday, and the call to prayer would soon echo from the mosque down the street. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of expectation to dress modestly, especially for Jumu\u2019ah. But as I glanced at my phone, a heat advisory alert flashed across the screen. The city urged everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, and I immediately thought of Mrs. Patel, the elderly woman living alone next door. She struggled with the heat, and last summer, I\u2019d seen her nearly faint in the hallway. I knew, as a responsible citizen, I should help her\u2014maybe bring her some cold water or help her get to a cooling center. But if I left now, dressed in my full modest attire, I risked overheating myself before even reaching the mosque. If I changed into lighter clothes, I\u2019d be violating my religious principles. My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between my duty to my faith and my responsibility to my community, unsure which path to take."}
