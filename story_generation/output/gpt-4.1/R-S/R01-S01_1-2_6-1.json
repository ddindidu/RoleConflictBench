The community center buzzed with anticipation, and I knew the doors would open in ten minutes. As a pastor, I felt compelled to share a brief story about compassion from scripture, hoping to inspire the group before we began our work. The faces around me were eager, some looking for guidance, others for reassurance. But as I started, my phone vibrated\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cPlease be at your station before opening. We\u2019re counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, firm but fair, echoing the importance of punctuality, especially today with so few hands. My heart pounded.
