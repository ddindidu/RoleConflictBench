As a Buddhist, I look forward to the weekly study circle\u2014a rare chance to sit quietly with others, to reflect on the teachings and discuss the chapter we\u2019ve all been meaning to read. My mind craves that stillness, the gentle rhythm of shared insight. But as an advocate, my phone buzzes with reminders: tonight\u2019s meeting at the firm, a routine check-in that\u2019s anything but optional. My colleagues expect me there, punctual and prepared, ready to discuss cases and strategies. I can almost hear the disappointment if I don\u2019t show up, the subtle questioning of my commitment.\n\nThe two roles pull at me from opposite ends. The study circle promises peace and spiritual growth, a space to nurture my inner self. The meeting demands my presence, my professionalism, my reliability. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014how can I honor both? The clock ticks closer to the hour, and I sit at my desk, torn, the weight of incompatible expectations pressing in from all sides."}
