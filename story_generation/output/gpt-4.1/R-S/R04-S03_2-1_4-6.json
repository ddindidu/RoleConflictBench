As the imam, I was scheduled to deliver the Khutbah today\u2014a responsibility I never took lightly. The topic, \u201cCompassion in Community,\u201d had been announced all week, and I knew many would come seeking guidance and inspiration. Yet, as a citizen, I also felt the weight of another duty. The community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers were desperately needed. I had already organized my tax documents, so I could spare the time, and I knew my presence would help reassure hesitant neighbors. But the Khutbah was only hours away, and I needed to prepare spiritually and mentally. The congregation expected my full attention and presence, while my fellow citizens hoped I would stand with them in this public health effort. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my time, my energy, my heart. I sat at my desk, hands trembling, unsure which call to answer first."}
