I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the network producer. They needed me live, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. Mother Superior had entrusted me to lead tonight\u2019s prayer vigil, a rare honor and a visible sign of my devotion. The sisters were already gathering in the chapel, expecting me to guide them in worship, to be a symbol of calm faith. Yet, as an activist, I knew how quickly public opinion could turn if our voice wasn\u2019t heard. The community depended on me to speak truth, to educate, to stand up in moments like this. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding silent reverence, the other urgent action. My hands trembled as I stood in the corridor, torn between the chapel\u2019s warm glow and the cold, insistent ring of my phone."}
