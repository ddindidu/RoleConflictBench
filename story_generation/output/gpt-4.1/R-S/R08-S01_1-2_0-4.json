As a Muslim, these moments are precious, a chance to reconnect and find peace. But just as I was about to leave the community center, a client approached the check-in table where I volunteer. She hesitated, then quietly confided a personal concern, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see the trust in her eyes, the expectation that I would respect her privacy and keep her words safe. My mind tugged in two directions: the spiritual calm I craved, and the responsibility to honor her confidentiality and offer support. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart raced as I stood there, caught between the sacred quiet I longed for and the trust placed in me by someone in need."}
