My teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cPlease prepare a summary of the key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s session.\u201d As a Buddhist, I felt honored and responsible, knowing the community expected thoughtful reflection and clarity. I opened my notebook, but my thoughts kept drifting. Tomorrow was also election day, and I realized with a jolt that my ID was at home\u2014across town, a long bus ride away. Today was my only chance to retrieve it, since the polls would be open tomorrow, but I\u2019d be at the temple all day, leading the session. The expectation to be a mindful, present Buddhist clashed with my civic duty as a voter. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. If I left now, I\u2019d have little time for spiritual study. If I stayed, I might lose my chance to vote. My heart pounded as I stared at my unfinished notes, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities."}
