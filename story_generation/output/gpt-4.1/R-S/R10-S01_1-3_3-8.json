The coordinator\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions. We must follow the new check-in procedure, or we risk losing our permit.\u201d I scanned the line, making sure everyone was accounted for, when I saw a man quietly slip ahead of a tired-looking woman. My heart tightened. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness\u2014even in small matters. It felt wrong to ignore the unfairness, but the coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear: keep the line moving, no disruptions, no confrontations. If I stopped to address the line-cutting, I\u2019d be breaking protocol and possibly causing a scene. If I let it go, I\u2019d be betraying my own sense of justice. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my team. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my hands trembling as I tried to decide what to do next."}
