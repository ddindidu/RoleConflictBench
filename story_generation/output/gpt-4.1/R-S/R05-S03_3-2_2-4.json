The High Holiday service was only hours away, and I still hadn\u2019t finished my sermon. The congregation would be there, waiting for words of comfort and inspiration. As their rabbi, I owed them my best\u2014especially now, when so many were searching for hope.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was starting. As a citizen, I believed deeply in civic engagement. I\u2019d promised myself I would watch, listen, and submit questions. Our community needed leaders who understood our needs, and I wanted my voice to count.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I watched the forum, I\u2019d lose precious time for my sermon. If I ignored it, I\u2019d miss my chance to participate in shaping our city\u2019s future. My mind raced with competing obligations, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I closed my eyes, torn between the pulpit and the polling place, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both."}
