The court session was in less than an hour, and my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality. As an advocate, I knew the expectation: be there, be prepared, never let a client down. But my stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I scanned the street\u2014only one small vendor, the one I\u2019d researched before, was kosher-certified. The line, though, snaked around the block. If I waited, I\u2019d risk being late. If I left, I\u2019d go hungry, breaking my commitment to observe kosher dietary laws, a core part of my Jewish identity.
