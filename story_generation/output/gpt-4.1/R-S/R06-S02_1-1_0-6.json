The post about our cause was everywhere\u2014shared by friends, strangers, even a few local news outlets. As an activist, I knew this was the moment to speak up, to educate, to add my voice and help people understand why this mattered. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to type out a passionate comment. But then I remembered the harsh words, the anger, the insults that always followed these posts. I thought about the Christian values I tried to live by\u2014kindness, humility, turning the other cheek. I worried that if I spoke out, I might be drawn into arguments, tempted to respond in ways that didn\u2019t reflect my faith. Yet if I stayed silent, I\u2019d be letting down the people who counted on me to stand up for what\u2019s right. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, unsure how to be true to both my beliefs and my cause. My thumb hovered over the \u201cpost\u201d button, my mind racing, caught between two worlds."}
