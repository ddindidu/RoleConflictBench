I could already picture the small group of parishioners gathering in the pews, waiting for me to lead them in quiet reflection. It was a routine, but one that brought comfort to many. My phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. A message flashed across the screen: \u201cPolice are blocking the exits. We need you now.\u201d My heart pounded. As an activist, I was responsible for the safety of those who had trusted me to guide them through today\u2019s peaceful protest. I could hear the rising panic in the background of the call, voices overlapping, fear mounting. I stood in the vestry, torn. The congregation expected me to be present, to offer spiritual guidance and stability. But outside, people needed my leadership to stay safe, to avoid chaos. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each with its own urgency. My hands trembled as I tried to steady my breath, caught between the sanctuary\u2019s calm and the turmoil outside, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
