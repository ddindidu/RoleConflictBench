This evening, after Maghrib prayer, Brother Karim approached me, mentioning he\u2019d like to talk about some personal struggles\u2014\u201cwhenever you have free time, Imam.\u201d I assured him I\u2019d make time soon. Later, as a citizen and resident of this apartment building, I remembered my friends and I had planned a small music session in my living room. We\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, but I realized our gathering would start just as the building\u2019s quiet hours began. I glanced out my window and saw my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, enjoying the cool air with her windows wide open. I felt the weight of my dual responsibilities: as an imam, I should be available for Brother Karim, but as a citizen, I must respect the building\u2019s rules and my neighbors\u2019 peace. The thought of disappointing my friends, neglecting a community member, or disturbing Mrs. Lee all pressed on me at once. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my faith and my civic duty, unsure which path to take."}
