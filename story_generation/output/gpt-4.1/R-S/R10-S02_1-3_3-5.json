As an activist, I knew I had to call the undecided representative right now\u2014my voice could tip the balance. But just then, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in line, ignoring the others waiting patiently. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and fairness, even in small matters. My conscience nudged me to speak up, to gently remind them of the right thing to do. Yet, every second I hesitated meant less time to advocate for a cause that could affect thousands. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the quiet, everyday morality of my faith, and the urgent, public responsibility of my activism. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the immediate injustice before me and the larger battle waiting on the other end of the phone."}
