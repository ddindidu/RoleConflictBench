As the lead engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every safety protocol was met, and now, with the inspector\u2019s urgent concerns, the entire operation was at risk of being shut down. My team looked to me for direction, waiting for my decision on how to address the flagged issues. At the same time, my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014another advocacy meeting was about to start, and my presence was expected. I was supposed to be the reliable advocate, always punctual, always prepared to speak up for those who needed a voice. But if I left now, the engineering team would be left scrambling, and the inspector might see it as negligence. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people who counted on me to represent them. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I felt torn, caught between two worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
