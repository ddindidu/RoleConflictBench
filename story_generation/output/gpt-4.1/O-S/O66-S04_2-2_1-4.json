I nodded, weaving through the morning traffic, feeling the weight of his urgency. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to get him to the station safely and on time, and I pride myself on never letting a passenger down. But my mind kept drifting to my own problem: my wallet, with my only valid ID, was sitting on my kitchen table across town. Today was the only morning I could grab it before work, and I needed it to vote tomorrow. If I missed this window, I might lose my chance to have a say in the election. The pressure built inside me\u2014my duty to my passenger clashing with my responsibility as a citizen. Every red light, every honk, every glance at the clock made my heart pound harder. I gripped the wheel, torn between two roads, knowing I couldn\u2019t travel both."}
