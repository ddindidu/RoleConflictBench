The lines on the paper were clean and practical\u2014just enough to make the space usable, nothing more. My mind was deep in the flow of function and form when my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen: a notification from the activist group I helped lead. Our latest post about sustainable urban spaces was going viral. Hundreds of comments, questions, and arguments were piling up. This was the moment to jump in, to educate, to steer the conversation and maybe even change a few minds. But my renovation plans were due tomorrow, and if I didn\u2019t finish now, I\u2019d lose the thread of my design. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent call to action and the quiet demand of my work. Both roles needed me, right now, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to give either the attention they deserved."}
