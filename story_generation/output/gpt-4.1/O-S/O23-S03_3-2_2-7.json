My client was counting on me to catch any loopholes\u2014especially the clauses that could cost them dearly if I missed something. The deadline was tight, and every minute mattered. As I started to review the dense legal language, my phone buzzed with a public alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone down the hall. She struggled with the heat and had no family nearby. I knew the city expected citizens like me to look out for vulnerable neighbors during emergencies. My mind raced\u2014should I keep working, honoring my duty as a lawyer, or check on Mrs. Lee, fulfilling my responsibility as a caring citizen? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the fear of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
