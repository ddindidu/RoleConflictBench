The hospital wing design sprawled across my desk, red lines marking the emergency routes I\u2019d spent weeks perfecting. Every detail mattered\u2014lives could depend on the seamless flow between operating rooms and corridors. But now, standing in the crowded polling station, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the project manager. I tried to focus as the election official explained the registration mismatch. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out this provisional ballot form before we close in ten minutes,\u201d she said, her tone firm. My mind raced. As an architect, I was expected to ensure every inch of that hospital wing functioned flawlessly, and the deadline for final revisions was tonight. But as a voter, I was supposed to follow every instruction, to participate fully and correctly in the democratic process. I felt torn, sweat prickling my neck. If I rushed the ballot, I might make a mistake. If I left, I\u2019d fail my civic duty. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that refused to wait."}
