I force a smile as the next customer slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp with frustration about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I remind myself to stay calm, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, even as my own patience thins. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014a reminder about the city\u2019s bus route survey, open only until tomorrow. As a citizen, I know I should take a few minutes to give feedback; the new routes could affect my commute and my neighbors\u2019. But the store is packed, my break is short, and my manager expects me back on the floor right away. I feel the pressure mounting: the demand to be present and helpful at work, and the responsibility to participate in decisions that shape my city. My heart pounds as I wonder which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
