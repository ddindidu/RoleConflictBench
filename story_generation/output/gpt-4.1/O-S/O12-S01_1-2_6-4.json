The UI glitch was minor, but QA was pushing for a fix before the next release. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cCan you get this sorted today?\u201d I sighed, knowing it would mean staying late. But tonight was my volunteer shift at the shelter, and I\u2019d promised to help with check-in.\n\nAt the shelter, I tried to focus on the forms, but my mind kept drifting back to the bug. Then, as I handed a clipboard to a client, she leaned in and whispered a private concern, her voice trembling. She trusted me to keep it confidential, to listen and respect her privacy. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from work, asking for an update.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions. The team needed me to fix the bug, but this woman needed me to be present, to honor her trust. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the demands of my job and the responsibility I felt as a volunteer."}
