As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to handle customer objections smoothly, but today, the calls are relentless. Prospects keep asking technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script only half-answers. I feel the pressure to sound confident, to keep them interested, but I\u2019m fumbling, improvising, hoping I don\u2019t mislead anyone. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flick to me, expecting results.\n\nBut my mind drifts. As a citizen, I know I should be at the community center this weekend. There\u2019s a free vaccine clinic, and I want to help out, maybe even volunteer. My tax documents are already sorted, so I have the time. I feel a responsibility to contribute, to be present for my neighbors, especially after the tough year we\u2019ve all had.\n\nThe demands pull at me\u2014my job needs my focus, my community needs my presence. I feel the tension in my chest, torn between the script in front of me and the sense of duty tugging from outside these office walls."}
