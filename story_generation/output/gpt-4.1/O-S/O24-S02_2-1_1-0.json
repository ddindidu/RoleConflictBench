The case is complicated, and I know the parties expect a judge who is prepared, impartial, and thorough. My eyes scan the legal arguments, but my phone buzzes insistently. A fellow activist is live-streaming from a demonstration downtown, calling for more people to join. The cause is close to my heart, and I know my presence would matter\u2014solidarity, numbers, and the energy of protest. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a judge, I must be diligent, focused, and above reproach. As an activist, I am expected to stand up, to be counted, to act when it matters most. My mind races with the demands of both roles, guilt gnawing at me for even considering leaving these files unfinished, yet equally guilty for not being out there, lending my voice. I stare at the clock, torn, the expectations of justice and justice-seeking pulling me in opposite directions."}
