As the company\u2019s accountant, I know I\u2019m expected to respond immediately\u2014any delay could mean penalties or even an audit. My boss has always emphasized the importance of compliance, and I pride myself on keeping everything above board. But my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d The protest is small, and our cause\u2014affordable housing\u2014needs every voice. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My colleagues expect me to be the reliable accountant, always on top of deadlines. My activist friends count on my presence and passion.

My hands tremble as I try to decide where I\u2019m needed most, feeling the pull of two lives that suddenly seem impossible to balance."}
