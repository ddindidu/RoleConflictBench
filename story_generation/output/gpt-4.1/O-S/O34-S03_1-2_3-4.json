The candidate forum for my district was streaming live\u2014this was my chance to hear their plans, to ask about the new zoning laws that would affect my neighborhood. But right now, Flight 482 was requesting the altimeter setting, a routine call, but one that demanded my full attention. I pressed the button, voice steady, \u201cFlight 482, altimeter two niner niner two.\u201d My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cForum live now\u2014submit your question!\u201d I felt the weight of civic duty, the urge to participate, to be more than a silent observer in my community. But the airspace was busy, and every second my focus wavered, lives were in my hands. I wanted to be a good citizen, to make my voice heard, but I was also the calm in the storm for pilots above.
