I glanced at the stack of high-value transactions waiting for me\u2014end-of-day deposits, large cash drops, and the final reconciliation. My manager always reminded me how a single mistake could throw off the books and cost the store hundreds. I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my shoulders as I counted bills and double-checked receipts, my hands moving with practiced precision.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the polling place just three blocks away. The ballot measure up for vote tonight would directly impact my street\u2014new zoning laws, changes to parking, things that would shape my daily life as a resident. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, that I\u2019d be the kind of citizen who didn\u2019t just complain but actually showed up. The polls closed in two hours, and I knew if I rushed through my work, I risked making a costly error. If I stayed to do everything perfectly, I might miss my chance to vote. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of my job against my duty as a citizen, torn between two roles that both demanded my full attention."}
