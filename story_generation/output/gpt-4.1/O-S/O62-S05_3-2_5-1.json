As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in top shape, so when I noticed the pool filtration system sputtering and making odd noises, my heart sank. If I didn\u2019t address it right away, the water could become unsafe, putting everyone at risk. I started making calls to maintenance, but my phone buzzed with a message from a client. As an advocate, I\u2019m supposed to provide timely, accurate legal advice, and this client\u2019s case had just taken a complicated turn. They needed my guidance now, and I could sense their anxiety in every word of their message. I stared at the pool, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The swimmers would be arriving soon, and my client was waiting for answers. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of safety and the responsibility to my client, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left hanging in the balance."}
