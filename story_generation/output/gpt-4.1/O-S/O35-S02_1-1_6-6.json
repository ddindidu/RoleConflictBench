My phone buzzed with an email from management: a professional development seminar, optional but clearly encouraged. I knew I should reply promptly, show my commitment to the job, keep up with the standards expected of me. But just as I opened the email, my activist group chat exploded\u2014our latest post about transit equity was going viral. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, the perfect chance to educate thousands, maybe more, if I could just add a thoughtful comment now. My fingers hovered between the work email and the social media app, heart pounding. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding me of professionalism, while my fellow activists urged me not to miss this rare opportunity. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to act\u2014right now."}
