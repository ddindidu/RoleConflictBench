As an architect, I was used to juggling timelines, making sure everything moved forward, even if I sometimes skimmed over the details. My team expected me to keep things on track, not get bogged down in minutiae. When it was finally my turn to vote, I signed the envelope quickly, eager to get back to work. But the poll worker frowned, pointing out a smudge on my signature. She asked me to re-sign, explaining that a clear signature was required or my ballot might be rejected. I felt a wave of impatience. My mind raced with thoughts of deadlines and meetings waiting for me. Yet, as a voter, I knew I was supposed to follow every instruction, no matter how small. I stood there, pen in hand, torn between my habit of moving things along efficiently and the responsibility to do this one thing exactly as told."}
