As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew I needed to send a formal reply\u2014our policy was clear, and clients and vendors expected prompt, professional communication. I started drafting the email, but then the building\u2019s alarms blared, and my phone vibrated with a flash-flood warning. I glanced out the window; water was already pooling along the curb, rising fast. As a citizen, I felt a surge of responsibility\u2014should I help alert neighbors, check on the elderly couple next door, or move my car to higher ground? But the vendor\u2019s message sat open on my screen, a reminder of my duty to keep business running smoothly. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the company needed me to be reliable and responsive, but my community needed me to act, to be present and helpful in a crisis. I stared at the screen, torn between the roles, feeling the pressure of both demands closing in."}
