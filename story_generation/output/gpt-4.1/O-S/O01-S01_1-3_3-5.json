As an architect, I knew the importance of designing functional spaces, even if it was just for myself. I wanted every corner to serve a purpose, every line to make sense. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer work I had agreed to do that afternoon. I was supposed to sort through files at the community clinic, each one filled with private medical histories. The expectation was clear: respect the privacy and confidentiality of every person whose name appeared on those pages.\n\nAs I drew, I realized I needed to reference some accessibility standards. I remembered that one of the files I\u2019d seen earlier contained details about a client with unique mobility needs\u2014details that would make my design more inclusive. But I also knew that using that information, even with good intentions, would be a breach of trust. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the architect in me wanted to create the best possible space, but the volunteer in me was bound by a promise of confidentiality. My pencil hovered over the page, my thoughts tangled in the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
