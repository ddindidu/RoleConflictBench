Did you find everything okay?\u201d The store was quiet, and I tried to keep my tone warm, scanning their groceries with care. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer center across town, where I was supposed to unlock the doors in less than twenty minutes. I knew people would already be waiting outside, some of them anxious for the help we provided. My manager had asked me to cover this extra hour at the register, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down or seem unfriendly to the customers. But every beep of the scanner made my chest tighter, knowing that if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, leaving people outside in the cold. I tried to focus on the customer in front of me, but the weight of both responsibilities pressed down, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be reliable and kind. I could feel the conflict building, unsure which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
