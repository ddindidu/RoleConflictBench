The case is new, the parties expect clarity, and the court expects me to be thorough and timely. I know the order must be precise, leaving no room for confusion. Yet, my phone buzzes incessantly. My activist group\u2019s post is exploding online\u2014thousands are reading, sharing, asking questions. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for, the perfect chance to educate and inspire real change. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. The court demands my focus and impartiality, but my heart aches to seize this rare opportunity for my cause. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between drafting the order and crafting the perfect comment. The clock ticks, and I feel the tension mounting inside me, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at once."}
