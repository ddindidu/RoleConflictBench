My break isn\u2019t for another twenty minutes, and the compliance system is ruthless\u2014one unscheduled minute away from my desk, and I\u2019ll get flagged. But my phone buzzes with a notification from the activist group: the petition to ban single-use plastics is about to close, and this is my last chance to add my name. I know how much every signature counts; I\u2019ve spent months urging others to take action, and now it\u2019s my turn. My supervisor expects me glued to my seat, every call logged, every break scheduled. But the activist in me is screaming not to let this moment slip by. My finger hovers over the mouse, torn between the risk of disciplinary action and the chance to stand up for what I believe in. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the demands of both worlds, caught in the space between duty and conviction."}
