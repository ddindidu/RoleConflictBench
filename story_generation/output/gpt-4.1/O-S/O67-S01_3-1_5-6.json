Dispatch had said \u201cpossible major heart attack,\u201d and I knew every second counted. As the ambulance driver, I was expected to provide initial care\u2014check vitals, administer oxygen, keep the patient calm. My mind raced through protocols, but a notification buzzed on my phone: an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested reorganizing the supply bins in the ambulance, a new system she wanted us to try if we had a moment. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me to follow her guidelines as a volunteer.\n\nNow, as I reached for the oxygen mask, I glanced at the cluttered supply shelf. The new system would make things easier, but I hadn\u2019t had time to switch it over. Should I pause for a second to find the right supplies, risking precious moments, or stick to the old, familiar chaos? The patient\u2019s labored breathing filled the space, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something different, each refusing to let go."}
