As a delivery person, I knew how important it was to get this grocery order to Mrs. Lee before six\u2014she\u2019d called twice already, worried about her dinner plans. The address was just a few blocks away, but traffic was crawling, and I kept checking the insulated bag on the seat beside me, picturing her anxious face if I was late. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center tonight, and I could already imagine the line of people waiting outside, some of them elderly, all depending on me to open the doors and start the meal service. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to a customer and the responsibility I felt toward the people at the center. Both needed me, both counted on me to be on time, and I felt the pressure of their expectations squeezing my chest as I sat at the red light, unable to move forward in either direction."}
