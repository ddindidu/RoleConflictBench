As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, scan each item quickly, and make sure every transaction is perfect. My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over every so often, silently urging me to go faster. In the middle of this rush, I spot Mrs. Lee, a regular from the shelter where I volunteer. She hesitates at the end of my lane, clutching a form. When she finally steps forward, she leans in and, in a low voice, confides a personal worry about her housing situation\u2014something she trusts me with because of my volunteer role. I know I should listen, respect her privacy, and offer support, but the line behind her grows restless. My cashier self wants to hurry her along, but my volunteer self knows this moment matters. The expectations of both roles pull at me, and I feel the pressure mounting as I stand there, caught between the demands of the job and the needs of someone who trusts me."}
