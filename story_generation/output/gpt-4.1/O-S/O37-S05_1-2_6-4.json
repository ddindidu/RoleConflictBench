As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow strict safety and hygiene protocols, but sometimes, when the gloves felt too tight or the task seemed minor, I skipped them. Today, though, I wore them, thinking of the germs that could linger. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the hearing in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client depended on me to represent them with precision and care; their case was complicated, every detail mattered. I glanced at my reflection, noticing the faint red marks the gloves left on my wrists. If I rushed through cleaning to prepare for court, I might miss a spot or break protocol. If I took the time to do everything perfectly, I\u2019d have less time to review my client\u2019s file. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I failed. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
