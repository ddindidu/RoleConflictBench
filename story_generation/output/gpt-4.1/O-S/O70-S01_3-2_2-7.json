As a delivery person, I knew the medical supplies in my van had to reach the hospital\u2019s emergency department within the next twenty minutes. The label was marked \u201curgent,\u201d and I could imagine the anxious faces waiting for these items. But as a volunteer, I\u2019d just attended a briefing where the coordinator stressed new safety protocols\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. The hospital\u2019s main entrance was under construction, and the only way in was through a side door, which meant parking further away and carrying the heavy box across the lot, following the new safety route. It would take longer, but skipping the steps would go against everything the coordinator had emphasized. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDeliver to ER by 2:00 PM.\u201d I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the hospital\u2019s need for speed and the volunteer program\u2019s insistence on safety. Both roles demanded my best, but their expectations were pulling me in opposite directions. I gripped the steering wheel, caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
