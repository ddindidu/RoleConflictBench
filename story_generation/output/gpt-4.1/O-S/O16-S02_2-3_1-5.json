My patient, Mrs. Lee, had a puzzling mix of symptoms\u2014persistent fatigue, joint pain, and a rash that didn\u2019t fit any textbook description. I knew I needed to focus, to piece together the clues and order the right tests. My pager buzzed. It was a message from my activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could expand healthcare access for thousands. The vote was tied, and the swing representative was still undecided. They needed me to call now, to share my perspective as a doctor and urge a yes vote.\n\nMy mind raced. As a doctor, my patient deserved my undivided attention and the best diagnostic skills I could offer. But as an activist, I had a responsibility to speak up for systemic change that could help so many more. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my immediate action, each too important to ignore. My hands hovered over the phone, torn between the patient in front of me and the cause that could shape the future for countless others."}
