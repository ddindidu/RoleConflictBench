The sales target blinks on my screen, a constant reminder that I\u2019m still three sales short for the week. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need you to push harder, especially at the end of the day.\u201d I dial another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts drift to the evening ahead. My friends and I have been planning a music night for weeks, but I remember the building\u2019s quiet hours start at 9 p.m.\u2014right when we\u2019re supposed to begin. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always keeps her windows open, and she\u2019s politely asked before if we could keep it down. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to be persistent, to push boundaries for the sake of numbers. As a citizen, I\u2019m supposed to respect the rules and my neighbors\u2019 peace. The pressure to meet my quota gnaws at me, but so does the guilt of possibly disturbing others. I stare at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibilities of being a considerate neighbor, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll let down tonight."}
