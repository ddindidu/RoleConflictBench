As an engineer, I know the prototype needs to be ready by tomorrow\u2019s meeting\u2014stakeholders are anxious, and their approval hinges on seeing something tangible. My phone buzzes with reminders: \u201cCandidate forum live now\u2014your vote matters!\u201d As a citizen, I feel the weight of responsibility to stay informed, to listen, to ask questions that could shape my community\u2019s future. The forum is streaming right now, and I promised myself I\u2019d participate, but the project\u2019s deadline looms over me like a storm cloud. My mind races, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the civic duty I believe in.

My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestle with which part of myself to honor tonight."}
