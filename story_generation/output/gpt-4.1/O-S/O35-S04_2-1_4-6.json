My phone buzzes\u2014a colleague texts that there\u2019s a suspicious, unattended bag on my usual train route. My mind races with the protocols: alert authorities, keep passengers calm, ensure no one approaches the bag. But right now, I\u2019m just a voter, and the election official is calling out, \u201cLast names A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with L. The new line is longer and slower, but the official\u2019s instructions are clear. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the urge to step away and help with the subway situation, the civic duty to follow voting rules and not cause a scene. My heart pounds as I stand between the two lines, torn by the demands of safety and citizenship, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both at once."}
