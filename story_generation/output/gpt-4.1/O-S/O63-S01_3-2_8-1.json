My shift as a telemarketer was supposed to end in ten minutes, but the system was clear: any unscheduled break or early log-off would be flagged, and I\u2019d already been warned once this month. My stomach twisted as I glanced at my phone\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter started in exactly fifteen minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today. The doors open right at four, and every pair of hands counts.\u201d I could picture the line of people waiting, the other volunteers already bustling around, and the disappointment if I was late. But if I left my telemarketing station even a minute early, the compliance system would log it, and I couldn\u2019t afford another strike. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling trapped between the rigid demands of my job and the urgent need at the shelter."}
