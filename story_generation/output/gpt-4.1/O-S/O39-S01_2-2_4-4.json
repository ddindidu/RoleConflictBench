My supervisor always drilled into us: safety first, keep the site clean, don\u2019t let anyone get hurt. I grabbed a mop, ready to tackle it, when my phone buzzed. It was my shift reminder for the community center. I hurried over, still thinking about the spill, and sat at the check-in table. A woman approached, her hands trembling as she filled out her forms. She leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided something deeply personal\u2014something she didn\u2019t want anyone else to know. I could see how much it cost her to share it. My mind raced. I needed to be present, to listen, to honor her trust and keep her secret. But the image of that spill haunted me. What if someone slipped? What if I was the only one who knew? I felt torn in two, pulled by the urgent need to protect both the people at the site and the privacy of the woman before me. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
