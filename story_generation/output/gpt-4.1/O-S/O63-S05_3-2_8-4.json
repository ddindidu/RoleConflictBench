My headset buzzed with the supervisor\u2019s reminder: \u201cNo unscheduled downtime, or the system flags you.\u201d The pressure was constant\u2014every minute accounted for, every call logged. But my phone vibrated with a message from my client. Their hearing was in ten minutes, and they needed me to review a last-minute document. As their advocate, I was expected to be thorough, to catch every detail that could sway the case. The stakes were high; a misstep could cost them dearly. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands. If I took the call, the compliance system would flag me, risking my job. If I ignored my client, I\u2019d fail them when they needed me most.
