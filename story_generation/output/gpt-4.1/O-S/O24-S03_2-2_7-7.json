The new appellate decision he cited could shift the entire direction of the case. As a judge, I knew I had to review it thoroughly before tomorrow\u2019s session\u2014my duty demanded I stay current, fair, and precise. I opened my laptop, ready to dive into the legal text, when my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone just down the hall. She struggled with the heat every summer, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check on her if things got bad. \n\nI stared at the legal document, then at the clock. If I didn\u2019t review the case law now, I\u2019d risk being unprepared in court. But if I ignored the alert, I\u2019d be neglecting my responsibility as a citizen to look out for those around me. My mind raced, torn between the weight of justice and the pull of compassion, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in from either side."}
