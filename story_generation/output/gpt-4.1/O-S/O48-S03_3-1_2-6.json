Her pain is obvious, and I know she needs my patience and gentle encouragement to get through this meal. As a nursing assistant, I\u2019m expected to be present, attentive, and compassionate, especially when my patients are struggling with something as basic as eating. But my mind keeps drifting to the envelope of tax documents waiting at home\u2014organized, but not yet filed. The deadline is creeping closer, and I promised myself I\u2019d get it done early this year. On top of that, the community center is running a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and I feel a responsibility as a citizen to show up, help out, and set an example. The weight of these expectations presses on me: my patient needs me now, but so does my community, and my own responsibilities as a citizen can\u2019t be ignored. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role should come first."}
