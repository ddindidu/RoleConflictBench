The inconsistencies were small\u2014nothing that would cause a collapse, but enough to nag at my conscience as an architect. My phone buzzed, and a message flashed: \u201cTie-breaking vote in 60 minutes. We need you to call Rep. Harris now!\u201d As an activist, I\u2019d spent months rallying for this policy, and my voice could tip the scales. But the building plans demanded my attention; safety and compliance were my responsibility, and I knew I couldn\u2019t let even minor errors slide. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the duty to my profession and the cause I believed in.
