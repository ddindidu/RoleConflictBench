My shift as a lifeguard was almost over, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the group of teenagers laughing and daring each other to dive right beneath the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. I knew I had to intervene\u2014enforcing safety rules was my responsibility, and one wrong move could mean a serious injury. But as I took a step forward, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in ten minutes, across town. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the facility, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and start the service. My heart pounded as I glanced between the rowdy teens and the ticking clock. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding I keep these kids safe, the other expecting me to be reliable and punctual for those depending on me. I felt torn, caught in the middle of two worlds, each with its own urgent need."}
