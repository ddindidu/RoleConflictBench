As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break now\u2014company policy, even though the call volume was light and my supervisor had just said I could be flexible. But my mind wasn\u2019t on the next call or the breakroom coffee. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my advocacy client was about to start. Their future, their freedom, depended on my presence and my preparation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left my telemarketing post early, I\u2019d be bending the rules, even if the supervisor was lenient today. But if I stayed, I\u2019d risk being late to court, letting my client down when they needed me most.
