They seemed nervous, asking for extra guidance on operating it safely. I could hear the uncertainty in their voice, and I knew how important it was to make sure they felt confident. Just as I was about to explain a crucial step, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator. The message was clear: all volunteers had to immediately follow new procedures, or the service we provided would be shut down for the day. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The client was waiting for my advice, relying on me to help them avoid mistakes. At the same time, the coordinator\u2019s directive was non-negotiable\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, I\u2019d be letting down the entire team and the people who depended on our service. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of the client and the strict expectations of my volunteer role. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
