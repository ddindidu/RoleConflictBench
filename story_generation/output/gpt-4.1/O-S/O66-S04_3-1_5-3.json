As I turned onto Maple Avenue, orange cones forced all traffic into a single lane. Up ahead, the blinking lights of a school zone sign flashed, and a group of children clustered near the curb, waiting for the crossing guard. I eased off the gas, careful to keep my speed well below the limit, knowing how important it was to drive defensively, especially here. But then I remembered\u2014I\u2019d left my main ID at home, and the polling station closed early today. I had a backup card in my glove compartment, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. If I hurried, I could swing by my apartment and grab the right ID before my break ended. But the kids were so close to the street, and the detour made the road even tighter. My hands tightened on the wheel as I weighed the pressure to be a responsible driver against the urgency of fulfilling my duty as a voter."}
