My shift as a volunteer started in twenty minutes, and I was the only one with the keys to unlock the community center. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and start the morning service. Just then, two travelers flagged me down, waving frantically beside a pile of heavy suitcases. They needed help loading their bags and wanted to split the fare to the airport\u2014a good fare, but it would take at least forty minutes round trip. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being helpful and professional, never turning away customers in need. But as a volunteer, I knew the disappointment and frustration that would ripple through the crowd if I was late. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the expectations of my job and my commitment to the people waiting for me. The travelers looked at me hopefully, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding an answer."}
