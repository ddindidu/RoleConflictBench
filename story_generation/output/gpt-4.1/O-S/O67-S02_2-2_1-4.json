I grip the wheel, adrenaline already surging, knowing every second counts. As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to respond instantly, to be the lifeline for someone in pain, maybe even in danger. But just as I\u2019m about to pull out, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks, the one person who could push our bill forward. She says she has ten minutes, right now, and after that, she\u2019ll be gone for days. My activist side screams at me\u2014this is the moment to make a difference, to fight for change that could save lives in the long run. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice is in my ear, urging me to move, reminding me of the person waiting, hurting, depending on me. My hands tremble on the steering wheel, torn between the immediate need in front of me and the chance to shape a better future. I can\u2019t do both. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, caught between two worlds, each demanding everything I have."}
