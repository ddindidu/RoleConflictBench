As a judge, I know the parties are waiting for my written judgment\u2014clear, detailed, and timely. Thirty days is the standard, and I pride myself on never missing a deadline. Yet, my phone buzzes with a notification: the activist group I helped organize is about to send a crucial petition to the legislature. They need my signature, my voice, to push for the policy change I\u2019ve championed for years. I feel the pull\u2014my duty to the court, to impartiality and careful reasoning, and my passion for justice outside the courtroom. If I pause to sign, am I compromising my judicial role? If I don\u2019t, am I betraying my cause? The cursor blinks on the blank judgment, the petition link glows on my screen, and I feel the tension knotting in my chest as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
