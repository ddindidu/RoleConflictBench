As an accountant, I know the rules\u2014every number must add up, every form must be perfect. The letter says there\u2019s a discrepancy, and I\u2019m expected to respond immediately. My mind races through spreadsheets and receipts, searching for the error. I pride myself on compliance; it\u2019s my job to make sure everything is right.\n\nBut as a citizen, I also feel the pull of my community. The vaccine clinic is this weekend, and they need volunteers. I promised I\u2019d help, and I know how important it is\u2014public health, safety, doing my part. People are counting on me, and I want to be there.\n\nThe demands press in from both sides. If I focus on the tax issue, I might let down my neighbors. If I go to the clinic, I risk missing the tax authority\u2019s deadline. My stomach knots as I stare at the clock, torn between my duty to the law and my responsibility to my community, unsure which role I should answer first."}
