I had three more sales to make before the end of my shift, or I\u2019d have to explain myself to my manager\u2014again. My script was open, my voice practiced, but the calls were blurring together, and the rejections stung more than usual. Then my phone buzzed: a reminder to vote before the polls closed. I\u2019d planned to go right after work, but I suddenly remembered my driver\u2019s license was at home. I could use my passport or health card, but they were in a drawer across town. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious calling time and risk missing my target. If I stayed, I might not have time to fetch my ID and vote before the polls closed. My manager expected results, and I needed this job. But I also believed in voting, in having my say. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between dialing the next number and grabbing my bag to rush out the door."}
