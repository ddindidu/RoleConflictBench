The line snakes past the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My manager expects me to keep things moving, to be friendly and efficient, and I pride myself on making people\u2019s days a little brighter. Suddenly, my phone buzzes in my apron pocket. I sneak a glance: it\u2019s a producer from the news network, asking if I can go on air right now to speak about the protest and set the record straight. My heart pounds. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist\u2014my chance to reach thousands, to correct the lies spreading online. But I can\u2019t just abandon my register; people are counting on me here, too. I look at the next customer, an elderly woman with a gentle smile, and then at the urgent message on my phone. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I feel torn in two, caught between the expectations of service and the call to speak out."}
