My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cKeep it safe, keep it clean.\u201d I knew I had to mop it up before someone slipped. But as I reached for the mop, my phone buzzed with a weather alert\u2014extreme heat warning. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just a few floors up. She always struggled in the heat, and the city\u2019s guidance was clear: check on vulnerable neighbors during advisories. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left the spill, someone could get hurt. If I ignored Mrs. Lee, she could be in real danger. My hands trembled as I stood between the mop and the stairwell, torn by the demands of my job and my duty as a citizen, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
