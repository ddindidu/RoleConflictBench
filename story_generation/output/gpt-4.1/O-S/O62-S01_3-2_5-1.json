I checked the filtration system and, sure enough, it was malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t address it right away, swimmers could be at risk. My supervisor always emphasized that maintaining equipment was as important as watching the water. But as I glanced at my watch, my stomach twisted. I was supposed to be at the community center in twenty minutes for my volunteer shift. The coordinator had sent a reminder last night: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions.\u201d They were counting on me, especially with the roster so tight. I could already picture the disappointed faces if I was late, the extra burden on the other volunteers. But if I left the pool now, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to keep swimmers safe. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between two places I needed to be, two groups of people depending on me, and no clear way to satisfy them both."}
