Tonight, as I count the register, I notice a small discrepancy\u2014just a few coins off. It\u2019s not enough to affect the total sales, but the rules say I should report any difference, no matter how minor. I glance at the clock, anxious to finish up because my friends are waiting for me. We\u2019ve planned a late-evening jam session, something we haven\u2019t done in months. But as I walk home, guitar slung over my shoulder, I remember the building\u2019s quiet hours start soon. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open, and she\u2019s mentioned how sound carries at night. As a citizen, I know I should respect her right to peace and follow the building\u2019s rules. But my friends are already setting up, and I\u2019m torn between not wanting to let them down and not wanting to disturb my neighbors. The stress from the register lingers, mixing with the guilt of possibly breaking quiet hours. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, wrestling with what I\u2019m supposed to do."}
