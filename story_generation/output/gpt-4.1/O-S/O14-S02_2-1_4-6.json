As a scientist, I know I need to finish summarizing the preliminary data for the departmental meeting in an hour. The results are still raw, and I\u2019m double-checking every number, every graph, making sure I don\u2019t misrepresent anything. My reputation\u2014and the integrity of our research\u2014depends on it. But my phone keeps buzzing. The activist in me can\u2019t ignore it: a post about our cause is exploding online, and people are hungry for more information. If I jump in now, I could educate thousands, maybe even sway public opinion. My colleagues expect precision and caution; my community expects passion and immediacy. I feel my chest tighten as I stare at the blinking cursor on my report and the flashing notifications on my phone, torn between the duty to my science and the urgency of my activism."}
