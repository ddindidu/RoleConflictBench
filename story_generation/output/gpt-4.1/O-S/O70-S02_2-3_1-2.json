I balanced the grocery bags on my handlebars, heart pounding\u2014not just from the rush, but from the crowd\u2019s rising tension around me. I was also here as an activist, helping to organize today\u2019s protest. Suddenly, shouts erupted. Police had started blocking the exits, and panic rippled through the crowd. My fellow organizers looked to me, expecting quick thinking and calm leadership to keep everyone safe. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the customer\u2019s urgent need, the protestors\u2019 trust in me. My phone buzzed again. I stood frozen, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to a stranger and the responsibility I felt to my community. My mind raced, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
