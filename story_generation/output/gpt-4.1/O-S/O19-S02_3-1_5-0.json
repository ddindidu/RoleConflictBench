Mrs. Lee sits across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. She\u2019s anxious, and I know how critical it is to walk her through each medication, to make sure she understands the risks of mixing them. My mind races through the possible interactions, the questions I need to ask, the reassurance I need to give. This is my duty as a pharmacist\u2014my patients trust me to keep them safe.\n\nBut my phone buzzes insistently in my pocket. A message from Maya, my fellow activist, flashes on the screen: \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Media\u2019s here. Can you come?\u201d I picture the small group downtown, their voices barely heard, and I know how much it matters that we show up, that we\u2019re seen. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches to be there, to stand up for what I believe in, but Mrs. Lee needs me now. The expectations of both worlds pull at me, and I can feel the tension building inside, unsure which part of myself I can let down."}
