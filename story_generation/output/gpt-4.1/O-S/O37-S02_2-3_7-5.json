I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my activist group. The vote on the Clean Air Act was happening in less than an hour, and the swing representative was still undecided. They needed me to call, to share my story, to push for change. But I was in the middle of my shift, gloves on, mask tight, and the supervisor had just reminded us about the new hygiene protocols. No phones, no distractions, and every surface had to be spotless. If I broke protocol, I could be written up or even fired. But if I didn\u2019t act now, the legislation might fail. My hands trembled, torn between the responsibility to keep patients safe and the urgent call to fight for a healthier future. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and conviction."}
