He\u2019s still weak, and every movement is slow and careful. I know he depends on me to help him dress and move safely, and I can see the relief in his eyes when I\u2019m there. As I was helping him with his shirt, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the city\u2019s bus route survey. The city\u2019s been changing routes, and I know how much it affects people like me who rely on public transport. The survey closes in an hour, and I\u2019ve been meaning to give feedback about the new schedule. I feel the weight of both responsibilities: Mr. Jenkins needs my full attention right now, but as a citizen, I feel obligated to speak up for myself and others who depend on the buses. My mind races, torn between the immediate needs of my patient and the broader needs of my community. I can\u2019t ignore either, but I only have so much time."}
