The newsletter was packed with updates\u2014new drug approvals, safety alerts, changes in dosing guidelines. I knew I needed to stay sharp, to keep up with the latest so I could give my patients the best care. But my mind kept drifting to the ballot measure. The polling place was just a few blocks away, and the window to vote was closing soon. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to have my voice heard, to help shape the future of my neighborhood. But if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time to catch up on the professional updates I\u2019d been putting off all week. My stomach twisted with anxiety. Both roles demanded my attention, both felt urgent, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down\u2014my patients, my neighbors, or maybe even myself."}
