My phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a message from my activist group: \u201cThe vote is happening now. We need you to call Representative Lee. You might be the deciding voice.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d spent months rallying for this policy, organizing meetings, writing letters, believing that today could be the turning point. But as I glanced up, I spotted a swimmer floundering near the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any second. Yet, the activist in me knew that missing this call could mean losing everything we\u2019d worked for. I gripped my phone, torn between the lives in front of me and the cause I\u2019d poured my soul into, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
