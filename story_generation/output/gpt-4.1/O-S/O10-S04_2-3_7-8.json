I knew I had to call them back and walk through the numbers, but I glanced at the clock and felt my stomach twist. I had just enough time to get to the polling station before it closed. Voting was important to me, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\n\nWhen I arrived, the election official frowned at my registration. There was a mismatch, and I\u2019d have to fill out a provisional ballot form. She explained the process, emphasizing I had only ten minutes before the station closed. My phone vibrated again\u2014the client, calling back, probably growing more frustrated by the minute. I felt torn.
