As the lead engineer, I was responsible for making sure every safety standard was met, and now, with the inspector\u2019s urgent concerns, the entire operation was at risk of being shut down. My team looked to me for direction, waiting for my decision on how to address the issues before the inspector returned in an hour. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d sent a message earlier, suggesting that if I had a spare moment, I should reorganize the supply room according to her new system. I knew she valued flexibility, but she also expected volunteers to follow her guidelines closely. I felt torn\u2014my professional duty demanded my full attention, but I didn\u2019t want to let down the coordinator or the people relying on our volunteer work. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expecting my commitment, each urgent in its own way. I stood frozen, caught between the demands of compliance and the quiet but persistent call to serve."}
