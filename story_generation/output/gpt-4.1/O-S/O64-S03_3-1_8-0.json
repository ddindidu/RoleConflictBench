My mind replayed the scene from earlier: a customer, red-faced and loud, berating me over a coupon that wouldn\u2019t scan. I\u2019d smiled, apologized, and kept my voice calm, even as my heart pounded. That\u2019s what was expected\u2014be patient, be friendly, no matter what. Now, walking through the park, I tried to shake off the tension. The air was cool, the grass dotted with families. I unwrapped a granola bar, the wrapper crinkling in my hand. I spotted the trash bin a few steps away, but I was tired, my feet aching. For a moment, I considered dropping the wrapper on the ground, just this once. But the no-littering sign glared at me, reminding me of my responsibility as a citizen to respect public spaces. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding endless patience, the other expecting me to do the right thing, even when no one was watching. I stood there, torn, the wrapper in my hand, caught between what was easy and what was right."}
