As a lawyer, I knew the stakes\u2014if I didn\u2019t scrutinize every clause, my client could face crippling financial liability. The clock ticked louder with each passing minute, reminding me of my other role. As an advocate, I was expected at the weekly meeting, a routine but necessary part of representing my clients\u2019 interests in court. My phone buzzed with reminders, and I felt the familiar knot in my stomach tighten. If I missed the meeting, I\u2019d let down those who relied on my punctuality and presence. But if I left the contract unchecked, I risked far greater harm. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my undivided attention, each unwilling to wait.
