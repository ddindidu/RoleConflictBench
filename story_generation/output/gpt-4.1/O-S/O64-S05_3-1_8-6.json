As a cashier, I\u2019m supposed to be the calm in the storm, smiling and patient, even as the customer in front of me raises their voice about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I nod, apologize, and try to fix the issue, feeling the eyes of the waiting crowd burning into me. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the advocacy meeting starts in ten minutes. I\u2019m expected to be there, on time, every time, to support my clients and speak up for their needs. My heart pounds. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my manager and the customers who expect friendly, efficient service. If I stay, I\u2019ll be late to the meeting, disappointing the people who rely on my advocacy. I grip the register, torn between the demands of both worlds, wishing I could split myself in two."}
