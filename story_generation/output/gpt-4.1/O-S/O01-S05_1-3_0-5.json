As an architect, I knew my duty was to ensure every detail met safety codes and compliance standards, even if these particular issues seemed unlikely to cause immediate harm. But as an advocate, my mind raced to the upcoming trial\u2014my client\u2019s future hung in the balance, and the opposition was relentless. If I flagged these inconsistencies now, it could delay the project, giving the other side ammunition to question my client\u2019s credibility and intentions. Yet, if I let them slide, I\u2019d be betraying my professional integrity and risking the safety I was sworn to uphold. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding loyalty, each with its own set of consequences. My heart pounded as I stared at the plans, torn between the architect\u2019s duty to safety and the advocate\u2019s responsibility to defend."}
