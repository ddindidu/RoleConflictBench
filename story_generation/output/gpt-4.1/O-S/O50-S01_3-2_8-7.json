As the machine repairer, I was expected to guide clients, especially when they looked as lost as these two. They were about to start a hazardous batch, and I could see they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols. My instinct was to step in, explain the risks, and walk them through the process.\n\nBut as a volunteer, I\u2019d just been at the morning briefing where the coordinator stressed that only designated trainers should instruct staff, to avoid confusion and liability. The new safety steps were clear: volunteers must not intervene directly, but instead report concerns to the coordinator. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014on one hand, the expectation to keep everyone safe and share my expertise; on the other, the demand to respect the chain of command and not overstep my volunteer role. My heart pounded as I watched the staff reach for the start button, torn between my responsibility to protect and my duty to follow the rules."}
