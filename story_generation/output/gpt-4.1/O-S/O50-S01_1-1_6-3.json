They seemed eager to learn, and I found myself slipping into my usual role, offering tips and sharing a few stories to make things clearer. But as the conversation drifted, they started asking about my volunteer work. It was innocent enough\u2014just curiosity about what I do and who I help. I could feel the expectation to be friendly and open, to build rapport as a service provider. At the same time, the volunteer in me bristled. I knew I had to protect the privacy of those I help, even if nothing sensitive was being discussed. My mind raced, torn between being helpful and approachable for my client, and upholding the trust and confidentiality expected of me as a volunteer. The words caught in my throat as I tried to decide how much to share, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
