The weather models had been right\u2014today\u2019s atmospheric conditions were perfect, a rare alignment I\u2019d waited months for. If I missed this window, my experiment, and possibly my funding, would be in jeopardy. My team was counting on me to gather the data that could finally validate our hypothesis. Just as I was prepping the sensors, my phone buzzed. It was the media liaison from the activist group. A major news network needed me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation that was already trending. The public was listening, and if I didn\u2019t speak, our cause could lose credibility. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues\u2019 silent expectations, the community\u2019s urgent need for truth. My hands trembled as I weighed the lab coat against the microphone, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
