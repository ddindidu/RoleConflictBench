The product team\u2019s brainstorming session is starting in five minutes. It\u2019s technically optional, but I know how these things go\u2014if I\u2019m not there, my input on the new feature design will be missing, and I\u2019ll be out of the loop. My team expects me to collaborate, to help shape the direction of our next release. But right now, I\u2019m standing in a cramped polling station, clutching my ID, listening as the election official explains that my registration doesn\u2019t match. If I want my vote to count, I have to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closes in ten minutes. I nod, but my mind races. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the session and maybe let my team down. If I leave, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. Both roles demand something of me, and I feel the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My hands tremble as I stare at the form, torn between my duty as a developer and my right as a voter, knowing I can\u2019t satisfy both."}
