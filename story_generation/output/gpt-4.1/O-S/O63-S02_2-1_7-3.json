As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my breaks only at scheduled times, no exceptions, because the call queue is always overflowing. Today, my break is still twenty minutes away, but my phone buzzes with a notification from my activist group: the online petition to our state senator is about to be sent, and this is my last chance to add my signature. I know how much my voice matters\u2014every name counts when we\u2019re fighting for policy change. But if I step away from my desk now, even for a minute, I risk being flagged for an unscheduled break, and I can already imagine the stern email from my supervisor. My heart pounds as I stare at the petition link, torn between my commitment to my job and my responsibility to the cause I believe in."}
