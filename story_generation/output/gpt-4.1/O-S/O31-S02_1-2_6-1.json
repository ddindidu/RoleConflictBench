As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity and fairness\u2014no favoritism, no bending the rules. The law is clear, but I know the owner: she\u2019s a single mother, always juggling two jobs, and she\u2019s inside organizing the protest I helped plan. My phone buzzes. The march is about to start, and as an activist, I\u2019m needed at the front, leading the first chant, rallying everyone for the cause we\u2019ve worked so hard for. My fellow officers expect me to enforce the law without exception, but my fellow activists expect me to stand with them, not against them. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014one visible, one hidden\u2014pressing down on me. The ticket book feels heavy in my hand, and my heart pounds as I glance between the car, the protestors gathering, and the badge on my chest."}
