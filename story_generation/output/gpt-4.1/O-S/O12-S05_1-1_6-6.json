My team expected quick turnarounds, and I prided myself on being reliable. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. I had a routine advocacy meeting in fifteen minutes, and punctuality was non-negotiable. The legal team counted on me to be present, to represent our clients and keep cases moving. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I stayed to fix the bug, I\u2019d be late and let down my colleagues in advocacy. If I left now, the bug would linger, and my developer team would be frustrated. My mind raced, torn between two worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I hovered over my keyboard, paralyzed, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to let down."}
