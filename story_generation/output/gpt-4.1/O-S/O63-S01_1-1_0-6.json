Most days, the calls were routine\u2014customers asked about pricing or features, and I had the answers ready. Today was no different, except my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply closet, asking us to try it if we had time during our shift. I glanced at the clock; my telemarketing shift ended just before my volunteer hours began.\n\nAs I fielded another call, my mind wandered. The script demanded my focus, and I couldn\u2019t risk missing a customer\u2019s question. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my head\u2014she trusted us to follow her guidance, to make things run smoother for everyone. I felt pulled in two directions: the expectation to be present and responsive for my callers, and the responsibility to honor the coordinator\u2019s request. My stomach tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at once. The pressure built, and I wondered how I could possibly meet the demands of both roles without letting someone down."}
