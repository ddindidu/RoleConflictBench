As a judge, I know the importance of drafting a clear, detailed scheduling order for the new case assigned to me. The deadline looms at the end of the week, and I can already feel the pressure to ensure every legal nuance is addressed.

I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the stress of these incompatible expectations tightens in my chest."}
