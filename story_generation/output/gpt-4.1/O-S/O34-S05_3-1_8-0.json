My headset buzzed with voices\u2014controllers from each sector, all needing my coordination to clear airspace and reroute traffic. My mind raced, calculating altitudes, headings, and the domino effect of every instruction. At the same time, my phone vibrated on the desk. It was a client, anxious and insistent, seeking clarity about a legal issue that couldn\u2019t wait. As their advocate, I was expected to provide precise, reliable advice, even in these informal moments. But my attention was split; the airspace demanded my full focus, yet the client\u2019s trust depended on my immediate response. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting my undivided expertise. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking lights on my radar and the flashing phone screen, torn between the lives in the sky and the person relying on my counsel."}
