The machines were running hotter than they should\u2014missing the last service window had pushed them to their limits. As the only repairer on shift, I knew I had to act fast, clean out the filters, and run diagnostics before something failed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the minor hearing for my client was about to start. It was a small case, nothing life-changing, but I\u2019d promised to represent them, to be their voice in a system that often ignored the little guy. My supervisor expected the machines to be running smoothly by the end of the hour, and my client expected me to stand up for them in court. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the toolbox, my mind racing between the whirring machines and the courtroom waiting for my presence."}
