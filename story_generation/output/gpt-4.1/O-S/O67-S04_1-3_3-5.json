I\u2019d left my wallet in my locker, and the polls would close in less than an hour. As an ambulance driver, I knew the kit had to be perfect\u2014missing supplies could mean the difference between life and death. But as a citizen, I had a duty to vote, and tonight was my only chance. My supervisor expected a flawless check, and the city expected my voice at the ballot box. I stared at the half-checked kit, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d risk missing something crucial in the kit. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, but my mind was torn, wrestling with the demands of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy either without letting the other down."}
