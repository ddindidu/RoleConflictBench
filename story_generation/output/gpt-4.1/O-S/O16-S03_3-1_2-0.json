As I passed a bench, I noticed a man slumped over, pale and sweating, struggling to breathe. Instinctively, I rushed to his side, my training kicking in. His symptoms were severe and unfamiliar\u2014his pulse was racing, his skin clammy. I needed to act fast, but I had no medical equipment with me. I spotted a nearby trash bin and realized it might contain a discarded water bottle or something I could use to help him, but the park was lined with no-littering signs, and rummaging through public trash was clearly against the rules. As a doctor, I felt the crushing responsibility to diagnose and help him immediately, but as a citizen, I was bound to respect public property and the law. My heart pounded as I knelt beside him, torn between my duty to save a life and my obligation to follow the rules."}
