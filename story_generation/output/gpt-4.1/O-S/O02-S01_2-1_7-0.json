My manager\u2019s email sat at the top of my inbox, marked urgent: \u201cWe need your time estimates for the quarterly roadmap by noon.\u201d I knew how much the team relied on my input\u2014if I delayed, the whole planning process would stall. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the food pantry started in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised to be there, and I hated the idea of letting the coordinator down. Still, I also knew that, at the pantry, a few extra hands could cover for me if I was late. At work, though, my absence would be glaring. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility I felt as an engineer and the commitment I\u2019d made as a volunteer. I could feel the pressure building in my chest, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
