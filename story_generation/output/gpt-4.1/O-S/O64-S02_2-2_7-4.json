My manager expects me to keep the line moving and treat everyone with warmth, even when the line snakes past the bakery. I\u2019m halfway through ringing up a regular when my phone buzzes in my apron pocket. I glance down and see the name of the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. My heart leaps\u2014this is the chance to push for the bill I\u2019ve poured my evenings into, the one that could actually make a difference. But the aide only has ten minutes, and I can\u2019t just abandon my register. The customers are tired and hungry, and my manager is watching.
