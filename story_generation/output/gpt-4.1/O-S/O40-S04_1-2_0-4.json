As a carpenter, I\u2019m expected to be on site by seven sharp, boots laced and ready, because safety briefings start right at the bell. Missing them isn\u2019t just frowned upon\u2014it\u2019s a risk to everyone, and I know the foreman\u2019s patience is wearing thin. But as I\u2019m about to leave, I remember: my ID is still at home, and tomorrow is Election Day. If I don\u2019t grab it this morning, I won\u2019t be able to vote. The polling station is strict\u2014no ID, no ballot. My stomach knots. If I swing by home, I\u2019ll be late to work, miss the safety talk, and maybe put my job on the line. If I go straight to the site, I\u2019ll lose my only chance to vote, something I promised myself I\u2019d do this year. I stand in the driveway, keys in hand, torn between my duty to my job and my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
