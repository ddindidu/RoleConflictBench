Dispatch had said the patient\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t life-threatening, but every second still felt urgent. My training drilled into me: safety first, no matter the pressure. I kept my speed in check, eyes darting between the road and the clock, feeling the weight of responsibility for my partner and everyone around us.\n\nThen my phone buzzed. The news network. They needed me\u2014now\u2014to speak on air, to set the record straight about our cause before misinformation spread any further. I\u2019d fought so hard for this moment, to have a platform, to educate the public. But I was behind the wheel, sirens wailing, city traffic thick as molasses. My heart pounded. If I answered, I\u2019d be distracted, risking lives. If I ignored the call, I\u2019d miss a rare chance to make a difference, to reach thousands.\n\nThe ambulance crawled forward, the phone vibrating insistently in my pocket. I felt split in two, torn between the duty to my patient and my cause, both demanding my full attention, both unwilling to wait."}
