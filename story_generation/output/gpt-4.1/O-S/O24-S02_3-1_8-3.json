Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, in bold. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to halt, reassess, and ensure the law was applied correctly, even if it meant disrupting the entire courtroom. The weight of impartiality pressed on me; I had to be the embodiment of the law, not my own beliefs.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. The activist in me knew what it was: the online petition I\u2019d helped draft, urging lawmakers to protect the very rights now in jeopardy. The window to add my signature was closing. I felt the pull\u2014my name could matter, my voice could join the chorus for change. Yet, as a judge, I was supposed to remain above the fray, uninvolved in public advocacy, especially on issues I might rule on.\n\nI stood frozen, the courtroom silent, the petition open on my phone, the law shifting beneath my feet. My two worlds collided, and I felt the strain of being both guardian and challenger of the law."}
