I\u2019ve already closed more deals than I expected this week\u2014my manager will be thrilled. The pressure to keep up this momentum is real; every call could mean another sale, another step closer to a bonus. I glance at my inbox between calls and spot the city newsletter. There\u2019s a survey about the new bus routes, and I know how important public transit is for people in my neighborhood. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to give feedback, to help shape decisions that affect us all. But the survey will take time, and every minute I\u2019m not dialing is a minute I\u2019m not selling. My manager expects me to stay focused, to keep my numbers high. Yet, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that if I ignore the survey, I\u2019m letting my community down. The phone rings again, and I hesitate, torn between my duty to my job and my duty to my city."}
