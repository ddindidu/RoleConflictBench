He\u2019s heartbroken,\u201d she pleaded, setting the toy on my workbench. I examined the snapped axle and chipped paint, already calculating the time and materials needed. She waited, expecting a quick answer and, I knew, a promise to restore her grandson\u2019s joy.\n\nBut as I reached for my notepad to jot down a quote, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. The polling station was open until evening, and my schedule was light, but I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote early, before the lines grew. I could see the expectation in Mrs. Patel\u2019s face\u2014she needed reassurance, a commitment. At the same time, I felt the weight of my civic duty, the responsibility to have my voice heard.\n\nMy hands hovered over the toy, my mind torn between the immediate needs of my craft and the broader call of citizenship. Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I could feel the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
