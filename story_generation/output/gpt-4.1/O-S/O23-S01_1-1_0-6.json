It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my client expected a thorough review. I could hear my phone buzz\u2014a new email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply closet at the shelter, mentioning it wasn\u2019t mandatory, just if I had time. I glanced at the clock. I had planned to spend the afternoon at the shelter, but the contract nagged at me. As a lawyer, I prided myself on being meticulous and timely, even if the deadline was far off. As a volunteer, I wanted to be reliable, to show I cared about the coordinator\u2019s ideas and the people we served. I felt pulled in both directions, the weight of professional responsibility pressing against the quiet but persistent call to help. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be the diligent attorney and the dependable volunteer. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
