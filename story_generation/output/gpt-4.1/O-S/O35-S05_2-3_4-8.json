As a subway operator, I was trained to keep calm, to prioritize passenger safety above all else. That\u2019s when the call came in\u2014a suspicious, unattended bag in car three. My heart thudded. Protocol demanded I halt the train, alert security, and ensure every passenger was safe. But as an advocate, I was due in court in less than an hour, and this was no ordinary hearing. My client\u2019s future hung in the balance, and my absence could tip the scales against them. I could almost hear the judge\u2019s gavel, feel the weight of my client\u2019s anxious gaze. The radio crackled, urging immediate action. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my full presence, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands hovered over the controls, my mind racing, caught between duty to the hundreds on my train and the one person waiting for me in court."}
