My job as a repairer was to keep these machines running and guide clients on proper usage, but he never listened, and now material was piling up in the scrap bin. I wanted to step in, explain the right way, but my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from another client. As their advocate, I was expected to give clear, accurate legal advice, and this client was in a crisis, waiting for my guidance before making a critical move. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the operator needed my technical expertise to stop the waste, but the client on the phone needed my legal mind, right now, to avoid disaster. My heart pounded as I looked from the malfunctioning machine to my phone, torn between the demands of two people who both counted on me for completely different reasons."}
