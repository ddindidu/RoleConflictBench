As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge, and I prided myself on giving them the best advice. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a message: the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks was available to talk\u2014right now, for just ten minutes. My heart pounded. As an activist, I\u2019d promised my group I\u2019d push for this bill, and this call could be the breakthrough we needed.
