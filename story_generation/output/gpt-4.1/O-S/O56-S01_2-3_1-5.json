A woman hovered at the entrance, clutching her purse, her eyes darting nervously. As a hairdresser, I knew how important it was to greet clients warmly, to put them at ease from the moment they walked in. I started to rise, ready to offer a smile and a reassuring word. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I was due at the community center in an hour, where I volunteered sorting confidential medical files. There, I was expected to be discreet, to respect the privacy of every person whose name crossed my desk. The contrast between the openness required in the salon and the secrecy demanded at the center tugged at me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the urge to be welcoming and open here, and the need to be silent and guarded there. As I stood between the nervous client and the thought of those private files, I felt torn, unsure how to balance the warmth expected in one world with the restraint required in the other."}
