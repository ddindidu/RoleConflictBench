As a pharmacist, I knew how critical it was to walk her through each medication, especially with her new blood thinner. She looked anxious, and I could sense she needed reassurance. I started explaining the risks and what to watch for, determined to make sure she understood everything. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was marked urgent: all volunteers had to immediately implement a new safety protocol, or the service would be suspended. I was supposed to drop everything and follow the new procedures right away. My mind raced\u2014if I left Mrs. Lee now, she might miss something vital and end up in danger. But if I ignored the coordinator\u2019s directive, I\u2019d be letting down the team and risking the entire volunteer operation. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between my duty to my patient and my commitment to the volunteer group, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
