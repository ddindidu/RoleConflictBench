As a nursing assistant, I was expected to help her eat, to ease her pain, to be present and gentle. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the trial for my advocacy client was about to begin. His future, his freedom, depended on my presence and my voice in that courtroom. I could hear the urgency in his last message, pleading for reassurance, for guidance. Yet here was Mrs. Carter, her eyes searching mine for comfort, her pain so immediate and raw. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, the hospital room closing in, the courtroom looming in my mind. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the task before me, but my thoughts kept drifting to the courthouse, to the client waiting for me. I was torn, pulled by two lives that needed me in different ways, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
