The store is quiet until a woman approaches, clutching a blender and looking anxious. \u201cI lost my receipt, but it\u2019s broken. Can I return it?\u201d she asks. I know the policy: no receipt, no return. My manager expects me to enforce it, no exceptions. I see her frustration, and I want to help, but I also know I could get written up if I bend the rules.\n\nMy phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Jamie, my friend from the activist group. \u201cWe need more people at the protest\u2014police are here. Can you come?\u201d I glance at the clock. My shift isn\u2019t over, but the cause is urgent. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the store needs me to be the reliable cashier, following every rule, while my activist friends expect me to show up, to stand for what I believe in. My heart pounds as I look from the customer\u2019s pleading eyes to the phone in my hand, torn between duty and conviction, not sure which demand I can bear to ignore."}
