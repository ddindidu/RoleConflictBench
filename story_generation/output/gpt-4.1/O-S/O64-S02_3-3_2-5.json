It was the end of my shift, and I was responsible for closing out the high-value transactions\u2014every cent had to be accounted for, no mistakes allowed. My manager expected nothing less; one error could mean hours of paperwork and suspicion. As I handed a customer their receipt, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from my activist group flashed on the screen: the state legislature was holding a surprise vote on the bill we\u2019d fought for all year. The outcome would come down to a single, undecided representative, and I was the only one with a direct line to their office. I was expected to call, to make my case, to be the voice for everyone who couldn\u2019t be there. My hands shook as I counted the cash, the weight of both roles pressing down on me.
