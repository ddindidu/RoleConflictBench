The symptoms were severe, and nothing in his chart or initial tests pointed to a clear diagnosis. As a doctor, I knew every minute counted; I was expected to piece together the clues, order the right tests, and act fast to save his life. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety twisted in my chest. Today was the only morning I could run home to grab my valid ID for voting\u2014without it, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cast my ballot tomorrow. The hospital was short-staffed, and leaving, even briefly, would mean abandoning my patient and my team at a critical moment. Yet, as a citizen, I felt the weight of my responsibility to vote, to have my voice heard. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between the life in front of me and the civic duty that awaited."}
