The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. My manager expects speed and accuracy\u2014no mistakes, no delays. I can feel the pressure mounting with every sigh from the queue. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket. I sneak a glance: a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. \u201cWe need more people at the protest\u2014can you come now? Media\u2019s here.\u201d I picture the small crowd downtown, holding signs, voices raised for a cause I care about deeply. I want to be there, to stand with them, to make a difference. But here, I\u2019m needed too. The next customer steps up, and I force a smile, my mind torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my convictions. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, caught in the impossible space between duty and passion."}
