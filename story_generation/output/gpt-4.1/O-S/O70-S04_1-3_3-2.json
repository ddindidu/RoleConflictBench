My last delivery sat on the seat beside me, a small box marked \u201cfragile.\u201d The address was just a few blocks away, but I knew from experience that no one was ever home at this hour. My job required me to leave the package somewhere safe, snap a photo, and confirm delivery. If anything happened to it, I\u2019d be held responsible. But if I didn\u2019t make it to the polling station in time, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this year.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPolling station closes soon.\u201d My heart pounded as I pulled up to the darkened porch. Should I take the extra minute to find the safest spot for the package, or rush off and risk leaving it exposed? My employer expected perfection, but my civic duty called just as loudly. I stood on the porch, package in hand, torn between two worlds, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as the minutes slipped away."}
