The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime\u2014find the fault, fast.\u201d I knelt, tools in hand, tracing wires and checking the sensor, my mind racing through possible causes. Every minute the line was down, pressure mounted. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a calendar alert. My volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one with the keys to the community center, and people would already be waiting outside, some of them elderly, some with nowhere else to go. I pictured their faces, the trust they placed in me to open the doors on time. My hands trembled as I tightened a screw, torn between the urgent demands of the factory and the quiet responsibility waiting across town. Both roles needed me, right now, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides."}
