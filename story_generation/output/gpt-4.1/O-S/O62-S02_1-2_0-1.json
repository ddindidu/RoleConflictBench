The sun beat down, and the water sparkled, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed with messages from my activist group\u2014today was the big protest, and I was supposed to lead the first chant. I could already hear the distant hum of the gathering crowd, feel the energy building. But here, at the pool, a few swimmers kept drifting toward the deep end. They weren\u2019t in trouble, not yet, but I knew my job: never take my eyes off them, not even for a second. The expectation was clear\u2014vigilance, responsibility, safety. Yet, my heart pounded with the urgency of the protest, the cause I believed in, the people counting on me to stand up and speak out. I gripped the armrest, torn between the duty to protect these swimmers and the call to fight for justice. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, demanding I choose."}
