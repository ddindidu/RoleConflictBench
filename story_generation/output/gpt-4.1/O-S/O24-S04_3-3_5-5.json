As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, detailed order outlining the defendant\u2019s release conditions\u2014no room for error, especially with someone\u2019s freedom at stake. The defendant\u2019s attorney waited anxiously, knowing every minute mattered for his client still in custody. My phone buzzed: a reminder that the polls would close in less than an hour. I had one chance to vote, and I needed to bring my ID, which was inconveniently at home. The courthouse was a good twenty minutes from my apartment, and the polling station would close soon after. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d risk delaying the order, keeping someone in jail longer than necessary. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote in this crucial election. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014justice for one, civic duty for all. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the demands of the bench and the ballot box."}
