I could feel the exhaustion in my arms, but I forced a calm smile, knowing my job was to listen, apologize, and fix what I could. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the polling station would close in twenty minutes. I\u2019d rushed here after voting, but the poll worker had stopped me, pointing out the smudged signature on my ballot envelope. \u201cPlease re-sign, or your vote might not count,\u201d she\u2019d said, her tone firm. Now, with the client\u2019s demands echoing in my ears and the weight of my civic duty pressing on my conscience, I felt torn. The client expected my full attention and a perfect fix, but the poll worker\u2019s instructions replayed in my mind, reminding me that my vote could be at risk. My hands trembled as I held the scissors, caught between the need to satisfy my client and the responsibility to ensure my voice was heard in the election."}
