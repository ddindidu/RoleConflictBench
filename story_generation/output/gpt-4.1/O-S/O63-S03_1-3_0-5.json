Most days, the calls blurred together\u2014polite voices, a few objections, nothing I couldn\u2019t handle with the lines I\u2019d memorized. But today, my mind kept drifting to the ballot measure. The polling place was just down the street, and the window to vote was closing in two hours. As a citizen, I\u2019d always believed in showing up, staying informed, making my voice count. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to stay on the line, handle every question, and not leave my post until my shift ended. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flicked over the cubicles, making sure we stuck to the script and the schedule. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I left now, I\u2019d let my team down and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to participate in something that mattered to my neighborhood. The phone rang again, and I hesitated, torn between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a citizen."}
