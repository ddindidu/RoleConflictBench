The bride-to-be and her friends rushed in, faces tense, glancing at their watches. I smiled, welcoming them, trying to ease their nerves. My job was to make them feel special, calm, and cared for, especially on a day like this. As I led them to their seats, I noticed one of the bridesmaids clutching a half-eaten sandwich, crumbs trailing behind her. She looked around, then casually tossed the wrapper under a chair. My heart skipped. I remembered my walk through the park that morning, the signs urging everyone to keep the area clean, the pride I felt in respecting public spaces. Now, as a citizen, I felt a responsibility to address the litter, to uphold the rules I believed in. But as a hairdresser, I was expected to keep the mood light, to avoid confrontation, especially with anxious clients. I stood frozen, torn between my duty to the community and my commitment to my clients, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
