Mrs. Lee, my regular, smiled at her reflection but then hesitated. \u201cCould you just trim a little more off the fringe?\u201d she asked, her tone gentle. I knew she\u2019d never complain, but I also knew she\u2019d be disappointed if I rushed. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today. No exceptions.\u201d The shelter was short-staffed, and I\u2019d promised to help with intake as soon as the doors opened. I looked at Mrs. Lee, her trust in me clear, and then at the clock again. My heart pounded. If I stayed to perfect her fringe, I\u2019d be late for my shift and let the team down. If I hurried, I\u2019d risk disappointing a loyal client. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing there with scissors in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
