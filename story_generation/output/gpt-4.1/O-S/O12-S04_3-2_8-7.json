The production outage was my fault\u2014a bug in my code had locked out thousands of users. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need you on this, now.\u201d But I was standing in the middle of the polling station, ballot envelope in hand, when the poll worker frowned and pointed out the smudged signature. \u201cPlease re-sign here, or your vote might not count,\u201d she said gently. My phone buzzed again: \u201cAre you there? We need a fix ASAP.\u201d I felt torn in two. As a developer, I was expected to drop everything and restore the service. As a voter, I was supposed to follow every instruction to ensure my ballot was valid. My mind raced\u2014if I left the line to troubleshoot, I might lose my chance to vote. If I stayed, the outage would drag on, and customers would keep calling. My hands shook as I stared at the pen, the envelope, and my phone, caught between two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
