A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now\u2014no frantic splashing, no cries for help. Still, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. As a lifeguard, I was expected to watch every movement, every ripple, never missing a sign of trouble. But my phone buzzed again, vibrating with urgency. The court session was about to start, and as the advocate for my client, my presence was non-negotiable. The judge had warned me: one more late arrival, and the case could be dismissed. My client\u2019s future hung in the balance, and I was the only one standing between them and a harsh verdict. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the pool and the courtroom.
