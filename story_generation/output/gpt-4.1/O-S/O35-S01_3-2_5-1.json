My heart jumped. The protocol was clear: stop the train, check the situation, and ensure passenger safety. I grabbed the radio, ready to alert the control center, but my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford delays today. Every minute counts.\u201d I pictured the line of people waiting for breakfast, the other volunteers counting on me to help open up. But here, in the train, someone needed urgent help. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the responsibility to strangers in two different worlds. My hands trembled as I stood between the train doors, torn by the demands of duty and compassion, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
