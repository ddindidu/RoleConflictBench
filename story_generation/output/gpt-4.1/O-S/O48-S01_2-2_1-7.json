As a nursing assistant, I know how important it is to be gentle and patient, especially since he\u2019s still in pain and nervous about moving. He trusts me, and I want to make sure he feels safe. But as I reached for his arm, I remembered the new safety steps the volunteer coordinator emphasized yesterday\u2014always use the gait belt, even if the patient seems steady, and never help someone stand without another staff member present. The coordinator was clear: these rules are non-negotiable, and everyone must follow them to prevent accidents. Mr. Lee looked at me, waiting, clearly uncomfortable and wanting to get dressed quickly. I could see he was getting anxious, and I didn\u2019t want to make him feel helpless or embarrassed. My mind raced, torn between my training as a nursing assistant to provide comfort and my responsibility as a volunteer to strictly follow the new safety protocols. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between what Mr. Lee needed from me and what the coordinator expected."}
