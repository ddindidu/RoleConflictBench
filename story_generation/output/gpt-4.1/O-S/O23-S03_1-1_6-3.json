Someone I\u2019d just met leaned in, curiosity bright in their eyes, and asked, \u201cSo, what kind of cases are you working on these days?\u201d I felt the familiar tug of expectation\u2014on one hand, as a lawyer, I\u2019m bound by confidentiality and the trust my clients place in me. On the other, as a citizen, I\u2019m supposed to be open, engaged, and contribute to the community\u2019s understanding of local issues. Just this morning, the city newsletter had arrived, asking for feedback on bus routes\u2014a topic I knew well because of a client\u2019s ongoing dispute with the city transit authority. I could offer valuable insight, but doing so might betray my client\u2019s privacy. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I found myself caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
