I know the rules: if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get written up, maybe even sent home. My crew depends on me, and I can\u2019t let them down. But I\u2019m standing in the school gym, ballot envelope in hand, as the poll worker frowns and points to a smudge on my signature. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she says. I nod, but my hands are shaking. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss my chance to fix the ballot. If I stay, I\u2019ll be late for the briefing. Both sides are counting on me\u2014my team for a safe, productive day, and my community for a fair election. My heart pounds as I stare at the pen, torn between duty to my job and my right to vote, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
