My manager\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cStay friendly, no matter what.\u201d I nod, apologize, and promise to fix the issue, even as the line behind her grows longer and more impatient. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I need to vote before my shift ends. I finally clock out and rush to the polling station, only to find a long line snaking out the door. I join it, relieved to be almost done with the day. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d The new line is longer, but the official insists. I hesitate, torn. As a voter, I know I should follow instructions, but as a cashier, I\u2019ve just spent hours managing lines and frustrated people, always trying to make things easier for them. Now, I\u2019m the one in line, and I feel the same frustration. I stand there, caught between following the rules and wanting a little kindness for myself."}
