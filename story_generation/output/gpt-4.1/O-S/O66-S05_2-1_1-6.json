The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, to ease his stress, to be reliable. But my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the weekly advocacy meeting was starting in fifteen minutes. I was expected to be there, to represent my client, to show up as the dependable advocate my colleagues and clients counted on. My mind raced, torn between the man in my back seat and the people waiting for me in the conference room. If I took the fastest route, I might make it for him, but I\u2019d be late for the meeting. If I prioritized my meeting, he\u2019d miss his train. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible expectations pulling me in two directions at once."}
