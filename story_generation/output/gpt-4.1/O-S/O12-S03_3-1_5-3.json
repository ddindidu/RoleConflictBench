The architects from three different teams were pinging me, all waiting for my input on the new feature specs. The launch date had just been moved up, and now everyone was blocked until I could make some decisions. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your answers today so the teams can move forward.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that any delay from me would ripple through the project.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with the city newsletter. I remembered the survey about the new bus routes\u2014something I cared about, since I relied on public transit every day. The survey closed next week, but I knew if I didn\u2019t fill it out now, I\u2019d probably forget. As a citizen, I wanted to give feedback, to help shape the city\u2019s future. But as a developer, I was already behind, and the teams were waiting. My mind raced, torn between my responsibility to my job and my responsibility to my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
