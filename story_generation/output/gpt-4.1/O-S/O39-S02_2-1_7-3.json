Two minutes until the safety briefing\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. The foreman\u2019s already eyeing the crew, making sure we\u2019re all present. I know the drill: be on time, listen up, work as a team. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I see the notification I\u2019ve been waiting for. The petition to push for stricter labor safety laws is about to be sent to the state senator. I have one last chance to add my name, to stand with the other activists, to show that workers like me care about these changes. My thumb hovers over the screen. If I\u2019m late to the briefing, I\u2019ll get called out, maybe even sent home for the day. But if I don\u2019t sign, I\u2019ll miss my chance to make a difference, to be more than just another laborer following orders. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the rules of the site and the call to fight for something bigger."}
