As a carpenter, I know the importance of safety\u2014every nail, every saw blade, every ladder must be checked before I even think about building. My supervisor expects me to inspect and maintain my tools, and I take pride in making sure everything is in perfect order. But as I walked through the park on my way to the site, I finished my coffee and looked for a trash bin. The nearest one was overflowing, and a few people had left cups and wrappers on the ground. The city has strict no-littering laws, and I\u2019ve always believed in respecting public spaces. I hesitated, cup in hand, feeling the pressure of time. If I stopped to find another bin, I\u2019d be late for my safety checks, risking a rushed inspection and possibly endangering my coworkers. But if I left the cup, I\u2019d be breaking the law and disrespecting my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give without letting the other down."}
