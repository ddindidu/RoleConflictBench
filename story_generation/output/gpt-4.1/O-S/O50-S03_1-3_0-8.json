The plant was quiet\u2014production was slow, and this machine hadn\u2019t been used in weeks, but my supervisor wanted it ready \u201cjust in case.\u201d I was deep into diagnostics, wires and manuals spread around me, when the building alarms blared. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning; outside, I could see water pooling along the curb, creeping higher with every minute.\n\nAs a repairer, I knew I was expected to stay, to find the source of the glitch and get the machine running. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: the city needed everyone to evacuate, to help neighbors, to keep the streets clear for emergency crews. My hands shook as I weighed the demands\u2014my job\u2019s expectation to fix the machine, my duty to the community\u2019s safety. The alarms echoed in my ears, and I stood frozen, torn between the humming machine and the rising water outside."}
