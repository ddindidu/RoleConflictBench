The dispatcher\u2019s voice was replaced by a news producer: \u201cWe need you live, now. Misinformation is spreading\u2014your voice matters.\u201d My heart thudded. As an ambulance driver, I knew the kit had to be perfect; missing supplies could mean the difference between life and death. But as an activist, I\u2019d spent months preparing for moments like this, when the truth needed a champion and the community needed clarity. I glanced at the half-finished inventory, guilt prickling at the thought of leaving it incomplete. Yet, the thought of letting falsehoods go unchallenged on national television made my stomach twist. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent in their own way. I stood frozen, torn between the silent, steady responsibility in my hands and the loud, immediate call to action ringing in my ear."}
