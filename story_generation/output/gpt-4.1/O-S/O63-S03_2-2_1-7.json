I fumble, glancing at the script, trying to sound confident. My supervisor expects me to handle objections, keep the call going, and never admit uncertainty. My numbers are down this week; I can\u2019t afford to lose another sale.\n\nBut outside, the city is shimmering in the heat. The news blares warnings: stay hydrated, check on vulnerable neighbors. I remember Mrs. Lee, two doors down, who lives alone and sometimes forgets to turn on her air conditioner. As a citizen, I know I should check on her, make sure she\u2019s safe. The expectation to help in emergencies tugs at me, but my job demands I stay glued to my desk, headset on, voice cheerful, no matter what.\n\nMy hand hovers over the \u201chold\u201d button, heart pounding. The customer is waiting for answers. Mrs. Lee might be waiting for help. I sit, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
