My inbox was filling up with urgent messages from QA, and my manager had just pinged me, asking for a fix before the end of the day. The pressure was mounting; I knew how much our users depended on the app, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down. Just as I was about to run another test, my phone buzzed with a city alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. She rarely left her apartment and didn\u2019t have air conditioning. The city\u2019s message urged everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to be a responsible citizen, to make sure Mrs. Lee was safe, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the demands piling up at work. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to fix the app and the responsibility to help someone in need right next door."}
