The radar screen glowed with the usual green blips, but my focus was on Flight 782, about to cross into the neighboring sector. I needed to coordinate with the next controller, confirm the handoff, and ensure the route was clear. My shift was supposed to end in ten minutes, but the next controller was running late. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I was the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center this morning. People would already be waiting outside, some of them elderly, relying on me to start the day\u2019s service. My supervisor expected flawless coordination here, no delays, no mistakes. The volunteer coordinator, on the other hand, had stressed the importance of punctuality, especially since I was the only one with the keys. My heart pounded as I stared at the radar, torn between the responsibility of keeping the skies safe and the faces I knew would be waiting in the morning chill."}
