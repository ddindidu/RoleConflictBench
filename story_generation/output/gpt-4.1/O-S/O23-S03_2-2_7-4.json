As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was sacred. My assistant, new to the firm and eager to help, hovered at my door, asking for access to files she didn\u2019t need to see. \u201cIt\u2019ll save us time,\u201d she insisted, her eyes hopeful. I felt the weight of my responsibility pressing down on me. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district was starting. As a citizen, I prided myself on being engaged, informed, and vocal about my community\u2019s future. I wanted to listen, maybe even submit a question. But the assistant waited, and the files sat on my screen, while the forum\u2019s live feed beckoned from my laptop. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014torn between upholding my professional ethics and fulfilling my civic duty. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
