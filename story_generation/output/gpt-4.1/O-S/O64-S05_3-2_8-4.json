She\u2019s upset about a coupon, her words clipped and loud. I force a smile, reminding myself to stay calm, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, even as my phone vibrates in my pocket. I know it\u2019s my client\u2014her hearing is in an hour, and she\u2019s counting on me to be prepared, to represent her with the focus and care she deserves. My mind races with legal arguments and evidence I still need to review, but I can\u2019t leave the register. The manager is watching, and the customers behind her are growing restless. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the demand to be patient and pleasant here, and the responsibility to be sharp and unwavering for my client. My heart pounds as I try to juggle the demands, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
