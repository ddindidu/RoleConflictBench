As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to take my break at the allotted time, but today the call volume is unusually light. My supervisor even mentioned we could be flexible with our breaks if things stayed slow. I felt a small sense of relief\u2014until I remembered my volunteer shift at the community center. The coordinator had sent a group message this morning, reminding us that every volunteer needed to be in place right as the doors opened. The roster was tight, and they were counting on me. I stared at my phone, torn. If I left for my volunteer shift now, I\u2019d be early, but I\u2019d be bending the rules at work. If I waited for my official break, I\u2019d risk being late to volunteer, letting down the team that needed every hand. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations from both sides, feeling the pressure of not wanting to disappoint anyone."}
