Today, a patient sat before me, describing a baffling mix of symptoms\u2014persistent fatigue, joint pain, and a strange rash. The test results were inconclusive, and nothing fit neatly into any diagnosis I knew. I felt the weight of my responsibility; my patient expected answers, and I was determined to find them.\n\nLater, needing a break, I took a walk in the park. The air was fresh, and I tried to clear my mind. As I passed a bench, I noticed a crumpled medical mask on the ground, just steps from a trash bin. The signs clearly said \u201cNo Littering.\u201d I hesitated. The mask might be contaminated, and as a citizen, I should respect public property and follow the law. But as a doctor, I was acutely aware of the risks of touching potentially infectious waste without gloves. My mind raced\u2014should I pick it up to keep the park safe, or leave it and respect my own safety and the law? I stood there, torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me."}
