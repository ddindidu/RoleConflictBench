As a taxi driver, I kept my hands steady on the wheel, eyes scanning the road, making sure I obeyed every traffic law. The roads were clear, the speed limit reasonable, and I prided myself on driving safely. But as an advocate, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s anxious questions. She wanted to know if her landlord could really evict her so suddenly, and what her rights were. I knew the law well, but I also knew the dangers of giving legal advice in such an informal setting. My role as a driver demanded my full attention on the road, but my role as an advocate pulled me toward her, urging me to offer clarity and reassurance. I could sense her desperation, and I wanted to help, but I also worried about the risks\u2014misunderstandings, liability, or missing a crucial detail while distracted. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to drive safely and the urge to provide the guidance she needed. The tension built inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
