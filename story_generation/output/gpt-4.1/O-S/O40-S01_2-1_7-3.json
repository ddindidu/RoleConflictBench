As a carpenter, I knew she expected me to repair or replace the warped boards so she could safely enjoy her backyard again. While I worked, Mrs. Lee lingered nearby, chatting about her garden and the weather. The conversation drifted, and soon she mentioned her son\u2019s recent troubles\u2014nothing too sensitive, but personal enough that I felt the weight of my other role as a volunteer in the community. I was trained to respect privacy, to never share details about the people I helped, even in passing. Yet, as a carpenter, I was also expected to build rapport with clients, to be friendly and open, which sometimes meant sharing stories or experiences from other jobs. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between being the approachable tradesman and the discreet volunteer. I hesitated, unsure how much to say, my mind racing with the expectations of both roles pressing in on me."}
