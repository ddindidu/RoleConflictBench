My supervisor expected me to diagnose and fix any technical issue, no matter how minor, and I prided myself on being thorough. But this machine was rarely used, and its glitch was maddeningly inconsistent\u2014sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t. I was determined to get to the bottom of it, even if production was slow today.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. I rushed to the polling station, only to find a long line. As I waited, an official announced, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name started with B, but the new line was barely moving. The original line, where I\u2019d already waited, was much faster. Still, the official\u2019s instructions were clear, and I knew I was expected to follow them.\n\nI felt torn. At work, I was supposed to solve problems, not just follow orders blindly. Here, as a voter, I was supposed to do exactly as told. My mind raced, caught between the urge to troubleshoot and the duty to comply, unsure which role should guide my next step."}
