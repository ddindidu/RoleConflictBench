I knew the code worked, but it wasn\u2019t elegant, and it certainly wasn\u2019t efficient. I could already hear the expectation in my head: clean, maintainable, efficient code. I wanted to fix it, to prove I could do it right.\n\nMy phone buzzed. An email from the volunteer coordinator. \u201cIf you have time, could you try organizing the supplies by category instead of alphabetically? It might help.\u201d I pictured the cluttered shelves at the community center, the way the kids struggled to find what they needed. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed: follow the guidelines, help where you can.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I stayed late to refactor the code, I\u2019d barely make it to the center before closing. If I left now, the code would stay messy, and my team would be disappointed. My mind spun with the weight of both roles, both sets of expectations pressing in, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
