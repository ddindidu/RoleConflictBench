There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a couple of dollars off. Store policy was clear: report any irregularity, no matter how minor. But it was almost closing time, and the line was growing. I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that accuracy was non-negotiable. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. Tonight, I was supposed to help at the community center, where we\u2019d just been briefed on new safety steps. The coordinator had stressed how important it was to follow every guideline, no exceptions. I knew I\u2019d be late if I stayed to sort out the register issue, and the center was counting on me to set a good example.\n\nMy mind raced between the two roles\u2014cashier, bound by strict procedures, and volunteer, expected to be reliable and safety-conscious. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the store\u2019s expectations and my commitment to the community center. I stared at the register, heart pounding, caught between what I should do and what I needed to do."}
