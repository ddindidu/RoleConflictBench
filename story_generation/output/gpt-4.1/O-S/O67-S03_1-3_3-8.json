The radio crackled with a flash-flood warning, and I glanced out the window to see water already pooling along the curb. As an ambulance driver, my duty was clear: keep the vehicle and supplies ready, provide care to anyone who needed it. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility to help my neighbors\u2014some elderly, some with children\u2014who might not know what to do or where to go. I could see Mrs. Patel across the street, struggling to move her groceries inside as the water crept higher. My mind raced. Should I stay and finish the kit check, ensuring I\u2019m ready for any emergency call? Or should I rush out to help my neighbors evacuate, risking that the ambulance might not be fully stocked if someone needed it? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding action, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between duty and community."}
