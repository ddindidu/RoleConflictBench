Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to clean and service the machines\u2014if I missed it, the whole line could grind to a halt, and everyone would know it was my fault. My supervisor had already reminded me twice: \u201cNo delays, no excuses.\u201d I was double-checking my tools when my phone buzzed. It was the activist group\u2019s coordinator, her voice urgent. \u201cA major network wants you on air now. They\u2019re spreading misinformation about our cause. We need you to set the record straight\u2014this is our chance.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d always promised to be there when the movement needed me, to speak up when it mattered most. But if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious prep time for the shutdown, and the machines might not be ready. I could almost hear the disappointment in both worlds\u2014the factory\u2019s hum faltering, the movement\u2019s voices drowned out. I stood frozen, torn between the clang of wrenches and the call to action, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
