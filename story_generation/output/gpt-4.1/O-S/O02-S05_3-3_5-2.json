As the lead engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every aspect of our facility met strict safety and regulatory standards. Today, an external inspector had flagged a critical issue\u2014one that, if not addressed immediately, could shut down our operations. My team looked to me for technical guidance, expecting swift, decisive action to keep the project on track.\n\nAt the same time, my client called, their voice tight with anxiety. They faced a pressing legal dilemma, needing clear, accurate advice to navigate the situation. As their advocate, I was expected to provide precise guidance, knowing their next steps depended entirely on my counsel.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. If I focused on resolving the engineering crisis, I risked leaving my client without the legal support they desperately needed. But if I prioritized their legal issue, I might fail my team and jeopardize the entire project. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of compliance and advocacy, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
