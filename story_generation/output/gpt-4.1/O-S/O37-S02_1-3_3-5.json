The vote on the Clean Air Act was happening in less than an hour\u2014a surprise, last-minute session. The group needed me to call Representative Lee, who was still undecided and could tip the scales. My heart pounded. I glanced at the half-empty shelves: the disinfectant was running low, and the manager expected a full report by noon so she could place the order. If I left now to make calls, I\u2019d miss the deadline and risk the supplies running out, which would mean complaints from the staff and possibly a warning from my supervisor. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to make a real difference in the legislation I\u2019d spent months fighting for. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen in the closet, torn between duty and conviction."}
