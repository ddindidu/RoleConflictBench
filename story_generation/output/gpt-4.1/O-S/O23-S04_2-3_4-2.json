My client\u2019s hearing is in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019m still reviewing the last-minute notes for the contested motion. She\u2019s counting on me to be sharp, to argue her case with every ounce of skill I have. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote\u2014something I\u2019ve always believed is my civic duty, a right people have fought for. My suit jacket feels heavier as I weigh the expectations. My client\u2019s future could hinge on my performance in court, but my voice in this election matters, too. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind races, torn between the courtroom and the polling booth, between my professional oath and my responsibility as a citizen. The seconds tick by, and I feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone\u2014or myself\u2014down."}
