New drugs, new protocols\u2014if I didn\u2019t keep up, I\u2019d fall behind, and my patients depended on me to know the latest. But my mind kept drifting to the voter ID card sitting on my kitchen table at home. The polls were open tomorrow, but today was my only real chance to swing by and grab it. If I missed this window, I might not be able to vote at all. My manager expected me to use every break to stay sharp, and I knew my colleagues would notice if I left early or came back late. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of my responsibility to vote, to have my say. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my profession and the duty to my country, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
