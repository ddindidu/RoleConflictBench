The delivery app pinged: \u201cCustomer needs groceries by 6 PM sharp.\u201d I checked the address\u2014across town, and traffic was already building. I knew how important this delivery was; the customer had called earlier, sounding anxious about dinner plans. As I started the engine, another notification buzzed in: an email from the volunteer coordinator at the community center. \u201cIf you have a moment today, could you try organizing the supply closet by category? It would really help us out.\u201d I\u2019d promised to stop by after my shift, and I wanted to do a good job\u2014she always counted on me to follow through.\n\nBut now, the clock was ticking. If I took extra time at the center, I might miss the delivery window. If I rushed the delivery, I\u2019d have to skip the organizing, letting down the coordinator and the team. My stomach twisted as I drove, torn between the customer\u2019s urgent need and my commitment to the center. Both roles mattered, and both expected me to be reliable. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility I could afford to let down."}
