As a taxi driver, I was trained to keep calm, follow every traffic law, and drive defensively\u2014especially on nights like this, when headlights blurred and cars darted unpredictably. But my phone buzzed urgently on the seat beside me. Messages from fellow activists flashed across the screen: police had started blocking the protest exits, and panic was spreading. I was supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure everyone got out without confrontation. My mind raced. If I pulled over to help, I\u2019d risk blocking traffic or causing an accident in these dangerous conditions. If I kept driving, I\u2019d be abandoning my friends when they needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014responsible driver, committed activist\u2014each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I approached the next intersection, torn between the rules of the road and the call to action."}
