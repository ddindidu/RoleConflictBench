As a software developer, I knew I was expected to write clean, efficient code\u2014anything less would let my team down and risk future bugs. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, asking for a quick call. As their advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate legal advice, not just generalities. Yet, in these casual consultations, I often found myself skimming over details, trying to be helpful without overcommitting. My mind raced: should I spend the next hour refactoring code to meet my team\u2019s standards, or prepare to give the client the thorough, precise advice they deserved? Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, leaving me paralyzed at my desk, torn between two worlds."}
