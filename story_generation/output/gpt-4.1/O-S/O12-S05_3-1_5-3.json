The product manager\u2019s message blinked on my screen: \u201cWe need your input on the API design now. The architects are waiting, and the launch date just got moved up.\u201d I knew the whole project was at a standstill until I weighed in. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the minor court hearing I was scheduled to attend as an advocate. The case wasn\u2019t high stakes, but my client was anxious, counting on me to represent them, no matter how small the matter seemed.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides. My team expected me to be decisive and collaborative, to unblock the architects and keep the project on track. My client expected me to show up, to be their voice in a system that often felt indifferent. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my mind racing with the consequences of letting either side down. I sat frozen, torn between the urgent needs of my colleagues and the quiet trust of my client, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
