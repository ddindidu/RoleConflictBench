The receptionist is idly scrolling through her phone, but I know Mrs. Lee expects me to greet her personally, to ask about her grandkids and make her feel at home. I smooth my apron and start toward her, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here\u2014if you\u2019re free, please come now!\u201d My heart pounds. I glance at Mrs. Lee, who\u2019s already waving at me, and then at my phone, where Maya\u2019s face flickers with hope and anxiety. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one expects warmth and comfort, the other, my presence and solidarity. My hands tremble as I stand between the salon\u2019s soft chatter and the distant chants echoing from my phone, torn by the demands of who I am and who I want to be."}
