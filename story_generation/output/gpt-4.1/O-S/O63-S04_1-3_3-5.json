Every call counts.\u201d I could almost taste the bonus. But then my eyes landed on the voter ID card peeking out from my wallet. The polls closed at 8 p.m., and tonight was my only chance to vote. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never miss an election, not after all those years hearing how every vote matters. But the call list was long, and the pressure to keep dialing was relentless. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time and maybe a few more sales. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to have a say in something bigger than quotas.
