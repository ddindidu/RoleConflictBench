I force a smile as the woman in front of me slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp about the wait. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the delay,\u201d I say, keeping my tone gentle, even as my heart pounds. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014again. I glance down and see the news network\u2019s number. They need me now, live, to speak out against the misinformation spreading about our cause. I know how crucial this moment is; my words could reach thousands, maybe change minds. But here, I\u2019m the cashier, expected to be calm, attentive, and present for every customer, no matter how frazzled or rude. My manager\u2019s eyes flick toward me, silently reminding me of the store\u2019s standards. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my activist\u2019s urgency clashing with my duty to serve. My hand hovers over my phone, torn between the checkout scanner and the call that could define my movement."}
