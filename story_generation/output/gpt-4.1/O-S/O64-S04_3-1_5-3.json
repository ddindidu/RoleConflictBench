The store\u2019s policy was clear: every cent had to be double-checked, logged, and locked away before I could leave. My manager had drilled it into me\u2014no shortcuts, no mistakes, or the audit team would be on us. But tonight was different. The polling station closed at 8:00, and I still hadn\u2019t voted. My ID was in my bag, but I\u2019d left my backup card at home, just in case. I could still fetch it later, but only if I finished here first. My mind raced with the pressure: the company expected me to be meticulous, but as a citizen, I was supposed to make my voice heard. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, my heart pounding as I glanced between the cash drawer and the ticking clock, torn between the rules of my job and the duty I owed to myself and my community."}
