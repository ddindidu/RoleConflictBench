I coordinated with the controller in the next sector, making sure the aircraft on route 27 would cross over smoothly. My headset buzzed with chatter, and I scribbled notes, eyes darting between screens. But my mind kept drifting to my wallet, sitting on the kitchen counter at home. Today was the only morning I could grab my ID before work, and without it, I couldn\u2019t vote tomorrow. The polling station was open, but my shift schedule left no other window. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014hundreds of lives depended on my focus, but so did my right to have a say in the election. My supervisor expected flawless coordination, no distractions. The polling officials expected me to show up with proper identification. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the demands of the airspace and the demands of my citizenship, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both at once."}
