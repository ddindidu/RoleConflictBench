She\u2019d just come out of surgery, and her voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer?\u201d she asked, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I squeezed her hand, feeling the weight of her fear and the responsibility to comfort her. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014an unknown number, but I recognized the area code. My heart skipped. It was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks, finally calling back.
