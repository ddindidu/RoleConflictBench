As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep my smile bright and my tone gentle, even as the woman in front of me raises her voice about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I nod, apologize, and try to soothe her, all while glancing at the clock. My shift as a volunteer at the community center starts in twenty minutes, and I remember the coordinator\u2019s stern reminder: \u201cEveryone must follow the new safety steps\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there on time, ready to help, and to set an example by following every guideline. But here I am, stuck between the demands of my job and my commitment as a volunteer. My heart pounds as I try to balance the customer\u2019s frustration with my own growing anxiety. I know I can\u2019t let either side down, but the pressure of these conflicting expectations is almost too much to bear."}
