She chatted about her day, unconcerned with time, and I made sure to drive safely, obeying every traffic rule, as expected of a good taxi driver. My job was to get her there comfortably and on time, even if she wasn\u2019t in a rush. But my mind kept drifting to my own plans: a late-evening music session with friends at my apartment. We\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, but I knew the building\u2019s quiet hours started soon, and my neighbor, who always left his windows open, had complained before. As a citizen, I was expected to respect the rules and my neighbors\u2019 peace. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding I be reliable and attentive to my passenger, the other urging me to be considerate and law-abiding at home. I could feel the tension building inside, torn between the urge to unwind with friends and the duty to maintain harmony in my community."}
