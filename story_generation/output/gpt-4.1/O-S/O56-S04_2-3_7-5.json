My next appointment, Mrs. Lee, was already waiting, her hair damp with sweat from her gym session, looking greasier than usual. She smiled apologetically, and I knew she expected the full treatment\u2014wash, condition, and a careful cut. That was my job, after all, to make every client feel fresh and renewed, no matter how they walked in.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the voting station down the street. The polls would close in less than an hour, and tonight was my only chance to cast my ballot. I\u2019d already forgotten my ID once this morning, and now it was tucked safely in my bag in the back room. If I missed this window, I\u2019d lose my voice in this election, something I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let happen.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectant gaze, the ticking clock, the weight of civic duty. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the shampoo, torn between the needs of my client and the responsibility I owed to myself as a voter."}
