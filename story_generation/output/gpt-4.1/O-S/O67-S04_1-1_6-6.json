The expectation is clear: drive safely, no matter what. I can\u2019t risk a scratch on the vehicle or a moment\u2019s lapse in attention. But today is also election day, and I\u2019m determined to vote before my shift. I park the ambulance, lock up, and hurry to the polling station, my uniform drawing a few glances. The line is long, but I join it, glancing at my watch, calculating how much time I have before I need to be at the satellite location.\n\nSuddenly, an official calls out, \u201cVoters with last names A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with B. The new line is longer, but the official\u2019s voice is firm. I know I\u2019m supposed to follow their instructions, but every minute I spend here is a minute I\u2019m not getting the ambulance to its next post. My duty as a voter is to comply, but my responsibility as an ambulance driver is to be on time and keep the vehicle safe. I feel the pressure building, torn between following orders and fulfilling my professional obligations."}
