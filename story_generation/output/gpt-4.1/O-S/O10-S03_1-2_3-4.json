As an accountant, I know how crucial it is to stay ahead of tax law changes\u2014there\u2019s a seminar starting in ten minutes that could help me ensure my clients remain compliant. Missing it could mean falling behind, risking mistakes, or even penalties for those who trust me. But as a citizen, I feel a different pull. My district\u2019s candidate forum is streaming live right now, and this election feels more important than ever. I want to listen, ask questions, and make an informed choice. I owe it to my community to participate, to be more than just a bystander. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014professional responsibility on one side, civic duty on the other. I stare at my laptop, torn, knowing I can\u2019t give my full attention to both. My mind races, anxiety building as I try to decide which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
