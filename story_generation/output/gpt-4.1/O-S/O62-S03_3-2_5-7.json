A quick inspection confirmed my fear: it was malfunctioning, and if left unchecked, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. As a lifeguard, I knew it was my responsibility to report it and stay until it was fixed, ensuring no one was put at risk. But as I reached for my phone, an alert flashed\u2014there was a heat advisory, and I remembered Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. She struggled in the heat, and I\u2019d promised her daughter I\u2019d check in during extreme weather. My duty as a citizen tugged at me: I should go to her, make sure she was hydrated and safe. Yet, the pool was already filling with kids eager to swim. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing that whichever choice I made, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
