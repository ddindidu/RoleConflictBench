The operator hovered nearby, fidgeting with the control panel again. I\u2019d already explained twice how improper settings led to material waste, but he seemed anxious, unwilling to listen. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the court session in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late; my client\u2019s case depended on my presence and preparation. Yet, as the machine repairer, I was expected to provide clear guidance, ensuring the operator understood how to avoid further mistakes. If I left now, the machine might be misused again, costing the company more. If I stayed, I risked missing the court session and letting down someone who trusted me to defend their interests. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need to educate the operator and the pressing obligation to my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that refused to wait."}
