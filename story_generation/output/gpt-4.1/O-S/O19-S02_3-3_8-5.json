The speaker\u2019s voice echoed through the room, outlining the latest updates in diabetes management\u2014information I needed to stay licensed and provide the best care to my patients. My phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from my activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could expand access to affordable medications. The vote was tied, and one representative was still undecided. They needed me to call now, to share my perspective as a pharmacist and urge a \u201cyes\u201d vote. My heart pounded. If I left the session, I\u2019d miss the exam and risk my professional standing. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my fellow advocates and possibly lose a once-in-a-lifetime chance to influence policy. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my phone, torn between duty to my profession and my passion for change, feeling the minutes slip away."}
