The Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent I was relying on. My mind raced\u2014every word I said next could be wrong, misleading, even unjust. I was expected, as a judge, to stay current, to pivot instantly when the law changed. But I was also a volunteer at the community center, where just yesterday, the coordinator emphasized the importance of following new safety protocols without deviation. I\u2019d promised to model consistency and reliability for the team. Now, in court, I was being asked to do the opposite: to halt, to change course midstream, to abandon the script for the sake of justice. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014steadfastness and adaptability, clarity and uncertainty\u2014each role demanding something different, each voice in my head growing louder as I stood, silent, in front of the waiting jury."}
