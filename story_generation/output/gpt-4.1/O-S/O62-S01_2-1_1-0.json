My shift as a volunteer at the community food bank was about to start in ten minutes, and I was supposed to be there on time\u2014reliability was something they counted on. But right now, a young swimmer in the middle of the pool caught my attention, their strokes growing sloppy, head bobbing awkwardly. I knew I couldn\u2019t look away, not even for a second. The rules were clear: lifeguards must monitor swimmers without distraction, ready to leap in at the first sign of trouble. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder about my volunteer shift, and I felt the weight of that commitment too. Other volunteers could cover for me if I was a little late, but I hated letting people down. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to leave and fulfill my promise at the food bank, while knowing that even a moment\u2019s lapse here could mean disaster. I gripped the armrest, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
