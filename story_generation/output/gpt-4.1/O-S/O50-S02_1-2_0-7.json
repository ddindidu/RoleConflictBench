The line supervisor hovered nearby, anxious. \u201cWe need you to figure this out before the next shift,\u201d she said. I knew the machine was rarely used, but if it failed now, the whole schedule would be thrown off. My hands were already deep in the wiring when my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I was due on the radio in five minutes to talk about the environmental campaign I\u2019d spent months organizing. The community was counting on me to explain our cause, to rally support. I could almost hear the host\u2019s voice, waiting for me to call in. My mind raced: if I left now, the machine might not get fixed in time, but if I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to reach hundreds of listeners. Both sides needed me, both expected me to deliver. My heart pounded as I weighed the tools in my hand against the phone in my pocket, torn between the demands of the factory floor and the promise of the airwaves."}
