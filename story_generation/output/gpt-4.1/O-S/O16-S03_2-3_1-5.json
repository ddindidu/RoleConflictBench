My patient, Mrs. Lee, sat across from me, her face drawn with worry. She described a cluster of symptoms\u2014persistent fatigue, joint pain, and a rash\u2014that didn\u2019t fit neatly into any diagnosis I knew. I felt the weight of my responsibility as her doctor: to listen, to investigate, to not let her leave without a plan. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the polling place down the street would close in two hours, and today\u2019s ballot included a measure that would directly impact my neighborhood\u2019s safety and resources. As a citizen, I believed in participating, in making my voice heard, in shaping the community I lived in. Yet, here I was, torn between the duty to my patient and the duty to my community. My mind raced, calculating time, weighing consequences, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me. I looked at Mrs. Lee, then at the clock, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
