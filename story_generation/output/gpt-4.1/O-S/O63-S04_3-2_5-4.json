It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and the manager\u2019s voice still echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale to hit target\u2014no exceptions.\u201d My bonus, and maybe even my job, hangs in the balance. But my thoughts keep drifting to the election. I realized this morning that my ID is at home, and today is the only window I have to get it before the polls close tomorrow. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the team\u2019s final push, but if I stay, I might lose my chance to vote. My colleagues\u2019 voices rise around me, urging each other on, while my own conscience nags at me about my civic duty. I stare at the clock, feeling the pressure from both sides, my heart pounding as I weigh the expectations of my job against my responsibility as a voter."}
