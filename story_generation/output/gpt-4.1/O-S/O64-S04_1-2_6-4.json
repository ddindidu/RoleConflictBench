Each time someone approaches, I smile and greet them, making sure to ask about their day, just as my manager expects. Friendly service, always. But my mind keeps drifting to the voter ID card sitting on my kitchen table. I forgot it this morning, and today is the only time I can swing by home before the polls close tomorrow. If I leave now, I\u2019ll have just enough time to grab it and still make it back before the lunch rush. But if I go, I\u2019ll leave the store short-staffed, and my coworkers will have to cover for me. I can almost hear my manager\u2019s disappointment if I abandon my post, even for a little while. Yet, if I don\u2019t get my ID, I can\u2019t vote, and I\u2019ve always believed in doing my civic duty. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, standing at the register, caught between being a good employee and a responsible citizen."}
