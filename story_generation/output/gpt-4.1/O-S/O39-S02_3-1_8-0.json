Protocol is clear: stop everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my head\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re a team. Safety first, always.\u201d I fall in line with the others, boots crunching gravel, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. A message flashes from Maya, my friend and fellow activist: \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Can you come? It\u2019s getting tense.\u201d I glance at the live stream\u2014familiar faces, signs raised, voices urgent. I know how much it matters, how every body counts. But here, on site, I\u2019m counted on too. If I slip away, I let my crew down, risk my job, maybe even my safety. If I stay, I let my cause down, miss a moment that could matter. My hands tremble as I weigh the hard hat on my head against the conviction in my chest, torn between two worlds that both demand all of me."}
