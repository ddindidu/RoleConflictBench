A homeowner\u2019s voice, tight with worry, told me their deck was splintered and unsafe. They needed it fixed today\u2014guests were coming tomorrow, and the deck was the centerpiece. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, knowing how much people rely on me to keep their homes safe and welcoming. As I loaded my truck, I glanced at the clock. Only a couple of hours left before the polls closed. I\u2019d meant to vote earlier, but the day\u2019s jobs had run long, and now I was squeezed between my duty as a craftsman and my responsibility as a citizen. The deck would take time\u2014maybe all the time I had left before the polling station shut its doors. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the trust the homeowner placed in me, the civic duty I owed my community. I gripped the steering wheel, torn, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
