I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was almost over, and I had a call scheduled with the local activist group. I quickly explained the difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but before I could offer more, my phone buzzed. It was a producer from a major news network. They needed me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. As a pharmacist, I owed Mrs. Lee a thorough explanation, maybe even a few minutes to discuss her medical history. But as an activist, this was my chance to reach thousands, maybe millions, and set the record straight. I could see Mrs. Lee waiting, expectant, trusting me for guidance. At the same time, the world outside was waiting for my voice. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
