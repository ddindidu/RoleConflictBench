It was the end of my shift, and I knew every cent had to add up\u2014one mistake, and I\u2019d be facing a grilling from my manager. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a message: \u201cLegislative aide on the line\u2014can talk for 10 minutes about the bill.\u201d My heart pounded. This was the call I\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to push for real change, to make my voice heard. But the drawer was open, and a customer was handing me a stack of hundred-dollar bills. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to keep the register perfect, and my duty to seize this rare moment for the cause I believed in. My hands trembled as I counted the cash, my mind racing, torn between the demands of my job and the urgency of my activism."}
