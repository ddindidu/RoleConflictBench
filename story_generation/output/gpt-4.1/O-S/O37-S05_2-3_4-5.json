As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep everything stocked and ready, but the client hadn\u2019t left any extra supplies, and I knew how much they valued a spotless home. My phone buzzed, snapping me back to my other world\u2014the courthouse. As an advocate, I was supposed to be preparing for a trial that could change my client\u2019s life forever. The hearing was tomorrow, and I still had to review evidence and draft arguments. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the expectation to manage household details with care, and the responsibility to fight for justice in the courtroom. I felt torn, knowing that if I left now to buy supplies, I\u2019d lose precious time for legal prep. But if I ignored the dwindling cleaner, I\u2019d be letting down someone who trusted me to keep their home in order. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
