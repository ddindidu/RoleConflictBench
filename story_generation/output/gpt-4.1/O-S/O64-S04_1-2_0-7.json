It\u2019s a slow afternoon, and I\u2019m grateful for the calm, but my mind is elsewhere. My break is coming up, and I plan to use it to vote at the polling station across the street. When my relief finally arrives, I hurry over, ballot in hand, determined to do everything right. At the table, a poll worker frowns at my envelope. \u201cThe signature smudged,\u201d she says gently. \u201cCould you re-sign it so your vote isn\u2019t rejected?\u201d \n\nI freeze. My break is almost over, and I know the store expects me to be back on time, ready to process transactions accurately and keep the line moving. But here, as a voter, I\u2019m expected to follow every instruction, to make sure my ballot counts. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I rush, I might mess up again, but if I take too long, I\u2019ll let my coworkers down. My hands tremble as I stare at the pen, caught between the demands of my two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
