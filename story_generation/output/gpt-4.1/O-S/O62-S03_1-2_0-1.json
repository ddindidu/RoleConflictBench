A few teenagers drifted toward the deep end, laughing and splashing, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. My training told me to stay alert, never letting my attention waver, even for a second. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the music night I\u2019d promised my friends. The plan was to play guitar and sing on my balcony, but I remembered the building\u2019s strict quiet hours. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always kept her windows open in the evenings, and she\u2019d mentioned how much she valued her peace after a long day. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the responsibility to keep swimmers safe, and the duty to respect my neighbors and the rules of our community. My mind raced, torn between the watchful vigilance required at the pool and the anticipation of breaking the quiet hours later. The conflicting expectations gnawed at me, and I found myself caught in the tension, unsure which role I could honor without letting the other down."}
