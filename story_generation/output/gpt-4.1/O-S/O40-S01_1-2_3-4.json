The client wanted an estimate by noon, and I still needed to check my inventory and call the supplier. My mind was already racing through wood types and delivery times when I remembered my volunteer shift at the community center. I hurried over, apron still dusted with sawdust, and took my place at the check-in table. As I handed out forms, a woman leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, confiding a personal worry about her living situation. She asked if I could help her find resources, but begged me not to tell anyone else. I nodded, heart pounding, as I glanced at the clock\u2014my supplier\u2019s office would close soon. I felt torn, the weight of her trust pressing on me, while the unfinished estimate and looming deadline gnawed at the back of my mind. I sat there, caught between the promise of confidentiality and the urgent demands of my business, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
