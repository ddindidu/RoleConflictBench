As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014one misplaced number could mean hours of backtracking, or worse, a compliance issue. My supervisor expected the documents on her desk by noon, and I was only halfway through the reconciliation. Just as I was double-checking a tricky transaction, my phone buzzed. A message from my activist group flashed on the screen: \u201cFinal call! Add your name to the petition before it\u2019s sent to the senator in ten minutes!\u201d I felt my heart race. I\u2019d spent weeks rallying for this policy change, urging others to join, and now my own signature was missing. But if I paused now, even for a few minutes, I risked missing the filing deadline.
