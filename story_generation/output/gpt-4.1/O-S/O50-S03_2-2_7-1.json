My job as a machine repairer meant I should step in, explain the right settings, and prevent the waste piling up at his feet. He looked frustrated, glancing at me for help, and I knew the company expected me to guide him, not just fix breakdowns. But my mind kept drifting to the evening ahead\u2014my friends and I had planned a music session at my place, something we\u2019d all been looking forward to. Then I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours started at eight, and Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, always left her windows open in the summer. As a citizen, I was supposed to respect those rules and her right to peace. The pressure built inside me: should I stay late to help the operator, risking being late for my friends and possibly disturbing Mrs. Lee? Or should I rush home, maybe leaving the operator to struggle and the company to lose more material? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
