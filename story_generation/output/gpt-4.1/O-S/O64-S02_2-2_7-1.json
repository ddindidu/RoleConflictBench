My manager expects me to keep things moving, to be friendly, efficient, the face of the store. But my phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014messages from my fellow activists. The protest is starting soon, and I promised I\u2019d be there, leading the first chant, my voice echoing through the streets for a cause I believe in. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to a customer, my mind split between the demands of my job and the pull of my convictions. I can\u2019t leave the register unmanned, not with so many people waiting, but every minute I stay, I feel like I\u2019m letting my friends\u2014and the movement\u2014down. The weight of expectation presses on me from both sides, and I glance at the clock, torn between the uniform I wear and the sign waiting for me outside."}
