The bottle was empty. I checked the supply closet\u2014nothing. My client expected the floors spotless, and I was responsible for making sure we never ran out. I knew she\u2019d be upset if I didn\u2019t get the job done today. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due at the community center in half an hour to help sort confidential medical files. As a volunteer, I was trusted to respect the privacy of every person whose name I saw. I couldn\u2019t risk being late or distracted, especially with such sensitive information. My mind raced. Should I call the client and ask about the cleaner, risking her privacy if someone else answered? Or should I leave the floors unfinished and focus on my volunteer shift, knowing I\u2019d be letting my client down? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds I was supposed to serve."}
