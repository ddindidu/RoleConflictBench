The beach was packed\u2014high tide, strong currents, and families everywhere. As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted; one slip in attention could mean disaster. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. The protest was starting in minutes, and I was supposed to be at the front, megaphone in hand, leading the first chant for justice. My fellow activists were counting on me to set the tone, to show up as I always promised I would. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the red lifeguard shirt clinging to my back, the activist\u2019s armband tucked in my bag. My heart pounded as I looked from the restless sea to the distant boardwalk, torn between the urgent needs of the swimmers and the cause I believed in. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the roar of the waves and the rising voices of the march."}
