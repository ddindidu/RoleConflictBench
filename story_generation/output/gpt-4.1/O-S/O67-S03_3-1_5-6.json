As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. My hands were steady, but my thoughts raced. I had to keep him alive until we reached the hospital. That was my duty\u2014provide care, stay calm, save lives.\n\nBut as a citizen, I felt the weight of other responsibilities. My tax documents sat in a neat pile at home, waiting for my final review before the deadline. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get them done early this year, avoid the last-minute scramble. And this weekend, the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic. I\u2019d volunteered to help organize, to give back, to do my part for public health.\n\nNow, with the patient\u2019s life in my hands, I felt the pressure mounting. Could I keep up with both roles? Was I letting my community down by missing the clinic, or risking my own future by neglecting my taxes? The ambulance\u2019s lights flashed in the rearview mirror, and I gripped the wheel tighter, torn between the demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
