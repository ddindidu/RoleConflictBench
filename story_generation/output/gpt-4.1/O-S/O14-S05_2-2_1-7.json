The specialized spectrometer, booked months in advance, was finally mine for a narrow window. My experiment\u2014years in the making\u2014depended on this data. I prepped the samples, hands steady but mind racing. My phone buzzed: a reminder for the court session in less than an hour. As an advocate, I owed my client my presence, my voice, my punctuality. The judge had warned: one more late arrival, and the case could be dismissed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The experiment needed my full attention, but so did my client, whose future hung in the balance. I imagined the disappointment in my research team\u2019s eyes if I left now, the trust in my client\u2019s if I didn\u2019t show. My chest tightened as I glanced between the humming machine and my briefcase by the door, torn by the impossible demands of science and justice."}
