Only two hours left before the polls closed, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year. As an ambulance driver, I knew every minute counted for the patient waiting in pain, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice carried the urgency I\u2019d heard a hundred times before.

If I responded now, I might not make it to the polling station in time. If I delayed, someone could suffer longer than necessary. The city traffic outside seemed to press in, mirroring the pressure building inside me. I could feel the pull from both sides\u2014my responsibility to the patient, my responsibility to my community.
