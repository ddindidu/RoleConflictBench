The phone rings, and I launch into my pitch, but as usual, the prospect interrupts with a technical question about data privacy. My script only skims the surface, and I fumble for words, feeling the pressure to keep the call on track and not lose a potential sale. My supervisor expects me to handle objections smoothly, but I know I\u2019m not giving the caller the full picture. \n\nDuring my break, I scroll through my emails and see the city newsletter. There\u2019s a survey about proposed changes to the bus routes\u2014routes I rely on every day. The city wants feedback from citizens like me, and I know I should take the time to read the details and respond thoughtfully. But my mind is still tangled in the demands of my job, and I wonder if I can spare the energy to be the engaged citizen I want to be. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I feel caught between the need to perform at work and my responsibility to my community."}
