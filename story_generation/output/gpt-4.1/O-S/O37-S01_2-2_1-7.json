As a housekeeping cleaner, I took pride in keeping every surface spotless, especially since the manager had commented on dust building up last week. I\u2019d promised myself to be more thorough, so I started scrubbing the baseboards, determined not to let anything slip by. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. The new safety steps, she\u2019d said, were non-negotiable. We had to follow them exactly, even if it meant slowing down. I remembered her stern look during the last briefing: \u201cNo shortcuts, not even for regulars.\u201d \n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized I was running behind. If I followed the new volunteer safety steps to the letter, I\u2019d have to leave the house less clean than I wanted. If I stayed to finish cleaning properly, I\u2019d risk missing the volunteer shift or, worse, not following the new safety protocol. My mind raced, torn between the pride I felt in my cleaning work and the responsibility I had as a volunteer. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which role to let down."}
