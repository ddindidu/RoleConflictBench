As a judge, I\u2019m expected to draft a clear, detailed scheduling order for a new case\u2014something that requires focus and careful thought. The deadline looms at the end of the week, and I know the attorneys and parties are waiting for my guidance. Yet, as an advocate, I have a court session scheduled in just fifteen minutes, one that could significantly impact my client\u2019s future. My client expects me to be there, prepared and punctual, to argue their case with full attention. I glance at the half-finished order on my screen, feeling the weight of judicial responsibility pressing down. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder for the court session. My mind races, torn between the duty to provide clarity and structure as a judge, and the obligation to stand by my client as their advocate. The expectations of both roles pull me in opposite directions, and I feel the tension coil in my chest as I try to decide which demand to meet first."}
