There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to report even the smallest error, and I prided myself on being thorough. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart raced. I was due at the advocacy center in fifteen minutes for our weekly meeting, and I knew they counted on my punctuality. Missing it would mean letting down the team and possibly jeopardizing a client\u2019s case. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me\u2014the store\u2019s demand for meticulous honesty, the advocacy group\u2019s need for my presence. My mind spun with the possible consequences of each choice, torn between the rules of my job and the responsibilities of my calling. I stared at the register, feeling the minutes slip away, caught in the tightening grip of conflicting expectations."}
