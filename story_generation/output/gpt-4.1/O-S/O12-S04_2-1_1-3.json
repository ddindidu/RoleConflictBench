I knew the expectation: clean, maintainable, efficient code. But the clock was ticking, and the feature was almost ready. I could patch it quickly, push it through, and fix it later, but that wasn\u2019t how I wanted to work. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote today. I\u2019d planned to go during lunch, but I realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I had a backup card in my bag, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. I could run home after work to get the right ID, but that would mean staying late to finish the code review fixes. My team was counting on me to deliver quality work, but I also felt the weight of my civic duty. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and my responsibility as a voter, unsure which role to prioritize."}
