The copper highlights she\u2019d requested looked a shade too brassy under the salon lights, and I could feel her disappointment radiate through the mirror. My training as a hairdresser told me to stay calm, listen, and fix it\u2014client satisfaction was everything, and a first impression mattered most. But as she opened her mouth to speak, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message flashed: \u201cCritical vote in 1 hour. We need you to call Rep. Lee NOW\u2014your story could sway the decision.\u201d My heart pounded.
