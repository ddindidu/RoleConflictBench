It was mandatory for my license renewal, and I knew I needed to stay updated on the latest treatments. As I set up my laptop, the local news blared a heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on our floor. She struggled with the heat and sometimes forgot to drink enough water. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to check on her, especially with the city urging everyone to look out for vulnerable neighbors during emergencies. But the webinar was about to start, and missing it could mean falling behind professionally. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the session, while outside, the sun was already beating down. I stood in the hallway, torn between my duty to my profession and my responsibility as a member of my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
