I know how much that matters. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I see a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s live-streaming from a protest downtown, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here\u2014if you\u2019re free, come now.\u201d My heart pounds. I want to be there, standing up for what I believe in, but I also know the crew expects me to be reliable, to put the job first. I stare at the notice, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
