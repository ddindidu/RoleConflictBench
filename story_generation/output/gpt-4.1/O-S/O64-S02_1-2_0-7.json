It\u2019s a slow afternoon, and only three customers wait in line, but I can\u2019t stop glancing at the clock above the counter. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be on air, live, talking about the environmental campaign I\u2019ve poured my heart into. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014reminder for the radio show. I\u2019m expected to be the voice of our movement, to educate, to inspire. But right now, I\u2019m also expected to be the reliable cashier, making sure every item is scanned correctly, every total is accurate, every customer greeted with a smile. My manager trusts me to keep things running smoothly, and these customers expect quick, friendly service. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to the next person, my mind torn between the responsibility in front of me and the cause that means everything to me. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
