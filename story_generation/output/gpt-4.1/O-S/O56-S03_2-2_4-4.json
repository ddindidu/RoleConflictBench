The online candidate forum for our district is streaming right now, and I promised myself I\u2019d watch, take notes, and finally send in my questions about the new zoning laws. But as I towel-dry her hair, she stares at her reflection, lips pressed tight. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not quite what I pictured,\u201d she says softly, eyes flicking to the brassy undertones. My training kicks in\u2014I need to listen, reassure her, maybe even redo the colour. That\u2019s my job: to make sure she leaves happy, to fix any mistake, no matter how long it takes. But the forum is live, and I know how important it is to be an active citizen, to speak up for my neighborhood. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, my hands trembling as I reach for the toner, my phone buzzing with forum updates in my pocket. I want to do right by her, and by my community, but I can\u2019t see how to do both at once."}
