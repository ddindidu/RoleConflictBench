The rapid strep test was positive, and I knew she needed antibiotics. As I reached for my prescription pad, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a call from the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks\u2014she had ten minutes to talk about the bill I\u2019d been fighting for, one that could change access to healthcare for thousands. My heart pounded. As a doctor, my patients expect my full attention and timely care. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to seize every rare opportunity to push for change. Mrs. Lee watched me, waiting for my advice, while the phone vibrated insistently in my pocket. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
