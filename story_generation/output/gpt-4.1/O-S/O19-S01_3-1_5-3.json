As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to counsel her thoroughly\u2014she was on several high-risk drugs, and one misstep could be dangerous. I asked about her symptoms, her routines, and gently probed for anything that might signal a problem. She seemed relieved to talk, and soon our conversation drifted, as it sometimes does, into more personal territory. She mentioned her volunteer work at the same community center where I also volunteered. \n\nSuddenly, I realized she was sharing details about people I knew from my volunteer role. As a volunteer, I was expected to respect the privacy of everyone I helped, never letting information slip, even unintentionally. But as a pharmacist, I needed to know if any of her social interactions or stressors might affect her medication. My mind raced\u2014should I ask more, risking a breach of trust as a volunteer, or hold back and possibly miss something important for her health? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt caught between my duty to her as a patient and my responsibility as a volunteer."}
