She explained how much it meant to him and asked if I could fix it. I promised to take a look and give her a quote by the end of the day. As soon as she left, I glanced at the clock\u2014my volunteer shift at the community center was about to start. I packed up and rushed over, where I was assigned to sort confidential medical files for families in need. The files were detailed, and I had to be careful not to let any information slip, even accidentally. My phone buzzed with a message from the woman, asking if I\u2019d had a chance to look at the toy. I felt the pressure mounting: the expectation to provide a timely, thoughtful repair quote, and the responsibility to protect the privacy of vulnerable people. My mind raced, torn between the trust my customers place in me as a carpenter and the ethical duty I owe as a volunteer. I stood there, files in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
