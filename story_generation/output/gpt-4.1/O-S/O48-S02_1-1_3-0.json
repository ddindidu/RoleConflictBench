My mind is focused on the routine\u2014temperature, pulse, blood pressure\u2014each number a small reassurance that she\u2019s stable. Just as I reach her door, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come. The turnout is low.\u201d I glance at Mrs. Lee, waiting patiently, and then at the screen showing the protest, a handful of people holding signs, their voices echoing my own beliefs. My supervisor expects me to finish rounds on time, and the patients rely on me. But my heart aches to be out there, standing up for what I believe in. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands tremble as I hold the thermometer, torn between duty and conviction, unsure which call to answer first."}
