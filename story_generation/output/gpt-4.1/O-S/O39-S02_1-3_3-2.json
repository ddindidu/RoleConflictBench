The foreman\u2019s voice rang out, reminding us that a clean site meant a safe site\u2014no exceptions. I glanced at the clock; my shift was nearly over, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. A message from the activist group flashed on the screen: \u201cPolice are blocking exits\u2014need help now!\u201d My heart pounded. I was supposed to help coordinate a safe, calm response, to protect my friends and the cause we all believed in. But here, on the site, I was expected to finish the sweep, to leave the area spotless for the next crew. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my coworkers down, risking safety and maybe even my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be abandoning people who counted on me to keep them safe. The broom felt heavy in my hands as I stood frozen, torn between two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
