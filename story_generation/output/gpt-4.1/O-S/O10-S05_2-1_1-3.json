The numbers blurred together as the clock ticked closer to the end of the month. As the accountant, I was expected to close the books accurately and on time\u2014no mistakes, no delays. My manager had already reminded me twice today how crucial this deadline was for the company\u2019s quarterly report. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the calendar: the minor court hearing for my client was in less than an hour. As their advocate, I was supposed to be present, to represent them with diligence, even if the stakes were low. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my colleagues counting on me to finish the financials, my client relying on me to stand by them in court. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations, knowing that whichever role I chose to fulfill, I\u2019d be letting someone down. I closed my eyes, wishing I could split myself in two, but the decision had to be made."}
