She was here for a routine check-up, but her questions about her health grew more anxious and specific. As her doctor, I knew I needed to offer clear, empathetic explanations, to reassure her and address her concerns with patience. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my other world\u2014my client\u2019s case had just taken a complicated turn, and they needed immediate, detailed legal advice. The expectation was that I would provide clarity and guidance, untangling the legal knots for them. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: Mrs. Lee deserved my full attention and compassion, but my client was waiting for answers only I could give. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient in front of me and the responsibility to my client reaching out for help. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension build, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet the demands of both at once."}
