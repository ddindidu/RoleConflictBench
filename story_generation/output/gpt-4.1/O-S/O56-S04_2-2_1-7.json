A woman stands just inside, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I know I should greet her right away, offer a warm smile, and help her feel at ease\u2014first impressions matter so much in this business. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder from the polling place: I still need to finish voting by mail. I remember the poll worker\u2019s voice from earlier, gentle but firm, asking me to re-sign my ballot envelope because the signature had smudged. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cso your vote counts.\u201d I feel the weight of both moments pressing on me. The client\u2019s anxious glance tugs at my sense of duty as a hairdresser, while the memory of the poll worker\u2019s request reminds me of my responsibility as a voter. My heart pounds as I stand between the reception desk and my phone, torn by the need to be present for someone who needs comfort and the obligation to ensure my voice is heard in the election."}
