The nurse\u2019s voice was tight with urgency\u2014one of the life-support machines was flashing critical fault codes, and the patient\u2019s life depended on a quick fix. As the hospital\u2019s machine repairer, I knew every second counted. My hands were already reaching for my toolkit when my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in ten minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and people would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on the hot breakfast we served. I could picture their faces, the hope in their eyes as they waited for the doors to open. My mind raced, torn between the desperate need in the ICU and the silent line forming at the center. Both roles demanded my presence, both lives and dignity hanging in the balance. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, paralyzed by the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
