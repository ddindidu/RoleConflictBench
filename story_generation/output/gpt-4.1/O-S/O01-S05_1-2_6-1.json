As an architect, I was expected to keep everything moving\u2014no delays, no bottlenecks. I\u2019d always managed by checking in casually, trusting my team to handle the details. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, not about the building, but about a legal issue tangled up in the project. As their advocate, I was supposed to give them precise, thorough advice, but the case was getting complicated\u2014zoning laws, contract clauses, potential disputes. They needed me to dig deep, to be meticulous and clear. I felt the pressure mounting: if I spent hours unraveling legal knots, the project might slip behind schedule. If I brushed off the legal work, the client could be at risk. My mind raced, torn between the easy rhythm of project management and the heavy responsibility of legal guidance. I stared at the blinking cursor in my email, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
