Mrs. Patel expects her apartment spotless, and I know she\u2019ll check the supply cabinet next time. I promised her I\u2019d never let her run out again. But as I look at the clock, my heart pounds\u2014ten minutes until the polling station closes. I\u2019ve been planning to vote all week, determined not to let my voice go unheard. The store is on the way to the station, but if there\u2019s a line or traffic, I might miss my chance. If I skip the store, I\u2019ll break my promise to Mrs. Patel and risk her disappointment. If I skip voting, I\u2019ll let myself down, after telling everyone how important it is. My hands tremble as I weigh the bottle in one hand and my voter ID in the other, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
