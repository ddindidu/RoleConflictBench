My patient, Mrs. Lee, sat across from me, her hands trembling as she described her worsening symptoms. She needed her medication adjusted\u2014her autoimmune disease was flaring, and the treatment was complex, requiring careful monitoring and a lengthy discussion. As her doctor, I knew I had to give her my full attention, to ensure she received the best care and left with a clear plan.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the polling station. Today was election day, and I had promised myself I would vote. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was lighter than usual, but I could already see my appointments running behind. If I spent the necessary time with Mrs. Lee, I might miss my chance to vote. If I rushed, I\u2019d be failing her as a doctor. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I felt a knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
