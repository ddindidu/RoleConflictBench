As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Suddenly, I spot a child flailing in the deep end\u2014an area strictly off-limits to non-swimmers. My heart pounds; I know I need to act fast. But just as I rise from my chair, my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s my client, desperate for urgent legal advice. As their advocate, I\u2019m expected to provide clear, accurate guidance\u2014right now, their next move depends on me. I freeze, torn between the pool and the phone, between the child\u2019s safety and my client\u2019s trust. The weight of both roles presses down, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I can\u2019t ignore. My mind races, caught in the impossible space between duty and responsibility, knowing that whatever I choose, something vital will be left undone."}
