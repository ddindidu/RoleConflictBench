A woman hovered at the entrance, her eyes darting nervously. As a hairdresser, I knew my job: greet her warmly, put her at ease, and make her feel welcome. I started toward her, rehearsing my friendliest smile. But outside, the muffled chants of the street demonstration grew louder. I remembered the barricades set up by the city, the police urging everyone to stay behind them. Suddenly, a fellow protester from earlier appeared at the window, gesturing urgently for me to join them and step past the barricade. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I was supposed to respect the law and public property, but the cause felt important. Inside, the new client looked lost, waiting for my attention. I stood frozen, torn between the comfort I owed her and the civic responsibility\u2014and risk\u2014calling from the street."}
