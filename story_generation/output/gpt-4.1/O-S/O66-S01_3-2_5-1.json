Suddenly, orange cones forced me into a single lane, and I saw the yellow school zone sign ahead. Kids clustered near the curb, backpacks swinging, a crossing guard raising her hand. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: slow down, be extra cautious, never risk a child\u2019s safety. But the minutes ticked by, and I imagined the disappointed faces at the shelter if I was late. My foot hovered between the brake and the gas, heart pounding, torn between my duty to drive safely and my promise to be there for those who counted on me."}
