As an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring our new product met the latest safety standard, which had just been updated last week. The release was tomorrow, and I still needed to finalize the documentation to prove our compliance. My manager had made it clear: no shortcuts, no delays\u2014regulatory evidence was non-negotiable.\n\nBut today was also election day. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, and the polling station was only a short drive away. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was unusually light, but every time I considered stepping away, another email pinged in\u2014questions from the compliance team, last-minute requests for clarification. I felt the weight of my responsibility to my team and the company, but also the civic duty tugging at me. I kept glancing at the time, torn between the expectation to deliver flawless, timely work and the obligation to participate in the democratic process. My stomach twisted as I tried to decide which role I could afford to let down, even for just an hour."}
