My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need every call, every lead, every conversion.\u201d The team\u2019s bonus\u2014and my own\u2014hangs in the balance. I spot a crumpled flyer in my pocket, a script I\u2019ve been using all week. My hands are full, and the next call is about to start. The nearest trash bin is a few steps away, but if I break my stride, I might miss the window to catch a potential customer. I glance at the no-littering sign, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a citizen. I know the rules, the expectation to keep public spaces clean, to respect the community. But the pressure to meet my sales target is suffocating. My thumb hovers over the call button, the flyer clenched in my fist, and I feel the tug-of-war inside me\u2014between doing what\u2019s right for my job and what\u2019s right for my city."}
