As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014no speeding, no running lights, always drive defensively. The roads were clear this morning, the sun just beginning to warm the city, but the minutes were slipping away faster than I liked. Today, I was also the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center, and I could already picture the small crowd gathering outside, waiting for the doors to open. They depended on me to start the day\u2019s service, and I hated the thought of letting them down. My mind raced with the pressure: if I followed every traffic law to the letter, I\u2019d be late, leaving people stranded. But if I rushed, even just a little, I\u2019d be betraying the trust placed in me as a safe, responsible driver. The light turned green, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
