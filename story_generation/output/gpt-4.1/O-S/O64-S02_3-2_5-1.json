The line had finally thinned, but now I was hunched over the register, counting bills for the end-of-day deposit. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be double-checked, forms filled, the safe locked, and the manager notified. I could hear my phone buzzing in my apron pocket\u2014texts from my activist group, urgent and insistent. The protest was starting in minutes, and I was supposed to lead the first chant, my voice setting the tone for the march. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock again. If I rushed the deposit, I\u2019d risk breaking procedure and getting written up, maybe even fired. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let down my friends and the cause I cared about most. My hands shook as I tried to focus on the numbers, but my mind was already outside, in the street, where my voice was needed. I felt trapped between the rules of my job and the call of my convictions, unable to move in either direction."}
