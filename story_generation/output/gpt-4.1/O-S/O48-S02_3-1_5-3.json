As a nursing assistant, I know I have to check his vitals every few minutes\u2014his life could depend on it. My hands are steady as I record his blood pressure, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder from the activist group: the petition to protect patient rights is about to close, and this is my last chance to add my name. I know how important this is\u2014if enough of us sign, it could push the lawmaker to act. But if I take my eyes off Mr. Lee, even for a moment, I might miss a critical change. My supervisor expects me to be fully present for my patients, but my fellow activists are counting on me to stand up for change. My heart pounds as I stare at the screen, torn between the immediate needs of the person in front of me and the broader fight for justice that could help so many more."}
