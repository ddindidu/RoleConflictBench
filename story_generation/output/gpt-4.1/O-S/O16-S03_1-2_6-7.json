As a doctor, I knew my responsibility: examine him thoroughly, confirm the diagnosis, and prescribe the right antibiotics if it was strep. I could already hear the waiting room filling up; the day was going to be long. Just as I was about to call him in, my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. My mind immediately went to Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. As a citizen, I felt a strong duty to check on her, make sure she had water, and her air conditioning was working. The expectation to help in emergencies pressed on me, but so did the line of patients relying on my medical expertise. I felt torn, my heart racing as I weighed the needs of my patient against the safety of my neighbor, both roles demanding my immediate attention."}
