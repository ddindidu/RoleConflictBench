As a nursing assistant, I was helping Mr. Lee, who had just come out of surgery, gently ease his arms into his shirt. He winced, and I slowed down, remembering how important it was to be careful with his stitches. My mind, however, kept drifting to the meeting I was supposed to attend in fifteen minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable\u2014my presence was needed to speak up for someone who had no one else. The expectation was clear: I had to be there, on time, every time. But Mr. Lee needed me now, and I could see the anxiety in his eyes as he struggled to sit up. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I rushed, I might hurt him; if I stayed, I\u2019d let down someone else who was counting on me. My hands trembled as I tried to steady myself, caught between the demands of care and the call to stand up for another."}
