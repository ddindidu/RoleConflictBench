As a lawyer, I knew the stakes\u2014if I didn\u2019t scrutinize every clause, my client could face serious financial consequences. The deadline was tight, and my phone buzzed with reminders from the client, their anxiety seeping through every message. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered today was election day.
