Mrs. Patel\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern\u2014her fever, joint pain, and rash seemed to contradict each other, and her test results were inconclusive. As her doctor, I knew she was counting on me to find answers, to give her a name for her suffering and a path to recovery. I felt the weight of her anxious gaze from the exam table.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a call I\u2019d been waiting for all week\u2014a legislative aide was on the line, ready to discuss the environmental health bill I\u2019d been fighting for as an activist. This was my chance to push for change that could help thousands, maybe even prevent cases like Mrs. Patel\u2019s in the future. But I only had ten minutes, and Mrs. Patel needed me now. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my patient and the broader cause I believed in. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to answer first, feeling the expectations of both worlds pressing in on me."}
