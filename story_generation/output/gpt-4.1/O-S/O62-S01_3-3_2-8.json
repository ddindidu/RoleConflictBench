As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger, especially with the tide rolling in fast. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my responsibility. Suddenly, my radio crackled. The volunteer coordinator\u2019s voice was sharp: \u201cAll volunteers, report to the main tent immediately. New safety procedures must be implemented now, or we risk shutting down the service.\u201d My heart pounded. As a volunteer, I was expected to follow every directive, no questions asked. But if I left my post, even for a minute, I\u2019d be turning my back on the swimmers who depended on me. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
