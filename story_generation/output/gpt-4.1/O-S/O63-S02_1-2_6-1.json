The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor just announced we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. My phone buzzes with a message from my activist group: the protest march is about to start, and they need me at the front to lead the first chant. My heart pounds. I know how important this moment is for our cause, and I promised I\u2019d be there. But I\u2019m still on the clock, and if I leave now, I\u2019ll be taking my break earlier than usual, maybe even stretching the rules a bit. I can almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding us to respect the schedule, even on slow days. My activist friends are counting on me, but so is my team at work. I stare at my headset, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
