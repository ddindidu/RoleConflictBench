Their faces were tense, eyes darting to the clock. I knew my job\u2014smile, welcome them, make them feel at ease. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d I said, ushering them to their seats, trying to project calm. But as I reached for my apron, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter. She\u2019d suggested reorganizing the supply closet today if I had a spare moment, and I\u2019d promised to help after my shift. I could picture the cluttered shelves, the way she\u2019d looked at me last week, hopeful I\u2019d take initiative. Now, with the bridal party needing every ounce of my attention and the coordinator counting on me, I felt the pressure mounting. I wanted to be present for these women, to make their day special, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the team at the shelter. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of both worlds, unsure how I could possibly meet them all."}
