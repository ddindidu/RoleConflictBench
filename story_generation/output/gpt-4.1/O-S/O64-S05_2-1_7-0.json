Today, the line snakes past the bakery, and I greet each customer warmly, scanning items and making small talk to ease the wait. But halfway through, I spot Mrs. Carter, a client from my advocacy work, inching forward with her groceries. She leans in, voice low, asking about her landlord\u2019s latest notice. My advocate side wants to give her a clear, thorough answer\u2014she\u2019s anxious, and I know how much she relies on my advice. But the line behind her grows restless, and I feel the impatient eyes of my manager. I\u2019m torn: do I pause to explain her rights, risking the ire of waiting customers and my boss, or do I brush her off with a quick, vague reassurance, betraying the trust she\u2019s placed in me? My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014friendly, efficient service versus the duty to empower my client with the information she needs. The register beeps, the line shuffles, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
