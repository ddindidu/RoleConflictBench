The launch date had been moved up, and now everyone was waiting on me to make decisions about the new features. My phone buzzed with reminders from my manager: \u201cWe need your input ASAP.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that any delay from me would stall the entire project. \n\nBut outside, the city was alive with protest. As a citizen, I believed in standing up for what was right, and today\u2019s demonstration was about an issue I cared deeply about. The crowd surged forward, voices raised, and someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s step past the barricade. We need to make them listen.\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the police tape and the officers watching us closely. I knew crossing that line meant breaking the law, risking arrest, and disrespecting public property. \n\nInside, I was torn. My team needed me online, making decisions. My conscience pulled me toward the cause, but the law and my sense of responsibility as a citizen held me back. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
