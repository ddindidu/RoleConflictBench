As a scientist, I knew the importance of documenting every detail, but today\u2019s results could wait\u2014routine logs were flexible, and nothing urgent pressed me. My mind drifted to my volunteer shift at the community clinic later that afternoon. The coordinator had emphasized new safety protocols in our last briefing, insisting we all follow them to the letter. I respected her dedication; the guidelines were clear, and I wanted to set a good example.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized I was running late. If I left now, I\u2019d have to skip updating my research logs until tomorrow. That nagged at me\u2014accuracy and timeliness were the backbone of good science. Yet, if I stayed to finish, I\u2019d risk arriving late at the clinic, possibly missing the safety huddle and undermining the coordinator\u2019s trust in me. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest: the scientist in me demanded precision and responsibility, while the volunteer in me urged reliability and adherence to rules. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
