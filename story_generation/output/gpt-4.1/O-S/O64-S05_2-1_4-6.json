In ten minutes, I was supposed to be across town, sitting in a meeting where my presence as an advocate was not just expected, but required. The store was busy, and my manager had already reminded me to stick to the return policy\u2014no receipt, no refund. That\u2019s when a woman approached, her face anxious, clutching a sweater. She explained she\u2019d lost her receipt but needed the money back for groceries. My heart twisted; as an advocate, I was trained to listen, to help, to fight for people in tough spots. But as a cashier, I was bound by the rules. The line behind her grew, and my phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding compassion, the other demanding compliance. My hands trembled as I looked from the woman to the clock, torn between the policy I was paid to uphold and the empathy I was sworn to embody."}
