As a nursing assistant, I was supposed to be present\u2014truly present\u2014for Mrs. Lee, who sat quietly in her bed, her eyes searching mine for comfort. She\u2019d confided in me about her loneliness, and I knew how much she needed someone to simply listen. I reached for her hand, offering a gentle squeeze, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket.

The trial was critical, and my absence could mean disaster for them.

I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which need was greater, and knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
