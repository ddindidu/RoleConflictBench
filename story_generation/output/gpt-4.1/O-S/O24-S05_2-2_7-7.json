As a judge, I prided myself on staying current with every legal development, knowing that justice demanded nothing less. This morning, an attorney had cited a fresh appellate decision\u2014one I hadn\u2019t yet read. The next session was in an hour, and I knew I needed to review the ruling thoroughly to ensure a fair hearing. But as I glanced at the clock, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was also due in another courtroom, this time as an advocate, representing a client whose future hinged on my punctuality and preparation. My client expected me to be there, sharp and ready, not distracted or late. The pressure mounted as I weighed my duty to the law against my responsibility to my client. My mind raced, torn between the need to be a diligent, informed judge and a reliable, present advocate. The expectations of both roles pressed in, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left wanting."}
