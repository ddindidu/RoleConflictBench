As a repairer, I know how important it is to make sure clients feel confident, and I pride myself on being thorough. She seemed nervous, and I could hear the uncertainty in her voice. I wanted to take the time to explain everything clearly, answer her questions, and make sure she felt supported.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my stomach tightened. My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and the coordinator had just sent a reminder: today, every minute counted. We were short-staffed, and the doors would open right on the hour. I could already picture the line of people waiting, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, ready to help. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, the client needed me now, and on the other, my team was counting on me to show up on time. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
