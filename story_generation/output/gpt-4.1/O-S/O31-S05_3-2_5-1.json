As a police officer, my duty was clear: protect the people. Reports said a violent assault was underway, and bystanders were at risk. My heart pounded, adrenaline surging, every second counting. But as I gripped the wheel, my phone buzzed with a message from my client. As their advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, timely legal advice, and their case had just taken a complicated turn. They needed me now, desperate for guidance before a crucial deadline. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me\u2014one demanding I rush into danger to shield the innocent, the other insisting I pause, focus, and untangle the legal web for someone relying on my expertise. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the urgent cries of the street and the silent plea from my client."}
