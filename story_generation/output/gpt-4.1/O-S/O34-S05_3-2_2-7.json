A sudden route closure had forced dozens of flights into tight holding stacks, and my headset buzzed with urgent voices\u2014pilots needing instructions, supervisors demanding updates. Every second counted; a single miscalculation could mean disaster. My hands hovered over the console, heart pounding, as I tried to keep the chaos at bay.\n\nBut my phone vibrated insistently. The court session for my client was about to begin, and as their advocate, I was expected to be there\u2014punctual, prepared, their only hope. The judge would not wait, and my absence could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me: the lives in the sky, the future in the courtroom. I could not be in two places at once, yet both demanded all of me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to keep the skies safe and the promise I\u2019d made to stand by my client."}
