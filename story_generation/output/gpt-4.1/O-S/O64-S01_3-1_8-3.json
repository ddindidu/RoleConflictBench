She\u2019s upset about a coupon, her words clipped and loud enough for the people behind her to hear. I remind myself to smile, to stay patient, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, even as my heart pounds with the pressure of the crowd. Then, as I scan her items, she recognizes me from the community center where I volunteer. She starts chatting about her neighbor, who I know from my volunteer work, and asks if I\u2019ve seen her lately. The conversation teeters on the edge of personal, and I feel the weight of my other role\u2014the expectation to protect privacy, to never let slip anything about the people I help. My mind races, caught between the need to keep the line moving, to be warm and helpful, and the responsibility to guard someone\u2019s trust. I can feel the eyes of the waiting customers, the woman\u2019s expectant gaze, and the invisible boundary I must not cross."}
