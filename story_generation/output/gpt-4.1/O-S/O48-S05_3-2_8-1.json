She\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, and my heart ached to see her so broken. As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was here\u2014offering comfort, listening, letting her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was a message from my advocacy client, whose case had suddenly taken a complicated turn. He needed immediate, clear legal advice, and I was the only one he trusted to guide him through the maze of paperwork and deadlines.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. Mrs. Thompson\u2019s sobs grew softer, but her grip on my hand tightened, silently pleading for me to stay. At the same time, my client\u2019s messages grew more urgent, each one a reminder of my responsibility to provide accurate, timely counsel. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of human connection and the cold precision of legal guidance. I could feel myself splitting in two, desperate not to fail either of them, yet knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once."}
