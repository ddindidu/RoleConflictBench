My heart thudded. In five minutes, I was supposed to be on air, sharing my passion for clean energy with the city. The radio station was only ten minutes away, but I was behind the wheel, driving a passenger who\u2019d just settled into the back seat, humming softly, clearly in no rush. As a taxi driver, I owed her a safe, comfortable ride, and she\u2019d mentioned she had plenty of time for her meeting. But as an activist, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations pressing on me. This radio segment was a rare chance to reach thousands, to spark real change. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between my duty to my passenger and my responsibility to my cause. My mind raced, calculating routes, consequences, and the risk of letting someone down\u2014either the person in my cab or the people counting on my voice."}
