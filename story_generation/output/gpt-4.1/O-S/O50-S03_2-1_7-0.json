He always insisted he knew better, but every time he changed something, the material waste piled up. As the machine repairer, I was expected to step in, guide him, and prevent further loss. My supervisor had made it clear: I needed to be assertive, even if it meant correcting someone in front of others. But I hesitated, not wanting to embarrass him or cause a scene.\n\nLater that day, I took a walk in the park to clear my head. The sun was warm, and the air was fresh. I passed a group of teenagers laughing, one of them tossing a soda can onto the grass right next to a trash bin. The no-littering signs were obvious, and as a responsible citizen, I felt the urge to say something. But I remembered how it felt to be corrected in public, and I didn\u2019t want to overstep or create conflict.\n\nBoth times, I felt the weight of expectations pressing on me\u2014one to act for the good of the company, the other for the good of the community. I stood there, torn, unsure which role to let guide me."}
