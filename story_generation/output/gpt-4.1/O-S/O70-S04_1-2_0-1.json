The last package of the day had just arrived\u2014late, but still technically on time. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery delivery, on time, no exceptions.\u201d I loaded the box into my van, checking the address. It was across town, and traffic was already thickening. \n\nBut today wasn\u2019t just any day. It was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station closed in two hours, and I still had a handful of deliveries left, this last one being the farthest. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to vote!\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I delivered the package first, I might miss my chance to vote. If I voted first, the package could be late, and I\u2019d risk a complaint or worse. \n\nBoth roles demanded my presence, my responsibility. I could almost hear the disappointment in my supervisor\u2019s voice, and at the same time, I imagined the regret of not casting my ballot. I sat in the van, keys in hand, torn between duty and civic responsibility, unsure which road to take."}
