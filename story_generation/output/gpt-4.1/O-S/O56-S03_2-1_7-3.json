As a hairdresser, I know I should wash and condition her hair before I even think about cutting it\u2014it's what she expects, and it's what I pride myself on. But as I lead her to the chair, my phone buzzes in my pocket. The city newsletter reminder flashes on the screen: the bus route survey closes in an hour. I promised myself I\u2019d participate this time, to be a responsible citizen and give feedback about the new stops near my apartment. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my client expects my full attention and care, but my city expects my voice. I can\u2019t ignore either, but I can\u2019t do both at once. My hands hover over the shampoo bottles, my mind racing, torn between the immediate needs of the person in front of me and the broader responsibility I feel to my community."}
