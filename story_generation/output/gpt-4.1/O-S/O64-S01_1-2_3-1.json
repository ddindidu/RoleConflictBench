I was supposed to be at the community center in fifteen minutes, ready to help set up for the morning rush. But as I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: any irregularity, no matter how minor, had to be reported and investigated before leaving. My manager expected me to double-check every transaction, fill out the discrepancy form, and wait for her to review it. I could already picture the disappointed look on the volunteer coordinator\u2019s face if I was late again. She\u2019d sent a reminder last night: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions.\u201d My stomach twisted as I weighed the responsibility to my job against my commitment to the center. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
