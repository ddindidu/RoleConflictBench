My registration didn\u2019t match, and I had only ten minutes before the station closed. I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me\u2014my vote mattered, and I wanted to do everything by the book. Just as I reached for the form, my radio crackled. Dispatch reported a violent assault just outside, only a block away. Bystanders were in danger, and I was the closest officer. My training screamed at me to act, to protect lives, to run toward the chaos. But the official\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to finish the paperwork, to follow the rules like every other voter. My heart pounded as I looked from the form to the door, torn between my oath as a police officer and my right\u2014and responsibility\u2014as a citizen."}
