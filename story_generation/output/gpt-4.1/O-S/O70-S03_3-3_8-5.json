It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I was halfway through my delivery route, and I\u2019d just realized one of the packages was missing from my van. My heart pounded as I tried to recall if I\u2019d left it at the last stop or if it had been misplaced at the warehouse. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, reassure the customer, and start tracking down the missing item. At the same time, I remembered the polling place down the street\u2014today was the last day to vote on a measure that would impact my neighborhood\u2019s safety and parking. The polls closed in two hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, just like I always told my friends and family was important. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a reliable, courteous delivery person and my responsibility as a citizen to have my voice heard. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
