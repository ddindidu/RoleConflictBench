As the lead engineer, I\u2019m responsible for making sure every detail meets the updated safety standard. The audit is next week, and I still need to gather evidence of compliance\u2014test reports, supplier certificates, all the paperwork. My manager expects nothing less than perfection, and I know a single oversight could delay the launch or, worse, put people at risk.\n\nBut as a citizen, I have other duties. My tax documents are finally in order, but this weekend the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic, and they\u2019re short on volunteers. I promised my neighbor I\u2019d help out, and I know how important it is, especially for the elderly in our area. I want to do my part, to be someone my community can count on.\n\nThe pressure builds as I weigh the demands. My professional integrity is on the line, but so is my sense of responsibility to my neighbors. I feel torn, anxious, and guilty, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
