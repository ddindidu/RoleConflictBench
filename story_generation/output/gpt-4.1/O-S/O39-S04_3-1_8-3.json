Protocol is drilled into us: when that alarm sounds, you don\u2019t hesitate, you don\u2019t question, you just move. I join the stream of hard hats heading for the muster point, but my mind is racing. Today is voting day, and I\u2019d planned to head straight to the polling station after my shift. I reach for my wallet, only to realize my ID isn\u2019t there\u2014I left it in my locker, back inside the building we\u2019re evacuating. The foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cNo one goes back for any reason.\u201d But if I don\u2019t have my ID, I can\u2019t vote. I know I could fetch it later, but what if the site stays closed for hours? My team expects me to follow safety rules, but my civic duty tugs at me just as hard. I stand at the muster point, torn between being a responsible worker and a responsible citizen, anxiety twisting in my gut as I weigh the demands of both worlds."}
