As the lead scientist, I was expected to ensure every piece of equipment was in perfect order, even if nothing seemed amiss. Safety protocols were non-negotiable, and I knew the consequences of neglecting even a minor detail. Yet, my phone buzzed with another reminder: the advocacy meeting was starting in fifteen minutes across town. As an advocate, punctuality was a sign of respect and commitment, and missing even one session could undermine my credibility with the community I represented.\n\nMy lab coat felt heavier than usual as I weighed my options. If I stayed, I could double-check the equipment, upholding the trust my colleagues placed in me. But if I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the meeting, fulfilling my promise to those who depended on my voice. The expectations from both sides pressed in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to yield. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between the silent hum of the lab and the urgent call of advocacy waiting beyond its walls."}
