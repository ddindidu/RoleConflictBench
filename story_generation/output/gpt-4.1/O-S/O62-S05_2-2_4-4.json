As the lifeguard on duty, I was expected to check every inch of the facility before the swim lessons began. That\u2019s when I noticed the broken lane rope, its frayed end floating uselessly. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the lessons would be chaotic, maybe even unsafe. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my client\u2019s hearing was in less than an hour. As their advocate, I was supposed to review the case file one last time, to be fully prepared for the disputes that could decide their future. My supervisor would expect the pool to be ready, but my client was counting on me to represent them with care and focus. I felt the pressure building, torn between the immediate, tangible needs of the pool and the high-stakes demands of the courtroom. My hands hovered over the lane rope, my mind racing through legal arguments, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
