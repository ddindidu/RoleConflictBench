As a lawyer, I was used to fielding questions, but when a friendly acquaintance leaned in and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story behind your latest client?\u201d I felt the familiar pressure of confidentiality tighten around me. I smiled, deflecting, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cURGENT\u2014new procedures must be followed tonight or we risk shutting down the service.\u201d My mind raced. I was expected to uphold the strictest ethical standards as a lawyer, never revealing a client\u2019s details, not even in passing. But as a volunteer, I was also expected to be immediately responsive, to follow every directive without delay. The two worlds collided in that moment\u2014one demanding silence, the other demanding action. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how to honor both without letting anyone down."}
