As a software developer, I was supposed to be in a cross-team meeting, hashing out the final specs for a feature that had to launch two weeks early. Architects from three teams were waiting for my input, and the project manager\u2019s messages grew more insistent by the minute. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was the volunteer coordinator. The message was marked urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service we provided to dozens of people would be shut down. I was expected to drop everything and follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions to the letter. My mind raced, torn between the pressure of unblocking my colleagues at work and the responsibility to keep the volunteer service running. Both sides needed me, right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all directions."}
