Both drivers are agitated, each insisting the other is at fault. I listen carefully, determined to remain impartial and ensure the law is applied justly. But as I begin to assess the scene, I remember my other role: I\u2019m also a volunteer for the city\u2019s road safety initiative, and just yesterday, our coordinator emphasized new safety steps for accident scenes\u2014steps that must be followed to the letter, no exceptions.\n\nThe drivers are growing impatient, and the crowd is swelling. As a police officer, I want to resolve the dispute quickly and fairly, but as a volunteer, I\u2019m supposed to implement the new safety measures, which will slow things down and might frustrate everyone further. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My mind races, torn between the urge to act decisively as an officer and the responsibility to model the new safety protocols as a volunteer. I stand there, caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
