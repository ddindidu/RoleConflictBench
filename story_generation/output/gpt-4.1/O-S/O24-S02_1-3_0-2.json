As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. The hearing was in two weeks, but I prided myself on being thorough and prepared. I reached for the file, but my phone buzzed urgently. Messages flooded in from my activist group: police had started blocking the exits at our peaceful protest downtown. Panic was rising among the crowd, and they needed someone to coordinate a safe response\u2014someone with experience, someone like me.\n\nMy mind raced. The court expected diligence and impartiality; my fellow activists expected leadership and quick action. I felt the weight of the robe on my shoulders, the responsibility to justice, but also the pull of my convictions and the faces of those counting on me. My heart pounded as I stared at the file, then at my phone, torn between the silent demands of the law and the urgent cries for help echoing through my screen."}
