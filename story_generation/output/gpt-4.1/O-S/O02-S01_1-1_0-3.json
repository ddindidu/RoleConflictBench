Today, during a project meeting, my manager encouraged us to brainstorm freely\u2014nothing was set in stone yet, and we could always propose alternatives later. I felt a sense of freedom, knowing I could explore different technical approaches without immediate pressure.\n\nLater that afternoon, I switched hats and joined my volunteer group at the community center. We were helping a few new families settle in, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. During a break, one of the families started chatting with me. The conversation was light, but it edged toward personal details\u2014where they\u2019d come from, what they\u2019d left behind. Nothing sensitive, but I felt a subtle tension. As a volunteer, I\u2019m expected to respect their privacy, to never pry or let curiosity override their comfort.\n\nI found myself caught between my engineer\u2019s instinct to gather information for better solutions and my volunteer\u2019s duty to protect confidentiality. My mind raced: Should I gently steer the conversation away, or let it flow naturally? The expectations from both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
