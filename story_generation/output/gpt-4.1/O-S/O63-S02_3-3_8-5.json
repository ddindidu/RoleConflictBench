My break wasn\u2019t scheduled for another forty minutes, and the compliance system would flag any unscheduled pause. I\u2019d already been warned last month\u2014one more infraction, and I could lose my job. But my phone buzzed with a message from the activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on the clean water bill, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to share my story and urge a \u201cyes\u201d vote. My heart pounded. I knew how much this bill meant to my community, but if I stepped away from my desk, even for five minutes, the system would log it. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the urgent call to action from my fellow activists. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between risking my livelihood and letting down a cause I believed in."}
