The safety audit was in two hours, and I was the one responsible for making sure everything was up to code. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo mistakes, not this time.\u201d I could feel the weight of the lab\u2019s reputation pressing on my shoulders. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. I had promised myself I\u2019d vote, no matter what. The polling station was only a fifteen-minute walk away, and the polls were open all day. My schedule was light, but the repairs and paperwork would take time, and I couldn\u2019t risk being away if the auditors arrived early. \n\nI felt torn, the scientist in me demanding perfection and safety, the citizen in me insisting on civic duty. My hands trembled as I glanced between the lab door and my phone, heart pounding with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
