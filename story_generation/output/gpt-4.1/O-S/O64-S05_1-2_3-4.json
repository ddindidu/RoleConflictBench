There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expected me to report even the smallest error, and I could already imagine the questions, the paperwork, the suspicion. But my mind kept drifting to my other life, the one outside this fluorescent-lit counter. As an advocate, I was preparing for a client\u2019s hearing tomorrow, a case with real consequences. My client depended on me to be sharp, focused, and ready to fight for them. But now, I was stuck here, torn between the duty to my employer and the responsibility to my client. If I spent time investigating this minor register issue, I\u2019d lose precious hours I needed to review evidence and prepare arguments. If I let it slide, I\u2019d be breaking store policy and risking my job. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give."}
