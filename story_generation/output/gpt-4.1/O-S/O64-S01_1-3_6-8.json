The store was quiet, and I took pride in making every interaction pleasant, asking about their day, making small talk, and ensuring they left with a good impression. Just as I finished ringing up a regular, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service we provided as volunteers would be shut down. My heart pounded. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were strict\u2014no exceptions, no delays. But here I was, expected to be present and friendly for the next customer, who was already approaching with a cart full of items. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. Should I step away to address the volunteer directive, risking my reputation as a reliable cashier, or stay put and risk the consequences for the volunteer service? The expectations clashed inside me, and I could feel the stress building as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
