As a judge, I know the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail must be scrutinized, every argument considered, so that justice is served impartially. My mind is deep in legal analysis when my phone buzzes with an urgent message: the legislature is about to vote on a bill I\u2019ve spent months advocating for as an activist. The outcome hinges on a single, undecided representative, and my colleagues are counting on me to make the call, to sway the vote that could change lives. My heart pounds. I feel the pull of duty from both sides\u2014one expects unwavering neutrality and focus, the other demands passionate action and immediate involvement. I stare at the phone, then back at the briefs, torn between the silent authority of the courtroom and the urgent voice of the cause I believe in."}
