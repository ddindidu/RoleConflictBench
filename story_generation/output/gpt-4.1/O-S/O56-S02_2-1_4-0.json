She\u2019s a first-time visitor, and I can see the uncertainty in her eyes as she studies the colour in the mirror. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask, trying to keep my voice calm and professional, even as my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Maya, a fellow activist: \u201cWe need more people at the protest\u2014can you come now?\u201d I feel my stomach twist. I want to reassure my client, listen to her concerns, and fix whatever she\u2019s unhappy with. That\u2019s my job, and I take pride in making people feel good about themselves. But I also know the demonstration is small, and every person counts. I promised my activist friends I\u2019d show up whenever I could. My client hesitates, her disappointment clear, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I want to be present for her, but I also want to stand up for what I believe in. My hands tremble slightly as I try to decide what to do next."}
