The store is quiet, and I try to keep my smile warm, making small talk as I bag her apples. My manager expects me to be friendly, attentive, and never rush a customer, no matter how slow the day is. But as I hand Mrs. Lee her receipt, I glance at the clock. The polling place down the street closes in two hours, and there\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the way our block handles parking\u2014something I care about deeply. As a citizen, I know I should vote, stay informed, and give feedback on issues that matter. But if I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my manager and the customers who rely on me for a friendly face and smooth service. If I stay, I might miss my chance to have a say in my own neighborhood. My heart pounds as another customer approaches, and I force a smile, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
