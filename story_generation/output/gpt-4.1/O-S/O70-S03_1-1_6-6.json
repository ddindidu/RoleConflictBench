As a delivery person, I knew the importance of being polite and professional\u2014smiling, confirming the recipient\u2019s name, making sure the handoff was smooth. But as I waited for the customer to answer, my mind kept drifting to the envelope of tax documents I\u2019d organized weeks ago, and the flyer I\u2019d seen about the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to contribute\u2014paying my taxes on time, staying up to date with vaccines, doing my part for public health. But my delivery schedule was packed, and I\u2019d already missed the last clinic because of a late shift. Now, as the door opened, I forced a smile, but inside I was torn. The customer expected my full attention and courtesy, but my community needed me too. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
