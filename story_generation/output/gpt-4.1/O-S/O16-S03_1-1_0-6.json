The symptoms point to a common cold, but as a doctor, I know I must be thorough. I order a few tests, just to be sure, and remind myself that accuracy is my duty. Yet, my mind drifts to the community center, where a free vaccine clinic is running this weekend. As a citizen, I feel a strong pull to volunteer, to help protect my neighbors and contribute to public health. My tax documents are already organized, so I have the time, but the clinic coincides with my on-call shift at the hospital. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my patients expect careful, undivided attention, while my community needs volunteers to keep everyone safe. I wrestle with the guilt of possibly letting someone down, torn between my professional oath and my civic responsibility, unsure which expectation I can afford to disappoint."}
