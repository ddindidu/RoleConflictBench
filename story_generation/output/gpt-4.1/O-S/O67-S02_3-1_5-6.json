Dispatch had said it was a possible heart attack\u2014every second mattered. I glanced at the patient in the back, pale and gasping, and reminded myself to stay focused, to be ready to help the paramedic with CPR if needed. My phone buzzed on the dashboard. I caught a glimpse: my activist group\u2019s post was exploding online. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to educate thousands about our cause. If I added a comment now, I could clarify our message, answer questions, maybe even change minds. But my duty as an ambulance driver pressed on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t let anything distract me from the patient\u2019s care. My mind raced, torn between the life in my ambulance and the movement I\u2019d poured my soul into. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
