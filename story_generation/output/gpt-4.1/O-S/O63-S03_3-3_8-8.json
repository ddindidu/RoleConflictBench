My script blinked on the screen, but outside, the sky had turned a bruised gray. Suddenly, the building alarms blared\u2014a flash-flood warning. Through the window, I saw water pooling at the curb, neighbors scrambling to move cars, a woman shouting for help. My heart hammered. I knew the compliance system would flag any unscheduled break, and I\u2019d already been warned about my metrics. If I left my desk now, even for a minute, I risked disciplinary action. But as a citizen, I was supposed to help in emergencies, to look out for my community. The expectation to stay at my station warred with the urge to rush outside, to do something\u2014anything\u2014to help. My hand hovered over the \u201cpause\u201d button, sweat prickling my palms. I could hear the panic outside, but the automated voice in my ear reminded me: \u201cYour break is not scheduled.\u201d I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my conscience, the seconds stretching unbearably as I wrestled with what to do."}
