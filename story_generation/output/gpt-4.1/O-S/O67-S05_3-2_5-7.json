The paramedic shouted for help\u2014she needed another pair of hands to stabilize the man whose chest heaved with every labored breath. As an ambulance driver, I was trained to step in, to provide initial care when seconds mattered. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard: a reminder of the court session I was due to attend in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client depended on me to be there, to argue their case, to ensure justice wasn\u2019t delayed or denied. The weight of both roles pressed on me. If I stayed to help, I\u2019d risk missing the court session and letting my client down. If I left, I\u2019d abandon a patient in crisis. My mind raced, torn between the duty to save a life and the promise to stand up for another. The city blurred past, and I felt the clock ticking, each second tightening the knot in my chest."}
