As a telemarketer, I was trained to handle objections, to stay calm, to explain every detail until the customer felt heard. But as he pressed for more and more information, I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my advocacy meeting, one I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. My supervisor expected me to be present at every session, to represent our clients without fail. The pressure built in my chest. If I cut Mr. Harris short, I\u2019d betray the trust I\u2019d built with him and fail my telemarketing duties. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the meeting, letting down my advocacy team and possibly missing crucial updates for my client. My mind raced, torn between the voice on the phone and the ticking clock, each role demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait."}
