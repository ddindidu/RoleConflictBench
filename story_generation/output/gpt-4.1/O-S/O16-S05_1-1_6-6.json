The rapid strep test was positive, and I knew she needed antibiotics. As her doctor, I was expected to explain the treatment, answer her questions, and ensure she understood the importance of taking the full course.

My patient looked anxious, waiting for reassurance, while my mind raced with the knowledge that being late could jeopardize my client\u2019s case.

My heart pounded as I stood between the exam room and the courtroom, torn by the impossible expectations placed upon me."}
