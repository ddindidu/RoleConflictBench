The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDrive safe, but hurry\u2014patient\u2019s critical.\u201d Every instinct as an ambulance driver told me to focus, to keep the vehicle steady on the slick roads, to ignore the pounding of my heart and the flashes of lightning. But as a citizen, I couldn\u2019t shake the memory of Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone on my floor. The heat advisory had been all over the news this morning, warning everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors. I\u2019d meant to stop by before my shift, but the emergency call had come in. Now, as I navigated the flooded streets, guilt gnawed at me. Was she okay? Was I failing her by not checking in? The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding my full attention to save a life in the back of my ambulance, the other whispering that I was neglecting my duty to my community. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
