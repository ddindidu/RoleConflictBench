She smiled at me, grateful for the extra time I spent making her tea just right. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that today was the last day to vote, and the polls would close for good tonight. I\u2019d been planning to go after my shift, but suddenly I remembered: my ID was at home, a forty-minute bus ride away. If I left now, I could just make it, but Mrs. Carter still needed help bathing, and Mr. Lee was waiting for his medication. My supervisor expected me to finish my rounds without delay, and my patients depended on me for their comfort and care. But if I didn\u2019t get my ID, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote, something I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this year. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, torn between the needs of those in my care and my duty as a citizen."}
