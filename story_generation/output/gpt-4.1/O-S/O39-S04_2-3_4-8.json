My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cKeep it safe, keep it clean.\u201d I knew if anyone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. I grabbed a mop, but my phone buzzed\u2014reminding me the polling station was closing soon. I rushed over, hands still gritty, and joined the line. When I finally reached the table, the official frowned at my ID. \u201cThere\u2019s a mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form, and we close in ten minutes.\u201d She handed me a stack of paperwork. My mind raced. If I left now, the spill could cause an accident. But if I ran back to clean it, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote. I could feel the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, each demanding my attention, each unforgiving if I failed. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between duty to my coworkers\u2019 safety and my right to have a say in the election."}
