Two minutes until the safety briefing. The foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my head\u2014\u201cEveryone attends, no exceptions. We\u2019re a team.\u201d I know the drill: miss the briefing, risk a write-up or worse. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a sharp reminder. The court session for my client starts in twenty minutes across town. I promised her I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d fight for her, that I wouldn\u2019t let the system swallow her up. The judge won\u2019t wait, and my absence could cost her everything. My boots feel heavy, caked with mud and responsibility. I can see the crew gathering, hard hats bobbing, eyes expectant. I can almost hear my client\u2019s anxious voice, feel the weight of her trust. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the team that counts on me and the client who needs my voice."}
