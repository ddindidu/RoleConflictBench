The bottle of floor cleaner was almost empty, and I knew I wouldn\u2019t have enough for the next visit. Mrs. Lee expected her floors spotless, and I prided myself on never letting her down. As I left, I made a mental note to pick up more cleaner, but my mind was already drifting to the protest downtown. As a citizen, I felt it was important to stand up for our rights, so I joined the crowd on Main Street. The energy was tense, and suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we mean business\u2014step over the barricade!\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the city workers guarding the restricted area. I knew the law was clear: stay behind the barricade. But the pressure from the crowd was intense, and I felt torn. If I crossed, I\u2019d be breaking the law I believed in upholding. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d disappoint those fighting for change. And in the back of my mind, I still worried about Mrs. Lee\u2019s floors and whether I\u2019d have time to buy the cleaner before my next shift."}
