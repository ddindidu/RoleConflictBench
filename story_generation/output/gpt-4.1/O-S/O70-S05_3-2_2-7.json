The medical supply box on the seat beside me was marked \u201cURGENT\u2014HOSPITAL DELIVERY.\u201d I knew the hospital was counting on me; a delay could mean a patient wouldn\u2019t get the care they needed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: court session in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I had promised my client I\u2019d be there, ready to fight for their case. They were depending on me, too. I gripped the steering wheel, torn. If I took the detour to the hospital, I\u2019d risk being late to court, letting my client down and possibly jeopardizing their future. But if I went straight to court, the hospital might not get the supplies in time. Both roles demanded punctuality, both lives could be affected by my choice. My mind raced, weighed down by the pressure of two worlds colliding, each expecting me to be their hero, right now."}
