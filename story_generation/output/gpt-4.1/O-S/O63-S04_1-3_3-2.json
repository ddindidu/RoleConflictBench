My sales numbers were already soaring this week, and management had sent a congratulatory email, urging me to keep the momentum going. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let up now, every call counts!\u201d But as I dialed the next number, my eyes kept darting to the clock. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I\u2019d make my voice heard. The polling station was just a few blocks away, but if I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to close another sale, maybe two. My heart pounded as I weighed the pressure to keep exceeding expectations at work against my responsibility as a citizen. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach. I stared at the phone, then at my coat hanging by the door, torn between the demands of my job and the duty I owed to myself and my community."}
