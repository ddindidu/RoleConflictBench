As a lifeguard, I knew the high tide brought hidden riptides and unpredictable currents\u2014one slip in my attention could mean disaster. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to every swimmer on this crowded beach. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder from my activist group: the online petition to ban offshore drilling was closing in minutes. I had spent weeks rallying support, and my signature\u2014my voice\u2014was needed now, before it was too late. My heart pounded.
