As a pharmacist, I knew how critical it was to dispense the right medications, especially for Mr. Lee, who depended on this complex regimen to manage his heart and diabetes. My mind raced through the dosages, the interactions, the consequences of even a minor error. The pharmacy was busy, phones ringing, patients waiting, but I couldn\u2019t rush this.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Maria, a client who needed urgent legal advice. She was in the middle of a crisis, and as her advocate, she trusted me to guide her through the legal maze. She needed clarity, reassurance, and immediate action\u2014something only I could provide right now.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The expectation to be precise and careful as a pharmacist clashed with the demand for swift, decisive support as an advocate. My hands trembled slightly as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved at the same time. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
