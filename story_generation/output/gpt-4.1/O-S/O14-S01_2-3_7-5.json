As a scientist, I was responsible for the lab\u2019s safety, and the upcoming audit had me on edge. The last inspection flagged a few minor issues with the centrifuge and the chemical storage, and I knew I had to double-check everything before the auditors arrived. But today was also my volunteer shift at the community clinic, where I sorted files containing sensitive medical histories. The expectation was clear: absolute confidentiality. \n\nAs I sifted through the files, my phone buzzed with a message from my lab assistant\u2014something about a possible leak in the fume hood. My mind raced. If I left now, I could fix the issue before the audit, but I\u2019d have to leave the files unsecured, even for a few minutes, which was strictly against protocol. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk the lab\u2019s safety rating and possibly endanger my colleagues. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, but the conflicting demands pulled me in opposite directions, each role demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
