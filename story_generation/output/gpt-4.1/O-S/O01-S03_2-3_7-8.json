As the architect, I was supposed to keep the project moving, coordinate with the contractors, and make sure the schedule didn\u2019t slip. The foreman was already at my side, asking if we should keep the crew working or call it for the day. But as a citizen, I knew the city expected me to act responsibly\u2014follow emergency guidance, help others, and not put anyone at risk. The alarms blared, echoing off the concrete, and I could see water pooling at the curb outside. My mind raced: if I sent everyone home, we\u2019d lose precious time and money. If I kept them here, I\u2019d be ignoring the warnings, risking their safety, and failing my duty to the community. My heart pounded as I looked from the anxious faces of the workers to the rising water outside, torn between my responsibility to the project and my responsibility to the people around me."}
