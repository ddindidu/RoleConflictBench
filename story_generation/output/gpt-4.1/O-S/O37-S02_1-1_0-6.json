I\u2019m supposed to be dusting the lounge and wiping down the tables, but my phone keeps buzzing in my pocket. The post I made about our campaign for fair wages is exploding online\u2014hundreds of people are commenting, asking questions, wanting to know more. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist, the chance to educate and rally support. But as a cleaner, I know the supervisor expects spotless surfaces and tidy corners, even if I usually just do a quick sweep and straighten up the magazines. If I stop now to respond online, the lounge will stay messy, and I\u2019ll get a warning. If I ignore the post, the momentum for our cause might fade. My hands tremble as I grip the mop, torn between the demands of my job and the urgency of my beliefs, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
