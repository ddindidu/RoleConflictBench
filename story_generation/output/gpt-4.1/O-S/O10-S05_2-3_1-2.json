As an accountant, the end-of-month deadline loomed over me like a storm cloud. My manager expected the books to be closed with absolute precision\u2014no errors, no delays. The spreadsheets on my screen blurred together as I double-checked every entry, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a client, desperate for legal advice. As their advocate, I knew how much they depended on me to guide them through this urgent issue. Their voice trembled with anxiety, and I could hear the trust they placed in my expertise. They needed clear, immediate answers\u2014there was no room for hesitation.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the numbers demanding my attention and the client\u2019s plea for help.

The pressure mounted, and I realized I couldn\u2019t give my best to either task if I tried to do both at once."}
