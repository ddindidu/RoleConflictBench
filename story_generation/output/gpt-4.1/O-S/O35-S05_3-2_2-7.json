My heart thudded. Protocol demanded I report and halt the train immediately\u2014passenger safety depended on it. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the court session starting in less than an hour. As an advocate, I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there, ready to defend their case\u2014one that could change their life. The expectation was clear: punctuality, unwavering commitment. Yet here I was, torn between two worlds. If I stopped the train, I\u2019d be late, maybe jeopardize my client\u2019s future. If I pressed on, I\u2019d risk the safety of everyone on board. Sweat prickled my brow as I gripped the controls, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both. My mind raced, caught in the impossible space between duty and promise, knowing whatever I chose, something vital would be left behind."}
