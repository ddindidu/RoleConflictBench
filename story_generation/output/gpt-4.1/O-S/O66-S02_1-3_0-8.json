He\u2019d told me there was no rush\u2014just a casual lunch with an old friend. The city traffic was light, and I felt the familiar comfort of routine, the expectation to get him there safely and on time. My phone buzzed on the dashboard. I saw the news alert: a major network needed an activist\u2019s voice\u2014my voice\u2014right now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. I knew how crucial this moment was; the public needed clarity, and I\u2019d promised my community I\u2019d always speak up when it mattered. But I was behind the wheel, responsible for my passenger\u2019s safety, and I couldn\u2019t just pull over or get distracted. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my presence for a stranger\u2019s safe journey, the other demanding my voice for something much bigger. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty in front of me and the call that could shape the conversation for thousands."}
