As a lawyer, I knew the court hearing scheduled for later was minor\u2014just a procedural matter that could be postponed if I absolutely had to. Still, I prided myself on being reliable for my clients, always showing up, always prepared. But today, I was also a voter, determined to fulfill my civic duty.\n\nThe line at the polling station snaked around the block, but it was moving steadily. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line looked longer and slower, but the instructions were clear. As a lawyer, I was trained to follow rules and respect authority, but as a voter pressed for time, I wanted to stay put and get through quickly.\n\nMy heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between the urge to follow the official\u2019s directions and the need to get to court on time. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and practicality."}
