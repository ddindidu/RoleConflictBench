The deadline isn\u2019t pressing, and I know I should take this chance to refactor the messy parts, make the code something I can be proud of\u2014clean, efficient, easy for my teammates to understand. But a notification pops up: the online candidate forum for my district is starting. I\u2019ve promised myself to be a better citizen, to stay informed, to participate, to give feedback that might actually matter. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. My team expects quality work, and I want to deliver. But my community expects engagement, and I want to be the kind of person who shows up. My mind races, torn between the satisfaction of perfecting my code and the responsibility of being present for my city\u2019s future. I hover between tabs, heart pounding, knowing I can\u2019t do both at once."}
