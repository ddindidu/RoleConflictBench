Dispatch had just reminded me of the importance of staying fit\u2014my duty as a police officer meant I needed to be in top shape, always ready to protect the community. But as I reached for my water bottle, another call came in. It was the producer from a major news network. They needed me, now, live on air, to counter a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019d been fighting for as an activist. My mind raced. The department expected me to prioritize my physical readiness, but the activist in me knew how crucial it was to seize this moment, to educate the public and defend the truth. I could feel the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded\u2014not from exercise, but from the impossible choice before me."}
