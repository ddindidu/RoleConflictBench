She hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t quite the shade I expected.\u201d My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to address her disappointment, listen carefully, and find a way to make things right. I could see she was nervous, maybe even regretting her choice to come here. I wanted to reassure her, to fix it, to make her feel beautiful and heard.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from a legal client. She was in trouble, needing immediate advice about a contract dispute that could cost her dearly. As her advocate, I was expected to respond quickly and accurately, to guide her through the next steps without delay.\n\nI felt torn, standing there with dye-stained gloves, caught between two people who needed me in completely different ways. My mind raced, weighing the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
