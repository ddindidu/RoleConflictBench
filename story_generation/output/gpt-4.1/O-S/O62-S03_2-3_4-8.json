Swim lessons were about to start, and I knew the kids would be at risk if the lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked. As a lifeguard, it was my job to keep the equipment in top shape, and I felt the pressure to fix it immediately. Just as I knelt to untangle the mess, the building alarms blared. Through the windows, I saw water rushing down the street\u2014flash-flood warning. My phone buzzed with emergency alerts, urging all citizens to evacuate and help neighbors if possible. I froze, torn. As a citizen, I was expected to follow public safety orders, maybe even check on the elderly couple next door. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t leave the pool in disarray, risking the safety of the kids about to arrive. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the pull of both responsibilities, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill them both at once."}
