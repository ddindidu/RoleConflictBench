My last delivery was a moderately valuable package, and the instructions were clear: I needed to get a signature from the recipient, no exceptions. I rang the doorbell, shifting my weight from foot to foot, hoping someone would answer quickly. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today. No late arrivals.\u201d I knew the roster was tight, and if I was late, it would put extra strain on the team. But as the minutes ticked by and no one came to the door, my anxiety grew. Should I wait longer and risk being late for my volunteer shift, or leave and fail to secure the delivery as required? The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, each demanding my full commitment, and I stood there, torn, unable to move forward without letting someone down."}
