I direct traffic, calm shaken drivers, and make sure everyone is safe. But as a citizen, I have my own life\u2014tonight, I\u2019d promised my friends we\u2019d play music together at my place, something we rarely get to do. The problem is, it\u2019s already late, and our building\u2019s quiet hours have started. My neighbor\u2019s windows are open, and I know she\u2019s sensitive to noise. I feel the weight of my badge and my responsibilities, but I also feel the pull of my personal life, my right to unwind and enjoy my home. I wrestle with the expectations: uphold the law and respect my neighbor\u2019s peace, or let myself relax after a long, stressful shift. The tension between my duty to others and my own needs gnaws at me as I stand at the accident scene, thinking about what I\u2019ll do when I finally get home."}
