My client was counting on me to catch any hidden traps\u2014especially the clause that could cost them millions if I missed it. The clock on my computer glared 4:50 p.m. I glanced at my phone: a reminder flashed, \u201cPolling station closes at 5:00 p.m.\u201d My civic duty tugged at me. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way of my voice this year. But the contract demanded my full attention; a single oversight could ruin my client. My heart pounded as I weighed the thick legal jargon against the ticking clock. If I left now, I might miss something crucial. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. Both roles pressed in on me, each demanding I put them first. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility I could bear to let down."}
