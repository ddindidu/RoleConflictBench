My shift as an air traffic controller is supposed to end in ten minutes, but I\u2019m still at the polling station, inching forward in a line that barely moves. My phone buzzes\u2014my relief is running late, and I\u2019m still technically on call. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cVoters with last names A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with B. The new line is longer, but the official\u2019s voice is firm. I know I\u2019m expected to follow instructions, but every minute here is a minute I\u2019m not at my post, ready to communicate with pilots. Just then, a message comes through: a cruising aircraft is requesting the routine altimeter setting. I\u2019m supposed to be there, headset on, providing clear instructions. My duty to the pilots is clear, but so is my responsibility as a voter to follow the rules. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the demands of the skies and the demands of democracy, my mind racing as I stand at the crossroads of my two roles."}
