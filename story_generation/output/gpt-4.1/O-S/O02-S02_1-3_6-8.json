The planning session was casual, and I knew the schedule could still shift, but my team relied on my input to keep things realistic. My phone buzzed insistently\u2014an unknown number. I excused myself and answered, only to hear the producer from a major news network. They needed me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. As an activist, I\u2019d always promised to be there when the community needed a voice, and this was the moment. But as an engineer, my team expected me to be present, focused, and reliable. I glanced back at the meeting room, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my colleagues and the urgent call to defend the truth."}
