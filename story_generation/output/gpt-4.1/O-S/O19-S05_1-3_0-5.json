The medication matched the label, and my hands moved automatically, counting pills, double-checking dosages. Accuracy was everything here\u2014one mistake could mean harm. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the trial starting in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client was depending on me; their future hung in the balance, and I was the one who knew the details of their case best.
