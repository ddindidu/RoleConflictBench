The hospital called twice already\u2014these supplies are urgent, and I know a delay could mean real trouble for someone inside. As a delivery person, I pride myself on being reliable, getting packages where they need to go, on time, every time. But as I turn onto Main Street, I spot the banner for the free vaccine clinic at the community center. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go today, do my part as a responsible citizen, especially with flu season looming. The line is already forming, and I know if I don\u2019t stop now, I might miss my chance. I also have my tax documents neatly organized at home, ready to file early, another way I try to contribute to the community. But right now, the clock is ticking for both the hospital and the clinic. My hands tighten on the steering wheel, heart pounding as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
