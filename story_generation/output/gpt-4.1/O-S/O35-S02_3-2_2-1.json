My heart pounds as I grip the radio, knowing protocol demands I report and halt the train immediately. Passengers\u2019 safety is in my hands; every second counts. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a reminder from my fellow activists: the protest march is starting now, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant. I can picture the crowd gathering, waiting for my voice to set the tone, to show them I\u2019m committed to the cause. I feel the weight of their expectations, the trust they\u2019ve placed in me to stand up for what\u2019s right. Yet here, in this cab, dozens of lives depend on my focus and swift action. My mind races, torn between duty and passion, responsibility and conviction. The train rumbles beneath me, the city\u2019s pulse echoing my own turmoil. I stare at the alert, then at my phone, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both need me\u2014right now."}
