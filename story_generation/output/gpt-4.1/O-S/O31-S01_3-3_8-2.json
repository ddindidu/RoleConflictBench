As a police officer, I knew my duty was clear: I had to testify, to uphold the law with integrity and fairness. The case was important, and my testimony could make a real difference. But then I glanced at my watch\u2014my volunteer shift started in less than an hour. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and I could already picture the line of people waiting outside, relying on me to open the doors and start the day\u2019s service. They counted on me to be there, on time, every time. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. If I missed court, I\u2019d be failing my duty as an officer. If I missed my shift, I\u2019d be letting down the people who needed help the most. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two promises I\u2019d made."}
