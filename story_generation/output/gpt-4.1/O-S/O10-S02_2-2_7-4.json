They wanted clarification on a confusing line item from last month\u2019s invoice, and I knew I needed to respond quickly and clearly\u2014my reputation as a reliable accountant depended on it. I started drafting a careful reply, double-checking the numbers, when my phone buzzed. It was a call from a legislative aide\u2014one I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks about the environmental bill I\u2019d been championing. She only had ten minutes to talk, right now, and this could be my only chance to make a real impact. My heart pounded. If I ignored the client, I risked damaging trust and professionalism. If I missed the call, I might lose the momentum for the policy change I cared so deeply about. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent needs of my clients and the pressing call to advocacy, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
