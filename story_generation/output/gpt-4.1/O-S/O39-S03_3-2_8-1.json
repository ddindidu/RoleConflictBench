As a construction laborer, I know the drill: stop everything, leave the site, and head straight to the muster point. No exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014protocols keep us safe, and the team depends on everyone following them. But as I hurry out, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder about tonight\u2019s music session at my place. I promised my friends we\u2019d play late, but the building\u2019s quiet hours start soon, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open. As a citizen, I\u2019m supposed to respect her right to peace and follow the building\u2019s rules. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014one demanding strict obedience for safety, the other asking for consideration and respect. My mind races, torn between the urgency of the evacuation and the looming conflict with my neighbor. I can feel the tension building inside me, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
