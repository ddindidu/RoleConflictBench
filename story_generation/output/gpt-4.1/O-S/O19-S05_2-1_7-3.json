As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay updated, and today\u2019s workshop on new prescription guidelines was something I\u2019d been looking forward to for weeks. My patients depended on me to give them the best advice, and missing this session could mean falling behind on crucial information. But as an advocate, I also had a responsibility to my client, who was waiting for me at the courthouse for a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but I knew every client deserved my full attention and effort, no matter how small the case. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the workshop, while my briefcase on the passenger seat reminded me of my legal duties. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My heart raced as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I sat there, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
