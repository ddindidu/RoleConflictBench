As an architect, I was expected to keep projects on track, and today I was reviewing timelines for the new community center. I glanced at the clock, noting that tasks were moving along, but I hadn\u2019t double-checked the contractor\u2019s latest updates. I told myself I\u2019d get to it soon. Then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polling place down the street would close in two hours. There was a ballot measure up for vote, one that could change the zoning laws on my own block. As a citizen, I knew I should go, cast my vote, maybe even talk to neighbors about the impact. But if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time on the project, and my team was counting on me to keep things moving. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my profession and my responsibility to my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in as the minutes ticked by."}
