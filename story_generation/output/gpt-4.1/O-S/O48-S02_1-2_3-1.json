My hands move automatically, but my mind is racing. The protest march is starting in less than ten minutes, and I promised to lead the first chant. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014messages from fellow activists, asking where I am. I can almost hear the crowd gathering, feel the energy building downtown. But here, in the quiet of the ward, I\u2019m expected to finish my rounds, record every temperature and pulse, and make sure each patient is safe and comfortable. The nurse in charge is counting on me; the patients trust me. Yet, my heart aches to be out there, standing up for what I believe in, lending my voice to the cause. I feel torn in two, pulled by the weight of responsibility in both worlds. My hands tremble as I jot down Mrs. Lee\u2019s numbers, the pressure mounting with every second that ticks by."}
