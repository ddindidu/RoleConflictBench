As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger, especially with the waves crashing harder than usual at high tide. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my responsibility. Then my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a gentle nudge to reorganize the first aid supplies in the storage shed, \u201cif time allows.\u201d I knew she expected me to follow through, to show initiative and reliability as a volunteer. But how could I leave my post, even for a few minutes, when the beach was this packed? My mind raced, torn between the duty to keep every swimmer safe and the desire to meet the coordinator\u2019s expectations. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the pull of responsibility and the urge to be dependable in every way."}
