The data from the latest experiment was still fresh in my mind, and I knew I should document every detail while it was clear. As a scientist, I prided myself on accuracy\u2014my supervisor always said, \u201cTimely notes make for reliable science.\u201d But the routine logs could technically wait; I\u2019d done it before without any real consequences. Still, the expectation to be thorough tugged at me.\n\nThen my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community kitchen. I was supposed to be there in fifteen minutes. Punctuality mattered, but I also knew the first half-hour was always slow, and the other volunteers could handle things if I was a bit late. Yet, I\u2019d promised myself and the coordinator I\u2019d be reliable, not just another name on the roster.\n\nI stood frozen, pen in hand, torn between the urge to finish my notes and the responsibility to show up for my shift. Both roles mattered to me, but right now, it felt impossible to do justice to both."}
