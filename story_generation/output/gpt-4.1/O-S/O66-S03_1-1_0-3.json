He mentioned he was heading to a casual lunch, no rush, just happy to be out on a sunny afternoon. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, but with no pressure, I could take my time, maybe even enjoy the drive. But as I waited at a red light, my phone buzzed with a notification from the city newsletter. The survey about new bus routes was open, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d give feedback\u2014after all, as a citizen, I wanted to help shape the city\u2019s future. The survey closed in an hour, and I knew this was my only chance between fares. My mind raced: should I pull over and quickly fill it out, risking the passenger\u2019s comfort and my professional standards? Or should I focus on the drive, letting my civic duty slide for now? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction as the light turned green."}
