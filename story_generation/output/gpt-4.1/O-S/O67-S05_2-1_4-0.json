As an ambulance driver, I was expected to be calm, efficient, and focused solely on the patient\u2019s immediate needs. But as I pulled up to the curb, I recognized the woman waiting\u2014Mrs. Carter, a client from my advocacy work. She looked at me with panic, not just from the pain, but from the fear of what this injury might mean for her job and insurance.\n\nAs I knelt beside her, she whispered, \u201cWill this affect my claim? What should I tell my employer?\u201d My hands worked to splint her arm, but my mind was torn. I was supposed to provide only medical care now, not legal advice. Yet, as her advocate, she expected clear, immediate answers. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding clinical detachment, the other empathy and guidance. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between the duty to treat her injury and the urge to reassure her with legal clarity. I hesitated, the words caught in my throat, unsure which role to let guide me."}
