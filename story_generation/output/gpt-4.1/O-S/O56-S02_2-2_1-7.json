She clutches her purse, eyes darting from the row of chairs to the mirrors, clearly unsure if she belongs. I know I should greet her, offer a warm smile, and help her feel at ease\u2014first impressions matter, especially for someone new. But my phone buzzes on the counter, a reminder that I\u2019m due on the radio in five minutes to talk about the community project I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The host is counting on me to educate listeners, to inspire action. My hands tremble as I glance between the nervous client and my phone. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. If I leave her waiting, she might feel unwelcome and never return. If I miss the radio segment, I let down my fellow activists and lose a rare chance to reach hundreds. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the comfort I owe this woman and the voice I owe my cause."}
