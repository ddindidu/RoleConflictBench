Mrs. Lee was waiting for me, her chart open, and I could see the expectation in her eyes\u2014she relied on me to keep her safe, to notice if something was wrong. Just as I wrapped the blood pressure cuff around her arm, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was marked urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service risked being shut down. I was supposed to drop everything and attend a briefing, follow the new guidelines to the letter. But I couldn\u2019t just leave my patients mid-round; their health depended on these checks. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patients and the responsibility to the volunteer program. Both roles demanded my full attention, both had consequences if I failed. I stood frozen, the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, unsure which path to take."}
