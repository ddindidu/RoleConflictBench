The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackles in my ear, reminding me of the patient\u2019s fragile state in the back\u2014every second counts, but so does every turn. I\u2019m supposed to drive safely, keep everyone alive, but the clock on the dashboard blinks 4:55. In five minutes, I\u2019m meant to be on air, live, sharing the truth about our cause, the one I\u2019ve poured my soul into. The community is counting on me to speak, to educate, to inspire action.
