The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew every number had to be perfect\u2014no errors, no delays. My supervisor\u2019s reminder email blinked on my screen: \u201cNeed those reports by 5 PM.\u201d I took a deep breath, ready to dive in, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the activist group chat: \u201cPolice are blocking exits at the protest. We need help coordinating a safe exit plan\u2014now.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. As an activist, I was expected to step up, to help keep everyone safe and calm, to organize and communicate quickly. But as an accountant, I was expected to stay put, focused, and precise, ensuring the company\u2019s financial integrity. I stared at the numbers, but my mind raced with images of friends in danger, voices calling for help. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice, as the clock ticked relentlessly forward."}
