An emergency diversion blared across my console, a passenger jet needing to cut through three sectors. I coordinated with my colleagues, voices tense, every second critical to keep the airspace safe. My mind raced, calculating altitudes, headings, and the ripple effect on other flights. In the midst of this, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the community center where I volunteer. One of the people I help wanted to talk, just to chat, they said. I answered, trying to sound calm, but my mind was split. As we talked, the conversation drifted toward their family, nothing sensitive, but I felt the weight of confidentiality. I was expected to be present, to listen, to respect their privacy. But my attention was divided, my thoughts still in the tower, juggling the lives in the sky. The demands of both roles pressed in, each expecting my full focus, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
