My volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes, but I still had a line of patients waiting for their prescriptions. I prided myself on being a meticulous pharmacist\u2014double-checking every label, ensuring every medication matched the doctor\u2019s orders. Today, a mother handed me a prescription for her child\u2019s cold. It was routine, but I knew mistakes could happen if I rushed. Still, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the kids at the center would be waiting for me, expecting me to help with their reading. Other volunteers could cover for me if I was late, but I hated letting people down. My supervisor at the pharmacy expected accuracy above all else, but the community center relied on my commitment too. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between my duty to my patients and my promise to the children. My hands hovered over the medication bottle, my mind racing as I weighed which responsibility should come first."}
