As a judge, I knew the gravity of my responsibility\u2014lives could be changed by my decision, and I owed it to everyone involved to review every detail with care. The expectation was clear: analyze the case files thoroughly, no shortcuts, no rushing. But today was also Election Day, and I had promised myself I would vote. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but now, with this urgent case, I felt the pressure mounting. I glanced at the clock again, calculating how long it would take to drive to the polls and back. My civic duty as a voter tugged at me\u2014I believed in participating, in making my voice heard. Yet, the weight of the case before me pressed down harder. I felt torn, my mind racing between the demands of justice and democracy, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting down one part of myself."}
