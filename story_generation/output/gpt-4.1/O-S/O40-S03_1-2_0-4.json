My shift as a carpenter started in fifteen minutes, and I still had to walk to the site. The foreman had been clear: safety protocols were non-negotiable, and being late meant rushing, which could lead to mistakes or even injuries. I prided myself on never cutting corners, always double-checking my gear and workspace before starting.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the online candidate forum for our district was streaming live right now. As a citizen, I believed in staying informed and participating in civic life. This election felt important, and I wanted to listen, maybe even submit a question about local infrastructure. I knew my voice mattered, and skipping the forum felt like neglecting my responsibility to the community.\n\nI stood in the doorway, torn. If I stayed to watch, I\u2019d risk being late and possibly compromising safety at work. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to engage as a citizen. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between duty to my job and duty to my community."}
