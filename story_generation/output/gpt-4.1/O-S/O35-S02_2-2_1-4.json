There\u2019s a delay up ahead\u2014nothing major, but enough to demand my full attention. I adjust the speed, careful not to jolt the passengers. My radio crackles, but it\u2019s my phone that vibrates insistently in my pocket. I glance down: a message from my activist group. The legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks is available to talk\u2014right now, for the next ten minutes only. My heart pounds. I know how crucial this call is; it could tip the scales for the bill we\u2019ve poured months into. But I\u2019m responsible for hundreds of lives at this moment, expected to keep the train safe and on time. My mind races, torn between the duty to my passengers and the cause I believe in. The seconds tick by, each one tightening the knot in my chest as I weigh the demands of both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t give my all to both at once."}
