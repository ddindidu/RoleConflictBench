He\u2019d mentioned he was just meeting a friend for coffee, no rush at all. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, but with no pressure, I could take my usual route. But ever since last night\u2019s volunteer briefing, my mind kept replaying the coordinator\u2019s words: \u201cWe need everyone to follow the new safety steps, no exceptions. Consistency keeps people safe.\u201d The new guidelines meant taking a detour around a busy intersection, even if it added a few minutes. As a volunteer, I\u2019d promised to set an example, even outside my shifts. But as a driver, I worried about annoying passengers with longer routes, especially when they expected efficiency. My hands tightened on the wheel. Should I stick to the direct route, or follow the new safety steps, even if it meant explaining myself and risking a complaint? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt caught between what I owed my passenger and what I owed my team."}
