Most callers were polite, and when they asked questions, I had the answers ready, neatly outlined in the script. It was routine, almost comforting. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer shift I\u2019d just finished, sorting files at the community clinic. The folders were thick with personal stories\u2014diagnoses, treatments, secrets that weren\u2019t mine to know. I\u2019d promised to keep everything confidential, to respect the trust placed in me.\n\nNow, as I spoke to a woman on the phone, she mentioned her recent hospital stay. My telemarketer instincts kicked in\u2014I could use this to tailor my pitch, maybe even close the sale. But the volunteer in me recoiled. I knew too much. Was I crossing a line if I referenced anything I\u2019d seen in those files, even unintentionally? The script said to connect, to empathize, to use what I knew. But the volunteer code demanded silence, respect, and restraint. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectations, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which voice to follow."}
