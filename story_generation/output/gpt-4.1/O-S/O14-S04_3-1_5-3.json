The journal\u2019s submission portal is open in another tab, the countdown to the deadline ticking away. As a scientist, I know I must double-check every figure, ensure the data is clean, and the conclusions are honest. My reputation\u2014and the integrity of the work\u2014depend on it. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: today is voting day. I promised myself I\u2019d go early, but I realize my ID is in my other bag, at home. I could fetch it later, but what if the lines are long, or I get caught up in revisions? The expectation to participate as a responsible citizen weighs on me, but so does the duty to report my research truthfully and on time. My mind races, torn between the lab and the polling station, between the demands of science and democracy. I stare at the screen, heart pounding, knowing I can\u2019t do both perfectly, and feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
