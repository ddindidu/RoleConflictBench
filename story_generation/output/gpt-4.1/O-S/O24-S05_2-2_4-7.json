As a judge, I was expected to craft a clear, thorough judgment\u2014findings of fact, conclusions of law, every word scrutinized by higher courts and the parties involved. The deadline loomed: thirty days to deliver justice in writing. Yet, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert. In less than an hour, I was due in another courtroom, this time as an advocate. My client\u2019s case was on the docket, and punctuality was not just professional courtesy\u2014it was their right to a fair hearing. I felt the pull from both sides: the duty to deliberate and articulate justice as a judge, and the obligation to stand, prepared and present, for my client as an advocate. My mind raced, torn between the silent demand of the unfinished judgment and the ticking clock counting down to my next appearance. The expectations clashed within me, each role demanding my full presence, neither willing to yield."}
