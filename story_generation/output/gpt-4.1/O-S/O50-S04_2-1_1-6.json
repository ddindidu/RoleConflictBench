The production manager\u2019s message flashed: \u201cMain unit down. Sensor errors again. Need you ASAP.\u201d I was already on my way, toolbox in hand, mind racing through possible causes\u2014faulty wiring, misaligned sensors, maybe a software glitch. Every minute the line was down cost the company money, and everyone expected me to fix it, fast.\n\nBut today was also election day. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t skip it, no matter what. I joined the line at the polling station, my badge still clipped to my shirt. The line was slow, but steady. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cVoters A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with H. The new line was longer, but the official insisted. \u201cPlease follow instructions, sir.\u201d\n\nI hesitated, torn. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the factory, letting down my team. If I left, I\u2019d be ignoring the official\u2019s directions, maybe even causing trouble at the polls. My phone buzzed again. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
