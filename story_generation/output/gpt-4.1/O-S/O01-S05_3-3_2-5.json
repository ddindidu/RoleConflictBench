As the architect overseeing the new high-rise hospital, I was expected to ensure every detail met the strictest safety codes. The city\u2019s inspectors would be relentless, and any oversight could mean disaster\u2014lives were at stake. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my client was in an hour. As their advocate, I was their voice, their hope. The outcome would shape their future, and they depended on my full attention and expertise in court. My mind raced between the hospital\u2019s fire escape routes and the legal arguments I needed to prepare. Both roles demanded everything from me, but there was only so much of me to give. I felt torn, anxiety gnawing at me, knowing that whichever path I chose, I risked failing someone who trusted me."}
