As an accountant, I knew I needed to reply to the vendor\u2019s automated payment confirmation\u2014our firm\u2019s policy was clear: every correspondence, no matter how routine, deserved a formal acknowledgment. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that professionalism was non-negotiable. But as I started drafting the email, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the weekly advocacy meeting was about to start. Attendance was mandatory, and punctuality was a matter of respect in the legal world. My colleagues would be waiting, expecting me to contribute to the case discussions.
