The subject line read: \u201cUrgent: Auditor Request.\u201d My heart skipped. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the importance of providing accurate, up-to-date financial records, especially with the external auditor breathing down our necks. I opened the files, fingers poised to compile the statements, when my phone buzzed with a different kind of urgency\u2014a message from my activist group. The state legislature was holding a surprise vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for. The outcome hinged on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a direct line to her office. My mind raced. The auditor expected the statements within the hour, but if I didn\u2019t call the representative now, the policy I believed in could be lost. I stared at the screen, torn between my duty to my profession and my commitment to my cause, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
