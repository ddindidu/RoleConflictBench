The data I could gather today would be crucial for my research, and I know my advisor expects me to be thorough and focused. But my phone buzzes again\u2014messages from fellow activists, reminding me that the protest march is about to start. They\u2019re counting on me to lead the first chant, to be the face at the front, rallying everyone together. I can hear the distant hum of voices gathering outside, the energy building. I know the experiment can wait; there are other slots, and missing this one won\u2019t derail my project. But I also know how important it is to keep momentum in the lab, to show commitment. My heart pounds as I weigh the sterile calm of the lab against the urgent call of the street. I feel pulled in two, the expectations of my colleagues and my cause pressing in from both sides, and I stand frozen, unable to move, caught between the world of data and the world of voices demanding change."}
