I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote today, but the afternoon had slipped away with errands and a last-minute shift. As I mentally mapped the quickest route to the polling station, a sudden commotion caught my eye. A child, small and panicked, was flailing in the deep end\u2014a spot strictly off-limits for kids. My training kicked in: safety first, always. I was expected to enforce the rules, to keep everyone safe, no exceptions. But the clock was ticking, and if I left even a minute late, I might miss my chance to vote\u2014a civic duty I took seriously. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the responsibility to protect lives right now, and the responsibility to have my voice heard for the future. The pressure of both roles pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I stood at the edge, torn between the pool and the polling booth."}
