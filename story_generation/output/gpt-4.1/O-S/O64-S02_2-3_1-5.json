My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, silently urging me to keep the line moving. Every beep of the scanner is a reminder: accuracy is everything, especially during the lunch rush. Suddenly, my phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014a message from my activist group. The state legislature is holding a surprise vote on the environmental bill we\u2019ve fought for all year. The outcome hangs on one undecided representative, and I\u2019m supposed to call now, add my voice to the flood of last-minute pleas. My hands tremble as I hand a customer their receipt. If I step away, the line will stall, my manager will be furious, and customers will complain. But if I stay, I\u2019ll miss the chance to make a difference on an issue I care about deeply. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stand frozen, torn between the register and the ringing phone in my pocket."}
