As a judge, I was expected to review every detail of the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order that had just landed on my desk. The attorneys were waiting, and the law demanded a swift, careful decision. My mind raced through the case files, searching for clarity, but a nagging thought kept intruding: today was also election day. As a voter, I was expected to bring valid identification to the polls, and I\u2019d just realized my driver\u2019s license was missing from my wallet. I could use another form of ID, but it was at home, a twenty-minute drive away. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014justice demanded my immediate attention, but so did my civic duty. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the legal arguments, but anxiety gnawed at me. Could I fulfill my responsibility to the court and still make it to the polls before they closed? The pressure of these conflicting expectations left me paralyzed, torn between the demands of the bench and the ballot box."}
