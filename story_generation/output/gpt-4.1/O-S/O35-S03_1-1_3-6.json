A passenger\u2019s voice, polite but insistent, asks for directions to the city library. I know I\u2019m expected to help, to keep the ride smooth and safe, and to answer questions as best I can. My hand hovers over the intercom button, ready to respond. But my mind drifts to the envelope of tax documents I organized last night, and the flyer I saw for the free vaccine clinic this weekend. As a citizen, I feel the weight of responsibility: pay my taxes on time, keep myself and others healthy, do my part for the community. The train rumbles on, and I feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I focus on the immediate needs of the passengers in my care, or make sure I don\u2019t miss the chance to get vaccinated and fulfill my civic duties? The expectations from both sides pull at me, and for a moment, I\u2019m caught between the two, unsure which role should come first."}
