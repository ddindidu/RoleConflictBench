The clock on the wall ticked steadily, but I tried to ignore it, focusing on her words, her loneliness. As a nursing assistant, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014how much she needed someone to listen, to simply be there. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen. A message from my activist group flashed: \u201cCritical vote in 45 minutes. We need you to call Rep. Harris now\u2014your story could sway the decision.\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d spent months fighting for this policy, organizing rallies, writing letters. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for. But Mrs. Greene\u2019s eyes searched mine, hoping for comfort, for presence. I felt torn in two\u2014needed here, needed there. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the quiet needs of one person and the urgent call to action for many."}
