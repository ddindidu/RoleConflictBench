The foreman said it\u2019d help us work better as a team, maybe even keep us safer. I knew the guys expected me to show up, to pull my weight and not slack off. But as I left the site that afternoon, the city was buzzing. A demonstration was swelling down Main Street, voices rising for a cause I believed in. I joined the crowd, feeling the energy, the unity. Suddenly, someone beside me nudged my arm, urging me to step past the barricade onto the city\u2019s restricted property. \u201cWe need to make them listen,\u201d he said. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew the law\u2014respecting public property, not crossing lines set for safety. But the pressure from the crowd was real, and I could feel the eyes of my fellow workers in my mind, expecting me to stand up for what\u2019s right. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
