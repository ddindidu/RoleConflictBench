He\u2019d told me there was no rush\u2014his meeting was casual, and he had time to spare. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but there was no pressure today. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my law office: the trial for my client was about to begin, and my presence was crucial. The outcome would shape my client\u2019s future, and as their advocate, I was expected to fight for them, to be there, prepared and focused. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014I checked the time on the dashboard, my passenger lounging in the back seat, chatting about his plans for a laid-back lunch. As a taxi driver, my job was simple today: drive safely, no need to rush, just get him to his meeting with time to spare. But my phone vibrated with a reminder\u2014my client\u2019s trial was starting soon, a case that could change the course of her life. As her advocate, I was expected to be in court, ready to defend her, to give her my full attention and expertise. My mind raced, torn between the calm duty of delivering my passenger and the urgent responsibility of standing by my client. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the impossible choice, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
