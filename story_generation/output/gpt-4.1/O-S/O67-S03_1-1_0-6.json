As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m always ready\u2014every second counts when a call comes in. The expectation is clear: drop everything, speed to the scene, save lives. But as a citizen, I have other duties. My tax documents are stacked neatly at home, waiting for me to double-check them before filing. The community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and I promised my neighbor I\u2019d help organize the line and hand out forms. I want to do my part, to be the kind of person who shows up for my community, not just in emergencies but in everyday ways too. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore the possibility that the radio will crackle to life at any moment, pulling me away. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014one demanding my constant readiness, the other asking for my steady, civic presence. I stare out the window, heart tugged in two directions, wondering how I can possibly be in both places when the time comes."}
