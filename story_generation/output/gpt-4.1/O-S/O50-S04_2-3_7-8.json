The operator was at it again, fiddling with the machine\u2019s settings despite my repeated instructions. Each wrong adjustment meant more wasted material, and my supervisor expected me to guide the staff, not just fix breakdowns. I opened my mouth to correct him, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the election. I had to get to the polling station before it closed.\n\nTen minutes later, I stood in line, heart pounding. The election official frowned at my ID. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form before we close\u2014in ten minutes.\u201d Her tone was firm, leaving no room for negotiation. I thought of the operator, probably making another costly mistake right now, and my supervisor\u2019s likely disappointment if I didn\u2019t return soon. But the official\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting compliance. My mind raced, torn between my duty to guide the operator and my responsibility as a voter. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt paralyzed, caught between two worlds demanding my presence."}
