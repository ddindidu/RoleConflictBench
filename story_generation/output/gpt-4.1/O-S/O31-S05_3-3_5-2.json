As a police officer, I was trained to act fast, to protect citizens and property above all else. The shouts grew louder\u2014someone was being attacked, and the crowd was panicking. My instincts screamed at me to intervene, to restore order and safety. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was my client, desperate for legal advice. As their advocate, I knew they depended on me for clear, immediate guidance; their future could hinge on my words in this very moment. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one demanding I run into danger, the other insisting I pause and provide counsel. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the chaos before me and the voice pleading for help on the line, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
