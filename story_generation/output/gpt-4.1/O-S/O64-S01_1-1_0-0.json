Only two customers stood in line, but Mrs. Patel, who always took her time, was unloading a cart full of groceries. As a cashier, I knew I was expected to process every transaction carefully, double-checking prices and making sure no mistakes slipped through. My manager had reminded me just last week how important accuracy was, especially during slow hours when we had time to be thorough.\n\nBut as I scanned each item, my mind kept drifting to the volunteer shift. I\u2019d promised to help with the after-school program, and even though I knew the other volunteers could cover for me if I was a little late, I hated the idea of letting them down. They counted on me to be reliable, to show up on time and ready to help. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014should I rush through the last transactions and risk making a mistake, or stay focused here and arrive late to the center? The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two places I was supposed to be."}
