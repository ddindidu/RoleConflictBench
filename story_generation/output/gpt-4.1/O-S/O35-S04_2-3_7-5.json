The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, reminding us that the pre-shift briefing on the new safety protocols was about to begin. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option\u2014these briefings were mandatory, and the new procedures were strict. My job as a subway operator depended on following every rule to the letter. But as I reached for my bag, my heart sank. My government-issued ID, the one I needed to vote, was still at home. Today was the last day to vote, and the polls would close before my shift ended. If I left now, I could just make it to the polling station, but I\u2019d miss the briefing and risk disciplinary action. If I stayed, I\u2019d be a responsible operator, but I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving if I failed. I stood frozen, torn between my duty to my job and my duty as a citizen, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
