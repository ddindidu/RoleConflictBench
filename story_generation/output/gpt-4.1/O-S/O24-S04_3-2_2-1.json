As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to weigh the facts with care and impartiality, especially when someone\u2019s safety might be at stake. The clock ticked louder than usual, reminding me that the polling station would close in less than two hours. I had promised myself I would vote today\u2014civic duty, a voice in the process, something I valued deeply. But the case file was thick, and the parties were waiting for my ruling. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to vote!\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two responsibilities pulling me in opposite directions. If I rushed the review, I might miss something crucial; if I left now, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the court. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the expectations of justice and citizenship, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully honor both at once."}
