As a construction laborer, I know the rules\u2014safety first, always. My supervisor expects me to keep the site clean and everyone alert. Suddenly, I spot Miguel, headphones in, about to step under a crane\u2019s swinging load. My heart leaps. I have to shout, now, to stop him. But my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s the activist group. The protest march is starting in five minutes, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, my voice rallying everyone for justice. They\u2019re counting on me to be there, to stand up and speak out. I glance at Miguel, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands tremble, torn between the urgent need to protect my coworker and the call to fight for change. The seconds stretch, my breath caught between two lives, each demanding all of me at once."}
