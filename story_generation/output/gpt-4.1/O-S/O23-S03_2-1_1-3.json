As a lawyer, I knew the filing deadline was looming, and my client was counting on me to catch every detail, every loophole. The pressure to be thorough pressed on my shoulders. Yet, as I reached for another document, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s bus route survey was closing soon. As a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself to be more involved, to give feedback that could improve our daily commutes. I glanced at the unopened newsletter, guilt gnawing at me. The city needed voices like mine, but my client needed my focus. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my profession and my responsibility to my community. The clock ticked, each second amplifying the tension inside me."}
