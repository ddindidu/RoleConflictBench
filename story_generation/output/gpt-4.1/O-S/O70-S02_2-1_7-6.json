The customer opens the door, frowning. \u201cWhere\u2019s my order? It\u2019s late,\u201d she snaps. I force a polite smile, remembering the company\u2019s training: always be courteous, always apologize. As I start to explain, my phone vibrates again\u2014this time, a notification from the activist group I help run. Our latest post about environmental justice is going viral, and my friends are urging me to jump into the comments now, when people are paying attention. I know this is the moment to educate, to answer questions, to make a difference. But the customer is waiting, tapping her foot, expecting my full attention and professionalism. My mind races, torn between the immediate demand to be the perfect delivery person and the urgent call to be the voice my cause needs right now. I feel the pressure mounting, my words catching in my throat as I try to balance both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t give either the attention they deserve."}
