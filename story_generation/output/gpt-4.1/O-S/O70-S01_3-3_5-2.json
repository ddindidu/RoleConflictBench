The high-value package sat on the seat beside me, its label marked \u201cHand Deliver\u2014ID Required.\u201d My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Confirm the recipient\u2019s identity, no exceptions.\u201d I pulled up to the address, but the recipient wasn\u2019t home. I called, left a message, and waited, watching the minutes slip away. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, some of them elderly and anxious for the warmth and company inside. I pictured their faces, the trust they placed in me to be there on time. \n\nI felt torn, pulled between my duty to deliver the package securely and my commitment to the people counting on me at the center. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
