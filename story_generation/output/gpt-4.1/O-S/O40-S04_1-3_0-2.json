The foreman had just reminded us that safety checks were non-negotiable, especially after last week\u2019s accident. As the team\u2019s carpenter, I was expected to be on site, tools ready, and every protocol followed. But today was election day, and the polling station was only open for ten more minutes. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote\u2014a civic duty I\u2019d promised myself never to neglect. My coworkers counted on me to set the safety example, but my community counted on me to have a say in its future. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on my chest. I could see the worksite, the sawdust swirling in the morning light, and I could picture the polling station, doors about to close. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my trade and my role as a citizen, feeling the minutes slip away."}
