As a judge, I know the defendant\u2019s fate hangs on my words\u2014I must draft a clear, detailed order for release, and every minute I delay, he remains in custody. My clerk waits, pen poised, eyes on me. But my phone vibrates urgently in my pocket. As an activist, I\u2019m responsible for the safety of dozens at the protest I helped organize. The police have started blocking exits, panic is rising, and I\u2019m needed to coordinate a safe, calm response. My mind races: the law demands precision and immediacy, but so does the safety of my fellow activists. I feel the weight of the robe on my shoulders, the echo of chants in my ears. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, yet both roles expect me to act now, to lead, to protect. My hands tremble over the keyboard, torn between justice in the courtroom and justice in the streets, knowing that whatever I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
