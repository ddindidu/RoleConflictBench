As a nursing assistant, I was supposed to help Mr. Lee get dressed after his surgery. He was waiting for me, his pain obvious, and I knew he needed my careful support to move safely. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that my client\u2019s court hearing was about to start. As their advocate, I was expected to be present, to argue their case with all the attention and care it deserved. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t split myself in two. Mr. Lee\u2019s anxious eyes met mine, silently pleading for help, while my mind raced with the details of the legal dispute I was supposed to represent. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. How could I choose between the immediate, physical needs of a vulnerable patient and the urgent, life-changing needs of a client depending on my advocacy? My hands trembled as I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, each expecting me to be their unwavering support."}
