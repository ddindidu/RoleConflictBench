A minor delay up ahead meant I had to adjust my speed\u2014slow enough to keep everyone safe, but not so much that I\u2019d throw off the entire schedule. The passengers depended on me to get them to work on time, and I felt the weight of their expectations with every rumble of the tracks.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the hearing I was supposed to attend as an advocate. My client\u2019s case wasn\u2019t high-stakes, but they still deserved my full attention and representation. I could picture them waiting, scanning the room for me, hoping I\u2019d show up and fight for them. The rules were clear: I couldn\u2019t leave the train, not even for a short while. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me\u2014how could I let my client down? My hands tightened on the controls as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the safety of hundreds and the trust of one."}
