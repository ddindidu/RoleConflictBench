Two minutes until the safety briefing. The foreman expects everyone there, no exceptions\u2014especially after last week\u2019s near-miss. I can\u2019t afford to let the team down or risk my job. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I see the reminder: minor hearing, courthouse, ten minutes. My client\u2019s case isn\u2019t high stakes, but they\u2019re counting on me to show up, to speak for them. I promised I\u2019d be there. My boots are caked with mud, my hands rough from hauling rebar, but my mind is already in the courtroom, rehearsing arguments. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my crew\u2019s trust, my client\u2019s hope. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the hard hats and the courtroom benches, knowing someone will be let down no matter what I choose."}
