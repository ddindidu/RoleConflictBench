My supervisor expected a full inventory report by the end of my shift, and I knew how important it was to keep everything stocked\u2014last time I missed something, the whole team had to scramble. As I double-checked the shelves, my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close at 8 p.m. sharp, and tonight is my only chance to vote. I reached into my bag for my ID, but it wasn\u2019t there\u2014I\u2019d left it at home, tucked in the drawer where I keep important documents. If I left now, I could just make it to my apartment, grab the ID, and get to the polling station before it closed. But if I left, the inventory wouldn\u2019t be finished, and I\u2019d let my team down. My heart pounded as I stared at the half-filled checklist, torn between my responsibility to my job and my duty as a citizen."}
