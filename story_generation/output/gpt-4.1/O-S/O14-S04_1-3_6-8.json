The maintenance checklist was due in half an hour, and as the lead scientist, I was expected to double-check every safety protocol, even if nothing seemed amiss. My team relied on me to keep the lab running smoothly and safely. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day, and I had promised myself I\u2019d vote. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told by an official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the station closed in ten minutes. I stared at the form, my mind racing. If I stayed, I might miss the lab\u2019s maintenance window, risking safety violations. If I left, I\u2019d forfeit my vote, betraying my civic duty. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility I owed more in this moment."}
