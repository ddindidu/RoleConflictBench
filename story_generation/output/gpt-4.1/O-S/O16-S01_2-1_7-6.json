Her autoimmune disease was flaring again, and she needed her medication adjusted\u2014something that required careful attention and precision. As her doctor, I knew the importance of getting this right; her health depended on it. My phone buzzed with a new email. It was from the volunteer coordinator at the clinic, reminding us that if we had a spare moment, we should reorganize the supply closet according to the new system she\u2019d outlined. I glanced at the clock. My shift as a volunteer was about to start, and the coordinator expected us to follow her instructions to keep things running smoothly.\n\nBut Mrs. Patel\u2019s case weighed on me. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I needed to double-check her treatment plan before moving on. Yet, as a volunteer, I was also expected to be a team player and help with the supplies. The two roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding my medical expertise and undivided attention, the other asking for my cooperation and willingness to pitch in. I felt the tension building inside, torn between my responsibility to my patient and my commitment to the volunteer team."}
