As a telemarketer, I was expected to take my breaks exactly as scheduled\u2014no sooner, no later. Management tracked every minute, and with the phone queue always full, any deviation was noticed. My headset buzzed with another call, but my mind was elsewhere. I was supposed to volunteer at the community center in fifteen minutes, and the coordinator had just emphasized new safety steps in our last briefing. She\u2019d made it clear: everyone had to follow the updated procedures, no exceptions. I knew if I left my desk even a few minutes early, my supervisor would see it in the logs. But if I arrived late at the center, I\u2019d miss the safety walkthrough and risk not being allowed to help. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the reliable employee, or the dependable volunteer. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
