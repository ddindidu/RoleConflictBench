My headset crackles as another prospect picks up. \u201cHello, this is Alex from BrightNet. Can I tell you about our new service?\u201d The man on the line immediately asks about upload speeds and data caps, questions my script only half-answers. I try to sound confident, but he\u2019s persistent, and I\u2019m supposed to handle every objection, keep him engaged, never admit uncertainty. My stomach knots. I\u2019m also watching the time because today is voting day, and I promised myself I\u2019d make my voice count.\n\nWhen my break finally comes, I rush to the polling station, only to be told my registration doesn\u2019t match. The official says I need to fill out a provisional ballot form, but the station closes in ten minutes. She\u2019s firm: follow every instruction, no shortcuts, or my vote won\u2019t count.

I feel torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding I do the right thing, right now."}
