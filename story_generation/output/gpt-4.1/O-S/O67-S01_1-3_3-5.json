As the ambulance driver, I knew how crucial it was to be prepared for any emergency\u2014lives depended on it. Just as I finished, my supervisor at the community center called me over. As a volunteer, I was trusted to sort confidential files\u2014medical histories of people we\u2019d helped. The expectation was clear: protect their privacy at all costs.\n\nBut as I sorted through the files, I noticed a familiar name\u2014someone I\u2019d just seen in the ambulance records, flagged for a severe allergy. The urge to double-check the first-aid kit for the right medication was overwhelming. Yet, I was bound by my volunteer role to keep this information private. My hands trembled as I held the file, torn between my duty to ensure the ambulance was ready for emergencies and my promise to respect confidentiality. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something the other forbade. I stood there, file in hand, heart pounding, caught between what I ought to do and what I must not do."}
