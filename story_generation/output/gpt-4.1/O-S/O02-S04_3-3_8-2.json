My phone buzzes: a reminder that the polling station closes at 6:00 p.m. I promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way. But the team is counting on me; if I don\u2019t deliver these numbers, the contract falls through, and everyone\u2019s work is at risk. My heart pounds as I picture the locked doors at the school gym, the ballot box just out of reach. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between my responsibility to my colleagues and my duty as a citizen. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding an answer I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
