As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to check and record her vital signs every few minutes. The nurse had stressed how critical her condition was tonight. I scribbled down her blood pressure, then remembered my friends were waiting for me. We\u2019d planned a late-evening jam session at my apartment, something I\u2019d been looking forward to all week. But the building\u2019s quiet hours started at 9, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always kept her windows open. As a citizen, I was expected to respect the rules and my neighbors\u2019 peace. The thought of letting my friends down tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to my patient and the law. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the simple joy of music, between my duty as a caregiver and my obligation as a considerate neighbor. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
