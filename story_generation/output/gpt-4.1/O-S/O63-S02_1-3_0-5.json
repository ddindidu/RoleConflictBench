Most callers today are easy\u2014just a few questions about the product, all covered in my script. I handle each objection with a calm assurance, ticking off names on my call list. But my phone buzzes with a text from my activist group: the crucial vote is happening now, and the undecided representative is taking calls for the next hour only. My heart pounds. I\u2019m expected to drop everything, to be the voice that tips the scale for the policy I\u2019ve fought for all year.
