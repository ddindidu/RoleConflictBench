As the accountant, I knew I needed to send a formal reply\u2014polite, precise, and timely. It was a small but important part of maintaining our professional relationships. But just as I began drafting my response, my phone buzzed with a message from a client. Their legal case had taken a sudden, complicated turn, and they needed my advice immediately. As their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, accurate guidance, to be present and thorough, especially now when the stakes were higher.\n\nMy mind raced. If I delayed the vendor reply, I risked appearing unprofessional and possibly jeopardizing future transactions. But if I didn\u2019t give the client my full attention, I could miss a crucial detail in their case, something that could cost them dearly. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate focus, each with its own set of expectations. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, feeling the tension build as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
