The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch any loopholes or hidden risks. Every clause demanded my full attention, but my mind kept drifting to the voter ID sitting in my apartment across town. I\u2019d misplaced it last week, and today was the only morning I could swing by home to grab it before the polls closed tomorrow. As a lawyer, I knew the importance of deadlines and the trust my client placed in me. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of my civic duty, the expectation that I would show up and have my voice heard. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the agreement, while another notification flashed about the election. I felt torn, anxiety tightening in my chest. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours of review. If I stayed, I risked being unable to vote. Both roles demanded my presence, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which responsibility I owed more in this moment."}
