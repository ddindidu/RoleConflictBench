My manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions. But as a citizen, I believed in fairness and treating people with respect. She looked desperate, explaining she\u2019d bought it for her elderly mother, who couldn\u2019t use it. I could see her hands trembling. I remembered my walk in the park that morning, pausing at the trash bin to pick up a stray cup someone had left behind. The sign said \u201cNo Littering,\u201d and I\u2019d felt a responsibility to keep the space clean for everyone. Now, behind the counter, I felt the same tug\u2014wanting to do what was right for the community, but also bound by the rules of my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the store\u2019s policy against my sense of compassion and civic duty, caught between the expectations of my role as a cashier and my values as a citizen."}
