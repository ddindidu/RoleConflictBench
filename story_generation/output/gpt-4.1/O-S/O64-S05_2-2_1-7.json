As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to process each transaction quickly and accurately, double-checking every price and coupon. My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over to me, silently urging me to keep the line moving. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I have a court session in less than thirty minutes. As an advocate, punctuality is non-negotiable; my client\u2019s case depends on my presence and preparation. I glance at the clock, my heart pounding. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my team and the customers who count on me to keep things running smoothly. If I stay, I risk missing the court session and jeopardizing my client\u2019s future. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I grip the register tighter, torn between the expectations of two worlds, knowing I can\u2019t satisfy both."}
