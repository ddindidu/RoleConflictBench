My volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there on time. They counted on me, but I knew the others could cover if I was a little late. Still, I hated letting people down. Suddenly, the radio crackled\u2014an emergency call, a car accident just a few blocks away. My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to respond immediately, no hesitation, no excuses. Every second mattered for the people waiting for help. But if I left now, I\u2019d definitely miss the start of my volunteer shift, and I\u2019d be breaking my word. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet promise I\u2019d made to the kitchen. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
