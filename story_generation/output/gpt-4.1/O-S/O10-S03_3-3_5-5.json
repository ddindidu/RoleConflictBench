My heart skipped. As the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m expected to respond to these notices immediately\u2014any delay could mean penalties or even an audit. I opened the attachment, scanning the details of the discrepancy, already calculating what documents I\u2019d need to gather and how long it would take to draft a response. \n\nBut then I glanced at my phone. A reminder flashed: the polling place for the ballot measure on our block closes in two hours. As a citizen, I believe in participating, in making my voice heard, especially on issues that directly affect my neighborhood. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this vote. \n\nMy mind raced. If I leave now, I risk missing the tax authority\u2019s deadline. If I stay, I forfeit my chance to vote on something that matters to me and my neighbors. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my immediate attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the pressure mount as the minutes ticked by."}
