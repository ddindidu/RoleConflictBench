Users can\u2019t log in.\u201d My heart raced as I opened my laptop, scanning error logs and tracing the outage to a bug I\u2019d introduced last week. The team was counting on me to fix it\u2014every minute meant more frustrated customers and mounting pressure from management. As I started debugging, my other phone rang. It was my legal client, her voice tight with anxiety. \u201cI need your advice now. The contract deadline is tonight, and I can\u2019t risk a mistake.\u201d She depended on me for clarity, for the kind of careful, thorough review that couldn\u2019t be rushed. My inbox filled with urgent pings from both sides: developers asking for updates, my client sending documents for review. I felt split in two, each role demanding my full attention, each crisis equally urgent. My mind raced, torn between the code that needed fixing and the legal advice that couldn\u2019t wait. I stared at my screens, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
