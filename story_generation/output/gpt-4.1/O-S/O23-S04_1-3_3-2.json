The courthouse is only a few blocks away, but so is the polling station. My client\u2019s procedural hearing is scheduled in fifteen minutes\u2014a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed. Still, I know my duty as a lawyer: to be present, to represent, to show my client that their case matters, no matter how small. But the polling station closes in ten minutes, and I haven\u2019t voted yet. Civic duty tugs at me; I believe in the process, in the power of a single vote. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it this year. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the court, while my mind races with the weight of both roles. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My client expects my presence; my country expects my participation. I stand in my office, keys in hand, torn between the courtroom and the ballot box, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
