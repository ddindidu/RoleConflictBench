As a doctor, I was expected to deliver news with clarity and compassion, to help families understand even the harshest realities. Today, I had to tell Mrs. Lee that her husband\u2019s prognosis was grim. Her eyes, red from crying, searched mine for hope I couldn\u2019t give. My words had to be gentle, yet honest\u2014she deserved nothing less.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently. As an advocate, I owed my client, Mr. Patel, timely and precise legal advice. His case had just taken a complicated turn, and he was waiting for my guidance. The law demanded accuracy and promptness; he trusted me to protect his interests.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Mrs. Lee needed my full attention and empathy, but Mr. Patel\u2019s situation couldn\u2019t wait. Both roles demanded my presence, my expertise, my care. I stared at the closed door, my mind racing, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
