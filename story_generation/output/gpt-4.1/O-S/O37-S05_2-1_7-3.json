As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol\u2014gloves, mask, disinfectant, the works. Lately, management had been stricter, and I\u2019d noticed some coworkers skipping steps. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t cut corners, even if it meant running late. But today, I was also due in courtroom 3B in twenty minutes, not as a cleaner, but as an advocate for a client at a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but my client still deserved my full attention and best effort. I glanced at my watch, feeling the pressure mount. If I rushed the cleaning, I could make it to the hearing on time, but I\u2019d be betraying my commitment to safety. If I stayed and did the job right, I\u2019d risk being late and letting my client down. My hands trembled as I rinsed the rag, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
