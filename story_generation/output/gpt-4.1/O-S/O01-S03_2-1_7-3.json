The project was already behind schedule, and every minute counted. My inbox pinged\u2014a reminder from the city about the public survey on bus routes. As a citizen, I always prided myself on being engaged, giving feedback to help shape our community. But the survey would take time, and I needed to review the site plans before the afternoon meeting. My mind raced: if I ignored the survey, I\u2019d be neglecting my civic duty, but if I paused my work, the project might slip further behind. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each important in its own way. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the responsibilities of my profession and my commitment to my city, feeling the tension rise as the minutes ticked by."}
