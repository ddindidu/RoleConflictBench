I nodded, already calculating the time and materials needed, knowing how much these little things matter to families. As I examined the damage, my phone buzzed. A message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist, flashed on the screen: \u201cWe\u2019re at City Hall now\u2014police are here. Can you come?\u201d I glanced at the clock. The protest was happening right now, and they needed more people to show solidarity. My hands hesitated over the toy. I could see Mrs. Patel watching me, waiting for a quote, her child\u2019s happiness in the balance. At the same time, I felt the pull of my activist heart, the urgency of standing up for what I believe in. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each important in its own way. My mind raced, torn between the quiet responsibility of my craft and the loud call of the street."}
