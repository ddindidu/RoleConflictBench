The lab\u2019s automated system was sending warning alerts\u2014something was wrong with the gas chromatograph, and if the leak detector was right, there could be a hazardous situation developing. My mind raced with the protocols I\u2019d drilled into my team: immediate shutdown, evacuation if necessary, safety above all. But here, in front of me, the poll worker was politely insisting I re-sign my ballot envelope. The signature had smudged, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, my vote might not count. I knew the rules\u2014no phones, no rushing, follow every instruction to the letter. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the ballot, but my thoughts kept darting back to the lab, to the safety of my colleagues, to the possibility of disaster. I felt torn in two, the weight of civic duty pressing against the urgent responsibility of my profession, both demanding my immediate attention, both unwilling to wait."}
