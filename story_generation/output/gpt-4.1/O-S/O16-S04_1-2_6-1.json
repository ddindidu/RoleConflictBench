My last patient of the day, a young woman with a sore throat and fever, sat across from me, anxiously awaiting my diagnosis. As her doctor, I knew I needed to take my time\u2014listen to her symptoms, examine her thoroughly, and prescribe the right medication. She deserved my full attention and care. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t ignore the ticking clock. Today was election day, and as a voter, I was determined to make my voice heard. The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had paperwork to finish before I could leave the clinic. My duty to my patient pulled me one way, demanding compassion and diligence, while my responsibility as a citizen tugged me in the other, urging me not to waste my chance to participate in democracy. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the patient in front of me, wrestling with the impossible choice between two roles that both mattered deeply to me."}
