My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding us that missing the sales target today meant no bonuses, maybe even penalties. I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to the polling station across town. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, convinced that my voice mattered. But every call I made was another minute lost, another chance to close a sale and help the team. My inbox pinged with urgent reminders from both the company and the election commission. I could almost feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the responsibility to my job, my team, my own paycheck, and the responsibility to my community, my country. My heart pounded as I stared at the list of leads and the clock ticking down, torn between dialing the next number and grabbing my coat to rush out the door."}
