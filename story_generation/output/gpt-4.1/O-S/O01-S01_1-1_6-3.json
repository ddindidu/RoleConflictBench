Today, while reviewing the progress of a new community center, I stopped by the site and chatted with the construction crew. Later, I headed to my volunteer shift at the local shelter. There, I found myself in a relaxed conversation with another volunteer about the new center. The talk drifted toward the people we were helping\u2014nothing sensitive, just general stories about the community\u2019s needs and how the new building might help.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a knot in my stomach. As an architect, I\u2019m expected to keep my projects on track and share updates, but as a volunteer, I\u2019m bound to respect the privacy of those we serve. Was I saying too much? Was I crossing a line by connecting my two worlds, even in a casual way? The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I hesitated, unsure whether to continue the conversation or pull back."}
