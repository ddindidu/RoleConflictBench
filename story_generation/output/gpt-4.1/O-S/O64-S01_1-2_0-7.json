As a cashier, I knew my job was to process each transaction quickly and accurately, making sure no mistakes slipped through. But my mind kept drifting back to the volunteer briefing I\u2019d attended that morning. The coordinator had emphasized new safety steps\u2014double-checking IDs for age-restricted items, sanitizing the counter after every customer, and pausing to explain the new bagging policy. We were told these steps were non-negotiable, and I felt the weight of that expectation pressing on me.\n\nNow, as I scanned a bottle of wine, I realized I hadn\u2019t asked for the customer\u2019s ID. The line behind her was growing, and I could feel their impatience. If I stopped to follow the new safety steps, I\u2019d slow everything down and risk complaints. But if I ignored them, I\u2019d be letting down the volunteer coordinator and the trust placed in me. My hands hesitated over the register, caught between the need for speed and the demand for thoroughness, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
