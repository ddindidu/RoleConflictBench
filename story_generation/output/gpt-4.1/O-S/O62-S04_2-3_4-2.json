My heart thudded as I spotted the broken lane rope floating in the water, its frayed end a hazard for the swim class starting in half an hour. As the lifeguard, I was expected to keep the pool safe and ready, and the supervisor had been clear\u2014equipment issues had to be fixed immediately. But as a citizen, I had promised myself I\u2019d vote today. The polling station\u2019s hours were strict; if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my chance. My mind raced, torn between my duty to the swimmers and my responsibility as a voter. I could already hear the disappointed voices of the swim instructor and the echo of my own conscience if I failed either role. I stood at the edge of the pool, keys in hand, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which way to turn."}
