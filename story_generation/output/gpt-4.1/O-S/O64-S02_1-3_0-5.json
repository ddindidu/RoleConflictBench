Only three customers wait, but I can feel their eyes on me, expecting quick, accurate service. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014an alert from the activist group. The message is urgent: the state legislature is holding a surprise vote on the environmental bill I\u2019ve spent months fighting for. The outcome hangs on one undecided representative, and the group needs me to call now, to share my story and urge a \u201cyes\u201d vote. My heart pounds. I glance at the line; Mrs. Patel is next, always friendly, but she hates waiting. My manager expects me to stay focused, no distractions, no phones. But the activist in me screams that this is the moment, the one chance to make a difference. I grip the scanner tighter, torn between the duty to my job and the cause I believe in, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
