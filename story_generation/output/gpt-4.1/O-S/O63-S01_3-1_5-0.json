My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe\u2019re just three sales short of the target. Every call counts.\u201d I could almost feel the weight of my team\u2019s hopes, the bonuses we\u2019d all been working toward for months. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised to be there on time, to help serve dinner, and I knew the staff counted on me to set an example. Still, I also knew that tonight, a few extra hands wouldn\u2019t make or break the shift; the other volunteers could cover until I arrived. My stomach twisted as I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent pressure to keep calling and the quiet responsibility waiting for me across town. I could hear the voices of my coworkers and the shelter staff in my head, each expecting me to put them first. My hand hovered over the phone, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which promise to keep."}
