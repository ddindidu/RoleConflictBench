The infection was aggressive\u2014without immediate, high-dose antibiotics, the outcome could be fatal. I knew what I had to do as a doctor: act fast, prescribe, and monitor. But my phone buzzed with urgent messages. The protest was starting in minutes, and as one of the lead organizers, I was expected to be at the front, megaphone in hand, rallying the crowd for justice. My friends and fellow activists were counting on me to set the tone, to show up as I always promised I would. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down\u2014my oath to heal, my commitment to fight for change. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the patient\u2019s life in my hands and the movement\u2019s momentum outside."}
