I checked the gauges\u2014pressure was dropping fast. If I didn\u2019t act, the water could turn unsafe for swimmers by afternoon. As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything running smoothly, and I know the risk if I ignore this. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the free vaccine clinic at the community center is this weekend, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go, not just for my health but as a responsible citizen. I\u2019d even set aside time to finish my taxes, wanting to do my part for the community. Now, I\u2019m torn. If I stay to fix the filtration system, I\u2019ll miss the clinic and delay my tax prep. If I leave, I risk the safety of everyone who comes to swim. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own consequences. I stand by the pool, heart pounding, caught between what I owe to my job and what I owe to my community."}
