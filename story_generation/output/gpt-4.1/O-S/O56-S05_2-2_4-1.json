My heart thudded with the familiar anxiety of wanting every client to leave happy, and I forced a gentle smile, ready to listen and fix whatever she disliked. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my legal client was waiting for a call. Her case had just taken a complicated turn, and she needed my advice now, not later. I could almost hear her voice, anxious and desperate for clarity, expecting me to untangle the legal mess she was in. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present, attentive, and reassuring in the salon, and the demand to be precise, focused, and available as an advocate. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the toner, my mind torn between the disappointed woman in my chair and the troubled client on the other end of the phone, both needing me in ways that felt impossible to reconcile."}
