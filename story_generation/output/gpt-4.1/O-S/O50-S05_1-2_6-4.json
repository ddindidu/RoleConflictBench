As a repairer, I was expected to be patient, to guide them through the basics\u2014how to check the oil, when to reset the system. Today, the client sounded anxious, asking for simple operating tips during our routine check-in. I could hear the uncertainty in their voice, and I wanted to reassure them, to make the machine less intimidating.\n\nBut as their advocate, I knew the stakes were higher. Their case was tangled in a legal dispute over faulty equipment, and every word I said could be scrutinized in court. If I gave advice now, it might be twisted later\u2014used to suggest the client was at fault, or that I\u2019d overstepped my role. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help and the need to protect their legal standing. The client waited on the line, expecting clarity, while I wrestled with the weight of both roles, caught in the tension between guidance and advocacy, unsure which voice should speak next."}
