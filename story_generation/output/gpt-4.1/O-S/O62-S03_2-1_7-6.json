As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the no-diving rule, to keep everyone safe, even if it meant being the \u201cbad guy.\u201d My supervisor had reminded me just this morning: \u201cNo exceptions, no matter who it is.\u201d But as a citizen, I also felt the weight of other responsibilities. My tax documents were finally organized, and I\u2019d planned to help at the free vaccine clinic this weekend\u2014something I believed was important for our community\u2019s health. The thought of missing the clinic gnawed at me, but right now, the immediate safety of these kids was in my hands. I could already hear their protests if I called them out, and I worried about being seen as overbearing. My mind raced, torn between the duty to enforce the rules and my desire to be a supportive, contributing member of the community. I hesitated, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of my two roles."}
