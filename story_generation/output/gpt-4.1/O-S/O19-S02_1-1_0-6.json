The label matches the medication, and I know accuracy is everything\u2014patients trust me with their health. My phone buzzes in my pocket, insistent. I glance at the screen: a notification from the activist group I help lead. Our latest post about affordable healthcare is going viral, and the group is urging me to add a comment now, while the momentum is hot. My heart pounds. I know how crucial this moment is\u2014if I speak up, I could educate thousands, maybe even sway public opinion. But the patient in front of me is waiting, expecting my full attention and expertise. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the demand for precision and care on one side, the call to action and advocacy on the other. My hands tremble slightly as I hold the prescription, torn between the immediate needs of my patient and the broader cause I believe in."}
