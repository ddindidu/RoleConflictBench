My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. I could feel his anxiety pressing on me, urging me to drive faster, to somehow beat the storm and get him to the airport on time. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and as quickly as possible, but the icy roads made every turn a risk.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a call from the network. They needed me\u2014now\u2014to go live and counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist: a chance to reach thousands, maybe millions, and set the record straight. But I was behind the wheel, responsible for my passenger\u2019s safety, and the airport was still miles away. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of both roles, feeling the impossible pull between duty and passion, between the person in my backseat and the cause I\u2019d devoted my life to."}
