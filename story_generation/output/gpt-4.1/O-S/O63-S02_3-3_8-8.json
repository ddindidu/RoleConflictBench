My telemarketing script glowed on the screen, and I knew the compliance system was tracking every moment. If I left my desk even a minute early, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d have to explain myself to my supervisor\u2014again. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was the local activist group. A major news network needed me on air, right now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for\u2014an opportunity to reach thousands, maybe millions, and set the record straight. But my break wasn\u2019t for another ten minutes. If I left now, I\u2019d risk disciplinary action, maybe even my job. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the urgent call to speak out for what I believed in."}
