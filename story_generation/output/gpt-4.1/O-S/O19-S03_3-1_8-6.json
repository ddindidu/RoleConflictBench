As a pharmacist, I\u2019d registered months ago for the national continuing education program\u2014an intensive weekend of seminars, the only way to keep my license and stay sharp on new treatments. My manager and colleagues expected me to bring back insights, and I knew my patients deserved the best care I could offer. But as a citizen, I felt another pull. The community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers were needed. I\u2019d already organized my tax documents, ready to file early, but this was different. The city\u2019s public health team was short-staffed, and neighbors were counting on people like me to help. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cWe all have a duty to our community.\u201d The two roles clashed in my mind\u2014professional growth versus civic responsibility. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, torn between the pharmacist who must stay current and the citizen who must step up in a time of need."}
