The client wanted open, collaborative spaces, but the employees needed quiet corners for focus. I\u2019d spent days balancing these needs, and now, with the deadline looming, every detail felt urgent. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the court session in an hour. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t be late; my client\u2019s case depended on my presence and preparation. But the floor plan still needed revisions, and the client\u2019s feedback was due by the end of the day. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to deliver a functional, thoughtful design and the duty to stand up for my client in court. Each role demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
