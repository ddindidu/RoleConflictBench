The clock on the wall ticks louder with every passing second. As a judge, I know I must review every detail, every argument, to ensure a fair hearing. The parties have worked for months, and my preparation could make all the difference. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. As a voter, I believe in participating, in making my voice heard. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election. My heart pounds as I glance between the thick stack of papers and the clock. If I leave now, I\u2019ll barely make it. If I stay, I\u2019ll be ready for court, but my vote will be lost. The weight of both responsibilities presses down on me, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. I grip my pen tighter, torn between duty to justice and duty to democracy, feeling the minutes slip away."}
