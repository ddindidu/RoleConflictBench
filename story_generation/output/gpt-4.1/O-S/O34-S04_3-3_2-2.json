My headset crackled with anxious pilots\u2019 voices, each one relying on me to keep them safe as the sudden route closure forced everyone into tight holding stacks. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo mistakes, not even under pressure.\u201d I wiped sweat from my brow, eyes darting between the screen and the clock. Seven minutes left until the polling station closed. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, determined to have my say, but the minutes were slipping away. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPolling station closes soon!\u201d I felt the weight of civic duty pressing on me, the expectation that I\u2019d show up, participate, be counted.
