My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything\u2014no mistakes.\u201d I glance at the clock. The polling station closes in ten minutes, and if I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. But if I abandon my post, the line will stall, tempers will flare, and my coworkers will be left scrambling. My civic duty tugs at me\u2014I\u2019ve always believed voting matters, that my voice counts. Yet, here I am, hands trembling, caught between the responsibility to my job and the responsibility to my country. Each beep of the scanner feels heavier, the seconds slipping away. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles presses down on me, demanding I choose."}
