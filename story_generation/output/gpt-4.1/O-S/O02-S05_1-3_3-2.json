As an engineer, I knew the upcoming safety audit was months away, but the documentation needed careful updates to ensure we met every regulation. My manager expected nothing less than perfection\u2014no shortcuts, no oversights. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from a client. As their advocate, I was their lifeline; they faced a sudden legal crisis and needed my guidance now. They trusted me to interpret the regulations and give them advice they could act on immediately. My mind raced. If I focused on the audit prep, I\u2019d delay the client\u2019s urgent needs. If I prioritized the client, I risked missing critical details in the compliance paperwork. Both roles demanded my full attention, and both had real consequences for people who depended on me. My chest tightened as I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
