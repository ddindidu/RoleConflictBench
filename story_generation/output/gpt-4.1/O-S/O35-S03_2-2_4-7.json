Protocol is clear\u2014stop the train at the next station, alert security, and keep everyone calm. My heart pounds as I picture the anxious faces behind me, all depending on my steady hand and quick thinking. But as a citizen, my mind drifts to my elderly neighbor, Mrs. Kim, who lives alone on my floor. The city\u2019s heat advisory blares in my memory; she\u2019s frail, and I promised to check on her today. I imagine her apartment, stifling and silent, and guilt gnaws at me. The train slows, and I grip the controls, torn between my duty to hundreds of strangers and my responsibility to one vulnerable neighbor. The weight of both roles presses down, each demanding my presence, each with its own stakes. I stare at the emergency brake, my thoughts a tangle of fear, obligation, and helplessness, caught between the tracks and the hallway just a few floors above my own."}
