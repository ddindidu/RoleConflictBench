The critical service was buckling under load, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged this morning. My team was counting on me to fix it\u2014fast. I knew I had to write clean, maintainable code, not just a quick patch, or we\u2019d be in the same mess tomorrow. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was Election Day, and the polling station would close in fifteen minutes. I rushed over, only to be told by the official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014right now, before the doors closed in ten minutes. My mind raced. My team needed me online, but my civic duty was right here, in my hands. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet the expectations of either role at this moment."}
