My shift as a subway operator had just ended, and I rushed to the polling station, determined to cast my vote before closing. As I handed over my ID, the election official frowned, explaining a registration mismatch. I\u2019d have to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station would close in ten minutes. My hands shook as I took the form, but just then, my phone buzzed\u2014an emergency alert from the subway control room. A passenger had collapsed on my train, and the emergency alarm was blaring. Protocol demanded I return immediately to assist, ensuring passenger safety. But the official was waiting, pen in hand, expecting me to complete the paperwork now or lose my chance to vote. I felt torn in two, the weight of civic duty pressing against my responsibility for the passengers who might need me. My mind raced, caught between the urgent call of my job and the once-a-year chance to have my voice heard."}
