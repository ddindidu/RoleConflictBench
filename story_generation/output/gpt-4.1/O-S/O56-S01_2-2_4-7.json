She was a first-time visitor, and I could see her lips press into a thin line as she studied her reflection. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d I asked, my heart thumping. She hesitated, then admitted the colour was a bit too warm for her liking. My mind raced with ways to fix it, knowing how important it was to make a good impression and ensure she left happy. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. I was due at the community centre in twenty minutes, and today, we were supposed to implement new safety steps. The coordinator had stressed how crucial it was for everyone to follow the updated guidelines without exception. I felt torn, caught between wanting to address my client\u2019s concerns thoroughly and not wanting to let down the volunteer team by arriving late or unprepared. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, scissors in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
