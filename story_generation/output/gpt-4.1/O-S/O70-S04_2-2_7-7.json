Just as I pulled up to the next stop, my phone rang\u2014another customer, anxious about their order, wanting a precise update. I took a deep breath, remembering the company\u2019s training: always be polite, always be professional, no matter how stressed or behind schedule I felt. I answered, trying to keep my tone calm and helpful, even as my mind raced ahead to the next delivery.\n\nBut today was also Election Day, and I had squeezed in a quick stop at the polling station between deliveries. As I handed over my ballot, the poll worker frowned and pointed out a smudge on the envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to re-sign this so your vote counts,\u201d she said, her voice firm. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of my delivery schedule and the customer still waiting for an answer. I knew I was expected to follow every instruction at the polls, but my job demanded I keep moving and respond quickly. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the expectations of my two worlds, unsure which to prioritize."}
