It was a reminder from the community center: my volunteer shift started in an hour, and the coordinator\u2019s message was clear\u2014no late arrivals, not today. I glanced at the splintered wood beneath my hands, thinking of Mrs. Lee\u2019s anxious face when she\u2019d shown me the damage. She needed her deck safe for her grandkids, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d finish by the afternoon. But the job was taking longer than I\u2019d planned; the rot had spread deeper than I thought. My toolbox was open, sawdust in my hair, sweat on my brow, and I could already picture the line of people waiting at the center, counting on me to help open the doors. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by the trust of a homeowner, the other by the commitment I\u2019d made to my community. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
