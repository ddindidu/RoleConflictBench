Mrs. Lee sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. She was anxious, and I knew I needed to walk her through every medication\u2014her new blood thinner, the diabetes pills, the heart medicine. One wrong combination could land her in the hospital. I started explaining, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in fifteen minutes. I remembered the election official\u2019s stern words earlier\u2014because of a registration issue, I\u2019d need to fill out a provisional ballot, and it had to be done before closing. \n\nI tried to focus on Mrs. Lee, but my mind raced. As a pharmacist, I owed her my full attention; her safety depended on it. But as a citizen, I had a duty to vote, and the official had been clear\u2014no exceptions, no late forms. My hands trembled as I handed Mrs. Lee an information leaflet, torn between the trust she placed in me and the civic responsibility waiting just down the street. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give."}
