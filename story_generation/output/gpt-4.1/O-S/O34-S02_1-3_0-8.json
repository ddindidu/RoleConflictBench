The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the sky. I savor the calm, knowing my job is to keep these skies safe, to be vigilant even when the world is asleep. Suddenly, my phone vibrates. It\u2019s the media liaison from my activist group\u2014breathless, urgent. A major network is airing a story that twists our cause, and they want me on air, now, to set the record straight. My heart pounds. I know how much this matters; the public needs the truth, and my voice could make a difference. But I glance at the console\u2014my headset crackles with a pilot\u2019s routine check-in. Even in this lull, I can\u2019t abandon my post. The expectation is clear: I must be here, alert, ready for anything. Yet the activist in me aches to answer the call, to fight misinformation before it spreads. I stare at the blinking lights, torn between duty to the skies and duty to my cause, feeling the weight of both pressing in, demanding I choose."}
