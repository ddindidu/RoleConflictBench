My script urged me to stay calm, answer every objection, and keep him on the line. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Address every concern.\u201d But as I tried to reassure Mr. Jenkins, my mind wandered to the envelope of tax documents waiting on my kitchen table\u2014organized, but not yet filed. The community center\u2019s vaccine clinic was this weekend, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go, do my part for public health. The pressure built inside me: the company needed me to be the perfect telemarketer, but my conscience nagged at me to be a responsible citizen. I felt torn, my words to Mr. Jenkins faltering as I wrestled with the demands of both roles, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
