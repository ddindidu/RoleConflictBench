The shift is steady, but I know the routine can change in a heartbeat. An aircraft is approaching the sector boundary, and I need to coordinate with the next controller to ensure a seamless handoff. My headset crackles with updates, and I prepare to make the call. Just then, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey on bus routes closes in ten minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d participate\u2014being an engaged citizen matters to me, and I know my feedback could help improve public transit for everyone. But the timing couldn\u2019t be worse.
