As a lifeguard, I was trained to never let my attention waver, to watch every swimmer, especially the kids who sometimes drifted toward the deep end. Today, the pool was busy but calm\u2014just a few swimmers edging a little too far, nothing urgent. Then, as a volunteer at the check-in table, a woman approached, her voice low. She hesitated, then confided a personal concern, her eyes pleading for understanding and privacy. I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would keep her words confidential. But my gaze kept flicking to the water, heart pounding with the fear that I might miss something critical. I was torn\u2014should I give her my full attention, honoring her need for privacy, or keep my eyes on the pool, ready to act if a swimmer needed help? The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the tension rising, caught between two responsibilities I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
