As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break at the scheduled time, but today the call volume was unusually light. My supervisor had even mentioned we could be flexible with our breaks. I felt a rare sense of freedom, but it was tinged with anxiety. Today was also election day, and I needed to get to the polling station before it closed. The polls were open all day, and my workload was manageable, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was being pulled in two directions. If I took my break now, I could vote and return without disrupting my calls. But what if the call volume suddenly spiked? Would my supervisor still be as understanding? I wanted to fulfill my civic duty, but I also didn\u2019t want to risk being seen as unreliable at work. My mind raced, weighing the expectations of my job against my responsibility as a voter, feeling the pressure build as I tried to decide what to do next."}
