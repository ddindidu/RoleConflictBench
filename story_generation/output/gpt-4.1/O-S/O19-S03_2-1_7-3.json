My mind raced to keep up, knowing how important it was to stay current for my patients\u2019 safety. Every detail mattered\u2014one missed update could mean a counseling error. But as I scribbled notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s bus route survey was closing soon. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, knowing how much public transit changes affect my neighbors and me. As a citizen, I felt responsible to give feedback, to help shape decisions that impact our daily lives. Yet, the workshop was intense, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss a single point. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my duty to my profession pulling me one way, my responsibility as a citizen tugging the other. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need to absorb every word from the speaker and the equally pressing call to contribute to my community\u2019s future."}
