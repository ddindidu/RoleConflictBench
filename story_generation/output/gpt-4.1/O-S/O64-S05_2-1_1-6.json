The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. As a cashier, I know the expectation: keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays. My manager glances over, silently urging me to pick up the pace. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the advocacy meeting I\u2019m supposed to attend in fifteen minutes. As an advocate, punctuality is non-negotiable; my presence is needed to support a client\u2019s case, and missing the meeting could mean letting someone down. I feel the pressure mounting, sweat prickling at my neck. Every beep of the scanner is a countdown, every sigh from the line a reminder of my responsibility here.
