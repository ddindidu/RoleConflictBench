I glanced at the flashing red light\u2014an ominous warning of a possible chemical leak. As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, I was responsible for the safety of everyone in the building. My mind raced through the protocols: shut down the system, evacuate, call maintenance. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the trial for my client was about to begin. As their advocate, I was their last hope, the one who knew the intricacies of their case and could argue for their future. The judge would not tolerate delays, and my client\u2019s fate hung in the balance. My heart pounded as I stared at the lab door, then at my laptop with the court link open. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my undivided attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice between duty and duty, knowing that whatever I did next would mean letting someone down."}
