They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t been briefed on the safety protocols. As the machine repairer, I knew it was my job to step in, explain the risks, and make sure they understood how to operate it safely. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the music night I\u2019d promised my friends. We\u2019d planned to play in my apartment, but it was already late, and the building\u2019s quiet hours had started. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always kept her windows open, and I knew she valued her peace. I felt torn\u2014should I stay and guide the staff, risking being late and possibly disturbing the neighbors with our music, or rush home to keep my promise and respect the building rules? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, caught between what I owed to my job and what I owed to my community."}
