As a lawyer, I knew I should review every clause, analyze the fine print, and ensure nothing slipped through the cracks\u2014even if the deadline was weeks away. My client trusted me to catch what they couldn\u2019t see. But as I scrolled through the document, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the court session for another client was in less than an hour. As their advocate, I was expected to be there, prepared and punctual, ready to defend their interests in front of the judge. My mind raced, torn between the meticulous review the contract deserved and the urgency of the courtroom. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding thoroughness and patience, the other requiring immediate action and presence. My heart pounded as I glanced between the contract and the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both clients what they expected at the same time."}
