As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays. My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over every beep and bag. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from a client. She\u2019s frantic, facing an urgent legal deadline, and she needs my advice now. As her advocate, I owe her clarity and precision, not rushed answers between transactions. My heart pounds as I glance at the growing queue, then at the message lighting up my screen. I can\u2019t ignore her, but I can\u2019t abandon my register either. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of mistakes. I feel split in two, torn between the expectations of my job and the trust of someone counting on me. The next customer steps forward, and my phone buzzes again."}
