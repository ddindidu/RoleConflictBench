My foreman\u2019s voice booms, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d I know the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder that the polling station closes in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I\u2019d make my voice count. The station is just down the street, but if I leave the site without checking in at the muster point, I\u2019ll be breaking protocol, risking my job and the trust of my crew. My heart pounds as I glance at the exit, then at the gathering workers. The weight of responsibility presses on me from both sides\u2014my duty to my team, and my duty as a citizen. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demand I act now. My hands tremble as I try to decide which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
