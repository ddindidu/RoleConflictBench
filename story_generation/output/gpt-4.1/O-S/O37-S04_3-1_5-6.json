The client\u2019s note was clear: only use the specialized product for the antique floors. I was supposed to manage supplies, but I hadn\u2019t noticed how low it was last week. Now, I\u2019d have to figure out how to finish the job without breaking the rules or disappointing the client. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about voting. I rushed to the polling station, still thinking about the missing cleaner. At the entrance, an official called out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line was longer and slower, but the instructions were clear. I hesitated, torn between following the official\u2019s directions and my urge to get back to the client\u2019s house quickly to sort out the cleaning supply problem. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with its own rules I was expected to follow."}
