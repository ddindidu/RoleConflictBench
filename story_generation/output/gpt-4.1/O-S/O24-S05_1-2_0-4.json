As a judge, I was expected to review the newly delivered case file for a procedural hearing\u2014just a routine matter, but the expectation was clear: I must analyze every detail, no matter how minor, before the hearing in two weeks. Yet, as an advocate, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from my client, whose case was far from routine. Their dispute was complex, the stakes high, and they depended on me to prepare a compelling argument and anticipate every move from the opposing counsel.\n\nI glanced at the judge\u2019s file, feeling the pressure to uphold impartiality and diligence. But my client\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of my duty to fight for their interests. The clock ticked, and I felt torn\u2014if I focused on the judge\u2019s file, I might let my client down; if I poured my energy into advocacy, I risked neglecting my judicial responsibilities. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I tried to reconcile the impossible demands of both roles, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left wanting."}
