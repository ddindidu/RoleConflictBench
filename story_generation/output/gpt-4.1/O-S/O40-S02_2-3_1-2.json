The protest I\u2019d helped organize was suddenly surrounded by police, exits blocked. My heart pounded. As a carpenter, I knew the importance of order and safety\u2014one stray nail, one cluttered path, and someone could get hurt. My boss expected nothing less than a spotless, hazard-free site. But as an activist, people were counting on me to help them stay calm and safe, to coordinate a peaceful response and prevent panic. I glanced at the half-finished shelving unit, the scattered screws, the broom in my hand. If I left now, the site would be a mess, a risk to anyone who walked through. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down the people who trusted me to help them in a tense, dangerous moment. My mind raced, torn between the order of my workshop and the chaos outside, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
