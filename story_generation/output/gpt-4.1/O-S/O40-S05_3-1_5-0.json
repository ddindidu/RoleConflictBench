Tomorrow, I\u2019m expected to lead the team, and I need to be sure I\u2019ve read every technical detail, every measurement, every note. But my phone keeps buzzing\u2014messages from a client who\u2019s anxious about their upcoming hearing. As an advocate, I know I should call them back, offer reassurance, and explain the legal process in terms they can understand. They\u2019re counting on me for clarity and support, and I can hear the worry in their texts.\n\nI stare at the blueprints, trying to focus on the joinery details, but my mind drifts to the client\u2019s case. If I ignore them, I risk letting them down when they need me most. If I put off the blueprints, I might miss a crucial detail and jeopardize tomorrow\u2019s build. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014one demanding precision and preparation, the other empathy and guidance. I feel torn, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be falling short of someone\u2019s expectations."}
