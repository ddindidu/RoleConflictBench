Today, the atmospheric conditions were perfect\u2014something that happened maybe once a year. My experiment, months in the making, depended on this rare alignment. If I missed it, the data would be incomplete, and with the funding review looming, my research could stall for another year. But my phone buzzed, reminding me of my other commitment: a minor court hearing for a client. The case wasn\u2019t high-stakes, but my client was anxious, counting on me to be there. As a scientist, I felt the weight of discovery and the pressure to deliver results. As an advocate, I knew the importance of trust and representation, no matter how small the case. My mind raced, torn between the lab and the courtroom, between the pursuit of knowledge and the promise I\u2019d made. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
