As an engineer, I was supposed to be brainstorming new approaches for our project, but the meeting was dragging on, with everyone tossing out ideas and debating possibilities. My manager expected me to contribute, to help shape the technical direction, even though we all knew nothing had to be finalized today. Still, I felt the pressure to be present, to show initiative.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in twenty minutes. The coordinator had sent a message earlier, stressing how important it was for everyone to be on time\u2014there weren\u2019t enough hands, and the doors would open right at noon. I could picture the line of people waiting, counting on us.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a committed engineer and the responsibility I felt as a volunteer. If I left the meeting early, would my team think I wasn\u2019t dedicated? If I stayed, would I let down the people who needed me at the shelter? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
