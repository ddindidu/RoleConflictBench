My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Keep them running, no matter what.\u201d I knew if I didn\u2019t act now, we risked a costly breakdown, maybe even a fire.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was the media liaison from the activist group. \u201cA major network needs you on air now. They\u2019re spreading misinformation about our cause.
