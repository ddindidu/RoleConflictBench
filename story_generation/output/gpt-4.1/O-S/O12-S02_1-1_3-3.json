As a software developer, I knew these sessions were where new ideas took root, and my team valued my input. Even if attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory, I felt a responsibility to show up, collaborate, and help shape the next big feature. But just as I was about to RSVP, a notification popped up from my activist group: the petition to our state senator was closing in an hour, and this was my last chance to add my name. I\u2019d spent weeks rallying support for this cause, urging others to take action. Now, when it mattered most, I was torn. If I signed the petition, I\u2019d have to step away from the session, risking missing out on key discussions and letting my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the opportunity to stand up for what I believed in. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations on both sides, feeling the pressure mount with every passing minute."}
