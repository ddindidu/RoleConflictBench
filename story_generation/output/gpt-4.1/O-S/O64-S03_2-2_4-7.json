A woman approached, clutching a faded box fan and explaining she\u2019d lost her receipt but needed to return it\u2014the fan barely worked, and today\u2019s heat was dangerous. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager watched from the office window, expecting me to enforce the rules. But as she spoke, I remembered the heat advisory blaring on my phone this morning and thought of Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor who lived alone in our building. She\u2019d mentioned her fan broke, too, and I\u2019d promised to check on her after my shift. As a cashier, I was supposed to follow the policy, no exceptions. As a citizen, I felt responsible for the vulnerable in my community, especially on a day like this. My hands hovered over the register keys, heart pounding, torn between the rules I was paid to uphold and the duty I felt to help someone in need."}
