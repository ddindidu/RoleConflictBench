It was the last day of the quarter, and I was three sales short of my target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no bonus, maybe even penalties, if we didn\u2019t make it. I dialed again, voice tight with urgency, when the building alarm blared, shrill and insistent. Through the window, I saw water swirling at the curb, rising fast. The city\u2019s emergency alert flashed on my phone: evacuate immediately, help neighbors if possible. My heart pounded. As a citizen, I knew I should check on Mrs. Lee next door, who lived alone and moved slowly. But as a telemarketer, I needed every second to close those last deals. The office buzzed with panic and ringing phones. I gripped the receiver, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility to my community, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
