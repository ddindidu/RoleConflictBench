I force a smile as the next customer slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about the wait. I nod, apologize, and scan her groceries, trying to keep my tone light and my hands steady. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her text urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. Can you come?\u201d I glance at the clock. My shift isn\u2019t over for another two hours, and the store manager is watching us all like a hawk. I know the protest is important; we\u2019ve been planning it for weeks, and every person counts. But right now, I\u2019m expected to be the calm, friendly cashier, smoothing over tempers and keeping the line moving. My heart pounds as I ring up the next customer, torn between the demands of my job and the call to stand up for what I believe in."}
