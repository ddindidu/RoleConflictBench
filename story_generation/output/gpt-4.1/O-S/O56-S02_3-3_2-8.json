I put on my warmest smile, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, and promising everything would run smoothly for the big day. My hands moved automatically, sectioning hair and chatting about veils and flowers, but my phone vibrated insistently in my pocket. I glanced down\u2014an urgent message from the network. They needed me live, now, to set the record straight on the cause I\u2019d poured my heart into. My mind raced. The bride\u2019s mother was watching me, expecting reassurance and calm.

The scissors felt heavy in my hand as I tried to steady my breath, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to hold together."}
