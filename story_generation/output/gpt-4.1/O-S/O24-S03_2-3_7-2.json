But as I left the courthouse, I found myself swept into a crowd gathering outside. The demonstration was peaceful, but tense. Suddenly, someone beside me whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s step past the barricade. We have a right to be heard.\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the yellow tape marking city property.
