Suddenly, the emergency alarm blared\u2014a passenger needed urgent medical help. My training as a subway operator kicked in: I had to stop at the next station, alert emergency services, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating with frantic messages from my fellow activists. The protest I\u2019d helped organize was taking a dangerous turn\u2014police were blocking exits, and people were trapped, scared, and looking to me for guidance. I was supposed to be their coordinator, the one who kept everyone calm and safe. My heart pounded as I stared at the emergency button, torn between my duty to the passengers in my care and my responsibility to my friends and cause above ground. Both sides needed me, both expected me to act now. I gripped the controls, paralyzed by the impossible choice, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in."}
