I force a smile as the next customer slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about a pricing error. My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently reminding me to stay calm and friendly, no matter how frazzled I feel. I apologize, scan her items, and try to reassure her, but my mind is elsewhere. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the court session for my client starts in twenty minutes. As their advocate, I know my presence could make or break the case. The expectation is clear: I must be there, prepared and punctual. But right now, I\u2019m trapped behind the register, responsible for keeping the line moving and the customers happy. My heart pounds as I juggle apologies and receipts, torn between the demands of two worlds, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
