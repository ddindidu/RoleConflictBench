As a hairdresser, I knew my job was to greet them warmly, offer reassurance, and set a calming tone for what should be a joyful morning. But just as I was about to welcome them, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day, and I had promised myself I\u2019d vote before my first appointment. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told by a poll worker that my ballot envelope was smudged and needed to be re-signed to ensure it would count. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the bride\u2019s expectations pulling me back to the salon, while the poll worker\u2019s patient gaze reminded me of my civic duty. My hands trembled, torn between the anxious bridal party waiting for my comforting presence and the official\u2019s request that I carefully follow the voting procedure. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
