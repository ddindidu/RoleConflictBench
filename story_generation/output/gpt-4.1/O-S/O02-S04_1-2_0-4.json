As an engineer, I was expected to brainstorm innovative solutions, but the team was still in the early stages\u2014nothing was set in stone yet. My phone buzzed, reminding me that I needed to pick up my ID from home if I wanted to vote. The polls would be open tomorrow, but today was my only window to grab the ID, since I\u2019d be traveling for work in the morning.\n\nMy manager expected me to stay for the brainstorming session, to show commitment and contribute ideas. But as a voter, I had a civic duty, and I couldn\u2019t participate without my ID. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I left now, I might disappoint my team or miss a key discussion. If I stayed, I risked losing my chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between my professional obligations and my role as a citizen."}
