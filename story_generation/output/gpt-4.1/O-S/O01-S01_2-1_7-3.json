The project was already behind schedule, and I was expected to keep everything moving smoothly. Every minute counted. Just then, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from the community center where I volunteered. One of the people I\u2019d been helping wanted to talk, and I knew how important it was to be present and trustworthy, to respect their privacy and never let anything slip, even in passing.\n\nLater, during a break at the construction site, I found myself chatting with a contractor. The conversation drifted, and before I realized it, we were talking about the neighborhood, the people, and the community center. Nothing sensitive was said, but I felt a knot in my stomach. As an architect, I was expected to build relationships and keep the project on track, but as a volunteer, I was bound to protect the privacy of those I helped. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I could feel the tension rising, unsure of how to balance the demands of both worlds."}
