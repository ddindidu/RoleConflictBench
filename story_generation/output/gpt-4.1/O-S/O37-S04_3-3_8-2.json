My shift wasn\u2019t over, but the polling station would close in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year. But the supervisor had just reminded us\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. Every surface had to be sanitized, gloves and masks on, every protocol followed. If I left now, I\u2019d have to rush, maybe skip a few steps, maybe even take off my gloves early to save time. But if I stayed and finished properly, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. My heart pounded as I weighed the rules drilled into me at work against my responsibility as a citizen. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cYour vote matters.\u201d But I could also hear my supervisor: \u201cOne mistake, and you\u2019re out.\u201d My hands shook as I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, both demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
