The hospital wing design is nearly finished, but the emergency route still needs tweaking. My phone buzzes\u2014it's Maya, a fellow activist, live-streaming from the city square. Their voice is urgent, asking for more people to join the protest against healthcare inequality. I glance at the clock. If I leave now, I could be there in twenty minutes. But the hospital team expects my revisions by morning; surgeons and nurses are counting on me to get this right. My mind races. As an architect, I know how crucial every detail is for patient safety. As an activist, I feel the pull to stand with my friends, to make our voices heard. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest. I stare at the blinking cursor in my email draft, torn between the silent demands of my profession and the passionate call of the street."}
