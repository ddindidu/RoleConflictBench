As a telemarketer, every second was monitored, and the automated compliance system would flag me if I left my desk even a minute early. My headset buzzed with the voice of Mrs. Carter, a woman I\u2019d met through my volunteer work at the community center. She was lonely, and our calls often drifted into friendly territory. Today, she started sharing about her grandson\u2019s struggles at school. It wasn\u2019t anything sensitive, but I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014volunteers are trusted to respect privacy, to never let personal details slip, even unintentionally. My eyes darted to the break timer. If I stayed on the call, I\u2019d risk a compliance flag and possible disciplinary action. If I cut her off, I\u2019d betray the trust she placed in me as a volunteer. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands of my job against the expectations of my volunteer role, caught in the tightening grip of two worlds that refused to overlap."}
