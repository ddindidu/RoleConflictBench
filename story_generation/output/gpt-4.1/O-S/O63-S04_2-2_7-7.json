Management has been strict lately, tracking every second we\u2019re away from our desks. I know if I leave even a minute early, it\u2019ll be flagged. But today is different. I\u2019m not just a telemarketer; I\u2019m also a voter, and I\u2019ve arranged my break to drop off my mail-in ballot at the polling station down the street. \n\nWhen I finally get there, the poll worker inspects my envelope and frowns. \u201cThis signature is smudged. Please re-sign so your vote counts.\u201d She\u2019s polite but firm, and I know the rules\u2014if I don\u2019t comply, my ballot might be tossed. But my break is almost over, and if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get written up at work. My heart pounds as I stare at the pen she offers, torn between the demands of my job and my duty as a citizen."}
