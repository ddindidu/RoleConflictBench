The polling station was open all day, and with my light schedule, I\u2019d planned to vote after lunch. But just as I was about to take my break, Mrs. Patel arrived, clutching a new prescription. She looked anxious, her hands trembling as she handed me the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ve never taken this before,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWill it make me dizzy? What if I forget a dose?\u201d \n\nI knew my responsibility as a pharmacist was to guide her, to ensure she understood every detail about her medication. She deserved my full attention, my patience, and my expertise. Yet, in the back of my mind, I felt the weight of my civic duty. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not with so much at stake. The hours seemed to shrink as I listened to Mrs. Patel\u2019s questions, my mind torn between the needs of my patient and the call to participate in democracy. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
