As an engineer, I\u2019m expected to design innovative solutions, but the project is still in its early stages\u2014nothing is set in stone, and I know I can propose alternatives later. Yet, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers are needed. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to help, to support public health, and to be present for my neighbors. My tax documents are already organized, so that\u2019s not pressing, but the pull to contribute to my community is strong. Still, I worry that stepping away from my work now might mean missing a burst of inspiration or falling behind on my technical research. The expectations from both sides weigh on me\u2014should I focus on my professional role, or answer the call to serve my community? The tension between my duties as an engineer and my responsibilities as a citizen leaves me restless, torn between two worlds that both matter deeply to me."}
