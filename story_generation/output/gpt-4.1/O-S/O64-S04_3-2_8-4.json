My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay friendly, no matter what.\u201d The woman in front of me is red-faced, her voice rising as she complains about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing and promising to fix it, even as I feel my patience fraying. But underneath my uniform, my mind is somewhere else entirely. My wallet is missing my ID, and I need it to vote. Today is the only morning I can run home to grab it before the polls close tomorrow, but I can\u2019t leave the register now\u2014not with the store this busy and my coworkers already stretched thin. I feel trapped, torn between being the reliable cashier everyone expects and fulfilling my responsibility as a voter. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, knowing every minute I stay here is a minute lost. The customer\u2019s voice blurs, and I wonder how I can possibly be both things at once."}
