As an ambulance driver, I knew the drill: stabilize, reassure, get him to the hospital fast. But as I gripped the wheel, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cBring your ID home today\u2014polls close tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019d left my wallet on the kitchen counter, and today was my only window to grab it before my next 24-hour shift. The expectation was clear\u2014my vote mattered, and I needed that ID. But the patient\u2019s life was in my hands right now. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. Could I justify a detour for my civic duty, or would that be a betrayal of the trust placed in me as a first responder? The city blurred past, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the urgent call of a stranger\u2019s life and the quiet, persistent voice of my own responsibility."}
