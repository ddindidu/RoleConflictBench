As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to monitor her recovery after surgery\u2014her blood pressure was a bit high, and I made a mental note to mention it to the nurse. Just then, Mrs. Lee\u2019s daughter, who knew me from my volunteer work at the community center, entered the room. She smiled and started chatting, her words drifting from the weather to her mother\u2019s health. \u201cShe\u2019s been so tired lately, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d she asked, glancing at my notes. \n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a volunteer, I was trained to respect privacy, never sharing details about anyone\u2019s health or personal life. But as a nursing assistant, I was expected to communicate openly with family members, especially about changes in a patient\u2019s condition. Mrs. Lee\u2019s daughter looked at me expectantly, waiting for reassurance or information. I hesitated, torn between my duty to protect Mrs. Lee\u2019s confidentiality and my responsibility to keep her family informed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I struggled to find the right words."}
