The meeting at the courthouse was in less than an hour, and I was already cutting it close. As I spun the chair around, my client\u2019s face fell. She stared at her reflection, lips pressed tight, clearly unhappy with the colour. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I was supposed to listen, reassure, and fix any dissatisfaction. But as an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable\u2014missing a meeting could mean letting down a client who depended on me for their legal rights.\n\nShe hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I expected.\u201d I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and I felt the weight of her trust.
