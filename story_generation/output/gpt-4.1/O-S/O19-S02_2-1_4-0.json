She nods, but I can see the worry in her eyes, so I slow down, repeating the important points. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014three messages from Sam, my friend and fellow activist. The protest downtown is smaller than expected, and the police have started circling. Sam\u2019s last message reads, \u201cWe need more people. Can you come now?\u201d I glance at the clock. My shift ends in twenty minutes, but Mrs. Lee still has questions, and there\u2019s a line forming behind her. I feel the weight of my white coat, the trust my patients place in me, and at the same time, the urgency of the cause I believe in. My heart pounds as I try to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s concerns, but my mind keeps drifting to the demonstration, to Sam, to the possibility that my absence could mean fewer voices heard. I feel torn, pulled in two directions, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am."}
