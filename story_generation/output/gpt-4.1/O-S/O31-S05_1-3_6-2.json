As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to enforce the law without bias. The rules were clear\u2014this was a violation. But as I glanced through the windshield, I recognized the driver: my client, waiting anxiously for me inside. As their advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate legal advice, especially now, when they faced an urgent legal issue and needed my guidance more than ever. If I issued the ticket, I\u2019d be upholding my duty as an officer, but I\u2019d also be adding to my client\u2019s stress and possibly undermining their trust in me as their advocate. If I let it slide, I\u2019d be compromising the fairness I swore to uphold. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I stood frozen, ticket book trembling in my hand, caught between the demands of justice and loyalty."}
