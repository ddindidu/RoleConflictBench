The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I could see tempers flaring between the two groups. As a police officer, I was expected to step in, enforce the law, and keep everyone safe. My radio crackled with updates, urging us to maintain order and prevent violence. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the advocacy meeting I was supposed to attend in fifteen minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my clients and colleagues depended on me to be present and prepared, especially with a court session scheduled later that day. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, the demands of public safety clashing with my commitment to those who needed my voice in the legal system. My heart pounded as I watched the protest teeter on the edge of chaos, torn between staying to fulfill my duty as an officer and leaving to honor my responsibilities as an advocate."}
