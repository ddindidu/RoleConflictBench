The store is quiet, and I take pride in making every interaction pleasant, knowing that friendly service is what\u2019s expected of me. As I hand a receipt to an elderly woman, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the court session for my client starts in thirty minutes. My heart pounds. As an advocate, I\u2019m expected to be there, prepared and punctual, especially today when the outcome could change my client\u2019s life. But the line at my register grows, and I see familiar faces waiting for my attention. I can\u2019t just abandon them; they count on me for kindness and efficiency. Yet, every second I stay, I risk letting down someone who needs my voice in court. My hands tremble as I scan another item, torn between the expectations of two worlds, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
