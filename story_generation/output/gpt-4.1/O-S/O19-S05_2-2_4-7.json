The patient in front of me, an elderly woman with trembling hands, listened intently as I explained how to take her new medication and what side effects to watch for. She asked questions, her anxiety clear, and I knew she needed reassurance and careful guidance. As a pharmacist, I owed her my full attention and expertise\u2014her safety depended on it.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my advocacy client was starting soon, across town. I was expected to be there, on time, to speak on their behalf. Missing it could jeopardize their case, and I\u2019d promised to be their unwavering support. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my presence and compassion here, the other my punctuality and voice elsewhere. My mind raced, torn between the patient\u2019s immediate needs and my commitment to justice. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
