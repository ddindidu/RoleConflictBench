As an architect, I knew every inch mattered\u2014each workspace needed to be functional, comfortable, and efficient. My phone buzzed, a reminder for the advocacy meeting in thirty minutes. I was supposed to be there, listening to clients, preparing for court, making sure their voices were heard. But the floor plan deadline loomed, and I could already hear my project manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how crucial it was to get this right for the employees who would spend their days here.\n\nMy mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d lose my creative flow and risk missing a critical design flaw. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late\u2014again\u2014for the meeting, letting down the people who counted on me to fight for them. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each role demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the needs of the future office and the immediate call to advocacy, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me apart."}
