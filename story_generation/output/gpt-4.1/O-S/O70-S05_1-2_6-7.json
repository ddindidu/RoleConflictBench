The package on the seat beside me was for Mrs. Patel, a regular customer who always expected a friendly chat and a smile. As a delivery person, I prided myself on being polite and professional, making sure every handoff felt personal. But today, my mind was elsewhere. In less than thirty minutes, I was supposed to be in court, advocating for a client whose future depended on my punctuality and preparation. The courthouse was across town, and traffic was unpredictable. \n\nAs I pulled up to Mrs. Patel\u2019s house, I saw her waiting by the door, waving. I knew she\u2019d want to talk, maybe even invite me in for tea. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCourt session in 25 minutes.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I rush the delivery, risking rudeness and a complaint, or stay and fulfill my duty as a courteous delivery person, knowing I might let my client down? My hands trembled as I picked up the package, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I could give."}
