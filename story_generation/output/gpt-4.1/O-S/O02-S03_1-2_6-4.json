As an engineer, I\u2019m expected to join this project planning call, to give my best estimate for the new system\u2019s timeline. The session is informal, and I know the schedule isn\u2019t set in stone yet, but my team relies on me to be present and thoughtful. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district is streaming right now. As a citizen, I believe in being informed, in listening to the candidates, and in giving feedback that could shape our community. I promised myself I\u2019d be more engaged this election. My mind races\u2014if I focus on the planning session, I\u2019ll miss the live discussion and the chance to ask questions. If I tune into the forum, I\u2019ll let my team down, maybe even set the project back. I feel torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety of knowing I can\u2019t fully meet both at once."}
