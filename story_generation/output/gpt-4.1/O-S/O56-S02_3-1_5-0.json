She\u2019s furious about her haircut, gesturing wildly, demanding a fix. I try to keep my tone calm, apologizing, offering to adjust the style, but she\u2019s not having it. My coworkers are already sweeping up, glancing at me with sympathy. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the square, her text urgent: \u201cWe need more people here, can you come?\u201d I glance at the screen, seeing the small crowd, the signs, the cause I care so much about. But here, in the salon, I\u2019m expected to be the patient professional, smoothing over complaints, making sure every client leaves happy. My heart pounds as I weigh the angry client in front of me against the call to action from my activist friends. I feel pulled in two directions, the pressure mounting, unsure which role I\u2019m supposed to honor in this moment."}
