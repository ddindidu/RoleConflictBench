She glared at her reflection, voice rising, demanding a fix for the cut she hated. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, silently urging me to handle it with patience and professionalism. I nodded, swallowing my own frustration, knowing I couldn\u2019t rush her out the door. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes. I pictured the check-in table, the line of people waiting, and remembered how last week, a client had quietly confided a personal struggle while filling out forms. I\u2019d promised to keep it private, to listen without judgment or interruption. Now, I felt torn. The salon expected me to stay until the client was satisfied, but the shelter needed me to be present, attentive, and trustworthy. My heart pounded as I weighed the angry woman in front of me against the vulnerable person who might be waiting for me to listen. I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
