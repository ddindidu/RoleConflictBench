The sun beats down, and the whistle hangs heavy around my neck. A few swimmers drift toward the deep end, but they\u2019re strong, laughing, no real danger\u2014still, I can\u2019t look away for a second. That\u2019s the expectation: constant vigilance, no distractions. But my mind keeps drifting to the community center across the street. The free vaccine clinic is only open this weekend, and I\u2019ve been meaning to go, to do my part as a responsible citizen. I organized my tax documents weeks ago, but this\u2014this is about public health, about helping keep everyone safe. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I leave, even for a short break, I risk missing something in the water. If I stay, I miss my chance to contribute to the community\u2019s well-being. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the demands, torn between duty to those in the pool and duty to the wider world."}
