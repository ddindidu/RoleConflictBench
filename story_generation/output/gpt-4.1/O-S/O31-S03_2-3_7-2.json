Both demanded justice, each convinced the other was at fault. I listened carefully, determined to act with integrity and fairness, as my uniform required. Just then, a crowd from a nearby demonstration surged closer, their chants growing louder. As a citizen, I believed in the right to protest and the importance of respecting public property. Suddenly, someone from the crowd recognized me and urged me to step past the barricade, insisting it was the only way to show solidarity. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was sworn to uphold the law and keep order. As a citizen, I felt the pull to stand with my community and their cause. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding loyalty, each with its own sense of right and wrong. I felt torn, caught between the uniform I wore and the convictions I held as a member of this city."}
