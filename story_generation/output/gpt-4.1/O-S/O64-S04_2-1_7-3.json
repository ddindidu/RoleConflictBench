The line snakes past the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My manager expects me to keep things moving, but also to be friendly\u2014no rushed, robotic service. I\u2019m doing my best, but my mind keeps drifting to the voting booth across the street. Today\u2019s the last day to vote, and I promised myself I\u2019d go on my break. I check my wallet between customers and realize I only have my work ID, not the government-issued one they require. I could run home after my shift to grab it, but that means staying late, and I promised to cover for a coworker who\u2019s out sick. If I leave the line now, I\u2019ll let down my team and the customers. If I wait, I might miss my chance to vote. The pressure builds in my chest as I try to keep my smile steady, torn between being the reliable cashier everyone expects and the responsible citizen I want to be."}
