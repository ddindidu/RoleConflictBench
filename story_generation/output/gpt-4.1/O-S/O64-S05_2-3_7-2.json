As a cashier, I smile, scan items, and make small talk, trying to keep the mood light despite the impatience simmering in the air. My manager expects me to be efficient and friendly, and I can feel the pressure of eyes watching my every move. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014three times in quick succession. I know it\u2019s my client, desperate for guidance on a legal issue that can\u2019t wait. As their advocate, I\u2019m supposed to provide clear, immediate advice, and I can picture them anxiously waiting for my response. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to a customer, torn between the obligation to the people in front of me and the responsibility to someone depending on my expertise. The demands of both roles pull at me, and I feel the weight of letting someone down, no matter what I choose next."}
