My supervisor mentioned we could take our breaks flexibly, as long as we don\u2019t abuse the privilege. I\u2019ve been eyeing my wallet all day, double-checking that my ID is inside. The polling station closes at seven, and this is my only chance to vote. If I leave now, I\u2019ll make it in time, but technically, my break isn\u2019t scheduled for another half hour. I know the company expects me to stick to my hours, but the polls won\u2019t wait. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility of my job against my right\u2014and duty\u2014to vote. I imagine my supervisor\u2019s disappointment if I leave early, but I also picture the locked doors of the polling station if I wait too long. The pressure builds in my chest, torn between being a reliable employee and a responsible citizen, as the minutes tick by."}
