As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, keep my passengers safe, and never rush, especially in weather like this. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. My hands tightened on the wheel. But the clock on the dashboard glared at me\u2014fifteen minutes until my volunteer shift started. The coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time today. The doors open right at nine.\u201d I pictured the line of people waiting, the other volunteers counting on me to help. Every red light, every cautious stop, made my heart pound faster. I wanted to be reliable for the team, but I couldn\u2019t risk a crash or a ticket. The pressure built with every passing block, torn between my duty to drive safely and my promise to show up for those who needed me."}
