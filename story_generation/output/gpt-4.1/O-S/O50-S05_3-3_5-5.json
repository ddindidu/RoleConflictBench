I knew that if I didn\u2019t act now, the entire line could grind to a halt, costing the company thousands and putting jobs at risk. My supervisor\u2019s voice was sharp in my ear: \u201cWe need you on this, now. No one else can fix it.\u201d I reached for my tools, but my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was the courthouse. The trial was starting in ten minutes, and my client\u2019s future\u2014her freedom, her children\u2014depended on my presence and my words. I could picture her anxious face, waiting for me to walk through those doors, to stand by her side and fight for her.
