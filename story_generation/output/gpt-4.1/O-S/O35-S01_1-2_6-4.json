My phone buzzed: an email from management about a professional development seminar. They wanted us to sign up if we were interested, and I knew responding promptly would show my commitment to the job. But just as I started to type a reply, a client at the volunteer check-in table leaned in, voice barely above a whisper. She confided a personal concern, her eyes darting nervously. As a volunteer, I was expected to listen, to respect her privacy, to be fully present. Yet, the pressure to maintain my professional image as a subway operator tugged at me\u2014I couldn\u2019t ignore the email for long. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my employer and the trust placed in me by someone in need. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each with its own set of expectations."}
