I know the timeline isn\u2019t set in stone yet, but my input will shape the next steps. Just as I\u2019m about to chime in, I get called to the front of the polling station. The election official\u2019s voice is firm: \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form, and we close in ten minutes.\u201d I nod, heart pounding. As an engineer, I\u2019m supposed to be reliable, present, and precise, even in these early planning stages. But as a voter, I have a civic duty to follow every instruction, to make sure my voice counts. My team is waiting for my answer, but the official is waiting for my paperwork. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my professional responsibility tugging at me, my civic responsibility demanding my attention. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I can\u2019t let either side down."}
