The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had a line of customers stretching down the aisle. My manager had reminded us all week: no early clock-outs, no exceptions, especially during the busy season. As a cashier, I was expected to follow every store policy to the letter, and today that meant handling a frustrated customer trying to return a blender without a receipt. She pleaded, insisting she\u2019d bought it here, but the policy was clear\u2014no receipt, no return. I could feel her eyes on me, waiting for me to bend the rules, but I knew my job was on the line.\n\nAt the same time, my mind kept drifting to my civic duty. I\u2019d promised myself I would vote, but if I stayed late to resolve this, I might miss my chance. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the store needed me to enforce the rules, but my community needed my voice. My heart pounded as I tried to find a way to honor both, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
