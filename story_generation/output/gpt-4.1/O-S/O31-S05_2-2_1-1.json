The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I could see tempers flaring between the two groups. As a police officer, I was expected to step in, enforce the law, and keep everyone safe, even if it meant breaking up the protest or making arrests. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my client, desperate for advice as their legal situation became more tangled by the hour. As their advocate, I owed them my full attention and clear, accurate guidance, especially now when every detail mattered.\n\nThe demands pulled at me from both sides. My fellow officers looked to me for action, expecting me to help restore order. At the same time, my client\u2019s trust depended on my availability and expertise. I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing with the consequences of neglecting either duty. The noise of the protest faded into the background as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me, torn between the law I swore to uphold and the client who relied on my counsel."}
