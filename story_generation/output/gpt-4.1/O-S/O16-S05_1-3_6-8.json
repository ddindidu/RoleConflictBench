My patient, a young woman with a sore throat and fever, sat across from me, waiting for my diagnosis. As her doctor, I knew I needed to examine her thoroughly, confirm strep throat, and explain the antibiotic regimen. She deserved my full attention and careful care.

The outcome of the hearing could change someone\u2019s life, and my absence might tip the scales. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my undivided commitment.
