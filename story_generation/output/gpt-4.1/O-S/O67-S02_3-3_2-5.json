My hands tightened on the steering wheel. As an ambulance driver, every second counted; lives depended on my speed and focus. But just as I started the engine, my phone buzzed with a message from my activist group: the legislature was holding a surprise vote on the bill we\u2019d fought for all year. The outcome hinged on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a direct line to her. They needed me to call now, to make our case, to tip the balance. My heart pounded. The city\u2019s expectations pressed in: save lives, be swift, don\u2019t hesitate. But my activist friends\u2019 voices echoed too: this is our moment, don\u2019t let it slip away. I stared at the phone, then at the road ahead, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me apart."}
