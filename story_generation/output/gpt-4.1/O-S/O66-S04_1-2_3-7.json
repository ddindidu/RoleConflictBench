My company expected me to drive defensively, and I prided myself on my clean record. After parking my cab, I hurried to the polling station to cast my vote. The process was smooth until a poll worker noticed my signature on the ballot envelope was smudged. She politely asked me to re-sign it, explaining that otherwise, my vote might not count. I hesitated, remembering the strict instructions from my taxi company about never signing anything twice on official documents, to avoid any suspicion of fraud or carelessness. The poll worker insisted it was necessary, but my mind raced with worry\u2014what if this small act conflicted with the standards I was held to as a professional driver? I stood there, pen in hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
