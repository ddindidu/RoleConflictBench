My headset itched against my ear as I wrapped up a call, careful not to let my voice betray the fatigue creeping in. The compliance system was ruthless\u2014one unscheduled minute away from my desk, and I\u2019d get flagged. I\u2019d seen coworkers written up for less. Just as I logged the call, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cURGENT\u2014mandatory procedure update. All volunteers must review and implement immediately to keep the service running.\u201d My heart pounded. The shelter depended on us, and the coordinator\u2019s tone left no room for delay. But if I opened the volunteer portal now, I\u2019d risk being caught by the compliance system. If I waited, the service might shut down, and people would be left without help. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the urgent needs of the shelter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
