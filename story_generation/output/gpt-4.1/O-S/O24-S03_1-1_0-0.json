As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, even for cases that seemed routine. The pressure to be thorough weighed on me; I knew that missing a detail could mean injustice. But the sun was shining, and I longed for a break. I decided to take a walk in the park, hoping fresh air would clear my mind.\n\nAs I strolled, I finished my coffee and glanced at the overflowing trash bin. The no-littering signs were clear, and as a citizen, I was expected to respect public property and set an example. But the bin was full, and I hesitated, cup in hand. Should I carry it all the way home, or leave it balanced on top, risking it blowing away? My mind tugged between my duty to the law, both in the courtroom and as a member of the community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different, and I stood there, cup in hand, caught between what I should do and what I wanted to do."}
