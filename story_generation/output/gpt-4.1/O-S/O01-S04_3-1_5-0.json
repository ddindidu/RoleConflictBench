Today, the project manager called an urgent meeting\u2014one last walkthrough before final approval. It was scheduled for late afternoon, right when the polling station would be open. As an architect, I knew how much was riding on this; a single oversight could compromise patient safety. But as a voter, I felt the weight of civic duty. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but the meeting\u2019s timing pressed against the closing hours. My colleagues expected my full attention, and the hospital board trusted my expertise. Yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the sense that missing my chance to vote would mean neglecting another responsibility. The pressure built as I stared at my calendar, torn between the demands of my profession and my role as a citizen, heart pounding as the clock ticked closer to both deadlines."}
