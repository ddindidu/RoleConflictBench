The expectation was clear: I needed to review and analyze every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. There, I was trusted to sort confidential medical files, a task that demanded absolute discretion and respect for privacy.\n\nAs I began sorting the files, my eyes caught a familiar name\u2014one that matched the case file waiting on my desk. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough, to know every aspect of the case, but as a volunteer, I was bound by a promise of confidentiality. The two roles collided inside me, each demanding loyalty, each with its own code. My heart pounded as I realized the information in my hands could influence my judicial review, but accessing it felt like a betrayal of trust. I sat frozen, torn between the duties that defined me, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
