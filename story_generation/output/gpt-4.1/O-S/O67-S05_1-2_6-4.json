My shift was ending, and I was supposed to move the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackled with routine updates, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014on the courthouse, where my client\u2019s hearing was about to begin. As an advocate, I was expected to be there, to argue her case with the care and attention it deserved. She was counting on me; her future depended on it.\n\nBut the ambulance needed to be delivered safely, no shortcuts, no rushing. The station manager had made it clear: safety first, always. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I hurried, I\u2019d risk an accident. If I delayed, I\u2019d fail my client. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCourt in 30 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded as I watched the minutes tick by, torn between the duty to my colleagues and the responsibility to my client. The city blurred past my window, and I wrestled with the impossible choice ahead."}
