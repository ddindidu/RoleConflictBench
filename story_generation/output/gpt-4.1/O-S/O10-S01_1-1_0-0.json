As an accountant, I knew the quarterly filing was non-negotiable\u2014every number had to be perfect, every document in order. My supervisor had reminded me twice this week how crucial accuracy was, especially with the audit coming up. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised to be there on time, to help set up before the dinner rush. The coordinator always emphasized reliability, and I hated the thought of letting the team down. Still, I knew the others could handle the first half hour without me, but the guilt gnawed at me. I felt torn, pulled between the precision demanded by my job and the commitment I\u2019d made to the people who counted on me at the kitchen. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, as I tried to decide which responsibility I could afford to let down\u2014if only for a little while."}
