The customer in front of me pleaded, her voice tight with frustration, \u201cPlease, I just need to return this. I lost the receipt, but I really need the refund.\u201d Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without a receipt. As a cashier, I was expected to enforce this rule, no exceptions. But my mind was elsewhere, already racing ahead to the courthouse across town. As an advocate, I was supposed to be there in less than thirty minutes for a hearing that could change my client\u2019s life. The store was short-staffed, and my manager had asked me to cover the register until my shift ended. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the store\u2019s demand for strict adherence to policy, and my client\u2019s desperate need for my presence and support. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the customer\u2019s anxious face, torn between the rules I was supposed to uphold and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t abandon."}
