As an engineer, I was responsible for submitting the final compliance report for our new product release. The updated safety standard had just come into effect, and my manager made it clear: no evidence of conformity, no launch. I scrolled through the checklist, double-checking every document, knowing the auditors would scrutinize every detail. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close at 8 p.m. sharp. Today was the last day to vote, and I had to bring my government-issued ID\u2014no exceptions. I glanced at my bag, realizing my ID was at home, a 30-minute drive away. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the window to finalize the compliance upload. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote in this critical election. \n\nMy mind raced, torn between my duty to my team and my responsibility as a citizen. Both roles demanded my presence, both with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I sat frozen, the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides, unable to move as the minutes slipped away."}
