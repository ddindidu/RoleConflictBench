As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping my workspace tidy\u2014one stray nail or misplaced saw could mean disaster. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d I knelt to gather the debris, but my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was a reminder for the advocacy meeting downtown, starting in just fifteen minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my clients and colleagues depended on me to be present and prepared. My heart pounded as I glanced at the mess around me. If I left now, I\u2019d be on time for the meeting, but the workshop would remain a hazard. If I stayed to clean, I\u2019d be late\u2014again\u2014and risk disappointing those who counted on me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the safety of my craft and the responsibility of my cause."}
