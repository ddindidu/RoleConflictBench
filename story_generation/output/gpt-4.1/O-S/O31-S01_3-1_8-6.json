My phone buzzed with a court summons\u2014I was needed to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. As a police officer, I knew how important it was to act with integrity and fairness, to ensure justice was served. Missing court wasn\u2019t an option; people depended on my testimony.\n\nBut then, another email pinged in. It was from the volunteer coordinator at the community center, where I spent my off-duty hours. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply room, hinting it would really help if I could tackle it today. I respected her leadership and wanted to follow her guidance, especially since the center was short-staffed.\n\nI stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore. The court expected my unwavering commitment to justice, while the center needed my reliability and willingness to help. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demanded more than I could give. I closed my eyes, torn between duty and dedication, unsure which path to choose."}
