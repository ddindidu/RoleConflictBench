Make sure your area\u2019s spotless before you go.\u201d My boots crunched over gravel as I grabbed the broom, glancing at the clock. I had just enough time to sweep up and rush to the polling station before it closed. The site rules were strict\u2014no one left until their section was clean and safe. I didn\u2019t want to let my crew down or risk a warning.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the polling place, my hands still gritty, I signed my ballot envelope. The poll worker frowned. \u201cSorry, this is smudged. Please re-sign so your vote counts.\u201d I hesitated, thinking of the safety protocols drilled into me at work\u2014never touch anything with dirty hands, always keep things clean. But the poll worker was insistent, and the line behind me was growing. My mind raced between the demand to keep things clean and the duty to follow the voting process. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
