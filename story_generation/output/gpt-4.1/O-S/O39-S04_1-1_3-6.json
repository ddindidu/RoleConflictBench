Don\u2019t forget to sweep your area.\u201d My boots crunched over scattered debris\u2014nails, wood chips, dust. I knew the rules: leave your spot clean, or risk a warning. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPolls close in 30 minutes.\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, no matter what. I rushed to the polling station, still in my work clothes, dust clinging to my jeans. The line snaked out the door. An official called, \u201cA\u2013M last names, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line looked longer, but the official\u2019s voice was firm. I hesitated, glancing at the clock, thinking about the mess I\u2019d left behind at the site and the rules I was supposed to follow here. My mind raced\u2014should I stick to my work ethic and go back to clean, or follow the voting instructions and risk being late for both? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
