My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, feeling the pressure mount. But then my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the advocacy group\u2019s routine meeting was starting in fifteen minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my colleagues counted on me to be present, to speak up for our clients. I stared at the phone, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d miss my sales target and risk disappointing my boss. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my fellow advocates and possibly jeopardize a case we\u2019d been working on for weeks. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014one role pushing me to keep dialing, the other urging me to log off and join the meeting. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach as I wrestled with what to do next."}
