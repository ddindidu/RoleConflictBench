He slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a coffee shop for a casual catch-up\u2014no rush, he said, plenty of time. I nodded, but my mind was already racing. My volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in thirty minutes across town. I knew the team could handle things without me for a while, but I hated being late; I\u2019d promised myself and the coordinator I\u2019d be reliable. At the same time, as a taxi driver, I prided myself on never making passengers feel hurried or unwelcome. The man in the back seat chatted about his weekend plans, oblivious to my growing anxiety. Should I take the fastest route and risk making him feel rushed, or stick to my usual, friendly pace and arrive late to my shift? My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, the city traffic lights blinking ahead, demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
