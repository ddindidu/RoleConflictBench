The package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014HAND DELIVER ONLY.\u201d My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Confirm the recipient\u2019s ID, no exceptions.\u201d I pulled up to the address, scanning the building for the right apartment. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polling station would close in ten minutes. If I didn\u2019t make it, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote.\n\nI grabbed the package, rehearsing my delivery script, but my mind kept drifting to the polling station just a few blocks away. I imagined the doors locking, the officials turning me away. But if I rushed this delivery, skipped the ID check, or left the package with a neighbor, I\u2019d be violating company policy\u2014and risking my job. My hands trembled as I pressed the buzzer, torn between my duty to deliver and my right to vote. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach."}
