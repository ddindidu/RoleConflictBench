My passenger, a young woman clutching her train ticket, kept checking her phone. \u201cPlease, can you get me to the station in fifteen minutes? My train leaves soon,\u201d she pleaded. As a taxi driver, I felt the weight of her urgency\u2014she was counting on me to get her there safely and on time. I promised I\u2019d do my best, but my mind was elsewhere.\n\nJust before picking her up, I\u2019d stopped at the polling station to vote. The official frowned at my ID. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form before we close in ten minutes.\u201d I stared at the form, heart pounding.

Should I rush her to the station, risking my chance to vote, or stay and complete the form, letting her miss her train? The clock ticked louder, and I felt the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
