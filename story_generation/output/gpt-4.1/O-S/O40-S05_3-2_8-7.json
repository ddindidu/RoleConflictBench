The homeowner\u2019s anxious eyes followed me as I examined the splintered beams, eaten hollow by termites. \u201cWe need a plan today,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cbefore the whole frame gives way.\u201d My mind raced through measurements and materials, the urgency pressing on my chest. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the court session in less than an hour. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late; my client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation. The judge was strict, and missing this session could tip the scales against us. Yet here, the family\u2019s safety was at stake, and they looked to me for immediate answers. I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014one demanding my hands, the other my voice\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the crumbling wood before me and the courtroom waiting across town."}
