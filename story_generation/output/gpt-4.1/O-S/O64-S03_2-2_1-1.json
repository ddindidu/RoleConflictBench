As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, scan each item quickly, and make no mistakes with the money. My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over every so often, a silent reminder to stay sharp. But my mind keeps drifting to tonight. My friends and I have been planning a music night for weeks, but the building\u2019s quiet hours start at nine, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open. As a citizen, I know I should respect the rules and her right to peace. The thought of disappointing my friends or disturbing Mrs. Lee makes my stomach twist. I try to focus on the beeping scanner, but the conflicting demands press in on me\u2014accuracy and speed here, respect and restraint later. My hands tremble slightly as I hand back change, caught between the expectations of my job and my responsibility to my community, unsure which role I\u2019ll let down tonight."}
