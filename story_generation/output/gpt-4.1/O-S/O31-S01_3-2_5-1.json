My volunteer shift started in ten minutes, and the coordinator had stressed how crucial it was for everyone to be on time today. The roster was tight, and I knew the kids counted on me to help with their reading. As I turned onto Main Street, I saw a crowd gathering near the bus stop. Shouts echoed, and I caught sight of two men fighting, one wielding a metal pipe. Panic rippled through the bystanders, some backing away, others frozen in fear. My training as a police officer kicked in\u2014protecting citizens and property was my duty. But if I intervened, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, letting down the team and the children who needed me.
