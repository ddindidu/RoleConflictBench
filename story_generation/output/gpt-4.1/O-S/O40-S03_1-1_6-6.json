She placed the broken toy on my workbench, explaining it was her grandson\u2019s favorite and asking if I could fix it quickly. I examined the damage, already calculating the time and materials needed, knowing she expected a fair price and a fast turnaround. As I reached for my notepad to write a quote, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the free vaccine clinic at the community center was this weekend, and volunteers were needed. I\u2019d also planned to finish organizing my tax documents, a task I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d complete early this year to avoid last-minute stress. The weight of my responsibilities pressed in\u2014my duty as a carpenter to serve my customers well, and my role as a citizen to support my community and fulfill civic obligations. I stared at the broken toy, feeling torn between the immediate needs of my customer and the broader expectations of my community. My mind raced, caught between the pull of my workshop and the call to contribute beyond it."}
