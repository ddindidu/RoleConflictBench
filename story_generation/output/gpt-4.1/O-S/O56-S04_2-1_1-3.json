Her eyes darted around, uncertain, and I remembered how important it was to greet every client warmly, especially the nervous ones. I smiled and started toward her, rehearsing my usual welcoming words. But as I took a step, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about voting today. I suddenly remembered I\u2019d left my main ID at home, and although other cards would work, I\u2019d planned to bring the right one to avoid any hassle. I could still fetch it later, but the thought nagged at me. The client shifted her weight, clearly waiting for reassurance, while my mind raced with the worry of long lines at the polling station and the risk of forgetting again. I felt torn, the weight of my professional duty pulling me one way, and my civic responsibility tugging the other, both demanding my attention at the same moment."}
