The polling station would close in just under two hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year. But right in front of me, the operator was fiddling with the machine\u2019s settings again, ignoring my earlier instructions. The whir of the conveyor belt was punctuated by the clatter of wasted material dropping into the bin\u2014another batch ruined. My supervisor expected me to guide the operators, to make sure they understood the process and minimized waste. I could see the frustration on the operator\u2019s face, and I knew if I left now, the mistakes would only multiply. But if I stayed, I might not make it to the polling station in time. My responsibility to the company and my commitment as a citizen pulled me in opposite directions. I felt my chest tighten as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable repairer, or fulfill my civic duty as a voter. The minutes ticked by, and I stood frozen, torn between two roles that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
