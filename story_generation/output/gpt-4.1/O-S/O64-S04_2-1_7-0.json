The line snakes past the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My manager expects me to keep things moving, but also to be friendly\u2014no rushed, robotic service.

Today is Election Day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station is just a few blocks away, and the hours are generous, but I know how these shifts go\u2014breaks get pushed, and before I know it, the day is gone.
