I glanced at the line forming at my register, each customer clutching envelopes and checks for high-value transactions. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything, especially at closing. One mistake, and we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d I felt the weight of every bill and coin, double-checking each entry, my hands trembling slightly. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the court session for my advocacy case started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one who could present the evidence, and my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality. The courthouse was a twenty-minute drive away, and I could already picture the judge glancing at the empty seat where I should be. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the numbers in front of me, torn between the responsibility to my employer and the duty to my client.
