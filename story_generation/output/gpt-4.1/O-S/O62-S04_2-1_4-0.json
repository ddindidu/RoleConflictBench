As I walked along the deck, I noticed a broken lane rope floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and the rope was essential for keeping the kids safe and organized. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of maintaining equipment, and I knew I was expected to fix it before the lessons began. \n\nBut today was also Election Day. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, and the polling station was only open for a few more hours. My schedule was light, but I couldn\u2019t leave the pool unattended, and the rope repair would take time. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me\u2014my duty to the swimmers and my duty as a citizen. I paced the deck, torn between the expectation to keep the pool safe and the obligation to make my voice heard at the polls, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
