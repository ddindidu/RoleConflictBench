The house was far from spotless\u2014muddy footprints trailed from the hallway, and a fine layer of dust clung to the windowsills. My supervisor expected nothing less than perfection, and I could already hear her voice in my head, reminding me that every corner mattered. But my phone buzzed, flashing a reminder: court session in forty-five minutes. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late; my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality and preparation. My heart pounded as I weighed the mop in my hand against the briefcase by the door. If I left now, the house would be left half-done, risking my job and reputation. If I stayed to finish, I\u2019d be late for court, letting down someone who counted on me. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of spotless floors and the call of justice."}
