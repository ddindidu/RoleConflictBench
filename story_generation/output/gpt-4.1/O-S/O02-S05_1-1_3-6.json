As an engineer, I knew the importance of keeping every safety document up to date\u2014regulations were strict, and the upcoming audit, though months away, was a chance to prove our diligence. My manager expected nothing less than perfection, and I prided myself on never letting a detail slip. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the advocacy meeting in fifteen minutes. These meetings were relentless, and as an advocate, my presence was non-negotiable. The team relied on me to represent our clients, to be punctual and prepared, especially with court sessions looming. I glanced at the half-finished compliance report, then at my calendar packed with advocacy commitments. My chest tightened. If I left now, the documentation would fall behind, risking non-compliance. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people counting on my voice. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I closed my eyes, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
