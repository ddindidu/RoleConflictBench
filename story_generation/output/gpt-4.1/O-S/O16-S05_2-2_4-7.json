My patient, Mrs. Lee, sat across from me, her hands trembling as she tried to process the news of her new diagnosis. She looked at me with pleading eyes, desperate for reassurance and guidance. As her doctor, I knew I owed her my full attention, to answer her questions with patience and empathy, to help her understand what life would look like from now on. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that the court session for my advocacy client was starting in fifteen minutes. I was expected to be there, to speak up for someone whose future depended on my punctuality and presence. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. I could see the hope in Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes, and I could feel the urgency of the courtroom waiting for me. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the expectations of compassion and commitment, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
