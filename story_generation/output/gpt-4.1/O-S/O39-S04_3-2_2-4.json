The crane was already lowering the steel beam, and the crew needed every hand to guide it into place before it swung out of control. Sweat trickled down my back as I grabbed my gloves, knowing that if I didn\u2019t help, the whole operation could stall\u2014or worse, someone could get hurt. But my mind kept drifting to my wallet, sitting on the kitchen table at home. Today was the only morning I could swing by and grab my ID before work, and without it, I couldn\u2019t vote tomorrow. My supervisor expected me to be reliable, to put the job first, but I also felt the weight of my civic duty. I stared at the beam, then at the clock, torn between the demands of the site and the responsibility waiting for me at the polls. My hands shook as I tried to decide which role I couldn\u2019t afford to let down."}
