My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an unknown number. I hesitated, then answered, and my heart leapt when I heard the legislative aide\u2019s voice. This was the call I\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to make my case for the bill I\u2019d poured months of energy into. But the customer opened the door just then, smiling expectantly. I was supposed to be present, courteous, and professional, but the aide said she only had ten minutes to talk. My mind raced. If I asked the customer to wait, I\u2019d risk a complaint or a bad review. If I let the call go, I might lose my only shot at influencing the policy I cared so deeply about. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, my hands sweating as I tried to juggle the package, the phone, and the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
