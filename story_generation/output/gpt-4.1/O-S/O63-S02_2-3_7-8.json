My manager\u2019s eyes flicker to the break log every hour, and I know if I step away outside my scheduled time, I\u2019ll get a warning\u2014maybe worse. But my phone vibrates with a different urgency: the activist group\u2019s coordinator, breathless, tells me a major news network needs me now. They want me to go on air, to counter a wave of misinformation that\u2019s already spreading. This is the moment we\u2019ve been preparing for, the chance to educate thousands, maybe millions, about our cause. My heart pounds. I glance at the clock\u2014my next break is still an hour away. If I leave my desk, I\u2019ll be letting down my team, risking my job. If I stay, I\u2019ll be letting down my community, missing the chance to make a real difference. The headset feels heavier than ever as I stare at the blinking queue, torn between two worlds that both demand everything from me."}
