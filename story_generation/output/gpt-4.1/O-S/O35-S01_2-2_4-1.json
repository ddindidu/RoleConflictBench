My mind was already on the community center, where I was scheduled to volunteer in less than an hour. The coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my head: \u201cWe need everyone on time today\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t let them down, especially with the roster so thin.\n\nJust then, the radio crackled. \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart thudded. As a subway operator, passenger safety was my top priority. I was expected to act quickly, to ensure everyone was safe, to follow every protocol. But if I delayed even a little, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, letting down the team that was counting on me.\n\nI stared down the length of the train, torn. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate action for public safety, the other requiring my presence and reliability. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
