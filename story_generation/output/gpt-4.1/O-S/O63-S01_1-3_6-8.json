My supervisor had just sent a message saying we could take our breaks a bit earlier if we wanted. I felt a rare sense of freedom, but as I reached for my phone, a notification popped up from the volunteer coordinator. The message was marked urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service we provided would be forced to shut down for the day. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear\u2014every volunteer needed to log in and follow the steps right now, no exceptions. I knew the telemarketing company expected me to stick to my work hours and not use my break for other obligations, even if the rules were relaxed today. But the volunteer role was just as important to me, and the thought of letting the service fail because I didn\u2019t act gnawed at my conscience. My hand hovered over the mouse, torn between the two worlds, feeling the pressure of both expectations closing in."}
