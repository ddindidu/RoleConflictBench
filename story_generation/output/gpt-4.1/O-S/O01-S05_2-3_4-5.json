As an architect, I knew how much the flow of a room could affect the people within it. My phone buzzed, jolting me from my concentration. It was a reminder: the trial for my client was in two hours. As their advocate, I was their voice, their shield, and the outcome of this case would shape their future. My mind raced with arguments and evidence, but the unfinished floor plan tugged at me. The company\u2019s leadership expected my design by the end of the day, and employees were counting on me to create a space that worked for them. Yet, my client\u2019s anxiety echoed in my mind, their trust in me absolute. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my creative focus, the other my unwavering presence and legal expertise. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the needs of those who would inhabit these walls and the life that hung in the balance in the courtroom."}
