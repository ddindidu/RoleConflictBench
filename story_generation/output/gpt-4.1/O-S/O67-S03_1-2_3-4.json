Gauze, bandages, epinephrine\u2014each item had to be accounted for, nothing expired, nothing missing. My mind was focused, knowing that someone\u2019s life could depend on this kit being perfect. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district was starting. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch it live, ask questions, and stay informed. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to participate, to make my voice heard, especially with the election coming up. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t rush this check. If I missed something, it could cost a patient dearly. My hands hesitated over the supplies, my eyes flicking to the phone screen. The forum was streaming now, and I could already see the chat filling with questions. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding my undivided attention for the sake of a stranger\u2019s life, the other insisting I fulfill my civic duty. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which expectation to meet first."}
