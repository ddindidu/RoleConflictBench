As a housekeeping cleaner, I\u2019m drilled to follow every safety and hygiene protocol\u2014gloves on, hands washed, never touch my face. But as the water started seeping under the front doors, panic rose with it. I could see people outside, neighbors and strangers, some struggling to move their cars, others shouting for help. As a citizen, I know I\u2019m supposed to help in emergencies, to look out for others, to be part of the community that stands together in crisis. But my hands were covered in chemicals, and I wasn\u2019t supposed to remove my gloves until I\u2019d finished and washed up. If I rushed out to help, I\u2019d risk spreading germs or exposing myself to something worse. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring people who might need me. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the rules of my job and the call of my conscience, the floodwater inching closer."}
