My boots are caked with dust, and I know if I\u2019m late, the whole crew will notice. We\u2019re supposed to be a team, and the rules are clear: no one skips the briefing, not even for a minute. But just as I\u2019m about to join the circle, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s the news network\u2014live, right now, they need me to speak out, to set the record straight about our cause before the misinformation spreads any further. My heart pounds. The crew expects me to be present, focused, reliable. But my fellow activists are counting on me to be the voice we need in this moment. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands tremble as I stare at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, right now."}
