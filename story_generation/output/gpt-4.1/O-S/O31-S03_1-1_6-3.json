As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to enforce the rules but also to use discretion when the situation called for it. The driver, a woman in her seventies, explained she\u2019d parked quickly to catch the bus downtown\u2014her only way to get to the polling station before it closed. I glanced at the city newsletter tucked in my pocket, reminding me as a citizen to participate in civic life, to stay informed, vote, and give feedback. The survey about bus routes was open through next week, and I\u2019d planned to fill it out tonight, thinking about people like her who relied on public transit. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, the expectations of my role pressing in from both sides. Should I issue the ticket, upholding the law, or let her go, knowing the bigger picture of civic participation? The conflict twisted in my gut as I hesitated, caught between the demands of duty and the responsibilities of citizenship."}
