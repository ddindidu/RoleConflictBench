My break was short, but I needed to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge. The sun was warm, and the park was peaceful, a rare moment to breathe. As I finished reading, I crumpled the wrapper from my snack, glancing around for a trash bin. There was one nearby, but it was overflowing, trash spilling onto the ground. The no-littering signs were clear, and I knew as a responsible citizen I should respect public property and keep the park clean. But I was already running late, and the urge to quickly toss the wrapper on the pile and rush back to work tugged at me. My mind raced\u2014should I risk being late to my shift, where my expertise was needed, or compromise my civic duty for the sake of my professional role? The weight of both expectations pressed on me as I stood there, wrapper in hand, caught between my responsibilities as a pharmacist and as a citizen."}
