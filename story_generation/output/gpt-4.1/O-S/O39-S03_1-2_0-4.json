My arms already ached from the morning\u2019s work, but I was determined to show I could handle the load. As I reached for my gloves, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for our district was starting. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch it live, ask questions, and finally be more involved as a citizen. I wanted my voice to matter, to help shape the place I lived. But now, the weight of the drywall and the weight of my civic duty pressed on me at once. If I stopped to watch, I\u2019d fall behind and risk disappointing my supervisor. If I ignored the forum, I\u2019d miss my chance to participate in something important for my community. My hands trembled as I stood between the stack of materials and the glow of my phone, torn by the demands of both roles, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
