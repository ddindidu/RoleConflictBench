The rules at work were drilled into me: always wear gloves, mask up, never cut corners with safety. As I walked home, I stumbled into a street demonstration. The crowd was loud, passionate, and someone I recognized from my neighborhood called out to me, urging me to join them past a police barricade. \u201cCome on, stand with us!\u201d they shouted, gesturing for me to cross onto the restricted city property.\n\nAs a citizen, I knew I was supposed to respect the law and public property, not trespass or cause trouble. But the energy of the crowd was infectious, and I felt the pull of solidarity. At the same time, my cleaner\u2019s instincts screamed at me\u2014no gloves, no mask, no sanitizer, and a mass of people pressed together. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the protocols I\u2019d be breaking, not just for myself but for everyone I\u2019d come into contact with later. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the expectations of my job and my role as a citizen in this moment."}
