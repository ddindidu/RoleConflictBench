As a judge, I\u2019m expected to review every detail, no matter how routine the case may seem. The hearing was in two weeks, but I prided myself on being thorough and prepared well in advance. Just as I reached for the file, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from my activist group: the legislature was holding a surprise vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for. The outcome would hinge on a single, undecided representative, and I was the one with the connection to sway them. My heart pounded. I could already hear the voices of my colleagues, reminding me of the importance of impartiality and diligence. Yet, the activist in me screamed that this was the moment to make a difference. I stared at the file, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided loyalty."}
