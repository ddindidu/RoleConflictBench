The automated compliance system was relentless\u2014every unscheduled minute away from my headset was flagged, and I\u2019d already been warned once this month. As soon as my break started, I hurried to the community center where I volunteer, still thinking about the calls I\u2019d have to make when I returned. At the check-in table, a woman I\u2019d seen before leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. She confided a personal struggle, her eyes pleading for understanding. I felt the weight of her trust, knowing I was expected to listen and keep her words confidential. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my break was almost over. If I was late, the system would log it, and I could face disciplinary action. My mind raced\u2014should I cut her off to rush back, risking her feeling dismissed, or stay and listen, risking my job? The pressure from both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of my work and the needs of someone who trusted me."}
