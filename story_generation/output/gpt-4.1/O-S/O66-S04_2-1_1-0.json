The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the polling station just a few blocks away. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014civic duty, my parents\u2019 voices echoed in my head. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but if I took this detour now, I\u2019d risk my passenger missing his train. If I waited until after, I might get caught up with more fares and miss my chance to vote. My hands tightened on the wheel as I weighed the responsibility to my passenger against my responsibility as a citizen. The light turned green, and I hesitated, heart pounding, torn between two roads and the expectations waiting at the end of each."}
