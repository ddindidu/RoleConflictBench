My shift as a volunteer at the community kitchen started in less than half an hour, and the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions.\u201d But here I was, standing beside the CNC machine, watching the operator frown at the control panel. He\u2019d already adjusted the settings twice, and each time, the material waste piled up. As the machine repairer, I was expected to guide him, to make sure he understood the process and stopped making costly mistakes. He looked at me, frustration in his eyes, waiting for my advice. I knew if I left now, he\u2019d likely keep making errors, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, letting down the team that was counting on me. My stomach twisted as I weighed the responsibility to my client against my commitment to the kitchen, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
