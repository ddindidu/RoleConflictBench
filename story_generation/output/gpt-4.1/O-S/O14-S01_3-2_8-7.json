As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, I was responsible for every piece of equipment, and this one was flashing a warning about a possible leak. My mind raced through the safety protocols I\u2019d drilled into my team\u2014shut down, evacuate, report. But as a volunteer here, I was also under the coordinator\u2019s watchful eye. Just yesterday, she\u2019d emphasized new safety steps: no one was to approach malfunctioning equipment alone, and we were to wait for her or a supervisor before taking action. \n\nI stared at the blinking panel, heart pounding. The scientist in me wanted to act immediately, to prevent a disaster. But the volunteer in me remembered the coordinator\u2019s stern warning\u2014no exceptions, not even for me. I could almost hear her voice, reminding us that rules were there for everyone\u2019s safety. My hands hovered over the emergency shutoff, torn between my training and my orders. The seconds stretched, each one heavy with the weight of conflicting responsibilities."}
