The store manager expects perfection\u2014one mistake, and the numbers won\u2019t add up, and I\u2019ll be the one answering for it. My hands are tired, but I can\u2019t afford to rush. Just as I finish, I remember I need to vote before the polls close. I hurry over, my head still full of numbers and receipts. At the polling station, I sign my ballot envelope, but the ink smudges. The poll worker asks me to re-sign, explaining that a clear signature is required or my vote might not count. I hesitate, thinking about the strict rules I just followed at work\u2014no erasing, no double entries, everything by the book. Now, as a voter, I\u2019m being told to do something that feels like correcting a mistake, something I\u2019d never allow at the register. I feel torn, caught between the cashier\u2019s demand for accuracy and the voter\u2019s need to comply with instructions. My heart pounds as I stare at the envelope, unsure which rule to follow."}
