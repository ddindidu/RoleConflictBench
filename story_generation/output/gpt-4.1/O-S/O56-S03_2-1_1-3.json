A woman stands just inside, clutching her purse, eyes darting from the chairs to the mirrors. I know that look\u2014first-time nerves. I\u2019m supposed to greet her warmly, make her feel at home, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. The city newsletter. I remember the survey about the new bus routes, and I promised myself I\u2019d fill it out today. They want feedback from people like me, people who actually use the buses. I feel the weight of that responsibility, knowing my input could help shape the city\u2019s future. But right now, this client needs me to smile, to offer her a seat, to ask about her day. I can\u2019t do both at once. My mind races, torn between my duty to my community and my duty to this woman who just wants a good haircut and a little kindness. I grip the broom tighter, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both expect something from me, and I don\u2019t know which to choose first."}
