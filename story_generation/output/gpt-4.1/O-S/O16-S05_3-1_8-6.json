As a doctor, I knew what I had to do: prescribe the strongest antibiotic, act fast, and monitor every vital sign. The infection was spreading rapidly, and every minute counted. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the advocacy meeting I was supposed to attend in ten minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my presence was expected, my voice needed in court sessions and meetings that shaped policies for vulnerable groups. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. If I stayed, I might miss the meeting and let down those who depended on my advocacy. If I left, I risked delaying critical care for my patient. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of the person before me and the broader responsibilities waiting outside these hospital walls. My hands trembled as I tried to steady my thoughts, caught in the impossible pull of two lives demanding all of me at once."}
