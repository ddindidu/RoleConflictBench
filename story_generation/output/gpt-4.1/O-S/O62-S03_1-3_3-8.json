As a lifeguard, I knew the rules: keep the area safe, equipment tidy, and facilities ready for emergencies. I noticed a few pool chairs were out of line\u2014nothing major, but I remembered the supervisor\u2019s reminder about keeping everything perfect. I started to fix them, but then the building alarms blared. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning, and I could see water creeping up the street outside. As a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: I should help my neighbors, maybe check on the elderly couple next door, or at least make sure everyone was aware and safe. But as a lifeguard, I was supposed to stay and maintain the pool area, keep it ready in case people needed shelter. My heart pounded as I looked from the misaligned chairs to the rising water outside, torn between the duty to my job and the call to help my community."}
