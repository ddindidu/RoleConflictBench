As a telemarketer, every second is monitored\u2014if I step away from my calls for even a minute outside my allotted time, the compliance system will flag me. I\u2019ve seen coworkers get written up for less. But my phone buzzes with notifications: the post I made last night about our environmental campaign is exploding online. People are asking questions, hungry for more information. If I respond now, I could reach hundreds, maybe thousands, and really make a difference. My activist heart aches to jump in, to educate, to ride this wave of attention. But my job demands I stay glued to my script, my calls, my schedule. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the risk of disciplinary action and the chance to amplify my cause. The pressure builds in my chest as I weigh the expectations of my employer against the urgency of my activism, caught in the tightening grip of both worlds."}
