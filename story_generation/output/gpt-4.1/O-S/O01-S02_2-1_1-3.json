As an architect, I was trained to spot trouble, and today, I saw it: a load-bearing wall in the new community center was miscalculated. If left uncorrected, it could endanger everyone who walked through those doors. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my activist group. The city council was about to vote on a bill that could improve building safety codes, and the group\u2019s petition was about to be sent. They needed my signature, my voice, right now. But if I paused to sign, I\u2019d lose precious minutes to alert the construction team and halt the unsafe work. My mind raced. As an architect, I owed it to the public to ensure immediate safety. As an activist, I had a duty to push for long-term change. Both roles demanded my action, both felt urgent, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides. My hand hovered over the mouse, torn between the blueprint and the petition, heart pounding as I wrestled with which responsibility to answer first."}
