The sun was relentless, and the swimmers below seemed content, though a few kept drifting toward the deep end. I knew my job\u2014never let my guard down, not even for a second. But my phone buzzed in my bag, a reminder that my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes. I was supposed to be there on time, setting an example, but I couldn\u2019t just leave the pool unattended. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. Other volunteers could cover the start of my shift, but I was the only lifeguard on duty right now. My supervisor expected unwavering vigilance, but the center counted on my reliability too. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the armrest, torn between duty and commitment, knowing I had to choose."}
