She\u2019d just come out of surgery, and her eyes darted around the room, searching for reassurance. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here,\u201d I whispered, trying to steady my own nerves as I offered her a gentle smile. She squeezed my hand tighter, her voice barely above a whisper, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d I knew how much she needed comfort, and I wanted to stay, to be the calm presence she deserved.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I had to vote before my shift ended. I rushed to the polling station, my mind still with my patient. As I handed in my ballot, the poll worker frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the envelope is smudged. Could you please re-sign it?\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The expectation to follow the poll worker\u2019s instructions clashed with my urge to hurry back to my anxious patient. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the support my patient needed and fulfilling my civic duty as a voter."}
