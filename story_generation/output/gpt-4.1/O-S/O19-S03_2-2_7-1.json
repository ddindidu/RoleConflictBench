I knew how important it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on me for safe, accurate advice. But tonight, I was also just a neighbor, a citizen in this apartment building, and my friends were coming over for our long-awaited music night. We\u2019d planned it for weeks, but as I set up the speakers, I noticed Mrs. Lee\u2019s windows wide open across the courtyard. The clock ticked past the start of quiet hours, and I remembered the building\u2019s rules\u2014no loud noise after ten, out of respect for everyone\u2019s right to peace. My friends were excited, urging me to turn up the volume, but I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. As a pharmacist, I was supposed to be responsible and considerate, always thinking of others\u2019 well-being. As a citizen, I was expected to follow the law and respect my neighbors. The music in my hands, the rules in my head, I stood frozen, torn between disappointing my friends and disturbing the peace I was supposed to uphold."}
