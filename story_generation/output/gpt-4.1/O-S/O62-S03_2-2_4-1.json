Tonight, after my shift, I notice a lane rope is frayed and nearly snapped. If I don\u2019t fix it now, tomorrow\u2019s swim lessons could be a mess, maybe even unsafe. But the only tools I need are locked away, and the maintenance office is closed for the night. I know where the spare key is hidden, but technically, I\u2019m not supposed to access it after hours.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m just a regular citizen with plans to meet friends for music in my apartment. We\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week, but the building\u2019s quiet hours start soon. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always leaves her windows open in the evening, and she\u2019s sensitive to noise. I want to respect her peace and follow the building rules, but I also don\u2019t want to let my friends down.\n\nStanding in the empty pool area, I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. Fix the rope and risk breaking the rules, or leave it and risk someone\u2019s safety? Go ahead with music night and disturb my neighbor, or cancel and disappoint my friends? I can\u2019t seem to win, no matter what I choose."}
