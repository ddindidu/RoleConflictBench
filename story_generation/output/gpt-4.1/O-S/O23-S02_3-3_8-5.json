My mind raced\u2014client confidentiality was sacrosanct, the foundation of my profession as a lawyer. I could not betray that trust, no matter the pressure. Yet, as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from my activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for. The outcome would affect thousands, and the only undecided representative was someone I\u2019d built a rapport with. They needed me to call now, to lobby, to make a difference. But if I stepped away, I risked missing a crucial call from my client, or worse, being accused of stalling in negotiations. My heart pounded as I stared at the two phones, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided loyalty, each expecting me to act\u2014now."}
