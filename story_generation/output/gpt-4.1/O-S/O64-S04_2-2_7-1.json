The line snakes past the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My manager glances over, reminding me with a nod to keep things friendly and efficient. But as I scan groceries and make small talk, my mind keeps drifting to the polling station across town. I promised myself I\u2019d vote today, but the clock is ticking, and my shift won\u2019t end for another hour. If I leave right at closing, I might just make it before the polls shut. But what if the line here doesn\u2019t let up? What if someone calls in sick and I\u2019m asked to stay late? I feel torn\u2014my duty to the customers and my responsibility as a voter are pulling me in opposite directions. My hands move automatically, but my thoughts are tangled, wrestling with the fear of letting someone down, no matter what I choose."}
