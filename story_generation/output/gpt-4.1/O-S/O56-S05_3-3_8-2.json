She needed a deep cleanse before I could even think about cutting\u2014my scissors would snag and pull otherwise. But as I worked, she leaned back and whispered, \u201cI got a letter from my landlord. He\u2019s threatening eviction. I need to know what to do, right now.\u201d My mind raced. As her hairdresser, I was expected to focus on her hair, to detangle and condition thoroughly before styling. But as her advocate, I knew she depended on me for clear, immediate legal advice\u2014her home was at stake. The shampoo foamed between my fingers, but my thoughts tangled worse than her hair. Should I pause the wash to give her my full attention as an advocate, or finish the job my salon expects of me? Both roles demanded my presence, but I couldn\u2019t split myself in two. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the weight of her trust and the pressure of my professional standards pressing in from both sides."}
