My shift is routine until a blip nears the sector boundary. I coordinate with the next controller, making sure the handoff is seamless\u2014safety depends on it. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a friend at the demonstration downtown, urging me to join. I remember the barricades set up by the city, the law forbidding anyone from crossing onto the restricted property. But the crowd\u2019s energy is electric, and my friend insists it\u2019s our right to be heard. I want to support the cause, to stand with my community, but I also know the rules are there for a reason. My mind races: as an air traffic controller, I\u2019m trained to follow procedures, to respect boundaries for the greater good. As a citizen, I feel the pull to challenge what I see as injustice. The radio crackles, the demonstration chants echo in my mind, and I feel torn\u2014caught between the order I enforce at work and the passion I feel as a member of this city."}
