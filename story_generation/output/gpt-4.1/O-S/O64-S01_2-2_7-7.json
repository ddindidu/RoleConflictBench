As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to greet every customer with a smile, keep the line moving, and make each person feel welcome. Today, the line snakes past the bakery, and I can sense the impatience growing. I try to keep my tone light, asking about people\u2019s days, scanning items quickly, and double-checking prices. But in the back of my mind, I can\u2019t shake the volunteer coordinator\u2019s words from this morning\u2019s briefing: \u201cEveryone must follow the new safety steps\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I volunteered to help at the register today, and the new guidelines mean I should sanitize the counter and keypad after every customer, even if it slows things down. The customers are watching, some tapping their feet, others glancing at their watches. I feel the pressure to keep them happy, but I also know the coordinator will check if we\u2019re following the rules. My hands hover over the sanitizer bottle, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
