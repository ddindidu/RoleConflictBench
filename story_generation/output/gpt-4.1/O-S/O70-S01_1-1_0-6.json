It was already 4:30, later than I\u2019d hoped, but still within the delivery window. My phone buzzed with a new email from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter. She\u2019d suggested that, if I had time after my shift, I could help reorganize the supply closet\u2014she\u2019d even attached a diagram. I knew how much she valued volunteers following her guidelines, and I wanted to show I was reliable. But I also knew Mrs. Lee was waiting for her medication, and the rest of my route was tight. If I hurried, I could finish deliveries on time, but I\u2019d barely have a moment to help at the shelter. If I stayed late to help organize, I\u2019d risk rushing my deliveries or making a mistake. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: be the dependable delivery person, or the committed volunteer. Both roles mattered to me, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to meet both demands."}
