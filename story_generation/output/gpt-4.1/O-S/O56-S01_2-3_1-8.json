Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. As a hairdresser, I knew how important it was to greet clients warmly, to make them feel at ease from the moment they walked in. I started toward her, rehearsing my welcoming smile, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator\u2014urgent, all caps. The new directive was strict: every volunteer had to follow the updated safety procedures immediately, or the service we provided would be shut down. My heart pounded. I was supposed to be present, attentive, and comforting to my client, but the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind, demanding my immediate compliance. I stood frozen, torn between the anxious client waiting for my attention and the pressing responsibility to uphold the volunteer guidelines. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt the tension rising as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
