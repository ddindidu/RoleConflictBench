Pilots\u2019 voices come through, tense and expectant, waiting for my revised climb instructions to keep them clear of turbulence. My fingers hover over the console, ready to relay new altitudes, every second critical for their safety. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a local alert: a heat advisory. I remember Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone just down the hall. She\u2019s frail, and the last time the temperature soared, she nearly fainted. The city urges us all to check on vulnerable neighbors, to be good citizens and help in emergencies. My mind races\u2014if I leave my post, pilots could be at risk.
