As a lifeguard, I knew I had to act\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, even if it meant being the bad guy. But before I could move, the building\u2019s alarms blared, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. Through the glass, I saw water creeping up the street, swirling around parked cars. As a citizen, I was supposed to help\u2014evacuate, alert neighbors, maybe even check on the elderly couple next door. My heart pounded. Should I rush outside to help my community, or stay and confront the reckless teens, risking their safety if I left? Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of responsibility pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the pool and the rising floodwaters, knowing I had to choose."}
