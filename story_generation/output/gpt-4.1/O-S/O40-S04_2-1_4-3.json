The contractor was clear: everything had to be ready by the end of the day, and the electrician was already waiting for me to finish so he could start his work. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote. I\u2019d planned to go during my lunch break, but the hinges for the cabinet doors had arrived late, and now every minute counted. I knew I needed to bring my ID, but I\u2019d left my main card at home. I had a backup in my wallet, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. If not, I\u2019d have to leave the site again later, risking the project\u2019s timeline. The team was counting on me to keep things moving, but I also felt the weight of my civic duty. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my craft and my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the pressure build as I tried to figure out how to be both a reliable carpenter and a responsible voter."}
