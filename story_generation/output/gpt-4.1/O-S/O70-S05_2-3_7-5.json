I forced a polite smile, recalling the company\u2019s training: always communicate professionally, no matter how stressed or rushed. As I apologized and explained the delay, my other phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a message from my law firm. The trial for my client, whose future hinged on today\u2019s verdict, was about to begin. My presence in court was non-negotiable; I was expected to advocate fiercely, to be fully present and prepared. But here I was, caught between a customer\u2019s demand for immediate answers and a client\u2019s desperate need for representation. My heart pounded as I juggled the pizza boxes, the customer\u2019s glare, and the weight of my client\u2019s trust. I could feel the expectations of both roles pressing in, each demanding my undivided attention, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds that refused to wait."}
