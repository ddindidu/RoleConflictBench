The radar screen is almost empty, and for once, there\u2019s no need to juggle holding patterns or reroute flights. My headset hums with the low static of a world at rest. But my phone vibrates insistently\u2014my client, desperate for legal advice, needs an answer before sunrise. She\u2019s facing an urgent issue, and my words could shape her next move. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both headsets: one for the skies, one for the law. The expectation here is absolute focus\u2014pilots trust me to keep them safe, and my client trusts me to guide her through legal turbulence.
