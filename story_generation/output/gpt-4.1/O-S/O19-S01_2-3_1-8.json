Her chart was complicated, and I knew how much she depended on me to get her medications right. As I was about to finish, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator at the community clinic where I also served. The message was marked urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the clinic risked being shut down. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were strict\u2014no exceptions, no delays. My mind raced. If I left the pharmacy counter now to help at the clinic, I\u2019d risk making a mistake with Mrs. Lee\u2019s prescription. But if I ignored the coordinator\u2019s directive, the clinic might close, leaving dozens without care. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with real consequences for people who depended on me. My hands trembled as I tried to decide what to do next."}
