As a carpenter, I knew the urgency\u2014termites had eaten through the support, and the family needed a repair plan before the house became unsafe. They looked at me, anxious, expecting answers and reassurance. I started explaining what needed to be done, but then the conversation shifted. The homeowner, grateful for my help, began chatting about her family, her struggles, and the challenges they\u2019d faced. As a volunteer, I was trained to respect privacy, to never pry or share what I learned in these homes. But now, as I assessed the damage, I realized I needed more information\u2014about the house, about who lived here, about what might be hidden behind the walls. I felt the pressure mounting: the family expected me to fix their home, but my role as a volunteer demanded I tread carefully, never overstepping, never making them feel exposed. I hesitated, caught between the urgency of my craft and the boundaries of my promise."}
