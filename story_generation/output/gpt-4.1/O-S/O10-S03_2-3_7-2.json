As an accountant, I knew I had to be clear and professional, even as the noise from the street demonstration outside my office window grew louder. The client\u2019s voice was tense, demanding answers, and I felt the pressure to resolve the issue quickly and accurately.\n\nJust then, I stepped outside to get better reception and found myself swept into the crowd. Someone beside me, a fellow protester, urged me to step past a police barricade onto restricted city property, insisting it was the only way to make our voices heard. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the law and public property, but the energy of the crowd was infectious, and the cause felt urgent.\n\nMy phone buzzed again\u2014the client was waiting. I stood at the edge of the barricade, torn between my duty to my client and my responsibility as a law-abiding citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
