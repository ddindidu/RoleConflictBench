My heart pounded\u2014there was a discrepancy in last quarter\u2019s report, and they needed a response by the end of the day. As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my responsibility to ensure every number was correct, every regulation followed. The pressure to protect the company from penalties weighed heavily on me.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from the volunteer coordinator flashed on the screen: \u201cUrgent\u2014new safety procedures must be implemented immediately. All volunteers must report to the center now or risk the service being shut down.\u201d I knew how much the community relied on us, and the coordinator\u2019s expectations were clear\u2014my presence was non-negotiable.\n\nI felt torn, anxiety rising in my chest. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, both with serious consequences if I failed. I glanced between the tax notice and my phone, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, unsure which duty to answer first."}
