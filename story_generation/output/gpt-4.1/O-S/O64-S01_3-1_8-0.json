My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAlways greet with a smile, no matter what.\u201d The woman in front of me slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp as she complains about a missing discount. I force a smile, trying to stay calm and patient, even as my heart pounds. I glance at the clock\u2014my volunteer shift at the shelter starts in fifteen minutes across town. I promised them I\u2019d be on time, but I can\u2019t just abandon my post here, not with so many people waiting and my manager watching. I know the shelter has plenty of volunteers tonight, but I also know how much they count on me to show up when I say I will. My mind races, torn between the expectation to be the ever-friendly cashier and the reliable volunteer. The customer\u2019s voice blurs as I wrestle with what to do next, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
