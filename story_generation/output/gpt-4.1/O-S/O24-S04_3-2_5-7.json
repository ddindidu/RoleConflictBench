The defendant\u2019s family waited anxiously for my order\u2014without it, he\u2019d spend another night in custody. The law demanded clarity and precision; every word I wrote could shape a life. My laptop blinked with reminders, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was the polling station. I\u2019d voted by mail that morning, but now a poll worker explained my signature was smudged. If I didn\u2019t return soon to re-sign, my ballot might be rejected. I felt the weight of civic duty\u2014every vote mattered, especially in this tight election. But the court expected my immediate attention, and the defendant\u2019s freedom hung in the balance. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the demands of justice and democracy, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
