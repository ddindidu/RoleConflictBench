The client was waiting for my time estimates before signing the contract, and the team needed my input to finalize the project plan. I tried to focus on the voting process, but my mind kept drifting back to the spreadsheet I\u2019d left open on my laptop. Suddenly, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d I glanced at the new line\u2014longer, slower, but following instructions was part of my civic duty as a voter. Yet, every minute spent here was a minute my team waited, the client grew impatient, and the project slipped further from certainty. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. Should I stay in the faster line and risk breaking the rules, or follow instructions and delay my work even more? My heart pounded as I shuffled my feet, caught between the demands of my profession and my duty as a citizen, unable to satisfy both at once."}
