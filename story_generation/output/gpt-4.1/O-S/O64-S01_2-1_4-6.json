My mind kept drifting to the volunteer shift I\u2019d just finished, where the coordinator had emailed a suggestion about reorganizing the supply closet if I had time. I wanted to help, to show I was reliable, but now, at the store, I had to focus on my cashier duties. Suddenly, a customer approached, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded, explaining it was a gift and she just wanted to exchange it. Store policy was clear: no returns without a receipt. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, no exceptions. But I could feel the pressure from my volunteer role too\u2014if I stayed late here, I\u2019d have no time to help at the center. My chest tightened as I weighed the customer\u2019s frustration against the store\u2019s strict policy, and the volunteer coordinator\u2019s hope that I\u2019d pitch in. I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t fully give."}
