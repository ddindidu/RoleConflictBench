I nod, feeling the weight of the task settle on my shoulders. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I\u2019m supposed to be on the radio in five minutes, talking about the workers\u2019 rights campaign I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The community is counting on me to speak up, to educate, to inspire. But here I am, boots caked in dust, hands aching, staring at a pile of lumber that isn\u2019t going to move itself. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my crew and risk my job. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to reach hundreds of listeners who need to hear our message. My heart pounds as I stand frozen between two worlds, each demanding more than I feel I can give."}
