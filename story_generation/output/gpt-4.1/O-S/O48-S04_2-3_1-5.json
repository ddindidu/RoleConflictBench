Mrs. Lee, just out of surgery, winces as I help her sit up. She\u2019s frail, her movements slow and uncertain. I know she needs me to help her get dressed and settled before dinner, and I can\u2019t rush her\u2014she trusts me to be gentle, to keep her safe. But my mind keeps drifting to my purse in the break room, where my ID sits ready. The polls close in less than an hour, and this is my only chance to vote. I promised myself I\u2019d make my voice heard this year, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s comfort and dignity are in my hands right now. My supervisor expects me to give every patient my full attention, but the world outside expects me to show up as a responsible citizen. I feel torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me as I weigh the needs of the person in front of me against the duty I owe to my community."}
