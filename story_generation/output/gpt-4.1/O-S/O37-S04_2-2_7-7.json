As a housekeeping cleaner, I\u2019d spent hours scrubbing surfaces, always careful to wear gloves, mask, and follow every hygiene protocol. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever touch anything without protection. Safety first, always.\u201d Now, as a voter, I held my ballot envelope, noticing the ink had smudged. The poll worker smiled and handed it back. \u201cCould you please re-sign this? We want to make sure your vote counts.\u201d I glanced at the communal pen, lying bare on the table, touched by dozens of hands. My instincts screamed at me to ask for sanitizer, to put on gloves, to refuse. But the poll worker\u2019s expectant gaze and the line of people behind me pressed in. I felt torn\u2014my duty to protect myself and others from germs clashing with my responsibility to follow the voting process. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between the rules of my job and the demands of my civic duty, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
