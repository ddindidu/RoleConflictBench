My mind was focused on maximizing natural light and creating collaborative spaces\u2014every detail mattered. The company expected me to design a floor plan that would boost productivity and comfort for every employee. Just as I was finalizing the layout, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center.\n\nLater, at the check-in table, a client leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal concern about their living situation. I listened, nodding, feeling the weight of their trust. But as they spoke, I realized their issue could be addressed by a design feature I was considering for the office\u2014something that could help people in similar situations. My mind raced. As an architect, I wanted to use this insight to improve my design, but as a volunteer, I was bound to protect their privacy. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between my professional drive to create better spaces and my ethical duty to keep their confidence."}
