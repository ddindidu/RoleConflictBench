As an accountant, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014especially now, with the external auditor\u2019s email blinking on my screen, demanding immediate access to the latest financial statements. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo mistakes, no delays.\u201d I started gathering the files, my fingers moving automatically, but my thoughts kept drifting to the courthouse across town.\n\nAs an advocate, I was supposed to be there in less than an hour, ready to represent my client in a trial that could change their life forever. They were counting on me to be prepared, focused, and persuasive. I could almost hear their anxious voice from our last meeting, trusting me to fight for them. But the numbers on my screen wouldn\u2019t balance, and the auditor\u2019s deadline loomed.

I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure mount with every passing second."}
