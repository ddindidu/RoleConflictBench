Suddenly, the intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, could you tell me which stop is closest to the museum?\u201d a passenger asked, their voice uncertain. I knew my duty as a subway operator: keep passengers safe, answer their questions, and provide a sense of calm. I reached for the microphone, ready to respond, when my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was marked urgent: \u201cAll volunteers must immediately implement the new safety protocol. Failure to comply could result in service suspension.\u201d My heart pounded. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays. But the passenger was waiting, and I could hear the anxiety in their voice. I felt torn, caught between the expectations of my job and my commitment as a volunteer. The seconds ticked by, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
