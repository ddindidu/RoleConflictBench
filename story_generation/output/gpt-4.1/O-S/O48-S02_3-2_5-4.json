As a nursing assistant, I know I have to check his vitals every few minutes\u2014his life could depend on it. My hands are steady as I record his blood pressure, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. I see the message: the legislative aide is available for a call, but only for the next ten minutes. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for as an activist\u2014my chance to push for the bill that could change so many lives. My supervisor expects me to stay by Mr. Lee\u2019s side, but the advocacy group is counting on me to speak up now. My heart pounds with the weight of both responsibilities. I stare at the phone, then at Mr. Lee, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
