The checklist for safety inspections was taped to the wall, a daily ritual before any structural work began. I knew how important it was\u2014one missed crack in a hammer handle, one dull blade, and someone could get hurt. My crew depended on me to keep the site safe, and I took that responsibility seriously.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was starting. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved this year, to listen, to ask questions, to vote with real knowledge. The city was changing fast, and I wanted my voice to count. I could hear the candidates\u2019 voices through the phone, already debating issues that mattered to me.\n\nI glanced at the tools, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in.
