The automated compliance system tracks every second I\u2019m not on a call, and I know if I step away now, even for a few minutes, I\u2019ll get flagged. My supervisor\u2019s warning from last week still echoes in my mind\u2014one more unscheduled break and I could be written up. But my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d I glance at the clock. My next scheduled break is in forty minutes. The protest is small, and every person counts. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my job demanding strict adherence to rules, my conscience urging me to stand up for what I believe in. My heart pounds as I hover over the \u201clog off\u201d button, torn between risking my job and letting my friends down."}
