My break is scheduled for 2:00 p.m., but the phone queue is still packed, and I know management is tracking every second I\u2019m away from my desk. The supervisor\u2019s reminders echo in my head: \u201cStick to your break times, but don\u2019t leave the queue hanging.\u201d I feel the pressure to be a model employee, to not let the team down or risk a reprimand. But today is also Election Day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station is just a few blocks away, open all day, and my workload is lighter than usual. Still, I can\u2019t just walk out\u2014my break is only fifteen minutes, barely enough time to get there and back, let alone cast my ballot. I stare at my phone, torn between my duty as a citizen and my responsibility as a telemarketer, anxiety twisting in my stomach as I weigh which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
