My team is waiting for my technical input\u2014without it, the new feature can\u2019t move forward, and the deadline is looming. Slack pings with reminders from the product team, and I know they\u2019re counting on me to collaborate, to clarify the architecture so everyone can proceed. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. This is the moment\u2014ten minutes to make the case for the bill I\u2019ve poured my heart into, the one that could actually change lives. My activist group is counting on me to advocate, to seize this rare chance to influence policy. \n\nMy mind races. If I take the call, I\u2019ll leave my team hanging, maybe jeopardize the project. If I ignore it, I might miss the only shot we have at real change. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that both need me, right now."}
