It was a slow afternoon, and I made sure to smile, ask about their day, and double-check every item. My manager always said that friendly service kept people coming back, and I took pride in making each person feel welcome. But my mind kept drifting to the election. I had just enough time to finish my shift and rush to the polling station before it closed.\n\nWhen I arrived, breathless, an official frowned at my ID. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form. But you have to finish before we close in ten minutes.\u201d I glanced at the long form and the clock. I remembered the training: follow every instruction exactly, no shortcuts, or my vote might not count.\n\nMy phone buzzed\u2014my manager, asking if I could come back for a last-minute customer. I felt torn. As a cashier, I was supposed to be helpful and available. As a voter, I was supposed to follow every rule, no matter how rushed I felt. My hands shook as I stared at the form, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet."}
