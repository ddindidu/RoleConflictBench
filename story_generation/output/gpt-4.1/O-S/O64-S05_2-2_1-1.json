The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, no mistakes, no delays. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014my client, desperate for advice. Their case has taken a complicated turn, and they need me to explain their options, to be the advocate I promised I\u2019d be. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down. If I pause to answer, the line will grow, my manager will frown, and customers will grumble. If I ignore the message, my client might make a costly mistake without my guidance. My mind races, torn between the demands of the register and the responsibility to my client. The beeping continues, the phone buzzes again, and I stand there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
