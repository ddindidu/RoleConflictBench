Someone turns to me, eyes bright with curiosity, and asks, \u201cYou\u2019re representing that client, right? What\u2019s really going on?\u201d I feel the familiar weight of my lawyer\u2019s oath\u2014confidentiality is non-negotiable, even in casual conversation. But my phone buzzes insistently in my pocket. I glance down to see that a post about my activist cause is exploding online. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014a chance to educate, to clarify, to rally support. If I comment, I could shed light on the broader issues, but I know that anything I say might be traced back to my client\u2019s case, blurring the line between advocacy and confidentiality. My mind races, torn between the duty to protect my client and the urge to seize this rare opportunity for public engagement. The expectations of both worlds press in on me, and I feel the tension coil in my chest as I weigh my next move."}
