The clerk rushes in, handing me a thick stack of papers\u2014an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. I know I must review every detail, every affidavit, and make a ruling within the hour. The law demands my full attention, my impartiality, my diligence. As I begin to scan the first page, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks, finally available for a ten-minute call about the bill I\u2019ve poured my heart into. This is the moment to push for real change, to advocate for those whose voices are rarely heard. My mind races. If I take the call, I risk neglecting my duty as a judge, possibly overlooking a crucial detail in the case. If I ignore the call, I may lose the chance to influence policy that could help so many. My hands tremble as I stare at the phone, torn between the demands of justice and the pull of my convictions."}
