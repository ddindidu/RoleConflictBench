The foreman had just reminded us\u2014again\u2014about the importance of safety and keeping the site spotless. I knew how quickly a stray nail or a cluttered corner could turn into a trip to the ER. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen. The notification was from our activist group\u2019s page\u2014a post about our cause was exploding online. Hundreds of comments, people asking questions, some spreading misinformation. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, the perfect chance to educate and set the record straight. But my hands were covered in dust, and the foreman was watching. If I stopped now to type out a thoughtful response, I\u2019d be breaking site rules and risking someone\u2019s safety. If I waited, the momentum online might fade. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the responsibility to my crew and the urgency of my cause."}
