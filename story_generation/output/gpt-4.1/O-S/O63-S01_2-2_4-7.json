Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to the volunteer shift I\u2019d promised to cover right after work. The coordinator had been clear in the last briefing: new safety steps were non-negotiable, and everyone had to follow them to the letter. I knew I\u2019d be expected to set an example.\n\nBut now, with my sales target looming, I wondered if I could afford to leave on time. If I stayed late to make more calls, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift and might rush through the safety procedures, letting people down. If I left on time, I\u2019d risk missing my target and disappointing my manager. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations on both sides, feeling torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to volunteering."}
