As a judge, I know the parties are waiting for my final judgment\u2014thirty days to write a clear, thorough opinion that will shape their lives. The law demands precision, and I owe it to everyone involved to get it right. But the volunteer service I care about is in crisis. The coordinator\u2019s message is clear: unless I follow the new procedures immediately, the program could be shut down, leaving dozens without support. I promised to help, and the guidelines are strict\u2014no room for delay or improvisation. My mind races, torn between the weight of justice and the desperate needs of the community. Each role pulls at me, expectations mounting, and I feel the pressure building as I try to decide where my responsibility lies."}
