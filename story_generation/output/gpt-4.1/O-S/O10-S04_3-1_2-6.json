They needed the financial statements\u2014immediately. My heart raced. Accuracy was everything in my job as an accountant, and I couldn\u2019t afford a single error, especially not with an audit looming. But today was also election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before heading back to the office. \n\nAt the polling station, I joined the line, clutching my ID and thinking through the numbers I\u2019d left unfinished. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name was Baker. The new line was longer, but the official insisted. I hesitated, glancing at my watch. The auditor\u2019s request echoed in my mind\u2014I needed every spare minute to get those statements right. But as a voter, I was expected to follow the officials\u2019 instructions, no questions asked. \n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I obey the official and risk losing precious time, or stay put and risk being reprimanded for not following the rules? My mind spun, caught between duty and responsibility, unable to move forward."}
