I\u2019ve been a customer for years!\u201d My script told me to reassure her, to answer every question with patience, but my eyes kept darting to the clock. I had to get home before noon if I wanted to grab my ID\u2014without it, I couldn\u2019t vote, and tomorrow\u2019s shift was a double. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection, never rush a call, but the weight of civic duty pressed on me. Mrs. Carter\u2019s frustration grew, and I could hear the disappointment in her tone, expecting me to give her the time and clarity she deserved. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my job and my right as a voter. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach as I tried to be both the attentive telemarketer and the responsible citizen, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
