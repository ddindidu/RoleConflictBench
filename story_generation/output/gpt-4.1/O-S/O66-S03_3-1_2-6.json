My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. As a taxi driver, I knew he expected me to get him to the airport on time, no matter the weather. But the roads were slick, and every minute I spent driving faster than I should was a risk\u2014not just to us, but to everyone else on the road. \n\nAt the same time, as a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get my taxes done early this year, and the vaccine clinic at the community center was this weekend. I wanted to set a good example, to do my part for public health and civic responsibility. But right now, all I could think about was the pressure to speed up, to ignore the rules for the sake of my passenger\u2019s schedule. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what was right\u2014for him, for me, and for everyone else out there in the storm."}
