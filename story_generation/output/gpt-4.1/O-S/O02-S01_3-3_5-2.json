The flagged safety issue was serious\u2014if I didn\u2019t address it right now, the plant could be shut down for days. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Make sure everything\u2019s compliant.\u201d I knew what was at stake, not just for the company, but for everyone\u2019s jobs. But as I glanced at the clock, panic crept in. My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and I was the only one scheduled to open the community center. People would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on us for their only hot meal of the day. I could picture their faces, the trust they placed in me to show up. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cUnlock doors by 5:00 PM.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. I couldn\u2019t let the plant down, but I couldn\u2019t let the community down either. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out what to do next, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
