The journal\u2019s submission portal is already sending me reminders\u2014this paper, months in the making, must be uploaded tonight or I\u2019ll miss the deadline. Every detail needs to be precise; as a scientist, I owe it to my field to report my findings honestly and thoroughly. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place down the street closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the zoning laws on my block, and I\u2019ve spent weeks reading up, talking to neighbors, and weighing the pros and cons. As a citizen, I believe in participating, in making my voice heard, in shaping the community I live in. My heart pounds as I glance between the data and the clock. If I leave now, I risk missing the journal deadline. If I stay, I forfeit my chance to vote on something that matters deeply to me and my neighbors. The weight of both responsibilities presses down, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014my colleagues, my community, or maybe even myself."}
