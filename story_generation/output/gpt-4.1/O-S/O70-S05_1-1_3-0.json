As a delivery person, I was expected to leave the package safely at the doorstep, snap a photo, and confirm the delivery. But as I approached the house, I recognized the name on the label\u2014Mrs. Patel, one of my pro bono clients. She\u2019d recently confided in me about a neighbor\u2019s dispute, and I\u2019d promised to keep her information confidential. Now, standing at her empty porch, I hesitated. If I left the package in plain sight, it could be stolen, violating my duty to secure deliveries. But if I hid it or delayed the drop-off, I risked breaching the delivery company\u2019s strict protocols. My phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Patel, asking for a quick update on her case. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the company\u2019s demand for efficiency and security, and my client\u2019s trust in my discretion and legal guidance. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation to honor first, caught between the uniform on my back and the promise I\u2019d made."}
