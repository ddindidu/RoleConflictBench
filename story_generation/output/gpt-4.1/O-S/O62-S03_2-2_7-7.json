As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. That\u2019s when I spotted a group of teenagers laughing and diving right under the bold, red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My training screamed at me to intervene immediately\u2014one wrong move and someone could be seriously hurt. But as a citizen, I couldn\u2019t ignore the heat advisory blaring from my phone. My elderly neighbor, Mrs. Kim, lived alone on the floor above. She rarely turned on her air conditioning, and I worried about her in this oppressive heat. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the pool needed my vigilance, but Mrs. Kim might need my help. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and my responsibility to my community. I gripped the whistle tighter, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between duty and compassion, knowing I had to choose."}
