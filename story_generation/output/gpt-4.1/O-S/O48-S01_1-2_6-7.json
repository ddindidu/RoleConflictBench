She looked up at me with tired eyes, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked if I could stay a little longer. She\u2019d been feeling lonely, she said, and just wanted someone to talk to. As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to provide emotional support and companionship, especially for patients like Mrs. Lee who didn\u2019t have many visitors. I pulled up a chair, ready to listen, when my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to follow the new safety steps\u2014no lingering in patient rooms longer than necessary.\u201d The new guidelines were strict, and we\u2019d been told to apply them without exception. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014Mrs. Lee\u2019s need for comfort, and the coordinator\u2019s clear instructions. My heart ached as I sat there, torn between staying to support her and following the rules I\u2019d promised to uphold."}
