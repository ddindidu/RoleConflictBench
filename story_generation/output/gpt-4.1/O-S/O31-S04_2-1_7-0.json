As a police officer, I knew I had to act with integrity and fairness, carefully listening to both sides, gathering evidence, and making an unbiased report. My badge demanded that I not rush, that I give each person the respect and attention they deserved. But as I glanced at my watch, a knot tightened in my stomach. Today was election day, and I had promised myself I would vote. The polling station was only open for a few more hours, and though my schedule was light, this accident was taking longer than expected. I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing against the demands of my uniform. I wanted to do right by these drivers, but I also wanted my voice to count in the election. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I found myself torn, standing in the middle of the road, wrestling with what to do next."}
