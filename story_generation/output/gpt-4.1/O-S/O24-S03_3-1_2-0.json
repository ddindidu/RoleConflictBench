An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed\u2014my clerk\u2019s message was clear: I needed to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My mind immediately shifted gears, the weight of my judicial responsibility pressing down. I found a bench, pulled out my tablet, and began scanning the case files, but the park\u2019s gentle breeze and laughter of children tugged at my attention. \n\nAs I read, I absentmindedly unwrapped a granola bar, the wrapper fluttering from my hand and landing near the path. I froze, glancing at the no-littering sign and the trash bin just a few steps away. As a citizen, I knew I should pick it up immediately\u2014respecting public property was a value I held dear. But as a judge, the clock was ticking, and every second spent away from the case could mean failing in my duty to ensure justice. My heart pounded as I stared at the wrapper, torn between the expectations of my two roles, feeling the pressure mount with every passing moment."}
