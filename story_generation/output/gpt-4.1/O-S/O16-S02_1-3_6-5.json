The exam room door closed behind me, and I saw Mrs. Patel, her voice raspy, waiting for my diagnosis. As a doctor, I knew she needed antibiotics for her strep throat, and I owed her my full attention\u2014listening, explaining, prescribing the right treatment. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The activist group chat was exploding: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could expand healthcare access for thousands. The vote was tied, and the swing representative was taking calls for the next hour only. My colleagues expected me, as a leading voice, to make that call and sway the decision. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my patient\u2019s trust in this room, and the hope of so many outside it. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of the person before me and the broader cause I\u2019d sworn to fight for. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
