As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay ahead of new regulations; my clients depended on my expertise to keep them compliant. The seminar was scheduled for tomorrow, right in the middle of the day. At the same moment, my phone buzzed. It was a client, frantic and desperate, facing an urgent legal issue that required immediate, precise advice. As their advocate, I was their lifeline, the one they trusted to guide them through crises. My mind raced. If I attended the seminar, I\u2019d be better equipped to ensure compliance in the future, but I\u2019d leave my client without the support they needed right now. If I stayed to help, I\u2019d risk falling behind on critical updates. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, knowledgeable, and reliable. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the demands of today and the needs of tomorrow."}
