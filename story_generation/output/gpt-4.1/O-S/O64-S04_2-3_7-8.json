I smile, scan items, and chat with customers, trying to keep things moving and spirits high. My manager expects me to be quick and friendly, and I can see impatience growing in the faces of those waiting. Suddenly, I glance at the clock\u2014only ten minutes left before the polling station closes. I remember the election official\u2019s words: because of a registration issue, I have to fill out a provisional ballot form, and I must do it before closing time. My heart pounds. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my manager and the customers who count on me for efficient service. But if I stay, I might lose my chance to vote, something I believe is my civic duty. The pressure from both sides is crushing. I feel torn, standing at my register, caught between the expectations of my job and the demands of my role as a responsible citizen, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
