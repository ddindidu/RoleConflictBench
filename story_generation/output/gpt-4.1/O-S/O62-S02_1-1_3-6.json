They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, but I knew part of my job as a lifeguard was to keep everything orderly and safe. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cAttention to detail matters.\u201d As I moved to fix them, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my activist group\u2019s latest post was exploding online. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, the perfect chance to educate thousands about our cause if I could just add a thoughtful comment now. My heart pounded. If I stopped to type, I\u2019d be neglecting my lifeguard duties, risking a reprimand or worse. But if I ignored the post, I\u2019d miss a rare opportunity to make a real impact. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the pool chairs and my phone, feeling the pressure mount."}
