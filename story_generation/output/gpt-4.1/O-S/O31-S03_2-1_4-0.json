As a police officer, I was expected to keep the area safe and orderly, making sure everyone followed the rules. The accident had drawn a small crowd, and I was busy directing traffic and calming anxious witnesses. When things settled, I took a moment to breathe and walked along the path, still in uniform. As a citizen, I always tried to follow the law and respect public spaces. I noticed a crumpled soda can on the grass, just a few steps from a trash bin and beneath a clear no-littering sign. I hesitated. If I picked it up, I\u2019d be setting a good example, but I was still technically on duty\u2014my focus should be on the accident scene, not cleaning the park. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be failing my own standards as a responsible citizen. The expectations of my badge and my conscience pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
