As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014patients depended on me to give them the right advice, and I prided myself on never missing a workshop. But as the clock ticked past six, my mind kept drifting to the polling station across town. Today was the last day to vote, and I had only this evening to get there with my ID. The workshop was running late, and I could feel the tension building in my chest. If I left early, I\u2019d miss key updates that could affect my patients\u2019 safety. If I stayed, I might lose my only chance to vote, a civic duty I valued deeply. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cBring your ID to the polls.\u201d I glanced at my bag, where my ID sat ready, and then back at the speaker, who was now discussing a new drug interaction. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I felt torn, unable to ignore the demands of either role."}
