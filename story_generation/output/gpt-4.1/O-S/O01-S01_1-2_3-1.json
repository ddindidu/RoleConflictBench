The renovation layout for my studio was almost done, but something about the entryway felt off\u2014too narrow, maybe, or not enough light. As an architect, I couldn\u2019t let it go; every detail mattered, even for my own space. I erased a line, redrew it, and checked the time again. My phone buzzed with a reminder: volunteer shift starts in twenty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need everyone on time today. No exceptions.\u201d I pictured the food pantry, the line of people waiting, the other volunteers counting on me. But the unfinished sketch tugged at me, demanding my attention, my perfectionism refusing to let me leave it half-baked. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the reliable volunteer, or the meticulous architect. I stared at the clock, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
