She smiled at me, her eyes grateful, and I knew how much she depended on these small moments of care. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse across town, where I was supposed to be in less than an hour. As an advocate, I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there, ready to speak up for her in a case that could change her life. The expectation was clear: punctuality, unwavering support, no excuses.\n\nYet here I was, still in my scrubs, with three more patients waiting for help with breakfast and medication. The nursing staff was already stretched thin, and I knew if I left now, Mrs. Lee might have to wait for someone else\u2014someone who didn\u2019t know her routine, who might rush her or miss the gentle encouragement she needed. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of two promises pulling me in opposite directions."}
