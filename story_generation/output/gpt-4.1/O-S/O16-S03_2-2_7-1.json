As her doctor, I knew she needed her immunosuppressant refilled without delay\u2014her health depended on it. The pharmacy\u2019s new policy, though, required a fresh in-person evaluation, and I was already running late. My friends were waiting for me to join them for our long-planned music night in my apartment. I glanced at the clock; it was almost 9 p.m., the start of our building\u2019s quiet hours. As a citizen, I was expected to respect those rules, especially since my neighbor, Mr. Patel, had left his windows open, and he\u2019d complained before about noise. The weight of my responsibilities pressed on me: Mrs. Lee\u2019s well-being on one side, my friends\u2019 expectations and the building\u2019s rules on the other. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my patient and my obligation to my neighbors and the law. I could feel the tension building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
