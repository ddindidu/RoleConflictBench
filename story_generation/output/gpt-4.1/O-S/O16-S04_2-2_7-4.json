My patient, Mrs. Lee, sits across from me, her hands trembling as she describes her worsening symptoms. She needs her medication adjusted today\u2014her condition is delicate, and any delay could mean a dangerous flare-up. I know I should take the time to review her chart thoroughly, consult with her specialist, and ensure she leaves with the right prescription and a clear plan.\n\nBut I can\u2019t ignore the other voice in my head. Today is the only morning I can get home to pick up my valid ID for voting. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll miss my chance to participate in tomorrow\u2019s election\u2014something I believe is my civic duty. The expectation is clear: I must be prepared, responsible, and present as a voter, just as I am as a doctor.\n\nMy chest tightens as I weigh the urgency of Mrs. Lee\u2019s care against the narrow window to fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. Both roles demand my full attention, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the needs of my patient and the call to cast my vote."}
