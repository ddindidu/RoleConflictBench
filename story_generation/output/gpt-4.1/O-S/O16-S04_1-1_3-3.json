As her doctor, I knew she needed reassurance and clear answers, so I took extra time to walk her through her results, answering every question with patience. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the polling station closing in a few hours. I\u2019d forgotten my main ID at home, and while I had a backup in my bag, I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. I could fetch my passport later, but that would mean cutting my clinic hours short or rushing through appointments. My patients expected my full attention and empathy, but as a voter, I felt the pressure to fulfill my civic duty and bring the right identification. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I found myself torn, my words to Mrs. Lee faltering as my mind wrestled with the demands of being both a dedicated doctor and a responsible voter."}
