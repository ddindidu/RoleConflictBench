The project timeline is slipping through my fingers\u2014two teams are at odds over a design change, and the client is demanding updates by morning. As the architect, I\u2019m expected to keep everything on track, to be the calm in the chaos, but my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district is streaming now. As a citizen, I believe in being informed, in participating, in holding leaders accountable. I promised myself I\u2019d watch, ask questions, maybe even share concerns about local development. But the project\u2019s deadline looms, and my inbox is filling with urgent messages. My mind races, torn between the duty to my profession and the responsibility I feel to my community. I can\u2019t shake the guilt\u2014if I focus on work, I neglect my civic role; if I tune into the forum, I risk letting my team down. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I sit frozen, unable to choose, feeling the tension build inside."}
