My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder that every second, someone\u2019s safety depended on my vigilance. A few swimmers drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed confident, laughing and splashing. Still, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down\u2014not even for a moment. That was the expectation: unwavering attention, no exceptions.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the election. I\u2019d forgotten my ID at home, and today was the only morning I could grab it before work. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d risk not being able to vote at all. The polls would be open tomorrow, but my schedule was packed\u2014no chance to leave the pool then. The weight of civic duty pressed on me, the expectation that I\u2019d show up, ID in hand, and make my voice heard.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pounding with the stress of choosing between two responsibilities. Should I leave my post for a few minutes, trusting nothing would go wrong, or stay put and risk losing my chance to vote? The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
