My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDouble-check everything, especially at closing. One mistake could throw off the whole count.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting as the line grew longer, each customer impatient to finish their day. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the new safety steps\u2014everyone must follow them, no exceptions.\u201d I remembered the briefing, the emphasis on consistency, and the importance of setting an example for the other volunteers. But now, as I tried to balance the demands of accuracy at the register with the urge to leave on time for my volunteer shift, I felt torn. If I rushed, I might make a costly error. If I stayed late to be thorough, I\u2019d miss the start of my volunteer duties and risk not following the new safety protocols. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions at once."}
