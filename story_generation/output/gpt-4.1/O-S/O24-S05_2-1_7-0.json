As a judge, I was expected to stay current with every legal development, and today an attorney had cited a fresh appellate decision that could shift the entire case. I knew I needed to read and analyze it thoroughly before tomorrow\u2019s session. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from a long-time client, seeking clarification about their ongoing dispute. As their advocate, I owed them clear, accurate advice, even in these informal moments. They trusted me to explain the law in a way that made sense, to guide them through uncertainty. But my mind was already tangled in the complexities of the new precedent, and I worried that any rushed explanation might be incomplete or misleading. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding impartial mastery of the law, the other requiring personal, attentive guidance. I stared at the unread court opinion and the blinking message, feeling the tension tighten in my chest, torn between the demands of justice and loyalty."}
