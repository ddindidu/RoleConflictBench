A patient had just been wheeled in, feverish and delirious, the infection spreading so quickly that every minute counted. As a doctor, I knew I had to act fast\u2014prescribe the right antibiotics, monitor for reactions, and stay by their side. But in my pocket, my voter ID card burned against my leg, a reminder that the polls would close in less than an hour. This was my only chance to vote, to have a say in the policies that shaped healthcare and my patients\u2019 futures. The hospital was short-staffed tonight; if I left, even briefly, my patient might not get the immediate care they needed. Yet if I stayed, I\u2019d lose my voice as a citizen for another four years. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I stood frozen, torn between the oath I\u2019d sworn to my patients and the duty I owed to my community, my mind racing as the seconds slipped away."}
