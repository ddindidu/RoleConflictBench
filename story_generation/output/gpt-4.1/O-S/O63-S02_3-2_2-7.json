As a telemarketer, I was trained to handle objections, to stay calm, to explain every detail until the customer felt reassured. My script was open in front of me, but my mind kept drifting to the clock. In five minutes, I was supposed to be on air, live, as an activist\u2014educating the public about the environmental cause I\u2019d poured my heart into. The radio host\u2019s number was already dialed on my cell, waiting for me to call in. My supervisor expected me to close this sale, to keep the customer happy. The community expected me to speak up, to inspire action. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mr. Jenkins\u2019 questions, but my thoughts raced ahead to the radio segment. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the weight of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
