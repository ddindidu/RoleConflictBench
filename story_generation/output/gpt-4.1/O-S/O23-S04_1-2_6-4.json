I heard you\u2019re working on that big case\u2014what\u2019s it about?\u201d he asked, his tone light but his eyes curious. My mind raced. As a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything about my client, not even the nature of the case. But as a neighbor and a voter, I felt the pressure to be open, to connect, to not seem secretive or aloof. \n\nAt the same time, I remembered that my only chance to grab my valid ID for voting was this morning, before work swallowed the rest of my day. If I left now, I\u2019d miss out on valuable networking, but if I stayed, I risked forgetting the ID and losing my chance to vote. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014professional secrecy and civic responsibility. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the tension twist inside me, unsure which role to honor first."}
