Holiday travel always brought this kind of chaos, and as an air traffic controller, I was expected to keep the airspace safe and efficient, no matter how many flights circled above. My headset buzzed with pilots requesting updates, supervisors checking on delays, and my own pulse thudded in my ears. In the brief lull between transmissions, I glanced at my phone. The volunteer coordinator\u2019s email blinked on the screen: a suggestion to reorganize the supply room if I had time after my shift. It was a small thing, but she\u2019d emphasized how much smoother things would run if we followed her new system. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014planes in the sky needing my focus, and the quiet expectation to go the extra mile as a volunteer. I could already imagine the disappointment if I let either side down. My mind raced, torn between the demands of the radar and the hope of making a difference on the ground."}
