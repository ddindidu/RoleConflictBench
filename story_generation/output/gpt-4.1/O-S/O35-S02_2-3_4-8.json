My heart thudded. Protocol was clear\u2014stop the train, alert security, keep passengers calm. I glanced at the monitor, watching the faces, the nervous glances. My duty was to keep them safe, to be present, to act quickly and responsibly. Then my phone buzzed. The news network. They needed my voice now, live, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. I\u2019d fought so hard to be heard, to educate, to seize these rare moments when the world was listening. But I was here, in the cab, responsible for hundreds of lives. My mind raced\u2014could I step away for just a minute? Could I do both? The weight of expectation pressed in from both sides, each urgent, each vital. I stared at the blinking lights, torn between the people in my care and the cause I\u2019d sworn to champion, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds demanding all of me at once."}
