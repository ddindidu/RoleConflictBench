Dispatch reported a violent assault breaking out at the city square\u2014bystanders screaming, chaos erupting. My training kicked in: protect citizens, stop the threat, secure the scene. But as I flicked on the siren, my mind raced back to the envelope on my kitchen table\u2014my only valid ID, left behind in my rush. Today was the only window I had to grab it before my shift stretched into overtime tomorrow, and without it, I couldn\u2019t vote. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election, not after everything at stake. The city square loomed ahead, sirens wailing, but so did the image of the polling station, the civic duty I\u2019d waited years to fulfill. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, torn between the oath I\u2019d sworn to protect and the right I\u2019d fought so hard to exercise."}
