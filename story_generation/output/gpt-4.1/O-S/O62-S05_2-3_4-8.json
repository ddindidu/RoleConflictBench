As I walked along the edge, I noticed a lane rope had snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and without that rope, the class would be chaotic and unsafe. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of maintaining the facilities\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it, I\u2019d be letting down the team and the kids who relied on us.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my advocacy case was in forty-five minutes. I was the key witness, and my presence was critical. The family I was supporting had no one else to speak for them, and the judge had warned that tardiness could jeopardize the outcome. My heart pounded as I stared at the broken rope, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. I could feel the expectations from both sides\u2014one demanding immediate action for safety, the other requiring my punctuality and voice for justice. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
