As a subway operator, I knew the importance of the pre-shift briefing\u2014today, they were introducing new operational procedures, and attendance was strictly enforced. Missing it could mean disciplinary action or, worse, risking passenger safety. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised to help set up for the morning meal service, and I knew how much the team relied on me. Still, I also knew that a few of the other volunteers were already there and could cover for me if I was late. My supervisor at the subway depot, on the other hand, had made it clear that punctuality was non-negotiable. I felt the weight of both commitments pressing down on me, my sense of responsibility tugging me in two directions. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the expectations of my job and my promise to the community."}
