Management needed my project estimates by noon\u2014no more delays, no more \u201cI\u2019ll get to it.\u201d They were counting on me to be precise, to anchor the quarterly roadmap. My mind raced through calculations, weighing risks, trying to be both realistic and optimistic. Just as I was about to finalize my numbers, I remembered: today was voting day. I rushed to the polling station, laptop in my bag, estimates unfinished.\n\nInside, the poll worker handed me my ballot envelope.

The instructions were clear: follow every step, no shortcuts, or my vote might not count.
