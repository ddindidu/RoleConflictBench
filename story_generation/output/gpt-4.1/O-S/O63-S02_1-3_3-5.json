My sales numbers were already soaring this week, and my manager\u2019s praise still echoed in my mind. I could almost taste the bonus, the recognition, the relief of finally being ahead. But my other phone buzzed with a message from the activist group: \u201cWe need you. The representative is still undecided. This is our chance.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew how much this policy meant, how many hours I\u2019d spent rallying support, how I\u2019d promised to be there when it counted. But the call list for work was long, and my supervisor expected me to keep the momentum going. If I stopped now, I risked losing the trust I\u2019d built at the office. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d let down the cause I believed in. My fingers hovered over both phones, torn between the demands of my job and the urgency of my convictions, the seconds slipping away as I wrestled with what to do next."}
