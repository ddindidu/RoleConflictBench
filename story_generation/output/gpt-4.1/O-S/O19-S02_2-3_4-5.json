As a pharmacist, I knew she needed careful counseling\u2014this medication had tricky side effects, and she\u2019d struggled with adherence before. I smiled, ready to walk her through every detail, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. A message from my activist group flashed on the screen: the state legislature was holding a surprise, tie-breaking vote on the medication access bill I\u2019d fought for all year. The only undecided representative was taking calls for the next hour. My heart pounded. I was expected to drop everything and make my case, to be the voice for patients like Mrs. Patel on a larger scale. But right now, she needed me\u2014needed my undivided attention and expertise. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down. My mind raced, caught between the immediate needs of the person in front of me and the broader change I\u2019d worked so hard to achieve. I took a deep breath, feeling the seconds slip away, and tried to steady my hands as I faced the impossible choice."}
