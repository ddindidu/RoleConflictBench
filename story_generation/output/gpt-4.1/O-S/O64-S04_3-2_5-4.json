The line of customers finally thins, and I start the end-of-shift cash deposit, double-checking every bill and receipt as the policy demands. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts, or we risk an audit.\u201d I know the rules, and I want to do my job right. But my mind keeps drifting to my wallet, where my ID should be\u2014but isn\u2019t. I left it at home, and tomorrow is Election Day. If I don\u2019t get it this morning, I won\u2019t be able to vote. The store\u2019s procedures are strict, and I can\u2019t just leave the deposit unfinished. But the polling place is only open for a few more hours, and this is my only window to get my ID. My hands tremble as I count the cash, torn between my responsibility as a cashier and my right as a voter. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both."}
