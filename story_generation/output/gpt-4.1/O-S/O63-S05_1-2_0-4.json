As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle objections smoothly, answer questions, and keep the conversation moving. Most days, callers were polite, and their questions were easy\u2014ones I\u2019d rehearsed a hundred times. But today, my mind kept drifting to the courthouse, where my client\u2019s case was about to be heard. As their advocate, I was supposed to be fully present, ready to represent them with every ounce of care and attention I could muster. The dispute was complicated, and my client was counting on me to catch every detail, to argue their side with precision.\n\nBut here I was, headset on, trying to sound cheerful and attentive to a customer asking about our latest offer. My heart pounded with guilt. I knew I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded at the same time. The expectation to be calm and persuasive on the phone clashed with the pressure to be sharp and focused in court. I felt myself pulled in two directions, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, unsure which one I would have to let down."}
