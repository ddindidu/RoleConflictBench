As a cashier, I made sure to greet each customer with a smile, asking about their day, making small talk to brighten their visit. Today, though, my mind kept drifting back to the volunteer briefing I\u2019d attended that morning. The coordinator had stressed new safety steps\u2014sanitizing the counter after every customer, wearing gloves, and keeping a strict distance. \u201cNo exceptions,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes meeting mine.\n\nBut as Mrs. Lee approached, her arms full, she looked tired and eager for a friendly word. I wanted to help her pack her bags, to offer the warmth I knew she appreciated. Yet, the volunteer guidelines echoed in my head: no direct contact, no handling customer belongings. My hands hovered, uncertain, as I tried to balance the store\u2019s expectation of friendly, personal service with the strict safety rules from my volunteer role. My heart pounded, torn between being the helpful cashier customers expected and the responsible volunteer I promised to be."}
