Every second counted. I relayed instructions, my voice steady, but my thoughts scattered. Today was the only morning I could swing by home to grab my ID\u2014without it, I couldn\u2019t vote, and tomorrow\u2019s shift was a double. The polling station would close before I finished. My civic duty tugged at me, the weight of my voice in the election, but the responsibility in front of me was heavier. The expectation to keep pilots safe, to be present and focused, clashed with the pressure to fulfill my role as a citizen.
