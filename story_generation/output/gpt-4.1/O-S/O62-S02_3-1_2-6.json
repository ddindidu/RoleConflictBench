As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger, especially with the tide as high as it was today. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I glanced down and saw the notification: my activist group\u2019s post was exploding online. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, if I could just add a comment to clarify our message and direct people to real action. My heart pounded. The expectation to educate and mobilize was just as urgent as the need to keep these swimmers safe. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hand hovered over my phone, torn between the lives in the water and the cause that could change lives beyond this beach."}
