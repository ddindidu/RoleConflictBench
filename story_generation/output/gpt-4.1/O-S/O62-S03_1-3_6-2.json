As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. I\u2019d already warned a few kids about entering the shallow area without supervision, but they kept slipping past the ropes when they thought I wasn\u2019t looking. My supervisor expected vigilance, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nLater that day, I found myself in the middle of a street demonstration. The crowd surged with energy, voices raised for a cause I believed in. Suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s step past the barricade\u2014show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d The barricade marked restricted city property, and as a citizen, I knew I was supposed to respect the law and public property, just as I expected others to follow the rules at the pool.\n\nMy heart pounded. The lifeguard in me wanted to uphold order and safety, but the citizen in me felt the pull of solidarity and protest. I stood at the edge, torn between enforcing rules and challenging them, feeling the conflict twist inside me as the crowd pressed forward."}
