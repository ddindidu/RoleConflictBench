My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to keep every swimmer safe. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now\u2014still, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down, not even for a second. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder that the polls would close in less than an hour. Today was the only day I could vote, and I needed to bring my ID, which was locked in my car outside the pool gates. The rules were clear\u2014no leaving the pool deck unattended, not even for a minute. But if I didn\u2019t go now, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote, my voice silenced for another election. My heart pounded as I watched the swimmers, torn between my responsibility to protect them and my right to participate in the vote. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between duty and civic responsibility, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both at once."}
