Each prospect today seems to have a barrage of technical questions\u2014details about data privacy, compatibility, hidden fees. The script only skims the surface, and my supervisor\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, handle objections, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d I feel the pressure to keep the call times short and the conversion rates high. But my mind keeps drifting to my wallet, sitting on the kitchen counter at home. I need that ID to vote, and this morning is my only window to grab it before work swallows the rest of my week. The polls are open tomorrow, but I can\u2019t risk another forgotten detail. My manager expects me to stay glued to my seat, but my civic duty tugs at me, reminding me of the importance of my vote. I stare at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility of being a voter, anxiety tightening in my chest as I weigh which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
