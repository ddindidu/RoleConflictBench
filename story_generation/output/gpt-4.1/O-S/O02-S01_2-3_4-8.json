As an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring our new product met every updated safety standard. The latest regulation had just come into effect, and my manager expected me to provide clear evidence of compliance before the release next week. The pressure was on; any oversight could mean a costly recall or worse.\n\nAt the same time, my phone vibrated with a message from the volunteer coordinator at the community center. The service we provided was at risk\u2014an urgent directive had come through, outlining new mandatory procedures. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: if we didn\u2019t implement these changes immediately, the center would have to shut down, leaving dozens of people without support.\n\nI stared at my screens, feeling the weight of both worlds. My team at work relied on me to uphold our standards, while the community counted on me to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions to keep the service running. Both roles demanded my full attention, both with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. My mind raced, torn between the expectations pressing in from every side."}
