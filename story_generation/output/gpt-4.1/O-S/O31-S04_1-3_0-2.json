Residents say the party\u2019s out of control.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the polling station closed its doors. As a police officer, I knew I had to respond quickly; ignoring a call wasn\u2019t an option. But as a voter, I\u2019d waited weeks for this day, determined to have my say in the election. My supervisor always said, \u201cPublic order comes first,\u201d but my civic duty tugged at me just as hard. I could already picture the disappointed faces of my neighbors if I let the party go on, and the regret I\u2019d feel if I missed my chance to vote.
