My script only skimmed the surface, and I felt the familiar pressure to keep the call moving, to handle objections smoothly, to close the sale. But the questions were valid, and I knew the answers mattered.\n\nAs soon as my shift ended, I switched hats\u2014now, I was an advocate, meeting with a client whose legal case had grown tangled and urgent. She needed clear, precise advice, not vague reassurances. My mind kept drifting back to the calls, to the half-answers I\u2019d given, and I wondered if I was doing the same here\u2014skimming, simplifying, when what was needed was depth and honesty.\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides: efficiency and persuasion as a telemarketer, accuracy and thoroughness as an advocate. I felt torn, my conscience tugged in two directions, unsure how to reconcile the demands of my roles with the needs of the people depending on me."}
