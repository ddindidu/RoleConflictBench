The sun was dipping lower, casting long shadows across the pool deck. I knew the polling station would close in just a couple of hours, and I still hadn\u2019t voted. My civic responsibility tugged at me\u2014I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election. But as I watched the swimmers, I noticed a teenager in the middle of the pool, their strokes growing sloppy, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to never let my focus waver, not even for a second. Yet, the clock ticked on, and the pressure to leave in time to cast my ballot gnawed at me. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the weight of both roles\u2014protector of lives and participant in democracy\u2014each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
