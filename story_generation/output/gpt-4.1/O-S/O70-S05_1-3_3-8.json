The courthouse was twenty minutes away, and the hearing was set to begin in thirty. But the last stop on my delivery route loomed ahead\u2014a small house with no car in the driveway. I grabbed the package, double-checked the address, and approached the porch. No answer at the door. My instructions were clear: leave the package only if I could ensure its safety. The neighborhood wasn\u2019t the best, and porch thefts were common. As a delivery person, I was expected to secure every parcel, confirm delivery, and avoid complaints. But as an advocate, I was expected to be in that courtroom, ready to fight for my client\u2019s future. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCourt in 25 minutes.\u201d I stared at the package, then at the empty porch, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to court on time, but risk the package. If I stayed to find a safer spot or wait for the homeowner, I\u2019d be late for the hearing. My hands trembled as I stood on the porch, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
