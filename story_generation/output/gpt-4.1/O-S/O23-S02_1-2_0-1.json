As a lawyer, I knew I should review every clause, even if it was just a standard service agreement and the deadline was weeks away. My client trusted me to catch the details others might miss. But my phone buzzed with urgent messages from my activist group\u2014the protest march was starting in minutes, and I was supposed to lead the first chant. They were counting on my voice to set the tone, to show our unity and resolve. My heart pounded as I glanced between the contract and the protest livestream already filling with people. I felt the weight of my client\u2019s expectations pressing on one shoulder, and the hopes of my fellow activists on the other. I wanted to be reliable in both worlds, but right now, I could only be in one place. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between duty and passion, as the sounds of the gathering crowd echoed through my phone."}
