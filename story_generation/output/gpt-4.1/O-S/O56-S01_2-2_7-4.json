As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to wash and condition her hair before starting, especially since it looked greasy. She seemed a bit embarrassed, apologizing for coming straight from her workout, but I reassured her it was no problem. As I led her to the sink, she hesitated, then quietly confided in me about a personal issue she was facing\u2014something she\u2019d never told anyone else. I recognized her from the community center where I volunteer, where I\u2019m expected to respect everyone\u2019s privacy and keep their concerns confidential. Now, standing in my salon, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. As a hairdresser, I was supposed to make her comfortable and focus on her hair, but as a volunteer, I was bound to protect her trust. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my profession and my commitment to confidentiality, unsure how to respond without betraying either role."}
