My boots crunched over scattered debris\u2014nails, splinters, dust\u2014reminding me of the safety protocols drilled into us every morning. \u201cNo one leaves until the site\u2019s clean,\u201d he\u2019d said, and I knew the risks: a single stray nail could mean a trip to the ER for someone tomorrow. But as I grabbed the broom, my phone buzzed. The reminder flashed: court session in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late, not today. The case was at a tipping point, and my client\u2019s future might hinge on my presence. My stomach twisted. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my crew and risking someone\u2019s safety. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my client and possibly jeopardizing the case. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my loyalty, each unforgiving of compromise. I stood frozen, broom in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
