Management is waiting for my estimates\u2014firm numbers that will shape the entire quarter. I know how critical this is; the team depends on my accuracy, and any delay could throw off the roadmap. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder: the radio show starts in five minutes. As an activist, I\u2019ve been given a rare chance to reach thousands, to educate and inspire action for our cause. I can\u2019t let the movement down, not when so many are counting on me to speak up. But the pressure from work is crushing. I feel my chest tighten, torn between the responsibility to my colleagues and the urgency of my activism. Both roles demand my full attention, right now. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I try to decide which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
