As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity and fairness, and my testimony could be crucial for the case. The courthouse was across town, and I needed to be there on time. But as I stepped into the hallway, I saw the notice: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on our floor. As a citizen, I felt responsible for her well-being, especially on days like this. I knew she struggled with the heat and had no family nearby. I glanced at my watch, feeling the pressure of my duty to the court and my duty to my community. Should I check on Mrs. Lee and risk being late, or head straight to court and hope she\u2019d be alright? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
