A call crackled through: \u201cUnattended bag, car three.\u201d My heart skipped. Protocol demanded I halt the train, alert security, and ensure every passenger\u2019s safety. I glanced at my watch\u20148:37 a.m. My court session was at nine, across town. As an advocate, I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there, ready to fight for her. She was counting on me; her future might hinge on my presence. But here, dozens of passengers depended on me to act swiftly, to keep them safe. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCourt in 20 minutes.\u201d Sweat prickled my neck. If I delayed, I\u2019d fail my client. If I left, I\u2019d fail my duty as an operator. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding I choose them first. My hands hovered over the radio, my mind torn, the train slowing as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
