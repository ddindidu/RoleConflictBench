As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, obey every traffic law, especially in weather like this. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. My hands tightened on the wheel. But today, I wasn\u2019t just a driver\u2014I was also an advocate, and my client\u2019s future hinged on my punctual arrival at court. The clock on the dashboard glared at me, each minute lost another blow to my professional duty. I could almost hear my client\u2019s anxious voice, feel the weight of their trust. Every red light, every cautious stop, felt like a betrayal of that trust. Yet, if I rushed, if I made a risky move, I could cause an accident, endangering myself and others. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something the other could not allow. My heart pounded as I approached another yellow light, torn between the law and the promise I\u2019d made."}
