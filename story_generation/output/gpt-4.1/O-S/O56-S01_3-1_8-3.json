The buildup was worse than I\u2019d expected, and I knew I\u2019d need extra time to wash and condition before I could even think about cutting. She was a new face, someone I recognized from the community center where I volunteered. As I gently separated the knots, she started chatting about her week, and soon our conversation drifted toward her family and recent struggles. Nothing too sensitive, but I felt the familiar tug of my volunteer role\u2014always careful, always respectful of privacy. Yet, as her hairdresser, I was expected to be friendly, to build rapport, to make her comfortable enough to trust me with her hair. I could sense she wanted to talk, maybe even needed to, but I worried about crossing a line, about betraying the unspoken confidentiality I owed her as a volunteer. My hands paused, tangled in her hair and in my own thoughts, caught between the expectations of two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
