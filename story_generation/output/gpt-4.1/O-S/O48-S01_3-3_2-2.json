As a nursing assistant, I was supposed to help Mr. Lee eat his lunch, but today he was wincing with every movement, barely able to lift his spoon. I knew he needed me to stay, to help him eat and offer comfort through his pain. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in ten minutes across town. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the doors, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to start the service. I could picture their faces, some elderly, some with children, all depending on the facility to open on time. My mind raced, torn between the immediate suffering in front of me and the responsibility waiting for me elsewhere. Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I could feel the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
