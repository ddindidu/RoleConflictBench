I need it urgently.\u201d I was halfway through my delivery route, the afternoon sun beating down on my van. I typed a polite reply, assuring them I was on my way and would arrive soon. My job demanded patience and professionalism, no matter how many times customers grew impatient or frustrated. \n\nBut as I hit send, I remembered today was election day. The polling station was only open for a few more hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote. It was my civic duty, and I\u2019d even told my family I wouldn\u2019t miss it. My schedule was light, but the route was long, and every delay\u2014every extra call or message\u2014ate into my time. \n\nI felt the pressure mounting: the expectation to be the reliable, courteous delivery person, and the responsibility to show up as a voter. My mind raced, torn between the customer waiting for their package and the ballot waiting for my mark. I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
