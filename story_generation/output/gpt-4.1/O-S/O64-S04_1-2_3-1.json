It was already late afternoon, and I still had to run a few errands before heading to the polling station. Voting hours were strict, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election. But as I was closing out a transaction, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few dollars off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still, store policy was clear: every discrepancy had to be reported and investigated before leaving for the day.\n\nMy manager expected me to be thorough, to follow every procedure to the letter. But if I started the paperwork now, I might not make it to the polls in time. I could feel the pressure building inside me, torn between my responsibility as a cashier and my duty as a voter. Both roles demanded something from me, and I couldn\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both. I stared at the register, my mind racing, caught between the rules of my job and the importance of my civic duty."}
