As the operator, I was expected to complete the pre-departure check\u2014lights, doors, intercoms\u2014before the train could leave. The checklist was routine, but every minute counted for the schedule and the safety of hundreds of passengers. My radio crackled with updates, and I could sense the impatience building on the platform.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. As an advocate, I had a client whose case had just taken a complicated turn. She was waiting for my call, needing urgent, clear advice before a critical deadline. I knew she was anxious, relying on me to guide her through the legal maze. The weight of her trust pressed on me, just as heavily as the responsibility for the train.\n\nI stood in the operator\u2019s cabin, torn between the checklist in my hand and the phone in my pocket. Both roles demanded my full attention, both lives depended on me. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down, even if just for a moment."}
