She\u2019s always so polite, and I pride myself on making sure my clients leave happy, so I nodded and reached for my scissors. But as I sectioned her hair, my mind wandered to the envelope of tax documents waiting at home. I\u2019d planned to finish them tonight, but then I remembered the vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. They\u2019re short on volunteers, and I know how important it is to help out, especially after last winter\u2019s flu outbreak. I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014my clients expect my full attention and care, but as a citizen, I should be pitching in for the greater good. The weight of these expectations pressed on me, and I found myself torn, scissors poised mid-air, wondering how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s needs at once."}
