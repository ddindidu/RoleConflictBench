They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their nervous glances and uncertain hands that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols. My job was clear: I had to step in, guide them, and make sure no one got hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014I was due at the polling station across town. I rushed over, only to find a long line snaking out the door. An official called out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B, but the new line was barely moving. The original line, where I\u2019d been waiting, was much faster. I was torn. As a voter, I was expected to follow the official\u2019s instructions, but as a machine repairer, I knew I needed to get back to the factory soon to prevent a possible accident. My mind raced, caught between the duty to keep people safe at work and the responsibility to respect the voting process."}
