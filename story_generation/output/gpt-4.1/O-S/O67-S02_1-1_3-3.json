Gauze, antiseptic, epinephrine\u2014each item accounted for, each expiration date scrutinized. My mind was focused, knowing that any missing or expired supply could mean the difference between life and death for someone in need. Just as I was about to close the kit, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder from the activist group: the online petition to push for better emergency response funding was about to be sent to the state legislator.
