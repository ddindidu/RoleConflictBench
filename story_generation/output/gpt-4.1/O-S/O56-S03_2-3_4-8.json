She hesitated, then quietly said the tone wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart sank\u2014I knew how important it was to make her feel heard and happy, especially on her first visit. I started to reassure her, ready to discuss options and fix it right away. Suddenly, the building alarms blared, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. I glanced outside and saw water creeping up the street, people shouting and running. As a citizen, I knew I should help evacuate, check on neighbors, and follow safety protocols. But as a hairdresser, I had a disappointed client in my chair, expecting my full attention and a solution. My mind raced, torn between my duty to her and my responsibility to the community. I could feel the pressure mounting, my hands trembling as I tried to decide what to do next."}
