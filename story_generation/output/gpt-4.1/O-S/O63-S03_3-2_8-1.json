Any unscheduled break, even a minute early, would trigger a compliance flag. My phone buzzed with a message from my friends: \u201cWe\u2019re setting up the speakers now! Come down for music?\u201d I\u2019d promised to join them for our usual Friday night jam in the courtyard, but I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours started at 8:00 sharp. Last week, a neighbor had complained, and tonight, their windows were wide open, a silent warning. \n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014my job required strict adherence to the schedule, but as a resident, I was expected to respect the peace and follow the building\u2019s rules. If I left my desk early, I risked disciplinary action at work. If I joined my friends on time, I\u2019d be breaking the quiet hours and disturbing my neighbor. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a considerate neighbor."}
