As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014patients depended on me for accurate advice. During the break, I wandered over to the refreshment table, where a few of the people I\u2019d been helping as a volunteer were chatting. One of them, Mrs. Lee, smiled and asked how the workshop was going. Before I knew it, the conversation shifted to her medications. She mentioned a new prescription, and I instinctively wanted to offer advice, to ensure she understood the changes. But then I remembered my role as a volunteer\u2014respecting privacy, never crossing boundaries, especially in public. My mind raced with the expectations of my profession, the urge to help, and the volunteer code to protect confidentiality. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I stood there, caught between the urge to share my knowledge and the responsibility to respect her privacy."}
