As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him to his meeting safely and on time, but with no rush, I could take the scenic route, maybe even chat a little. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a message from a client. As an advocate, I was expected to provide clear, timely legal advice, and this client\u2019s case had just taken a complicated turn. He needed guidance now, not later. My mind raced: should I pull over and call him, risking my passenger\u2019s comfort and the flow of the ride? Or should I focus on driving, knowing my client was waiting, possibly anxious, for my response? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to put them first. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
