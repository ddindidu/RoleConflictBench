As a judge, I know how crucial it is to stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. I\u2019ve been waiting for this edition, eager to see how new precedents might shape my courtroom decisions. Yet, as I glance at the clock, my phone buzzes with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter starts in thirty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoes in my mind\u2014today, every volunteer is essential, and the doors open right on time. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I stay to read, I risk letting down the team and the people who count on us. If I leave now, I\u2019ll fall behind in my professional duty, possibly missing something that could impact justice for others. My heart pounds as I stare at the journal, torn between the demands of my bench and the needs of my community, knowing I can\u2019t give both my best at this moment."}
