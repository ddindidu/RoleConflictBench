The instructions were clear: leave it at the doorstep, take a photo, and make sure it\u2019s safe. I glanced at my phone, ready to snap the proof, when a notification popped up\u2014a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. \u201cWe\u2019re at the square now, live. Police are circling. Can you come?\u201d My heart thudded. I\u2019d promised to help today, to stand with them and show the city we wouldn\u2019t be ignored. But the package in my hand was expensive, and the company tracked every delivery. If it went missing, I\u2019d be blamed. I looked at the empty street, then at the stream on my phone\u2014faces I knew, voices I cared about, chanting for justice. My job demanded I finish the route, secure every parcel. My conscience pulled me toward the protest, to be present, to matter. I stood frozen on the porch, torn between duty and conviction, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
