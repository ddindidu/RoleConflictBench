The QA team flagged a UI glitch that\u2019s been popping up for some users. It\u2019s not critical\u2014there\u2019s a simple workaround, and no one\u2019s data is at risk\u2014but the product manager wants it fixed before the next release. I sigh, already picturing the code I\u2019ll need to comb through, the test cases to rerun. \n\nThen, my other phone rings. It\u2019s the media liaison from the activist group I help lead. A major news network is running a breaking story that misrepresents our cause, and they want me on air, now, to set the record straight. My heart pounds. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014a chance to reach millions, to correct the narrative, to make a real difference. \n\nBut the bug can\u2019t wait, either. If I leave it, users will keep complaining, and my team will have to pick up the slack. I stare at my screens, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
