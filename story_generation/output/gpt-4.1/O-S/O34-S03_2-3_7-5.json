My headset crackled with voices\u2014controllers in adjacent sectors, pilots requesting alternate routes, supervisors asking for updates. Every second, I coordinated handoffs, recalculated vectors, and tried to keep the airspace from turning into chaos. My heart pounded, but I knew the expectation: keep the traffic flowing, keep everyone safe.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, another clock ticked. The polling place down the street would close in two hours, and today\u2019s ballot measure could change the way my block was zoned. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, be an active citizen, make my voice heard. The city expected it, my neighbors expected it, and I expected it of myself. Yet, as the storm raged and the workload mounted, the possibility of leaving my post\u2014even briefly\u2014felt impossible. I stared at the screen, torn between the skies and the street, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give."}
