My supervisor had said we could take breaks early if things were slow, so I considered logging out. As a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my break schedule, but the flexibility was tempting, especially tonight. My friends were coming over for a late-evening jam session, and I wanted to set up early. But as a citizen, I knew the building\u2019s quiet hours started soon, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open in the evenings. The thought of our music drifting into her apartment made me uneasy. I felt torn\u2014should I take my break early and risk bending the rules at work, or wait and risk disturbing my neighbor if we started late? The pressure of wanting to be a good employee and a considerate neighbor pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the expectations of my two worlds."}
