The UI glitch wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could refresh and move on\u2014but QA wanted it fixed before the next release. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cLet\u2019s keep the product polished.\u201d I knew I could patch it up in a few hours, but this weekend was the free vaccine clinic at the community center. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to help out, especially since I\u2019d already organized my tax documents early this year. The clinic needed volunteers, and I\u2019d promised my neighbor I\u2019d be there. But the pressure from work was mounting, and I could almost hear the disappointment if I missed the release deadline. My mind spun with the competing demands: the expectation to deliver flawless software, and the pull to support my community\u2019s health. I sat at my desk, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
