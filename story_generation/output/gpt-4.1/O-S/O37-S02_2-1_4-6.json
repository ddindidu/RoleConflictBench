My client expects the house spotless for her return in three days, and it\u2019s my job to make sure I have everything ready. I mentally list the stores I could visit after my shift, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. I glance at the screen\u2014my activist group\u2019s latest post is exploding online. Hundreds of comments, people asking questions, some spreading misinformation. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate, to set the record straight, to make a real impact. But if I stop now to craft a thoughtful response, I\u2019ll run late, and I might not have time to buy the cleaner before the store closes. My client trusts me to keep her home in order, but my community is counting on me to speak up while the world is watching. My hands tremble as I weigh the bottle in one hand and my phone in the other, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
