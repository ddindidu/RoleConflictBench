I knew from training that if it failed, the water could quickly become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. My supervisor expected me to act fast and report any equipment issues immediately, so I started heading toward the maintenance office. Just then, at the check-in table where I also volunteered, Mrs. Lee, a regular client, approached me. She looked anxious and, in a low voice, confided a personal concern about her family, asking for my advice. As a volunteer, I was trusted to listen and keep her worries confidential, offering support without judgment or distraction. But the urgency of the pool\u2019s malfunction pressed on my mind. I felt torn\u2014should I stay and give Mrs. Lee the attention and privacy she deserved, or rush to report the filtration problem before someone got hurt? My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, each demanding my full presence, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
