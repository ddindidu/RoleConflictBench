My mind was focused on my patients, on being gentle and attentive, just as I was trained. After my shift, I walked home, passing through the city square where a demonstration was underway. The crowd was loud, passionate, and someone I recognized from my neighborhood called out to me, urging me to join them. They wanted me to step past a police barricade onto restricted city property, insisting it was for a just cause. I hesitated, feeling the weight of my uniform still on my shoulders. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be responsible, to set an example of care and respect. As a citizen, I was supposed to follow the law and respect public property. The crowd\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my answer, and I felt torn between the urge to stand with my community and the duty to uphold the rules I believed in. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, wrestling with what I should do next."}
