As a lawyer, I knew my duty: protect my client\u2019s confidentiality at all costs. The trust between us was built on the promise that their secrets would remain safe with me. Suddenly, my firm\u2019s new assistant knocked and asked for access to the client\u2019s files, explaining it would help streamline our workflow. She seemed earnest, just trying to do her job, but she didn\u2019t know the sensitive nature of this case.\n\nAt the same time, as my client\u2019s advocate, I felt the weight of their expectations. They needed me to represent them fiercely, to ensure every fact was handled with care and precision. If I refused the assistant\u2019s request, I risked slowing down the process and possibly missing important deadlines. But if I allowed her access, I might compromise the very confidentiality I was sworn to uphold. My mind raced, torn between the demands of efficiency and the sacred duty of trust. The pressure built inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be at stake."}
