Inside, a family waited, their faces already etched with worry. I knew I had to go in, sit with them, and explain the diagnosis\u2014words that would change their lives. They deserved my full attention, my empathy, my clarity. But as I steadied myself, my phone buzzed urgently. The news network was on the line, asking for an immediate live interview. Misinformation about my cause was spreading fast, and I was the voice people trusted to set the record straight. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the family needing comfort and truth, the public needing facts and advocacy. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once. I hesitated, torn between the quiet room and the glaring spotlight, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
