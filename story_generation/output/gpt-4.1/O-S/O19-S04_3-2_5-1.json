The polling station would close at eight, and I still had to finish my shift, run home for my ID, and get across town. Just as I was about to wrap up for the day, Mrs. Lee arrived, clutching a paper bag of pill bottles. She looked worried, her voice trembling as she explained her new prescriptions. I knew she was on blood thinners and a new heart medication\u2014dangerous if not managed carefully. My duty as a pharmacist was clear: I needed to give her my full attention, review every interaction, and make sure she understood the risks. But as I sat with her, explaining side effects and double-checking dosages, the minutes ticked by. I felt torn\u2014my responsibility to Mrs. Lee weighed heavily, but so did my right and duty as a citizen to vote. The pressure built inside me, a knot of anxiety and guilt, as I tried to balance the needs of my patient with the demands of my civic role, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
