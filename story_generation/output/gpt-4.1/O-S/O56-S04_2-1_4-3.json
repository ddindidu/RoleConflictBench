She was a first-time visitor, and I\u2019d spent extra time making sure the colour blended just right. But as she peered into the mirror, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected,\u201d she said quietly. My heart sank. I knew I should sit with her, listen, and offer a solution\u2014maybe a toner, maybe a redo. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me: to make sure every client leaves happy, especially someone new.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the voting station down the street. Polls had just opened, and I\u2019d planned to go on my lunch break. I\u2019d brought my driver\u2019s license, but I\u2019d left my passport at home, just in case. If there was a problem, I could fetch it later, but that would mean leaving the salon again, maybe during another client\u2019s appointment. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my client\u2019s disappointment on one side, my civic duty and the logistics of voting on the other. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between fixing her hair and making sure my voice was counted."}
