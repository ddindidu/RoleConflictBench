As an architect, I was supposed to keep projects on track, and today was my day to review timelines. I glanced at the emails, making sure nothing was falling behind, but I wasn\u2019t too worried\u2014things seemed to be moving along. Then, my phone buzzed with a city alert: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on the floor below. As a citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her set up a fan. But if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time, and my team was counting on me to keep things running smoothly.
