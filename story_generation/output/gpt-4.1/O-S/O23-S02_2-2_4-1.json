The courthouse lobby is buzzing, my client waiting anxiously for me to argue a motion that could make or break their case. I\u2019ve spent days preparing, knowing how much they depend on my voice in that courtroom. But my phone vibrates\u2014messages from fellow activists flood in. The protest march is assembling just blocks away, and I promised to lead the first chant, to stand at the front and show our resolve. Both roles demand my presence, my energy, my conviction. I feel the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the urgency of justice in the courtroom. At the same time, I feel the pull of the crowd, the cause that fuels my activism, the expectation that I\u2019ll be there, megaphone in hand. My stomach twists as I stand between two doors, each leading to a different kind of justice, each with people counting on me. I close my eyes, torn, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
