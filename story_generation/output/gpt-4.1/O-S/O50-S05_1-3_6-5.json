As a machine repairer, I knew I was expected to be patient, to guide clients through the ins and outs of their equipment, especially someone new. I glanced at the clock\u2014my next call was in ten minutes, a meeting with the legal team about this very client\u2019s upcoming trial. As his advocate, I was supposed to be fully prepared, ready to represent him in a case that could change his life. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need to reassure him about the machine and the looming responsibility of the courtroom. If I spent too long on this call, I\u2019d risk being unprepared for the legal meeting. If I cut him short, I\u2019d fail him as a repairer. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
