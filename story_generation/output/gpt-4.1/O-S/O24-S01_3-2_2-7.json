As a judge, I knew the gravity of this decision\u2014someone\u2019s safety could depend on my careful, thorough analysis. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the community center was opening its doors in fifteen minutes, and as a volunteer, I was expected to help with the new safety procedures. The coordinator had stressed how crucial it was for everyone to follow the updated steps, especially today, with a larger crowd expected. My mind raced, torn between the urgent legal documents demanding my full attention and the responsibility I felt toward the people relying on me at the center. I could picture the coordinator\u2019s disappointed face if I didn\u2019t show, and the possible consequences if I rushed my judicial review. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unable to move toward either duty."}
