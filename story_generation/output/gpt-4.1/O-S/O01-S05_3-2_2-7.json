The hospital\u2019s fire escape routes didn\u2019t align with the latest safety codes, and the contractor was already pushing for sign-off. As the architect, I knew I couldn\u2019t let a single oversight slip through\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed, jolting me. A reminder: court session in thirty minutes. As an advocate, my client was counting on me to be there, to argue for their right to fair compensation. Missing it could jeopardize their entire case. I glanced at the clock, sweat prickling my neck. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to court, but the plans would go unchecked for another day. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk my client\u2019s future. Both roles demanded my full presence, both carried consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore.

I gripped the edge of the desk, paralyzed by the impossible choice, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart."}
