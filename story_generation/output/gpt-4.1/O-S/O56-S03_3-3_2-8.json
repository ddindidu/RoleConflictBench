I smiled warmly, ushering them in, determined to ease their nerves and keep everything running smoothly. My scissors glinted in my hand, ready to transform their anxiety into confidence for the big day. Suddenly, the building alarms blared, and my phone vibrated with a flash-flood warning. Through the window, I saw water creeping up the street, people outside shouting and scrambling for safety. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014maybe guide people to higher ground, check on neighbors, or at least make sure everyone in the salon was safe. But as a hairdresser, my clients expected calm, reassurance, and the perfect wedding look, no matter what chaos raged outside. My heart pounded as I stood between the anxious bridal party and the rising flood, torn by the demands of both roles, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
