QA flagged a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing catastrophic, but it\u2019s been popping up for some users. There\u2019s a simple workaround, but management expects quick fixes, and I know my team relies on me to keep things running smoothly. I\u2019m about to dive into the code when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a call from a legislative aide\u2014one I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. They have ten minutes to talk, right now, about the bill I\u2019ve poured my heart into. My activist side screams at me to answer, to seize this rare chance to push for real change. But my developer self feels the weight of my team\u2019s trust and the company\u2019s expectations. My heart pounds as I hover between the phone and my keyboard, torn by the demands of both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at once."}
