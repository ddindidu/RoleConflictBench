My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything\u2014no mistakes.\u201d I focus on each barcode, each total, trying not to let the pressure get to me. But as I hand a receipt to the next customer, I remember the heat advisory blaring on the radio this morning. Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lives alone on my floor. She\u2019s frail, and the thought of her struggling in this heat gnaws at me. As a citizen, I know I should check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her get to a cooling center. But as a cashier, I can\u2019t just leave my post\u2014people are counting on me to keep the line moving, and my job depends on it. My hands tremble as I scan another item, torn between the duty to my community and the demands of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
