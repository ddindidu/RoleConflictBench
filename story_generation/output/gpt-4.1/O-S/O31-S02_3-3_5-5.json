My training as a police officer kicked in: protect citizens, secure the scene, prevent harm. I was already halfway to my cruiser when my phone buzzed.

My heart pounded. I could picture the chaos at the square, people screaming, needing help. But I also saw the faces of those who would be affected by the law, waiting for justice, for change.
