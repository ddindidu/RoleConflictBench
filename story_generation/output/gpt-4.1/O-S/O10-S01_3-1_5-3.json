As the accountant, I knew I had to respond to the tax authority\u2019s request immediately\u2014any delay could mean penalties for the company. My mind raced through the files, searching for the missing piece that would explain the discrepancy. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. I had promised to help with the afternoon group, where I was trusted to keep everyone\u2019s stories private.\n\nWhen I arrived, the group was already chatting. Someone mentioned their struggles with paperwork and taxes, and the conversation drifted toward personal finances. I felt the urge to ask more, to see if their experience could shed light on the issue I faced at work. But as a volunteer, I was expected to respect their privacy, not probe for details that weren\u2019t freely offered. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding compliance and answers, the other requiring trust and confidentiality. I could feel the tension building inside, torn between my professional duty and my commitment to those I was there to help."}
