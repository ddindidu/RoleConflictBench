My volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes, and I was the only one with the keys to open the community center. I pictured the line of people who would be waiting outside, counting on me to let them in and start the morning service. But right now, I was stuck at the register, facing a frustrated customer holding a blender and no receipt. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. The customer pleaded, explaining it was a gift and they really needed the refund. I could feel the impatience of the growing line behind them, and my manager\u2019s expectation that I enforce the rules. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility for the people waiting at the center, some of whom depended on our services for breakfast. My mind raced, torn between following the store\u2019s strict procedures and my commitment to the people who needed me as a volunteer. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
