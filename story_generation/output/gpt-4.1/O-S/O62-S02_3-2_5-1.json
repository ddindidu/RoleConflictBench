The water was already starting to cloud, and I knew it could become a serious hazard for the swimmers if I didn\u2019t act fast. As a lifeguard, it was my responsibility to keep everyone safe, and that meant shutting down the pool and calling for repairs immediately. But my phone buzzed with a message from my activist group\u2014everyone was gathering at the park, waiting for me to lead the protest march. I was supposed to be at the front, megaphone in hand, rallying the crowd for the cause I cared so deeply about. My supervisor expected me to handle the pool emergency, but my fellow activists were counting on my presence and leadership. I felt torn, anxiety twisting in my stomach as I weighed the safety of the swimmers against the momentum of the movement. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the pressure mounting as the minutes ticked by."}
