I\u2019ve been loyal for years, and now you\u2019re pushing this on me?\u201d As a telemarketer, I was trained to handle objections, to keep my voice calm and persuasive, to never let a customer feel dismissed. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse, where my client\u2019s fate hung in the balance. As their advocate, I was expected to be fully present, to pore over every detail, to fight for their future with unwavering focus. Yet here I was, split between two worlds\u2014one demanding empathy and patience for a skeptical customer, the other requiring sharp legal acumen and undivided attention. My heart pounded as Mr. Harris demanded a thorough explanation, but my thoughts raced with legal arguments and evidence I needed to review. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
