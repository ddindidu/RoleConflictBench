The electrician was late, the plumber was grumbling, and I was the one caught in the middle, trying to keep the project on track. My mind buzzed with measurements and deadlines as I finally left the site, desperate for a break. \n\nOn my walk through the park, I unwrapped a sandwich, barely tasting it. My hands, rough from work, clutched the wrapper as I passed a sign: \u201cNo Littering. Keep Our Park Clean.\u201d The trash bin was a few steps away, but my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the site, another problem. I hesitated, wrapper in hand, torn between tossing it carelessly to rush back to work or taking the extra moment to do what I knew was right as a citizen. The pressure to return and keep the cabinetry on schedule pressed against my sense of responsibility to my community. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the demands of my craft and my duty to the city I called home."}
