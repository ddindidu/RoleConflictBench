My team was counting on me to finalize the technical specs so the other departments could move forward. Slack notifications kept popping up\u2014product managers asking for clarifications, designers waiting for my input. The deadline was just hours away, and I knew any delay would ripple through the project. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a different urgency: a message from my activist group. The online petition we\u2019d been working on for weeks was about to be sent to a key lawmaker. This was our last chance to add signatures, and my name\u2014my voice\u2014was needed.
