My next passenger was due in fifteen minutes, and I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about voting. I had promised myself I\u2019d make my voice heard this year. I locked up the cab and hurried to the polling station, only to be told by an official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I\u2019d have to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station would close in ten minutes.\n\nI could feel sweat prickling at my neck. The form looked long, and I knew I\u2019d be late for my next fare if I stayed. But as a voter, I was expected to follow the official\u2019s instructions and complete the process properly. As a taxi driver, I owed my passengers a clean, timely ride. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my job and my responsibility as a citizen. I stood there, pen in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds and unsure which to choose."}
