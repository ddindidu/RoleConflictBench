It\u2019s all clean,\u201d she said, settling into my chair. Normally, I\u2019d take her straight to the sink, but her hair really did look and feel spotless. Still, the salon expects every client to have their hair washed and conditioned here before I start cutting. It\u2019s part of our policy, and my manager is strict about it. I could skip the wash, save time, and maybe even make Mrs. Lee happy, but I\u2019d be breaking the rules.\n\nMeanwhile, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in twenty minutes. I was already cutting it close, and if I did the full wash and condition, I\u2019d definitely be late. I knew the kitchen would be fine without me for a bit; there were plenty of volunteers today. But I hated the idea of letting them down or showing up late when I\u2019d promised to be there on time. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind torn between the expectations of my job and my commitment to volunteering."}
