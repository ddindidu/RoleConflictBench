Shows you\u2019re committed.\u201d I know the team expects me to be there, to pull my weight and not let anyone down. But as I stuff my lunch pail into my locker, my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cLast chance to vote\u2014polls close tonight. Bring ID.\u201d I fumble for my wallet, heart pounding. My ID is at home, a forty-minute bus ride away. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the training and risk disappointing the crew. If I stay, I\u2019ll lose my only chance to vote, something my family always said was a duty, not just a right.

I stand frozen, torn between the hard hats and the ballot box, feeling the pressure build as the clock ticks down."}
