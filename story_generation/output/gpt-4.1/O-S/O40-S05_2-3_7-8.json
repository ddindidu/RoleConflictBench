The wood was warped and dangerously loose, and the family had made it clear they needed it fixed before the weekend. As a carpenter, I felt the weight of their trust\u2014restoring the deck meant restoring their safe space. My tools were ready, and I could already picture the satisfaction of a job well done.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session was in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client depended on me to be there, to argue their case at a critical moment. Missing it could mean losing everything we\u2019d worked for. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations from both sides pulling me apart. The homeowner\u2019s anxious glances, my client\u2019s desperate texts\u2014both needed me, right now, in different places. My hands trembled, torn between the hammer and the briefcase, as I tried to decide which role I would have to let down."}
