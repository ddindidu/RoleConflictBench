The jury trial was set to begin in less than an hour, and my client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014hung in the balance. I was supposed to be there, prepping final arguments, but I\u2019d promised to cover this morning\u2019s volunteer shift. As I handed out forms, a woman leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. She confided a personal concern, something sensitive and deeply private, trusting me as a volunteer to keep it confidential. My mind raced. As a lawyer, I was trained to spot information that could be relevant to legal proceedings, and what she\u2019d shared might intersect with my case. But as a volunteer, I was bound to protect her privacy above all else. The courthouse clock ticked in my mind, the weight of my client\u2019s expectations pressing down, while the woman\u2019s vulnerable eyes pleaded for discretion. I felt torn, caught between the duty to my client and the promise of confidentiality to someone in need, unsure which role should guide my next step."}
