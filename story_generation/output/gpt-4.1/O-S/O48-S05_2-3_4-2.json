As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to record these changes and alert the nurse, but I also knew he was anxious about his upcoming court date. Just as I finished noting his blood pressure, my phone buzzed. It was a message from another client, desperate for legal advice about an urgent eviction notice. As their advocate, I was expected to respond quickly and accurately, to guide them through the next steps before the deadline passed.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Mr. Lee needed my full attention to ensure his recovery stayed on track, but my client\u2019s future depended on my timely, precise advice. My mind raced, torn between the immediate physical care in front of me and the urgent legal guidance someone else was waiting for. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between the duty to my patient and the responsibility to my client, knowing that whichever I chose, I risked letting someone down."}
