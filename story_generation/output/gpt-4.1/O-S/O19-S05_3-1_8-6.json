The national program was rigorous this year, packed with updates on new therapies and safety protocols. My supervisor expected me to stay at the forefront of pharmaceutical knowledge, and I took pride in being a reliable resource for my patients. But as I scrolled through the next module, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the advocacy meeting scheduled in fifteen minutes. As an advocate, I was counted on to be present and punctual at every meeting and court session, to give a voice to those who needed it most. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the live Q&A with the program\u2019s lead instructor, a rare chance to clarify complex topics. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the meeting, letting down the people who depended on my support. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between my commitment to professional excellence and my responsibility to those I represented."}
