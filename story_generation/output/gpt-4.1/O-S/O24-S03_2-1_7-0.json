This morning, an attorney cited a fresh appellate decision that could shift the entire case. I promised to review it before our next session, and the weight of that responsibility presses on me as I leave the courthouse. Yet, as a citizen, I crave a moment of normalcy\u2014a simple walk in the park, away from the relentless tide of legal documents. The sun is warm, the air is crisp, and I savor the rare peace. I unwrap a snack, but as I finish, I notice the trash bin is overflowing, and a few wrappers have blown onto the grass. The posted no-littering signs glare at me, a silent reminder of my civic duty. I hesitate, torn between rushing home to study the new case law and taking the time to pick up not just my own trash, but the scattered litter around me. The judge in me urges discipline and preparation; the citizen in me demands respect for the community. My hands tremble slightly as I stand there, caught between the expectations of the bench and the responsibilities of the everyday world."}
