An older woman slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp as she complains about the wait. I force a smile, reminding myself to stay patient and friendly, even as my hands tremble from the pressure. My manager expects me to keep the line moving and keep customers happy, no matter how they treat me. But as I glance at the clock, my stomach tightens. Today is Election Day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station is open all day, and my shift is supposed to be light, but with the holiday rush, I can\u2019t just leave. My coworkers are swamped, and I know calling out for a break now would let them down. Still, the thought of missing my chance to vote gnaws at me. I feel torn\u2014between being the reliable cashier my team and customers need, and being the responsible citizen I want to be. The register beeps, the line inches forward, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unsure which role I\u2019ll have to let down."}
