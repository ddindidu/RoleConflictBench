The automated compliance system is ruthless; even a minute of unscheduled downtime could mean a warning or worse. My headset buzzes with another call, but my phone vibrates with a reminder: today\u2019s the last day to drop off my mail-in ballot. I rush to the polling station during my lunch, hoping to make it back in time. As I hand over my ballot, the poll worker frowns and points out a smudge on the envelope. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to re-sign this, or your vote might not count,\u201d she says, sliding a new envelope toward me. I glance at my watch\u2014if I take even a few extra minutes, the system will flag me. But if I rush, my vote could be rejected. My job demands strict adherence to the schedule, but my duty as a voter means following every instruction. My heart pounds as I stand there, pen in hand, torn between the risk of disciplinary action and the fear of my voice not being heard."}
