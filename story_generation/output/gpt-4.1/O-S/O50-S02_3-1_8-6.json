They were about to start a batch that, if mishandled, could cause a serious accident. As the machine repairer, it was my duty to step in, explain the safety protocols, and make sure everyone understood the risks. My supervisor expected me to be vigilant, to guide the team and prevent any mishaps.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my activist group\u2019s latest post was exploding online. This was the moment we\u2019d been waiting for, a rare chance to reach thousands with a single, well-timed comment. My friends were counting on me to add crucial information, to educate the public and keep the momentum going.\n\nI felt torn, my mind racing between the urgent need to protect the staff in front of me and the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to advance my cause.
