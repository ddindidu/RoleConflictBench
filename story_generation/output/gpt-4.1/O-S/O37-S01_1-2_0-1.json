As the housekeeping cleaner in our shared house, everyone expects me to keep the place spotless, but lately, I\u2019ve only managed to tidy up the obvious messes\u2014folding blankets, wiping counters, and sweeping the hallway. Today, I noticed dust gathering in the corners and a sticky patch on the kitchen floor. I knew I should do a more thorough job, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift starts in less than an hour. The coordinator had sent a message last night, stressing that every volunteer must be on time because the roster is tight and the doors open right at nine. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I left now, the house would only be half-clean, and my housemates might complain. But if I stayed to finish, I\u2019d be late for my shift, letting down the team and the people counting on us. My mind raced, torn between the demands of both roles, each pulling me in a different direction."}
