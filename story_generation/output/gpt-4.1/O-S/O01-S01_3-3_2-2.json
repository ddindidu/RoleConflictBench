The hospital project was at a critical stage\u2014today was the final inspection before construction resumed. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a single oversight. Lives depend on this.\u201d I knew I had to double-check every exit, every fire escape, every detail. But my phone buzzed, reminding me of my volunteer shift at the shelter. I was the only one with the keys, and people would already be lining up outside, waiting for warmth and food. If I was late, they\u2019d be left in the cold. My mind raced, torn between the weight of responsibility as an architect\u2014ensuring the safety of hundreds of future patients\u2014and my commitment as a volunteer, not wanting to let down those who depended on me. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
