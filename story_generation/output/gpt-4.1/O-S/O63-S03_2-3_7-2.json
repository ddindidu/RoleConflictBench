The phone queue was still packed, and I knew management was watching every second I logged out. My headset felt heavy, my jaw tight from hours of polite pitches. I needed this break, but the pressure to keep the queue moving gnawed at me. \n\nAs I finally stepped outside, the city\u2019s noise hit me. A crowd had gathered nearby, chanting and waving signs. I recognized the demonstration from the news\u2014people demanding change, their voices echoing off the buildings. I watched, torn between curiosity and caution. Suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we won\u2019t be ignored!\u201d They gestured toward the barricade, the line between public sidewalk and restricted city property. \n\nI hesitated, feeling the weight of my roles. As a telemarketer, I was expected to return on time, every break logged and justified. As a citizen, I believed in following laws and respecting boundaries, but I also felt the pull of solidarity with the crowd. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, caught between the demands of my job and my responsibilities as a member of this city."}
