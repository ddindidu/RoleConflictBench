Please, it\u2019s broken and I can\u2019t afford another.\u201d My training as a cashier was clear: no returns without a receipt. The store manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions. But as an advocate, I was used to fighting for people, especially when the stakes were high. My client\u2019s trial was tomorrow, and I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, determined to give them the best defense possible. I knew what it meant to have someone in your corner, someone who believed in you when the rules seemed stacked against you. The woman\u2019s eyes pleaded with me, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. The store expected me to enforce the policy, but the advocate in me wanted to help her, to bend the rules just this once. My heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between the rigid expectations of my job and the compassion that defined my other life."}
