My manager expects me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, especially during the after-work rush. I glance at the clock\u2014only two hours left before the polls close. There\u2019s a ballot measure today that could change the way our block handles parking, something I care about deeply as a resident. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who shows up and speaks out. But every time I think about asking for a break, I see the growing line, the tired faces, my supervisor\u2019s watchful eyes. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my team and the customers. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to have a say in my own neighborhood. My hands tremble as I hand back a receipt, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility I feel as a member of my community."}
