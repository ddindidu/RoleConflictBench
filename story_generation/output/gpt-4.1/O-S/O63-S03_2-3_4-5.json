I still needed three more sales to hit my weekly target, and management had made it clear\u2014no exceptions, no excuses. My script was open, my list of leads dwindling, and my nerves fraying. But then my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place for the ballot measure about our block\u2019s zoning would close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who didn\u2019t just complain but participated. My neighbors were counting on me to help shape our community\u2019s future. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d miss my target, risk my bonus, maybe even my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my civic duty slide, something I always told myself I\u2019d never do. My hand hovered over the mouse, torn between dialing the next number and grabbing my coat. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I could feel my chest tighten as I weighed what mattered more in this moment."}
