The cloud tops are rising faster than forecasted, and pilots\u2019 voices crackle in my ear, each one waiting for revised climb instructions. My supervisor expects me to keep the airspace safe, to communicate clearly and quickly. Every second counts. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: today is election day. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, but I know if I don\u2019t go soon, I might get caught up in a rush or an unexpected delay. I promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014my civic duty, my voice. Yet, right now, the sky demands my full attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the responsibility to the pilots above and the responsibility to my community below. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, torn between the demands of the air and the call of the ballot box, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
