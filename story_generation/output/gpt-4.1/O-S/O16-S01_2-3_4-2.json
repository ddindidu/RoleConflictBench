She sat across from me, her eyes wide with worry, clutching the pamphlet I\u2019d just handed her about her new diagnosis. I knew she needed more than just information\u2014she needed reassurance, a clear plan, and someone to listen. I wanted to give her all of that, to be the doctor she deserved. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in ten minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and I pictured the line of people already waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start the day\u2019s service. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urge to stay and support my patient with the responsibility I felt toward the people waiting at the center. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, and my time, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, and I hesitated, torn between the needs of one and the needs of many."}
