It\u2019s a little higher than usual, and her pulse is quick. She\u2019s just come out of surgery, so I know I should keep a close eye on her, maybe check again in fifteen minutes, just to be safe. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the online candidate forum for my district is starting now. I\u2019ve been waiting for this, eager to hear the candidates\u2019 positions before I vote. I promised myself I\u2019d participate, maybe even submit a question about healthcare funding. \n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. As a nursing assistant, I\u2019m expected to be vigilant, to notice even small changes in my patients and act quickly. As a citizen, I want to be engaged, to make my voice heard and help shape the future of my community. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I feel the tension rising in my chest as I stand in the hallway, torn between the patient who might need me and the civic duty I don\u2019t want to neglect."}
