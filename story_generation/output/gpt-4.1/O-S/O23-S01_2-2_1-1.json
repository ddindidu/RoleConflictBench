The filing deadline was tomorrow, and I knew I needed to review every clause, every signature, before the clock ran out. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. The shelter\u2019s doors would open in thirty minutes, and today, every pair of hands was needed. The roster was tight, and I\u2019d promised to be there on time. I could almost hear the coordinator\u2019s voice: \u201cWe can\u2019t start without you.\u201d My mind raced, torn between the urgent legal review and the faces at the shelter who counted on me. I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I\u2019d catch every detail, and the equally pressing responsibility to the people who needed a warm meal and a smile. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding all of me, right now."}
