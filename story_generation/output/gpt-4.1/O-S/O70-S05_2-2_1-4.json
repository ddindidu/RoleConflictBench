The groceries in the back seat were for Mrs. Patel, who had called twice already, her voice trembling as she explained she needed them for her family\u2019s dinner. The delivery window was closing fast, and traffic was crawling. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a reminder about the court hearing in less than an hour. My client, Mr. Lee, was counting on me to be there, to argue his case with the care and attention it deserved. I could picture him waiting anxiously outside the courtroom, hoping I\u2019d show up prepared. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. If I delivered the groceries late, I\u2019d let down a family who depended on me. If I rushed the delivery and missed the hearing, I\u2019d fail my client at a critical moment. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I tried to breathe, torn between two promises, each demanding my full presence, each unforgiving of delay."}
