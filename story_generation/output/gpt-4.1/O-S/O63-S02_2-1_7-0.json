The phone queue is still packed, and I know management is watching every second I\u2019m away from my desk. If I take my break now, I\u2019ll get a warning, maybe even lose my chance at a bonus. But my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s at the city square, live-streaming a protest that barely has a dozen people. \u201cIf anyone can come, we need more bodies,\u201d she texts. I feel my chest tighten. I promised myself I\u2019d show up more, be present, not just online. But here I am, headset on, tied to a script, expected to keep the calls moving. My break is the only window I have, but if I leave my desk, I\u2019ll be letting my team down\u2014and risking my job. If I stay, I\u2019ll be letting my friends down, and the cause I care about. The seconds tick by, and I can\u2019t decide which part of myself I\u2019m supposed to betray."}
