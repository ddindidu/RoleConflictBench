The critical service was buckling under load, and the traces pointed directly to the functions I\u2019d merged last night. My team was counting on me to fix this\u2014clean, maintainable code was my mantra, and now it felt like I\u2019d let everyone down. Slack notifications pinged relentlessly, each one a reminder of the chaos I\u2019d caused.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with another reminder: the radio show. In five minutes, I was supposed to go live, educating the public about our cause\u2014something I\u2019d spent weeks preparing for. The community expected me to be articulate, passionate, and present. I could already picture the host introducing me, the listeners tuning in, waiting for my words.\n\nI glanced between the terminal and my phone, sweat prickling my neck. If I stayed, I could start patching the code, maybe prevent a full outage. If I left, I\u2019d let my team down\u2014but if I missed the show, I\u2019d let my community down. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I felt myself caught, breathless, between them."}
