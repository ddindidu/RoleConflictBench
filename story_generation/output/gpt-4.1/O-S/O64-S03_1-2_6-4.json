I smile at Mrs. Lee as she places her groceries on the belt, making sure to greet her warmly. \u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d I ask, keeping my tone friendly, just as my manager expects. The store is slow, and I know I\u2019m supposed to make every customer feel welcome, even if it means stretching small talk a little longer.\n\nBut my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder that the online candidate forum for my district is streaming right now. I promised myself I\u2019d watch it live, to stay informed and maybe even ask a question in the chat. As a citizen, I feel responsible for knowing who\u2019s running and what they stand for\u2014especially with the election coming up. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I focus on the forum, I might seem distracted or rude to customers. If I give my full attention to the register, I\u2019ll miss the chance to participate in something that matters to my community. My hands move automatically, but my mind is split, torn between being the attentive cashier and the engaged citizen I want to be."}
