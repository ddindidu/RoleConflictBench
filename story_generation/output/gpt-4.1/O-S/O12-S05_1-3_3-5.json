As a software developer, I was expected to collaborate with other teams, and Product had scheduled a general brainstorming session for the next sprint. Attendance was technically optional, but I knew my input was valued, and skipping it would mean missing a chance to shape the new features. At the same time, as an advocate, I was preparing for a critical trial\u2014one that could determine the course of my client\u2019s life. The trial was set for the same day as the brainstorming session. My client was counting on me to represent them with everything I had, and the weight of their trust pressed heavily on my shoulders. I felt torn, pulled between the creative energy of my tech team and the solemn responsibility of the courtroom. My mind raced with possible solutions, but the anxiety of letting someone down\u2014either my colleagues or my client\u2014gnawed at me. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to make the call."}
