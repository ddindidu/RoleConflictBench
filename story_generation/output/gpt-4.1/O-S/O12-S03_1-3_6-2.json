The UI glitch again\u2014users complained, but it wasn\u2019t critical, and everyone knew the workaround. Still, my manager expected a fix, and QA was breathing down my neck. I promised myself I\u2019d handle it after the demonstration. \n\nLater, standing in the crowd, I felt the energy of people demanding change. Suddenly, someone beside me nudged my arm, whispering, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2014past the barricade. We need to make them listen.\u201d I hesitated, staring at the yellow tape marking city property. I knew the law; crossing it was trespassing. As a citizen, I was supposed to respect public property and follow the rules. But the urgency in the air was contagious, and the crowd\u2019s expectations pressed on me. \n\nMy mind raced\u2014should I risk breaking the law for the cause, or hold back and disappoint those around me? And in the back of my mind, the bug report notification blinked, a reminder of my other world, where I was expected to fix problems, not create them. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my two lives."}
