As a lifeguard, I knew my duty: never let my attention waver, not even for a second. Today, the pool was busy, and I spotted a swimmer in the middle, their strokes growing sloppy. I leaned forward, heart pounding, ready to jump in if needed. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the free vaccine clinic at the community center. As a responsible citizen, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go, do my part for public health, and I still had tax documents to finalize before the deadline. The weight of both roles pressed on me. If I left my post, even briefly, I\u2019d risk someone\u2019s safety. But if I missed the clinic, I\u2019d be neglecting my civic duty, and the tax paperwork loomed over me. My mind raced, torn between the immediate responsibility in front of me and the broader obligations I owed my community."}
