I glanced at the line of customers, each with carts piled high, and felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. As a cashier, I had to process every transaction with precision, especially now, handling the day\u2019s largest sales. Any mistake could mean a costly error for the store\u2014and for me. But in the back of my mind, another worry gnawed at me: today was election day, and the polling station would close in just a couple of hours. I was expected to fulfill my civic duty, to show up and cast my vote, but the line wasn\u2019t shrinking, and my manager had already reminded us that accuracy was more important than speed. My hands trembled as I counted change, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility of being a voter. Each passing minute felt like a choice slipping away, and I could feel the stress building, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
