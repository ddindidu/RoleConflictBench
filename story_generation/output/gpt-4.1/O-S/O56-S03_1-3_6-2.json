As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting, to ensure the best results and maintain salon standards. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair is spotless, and I hesitate, not wanting to waste water or her time. Still, my boss is strict about following protocol.\n\nLater, on my lunch break, I pass by a street demonstration. The crowd is passionate, voices raised for a cause I support. Suddenly, someone grabs my arm, urging me to step past a police barricade onto restricted city property. As a citizen, I know I should respect the law and public order, but the energy of the crowd and the urgency of the moment tug at me.\n\nI feel torn, pulled between the expectations of my job and my conscience as a citizen. Both roles demand something of me, and I can\u2019t ignore the pressure building inside as I stand at the edge of two worlds, unsure which line I\u2019m about to cross."}
