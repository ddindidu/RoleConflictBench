My code was almost done, the new feature finally coming together after a week of late nights. But the code review comments blinked at me: \u201cPerformance issues\u2014needs refactoring.\u201d I knew I couldn\u2019t just push it as is; my team counted on me to deliver clean, efficient code. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center at 8:15. People would already be waiting outside, some of them elderly, relying on me to start the morning service. My manager expected me to fix the code before the daily standup, but the faces of those waiting volunteers flashed in my mind. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my team\u2019s trust in my work, the community\u2019s trust in my presence.
