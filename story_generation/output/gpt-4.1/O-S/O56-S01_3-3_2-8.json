I knew how important it was to greet them warmly, to set them at ease before the big day. I smiled, ushered them to their seats, and tried to chat about hairstyles and wedding jitters. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the volunteer coordinator. I glanced at it and my heart sank. There was an urgent directive: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the service I volunteered for would be shut down. The instructions were strict, and I was expected to follow them to the letter, no exceptions.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The bride\u2019s anxious eyes met mine, silently pleading for reassurance. At the same time, the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind, reminding me of the responsibility I had to the people who depended on our volunteer work. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for my scissors, torn between the comfort I owed my clients and the duty I owed my fellow volunteers."}
