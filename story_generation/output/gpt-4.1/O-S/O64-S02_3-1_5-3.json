The policy is clear: no distractions, no shortcuts, every step logged for the audit. My manager trusts me to get this right, and I know a single mistake could mean trouble for both of us. My phone buzzes on the counter. It\u2019s a reminder from my activist group\u2014our petition to the state senator is about to close, and this is my last chance to add my name. I\u2019ve spent weeks rallying support for this cause, urging others to sign, and now, when it matters most, I\u2019m stuck behind the register. If I pause to sign, I\u2019ll break store policy and risk an error in the deposit. If I ignore the petition, I\u2019ll let down my fellow activists and my own beliefs. My hands tremble as I hover between the cash drawer and my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
