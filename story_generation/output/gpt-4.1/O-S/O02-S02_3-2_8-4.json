The numbers had to be precise\u2014if I delayed, the whole deal could fall through. My team was counting on me to get this right, and the client was waiting for my answer before signing. Just as I started reviewing the schedule, my phone buzzed again. It was a legislative aide from Senator Kim\u2019s office\u2014she could talk now, but only for the next ten minutes. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist: a real chance to push for the environmental bill I\u2019d been fighting for. My heart pounded. If I missed this call, the bill might lose momentum. But if I didn\u2019t finish the estimates, I\u2019d let my team down and jeopardize the project. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, each demanding my full attention at the exact same moment."}
