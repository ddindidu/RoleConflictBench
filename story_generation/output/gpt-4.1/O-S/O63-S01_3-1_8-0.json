My volunteer shift at the food pantry started in fifteen minutes, but my telemarketing break wasn\u2019t scheduled for another half hour. The compliance system blinked a warning\u2014any unscheduled downtime would be flagged, and I\u2019d already been cautioned once this month. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to your schedule, or it\u2019ll go on your record.\u201d But I\u2019d promised the pantry coordinator I\u2019d be there on time, and I hated the thought of letting her down, even if the other volunteers could cover for a bit. My stomach twisted as I weighed the risk of disciplinary action against the guilt of not keeping my word. I stared at the \u201cLog Out\u201d button, my finger hovering, caught between the rigid demands of my job and the flexible, yet meaningful, commitment I\u2019d made as a volunteer."}
