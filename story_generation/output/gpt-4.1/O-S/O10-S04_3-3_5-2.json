The subject line\u2014\u201cImmediate Response Required: Tax Discrepancy\u201d\u2014felt like a siren. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the expectation: respond quickly, ensure compliance, avoid penalties. My boss would expect nothing less. But as I glanced at the clock, panic rose in my chest. The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year. Civic duty, the right to have a say\u2014those expectations pressed on me too. I could see the polling station from my office window, just across the street, but the tax notice demanded my attention now. If I left, I might miss the chance to clarify the discrepancy before the deadline. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the responsibility I felt as a citizen. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach."}
