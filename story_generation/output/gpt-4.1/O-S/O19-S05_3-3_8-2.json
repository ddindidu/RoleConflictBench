As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014today was the final session of a national continuing education program, and missing it could jeopardize my licensure.

As their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, accurate advice\u2014any delay could have serious consequences for them. My heart pounded as I glanced between the webinar countdown and the incoming messages. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait.
