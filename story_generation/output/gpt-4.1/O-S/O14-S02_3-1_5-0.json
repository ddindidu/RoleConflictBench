The journal\u2019s submission portal is open in another tab, the deadline just hours away. My data is solid, but the analysis needs one more careful review before I can upload everything. My phone buzzes\u2014an urgent message from Maya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice tense as she asks for more people to join the demonstration. The protest is small, but the issue is huge, and I know my presence could help amplify their message. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the scientific community expects precision and integrity, while my activist friends count on my solidarity and action. My heart pounds as I watch Maya\u2019s shaky video feed, then glance back at my unfinished report. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both demand all of me right now."}
