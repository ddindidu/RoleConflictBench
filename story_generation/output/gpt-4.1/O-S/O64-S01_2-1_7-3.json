As a cashier, I know people expect a friendly face, someone who remembers their name or asks about their day. When Mrs. Carter steps up, I greet her warmly, and we chat as I scan her groceries. The line behind her grows, but I keep the conversation light, just as I\u2019ve been trained.\n\nThen, she mentions her daughter, who I know from my volunteer work at the local shelter. Instinctively, I want to ask how she\u2019s doing, to show I care. But as a volunteer, I\u2019m bound to respect the privacy of everyone I help. Even though nothing sensitive has come up, I feel a knot in my stomach. The customers expect friendliness, but my volunteer role demands discretion. My mind races\u2014should I acknowledge what I know, or keep the conversation generic? The pressure of the waiting line and the weight of confidentiality pull me in opposite directions, and I can feel my smile falter as I hesitate, caught between two sets of expectations."}
