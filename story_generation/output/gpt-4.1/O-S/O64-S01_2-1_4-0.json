My volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes, and I was still at the store, stuck behind the counter. A woman stood in front of me, holding a blender and explaining that she\u2019d lost her receipt but really needed to return it. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without a receipt. My manager expected me to follow the rules, no exceptions. But the woman looked desperate, and I could feel her frustration mounting.\n\nAt the same time, I knew the volunteer coordinator counted on me to be punctual, but today, there were plenty of volunteers. If I was a little late, the others could cover for me. Still, I hated the idea of letting anyone down. I felt torn, caught between the rigid expectations of my job and the more flexible, but still important, commitment I\u2019d made as a volunteer. My mind raced, weighing the consequences of each choice, as the woman waited for my answer and the clock kept ticking."}
