The quarterly tax filing deadline loomed just a week away, and I knew every number had to be perfect\u2014no mistakes, no shortcuts. My manager expected nothing less than full compliance with every tax law and regulation. As I double-checked the figures, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply room at the shelter, mentioning it would be helpful if I could try it out before the weekend. I wanted to help, to show I was committed to the team and willing to follow her guidance. But the thought of leaving my desk, even for a few hours, made my stomach twist. I felt torn\u2014my professional duty demanded my full attention, but my heart pulled me toward the shelter, where I knew my help was needed. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, unable to decide which expectation to meet first."}
