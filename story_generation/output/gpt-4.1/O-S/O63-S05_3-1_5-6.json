My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit the target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d The pressure was suffocating. I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my eyes kept darting to the calendar reminder flashing on my screen: \u201cAdvocacy meeting in 10 minutes. Attendance mandatory.\u201d My advocacy team relied on me to be present, to speak up for our clients, and to show unwavering commitment. Missing a meeting could mean letting down people who counted on my voice. But if I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my telemarketing team at the most critical moment. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014one demanding relentless sales, the other unwavering presence. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the walls of both worlds closing in."}
