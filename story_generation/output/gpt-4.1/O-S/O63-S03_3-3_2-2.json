My script urged me to reassure her, to explain every detail, to keep her on the line. I could almost see my supervisor\u2019s expectant gaze, waiting for me to turn this call around. But outside, the city pulsed with energy. Through the window, I glimpsed the crowd gathering for the demonstration. My break was minutes away, and I\u2019d promised my friends I\u2019d join them. \n\nWhen I finally stepped outside, the air was thick with chants and banners. Someone grabbed my arm, eyes bright with urgency. \u201cCome on! We need more people past the barricade\u2014show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d The police line was clear, the tape fluttering in the breeze.

My mind spun, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my community, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
