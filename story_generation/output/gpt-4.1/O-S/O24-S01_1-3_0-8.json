As a judge, I knew the expectation: every file deserved my full attention, no matter how routine the case seemed. I owed it to the parties to be prepared, to catch any detail that might matter. But my phone buzzed with a new message\u2014an urgent directive from the volunteer coordinator. The community service I helped run was at risk; new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or we\u2019d be forced to close our doors. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear: everyone\u2019s compliance was non-negotiable, and my help was needed now.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I focused on the case file, I\u2019d be neglecting the volunteer work that so many people depended on. If I dropped everything for the volunteer directive, I\u2019d be failing in my duty as a judge. My mind raced, torn between the silent weight of the law and the desperate voices of those who needed our service. I stared at the file, then at my phone, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
