As the lead engineer, everyone was waiting for my effort estimates to finalize the contract. The project manager\u2019s emails grew more urgent by the hour\u2014without my numbers, the deal couldn\u2019t move forward. But as the client\u2019s advocate, I knew their case was complicated. The contract terms were strict, and if I underestimated, the client could be exposed to penalties or rushed work. My engineering team wanted realistic deadlines, but the client\u2019s legal interests demanded caution and thoroughness. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one side urging me to commit, the other warning me to protect. My mind raced with calculations and legal risks, knowing that whatever I decided would disappoint someone. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between my duty to my team and my responsibility to my client, unable to move forward."}
