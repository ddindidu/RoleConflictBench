The school zone sign flashed, and a group of kids clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the hum of traffic. I eased my foot on the brake, heart pounding, knowing I had to be extra cautious\u2014my job as a taxi driver demanded it. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. Glancing down, I saw the name of the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks.
