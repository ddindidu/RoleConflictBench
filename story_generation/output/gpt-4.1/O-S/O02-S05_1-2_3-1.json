As an engineer, I knew the routine audit was months away, but the documentation was outdated and needed careful revision to meet the latest safety standards. My manager expected everything to be flawless, and I felt the weight of that responsibility. At the same time, as an advocate, my client\u2019s case was becoming a tangled web of regulations and exceptions. She called twice today, anxious for clear, accurate advice. She trusted me to guide her, and I could hear the urgency in her voice. I wanted to give her the attention she deserved, to comb through every detail and offer the best counsel. But every minute I spent on her case meant less time ensuring our engineering files were audit-ready. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my team and the promise I\u2019d made to my client. The clock ticked on, and I stared at the mountain of work, feeling the pressure build as I tried to decide where to turn first."}
