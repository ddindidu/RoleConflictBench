Deadlines are more like guidelines, and as long as the work is progressing, I don\u2019t stress over every detail. This Saturday, I\u2019m taking a break, walking through the park, letting my mind wander. I unwrap a snack, and without thinking, I crumple the wrapper in my hand. There\u2019s a trash bin a few steps away, but I\u2019m lost in thoughts about the new building design, the project timeline, and whether I should push the team harder next week.\n\nThen I notice the no-littering sign. As a citizen, I know I should respect public spaces, follow the rules, and set an example. But the easygoing part of me\u2014the one that lets things slide at work\u2014whispers that it\u2019s just one wrapper, and I could toss it later. My hand hovers, uncertain, as I glance between the trash bin and the path ahead. The expectations of my roles tug at me: efficiency and progress versus responsibility and respect. I stand there, caught between the urge to move on and the duty to do what\u2019s right, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in."}
