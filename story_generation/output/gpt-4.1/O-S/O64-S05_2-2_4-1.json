As a cashier, I was expected to follow every store policy to the letter, especially when it came to returns. Today, a woman approached, frustration etched on her face, clutching a blender she wanted to return\u2014without a receipt. The policy was clear: no receipt, no return. But as she pleaded her case, I recognized her as a client from my other life, the one where I was her advocate, guiding her through a complicated legal issue. She trusted me to provide clear, honest advice, to fight for her interests. Now, she looked at me, hoping I\u2019d bend the rules just this once. My manager watched from across the floor, expecting me to enforce the policy. My client\u2019s eyes searched mine for understanding. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, the rules of the store clashing with my duty to support her. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t satisfy both expectations."}
