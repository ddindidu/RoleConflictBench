As a telemarketer, every minute is tracked, every break scrutinized. Management has made it clear: no unscheduled pauses, not even for a bathroom break, unless I want a warning in my file. But just as I\u2019m about to start my next call, my phone buzzes with a message from my activist group. The legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks is available\u2014right now, for the next ten minutes only. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to push for the policy change we\u2019ve all worked so hard on. My heart pounds. If I take the call, I\u2019ll have to step away from my desk, and the system will log my absence. I can already imagine the manager\u2019s glare, the possible write-up. But if I miss this window, our campaign could lose its momentum. I stare at the blinking lights, torn between the job that pays my bills and the cause that gives my life meaning, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
