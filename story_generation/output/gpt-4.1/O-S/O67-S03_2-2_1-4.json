As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m trained to drop everything and respond, no matter what. My hands automatically reached for the ignition, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district was starting now. As a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d stay informed, participate, and even submit a question about healthcare funding. I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this chance to have my voice heard, to help shape the policies that affect my work and my neighbors. But the siren\u2019s call was literal\u2014someone needed me, and every second counted. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, the candidates\u2019 faces flickering, while the ambulance engine idled, ready to roar. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each with its own urgency. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between duty to a stranger in pain and duty to my community\u2019s future, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
