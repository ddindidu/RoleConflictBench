My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers, or we\u2019ll have to talk about your future here.\u201d I stare at the list of cold calls, my headset heavy on my ears, my fingers trembling as I dial another number. But my phone buzzes with a different urgency: a message from my activist group. The protest march is starting in minutes, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, my voice setting the tone for the crowd. They\u2019re counting on me to show up, to stand up for what we believe in. My heart pounds as I weigh the headset in one hand and my protest sign in the other, torn between the pressure to keep my job and the responsibility to my cause. The seconds tick by, and I can feel the expectations from both worlds closing in, demanding I choose."}
