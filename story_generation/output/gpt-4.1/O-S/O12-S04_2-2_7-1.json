Users were getting kicked out of the app at random, and QA was tagging me directly, asking for urgent fixes. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need this stable before tomorrow.\u201d I knew how much our clients depended on us, and I felt the weight of their frustration. But as I glanced at the clock, my stomach twisted. The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had to get across town. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after all the debates and discussions. My civic duty felt just as important as my job. But if I left now, I\u2019d let my team down; if I stayed, I might lose my chance to have a say in the election. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my work and my responsibility as a citizen."}
