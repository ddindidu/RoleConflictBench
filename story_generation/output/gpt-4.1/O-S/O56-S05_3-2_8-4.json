She needed a deep cleanse before I could even think about cutting\u2014if I didn\u2019t, my scissors would snag, and her style would be ruined. But my phone buzzed on the counter, the screen lighting up with a reminder: court in one hour. My other client, Mr. Patel, was counting on me to represent him in a hearing that could decide his future. I could almost hear his anxious voice in my head, reminding me how much this case meant to him. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair, but my mind kept drifting to the courtroom, to the files I still needed to review. Both clients needed me, both expected my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, the weight of their trust pressing down on me as I rinsed the suds from Mrs. Lee\u2019s tangled hair."}
