As an architect, I\u2019m trained to anticipate every need\u2014clear walkways, accessible desks, enough light for everyone. My mind is always on function, on making sure every detail serves the people who\u2019ll use the space. Later, I rushed to the polling station, ballot in hand, feeling the weight of civic duty. When I handed over my envelope, the poll worker frowned and pointed out a smudge on my signature. \u201cCould you re-sign this? Otherwise, your vote might not count.\u201d \n\nI hesitated. As an architect, I\u2019m meticulous\u2014every mark matters, every instruction followed to the letter. But as a voter, I\u2019m suddenly anxious. What if re-signing looks suspicious? What if it\u2019s not allowed? The poll worker insists, but my mind races with the need to do things right, to follow the rules exactly. I feel torn, caught between my professional instinct for precision and my responsibility to follow the poll worker\u2019s guidance. My hand hovers over the envelope, heart pounding, unsure which role to trust."}
