I\u2019d planned to vote before my shift, ID in hand, but dispatch\u2019s urgent call changed everything: an armed robbery, just blocks away. My duty as a police officer surged to the forefront\u2014lives were at stake, and every second counted. But as I reached for my wallet, I realized I\u2019d left my primary ID at home, only my backup card in my pocket. The poll worker hesitated, unsure if it would suffice. I could fetch the right ID later, but the robbery demanded my immediate response. My mind raced\u2014should I insist on voting now, fulfilling my civic duty, or rush to the scene, upholding my oath to protect? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation clear, yet impossible to meet at once. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the call of duty and the right to vote, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both in this moment."}
