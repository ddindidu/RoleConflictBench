The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime\u2014find the fault, fast.\u201d I knelt, tools in hand, tracing wires and checking the sensor\u2019s connections, but the error kept flashing. Every minute the line was down, pressure mounted. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the polling place would close in two hours. The ballot measure today could change parking rules on my block, something I\u2019d argued about at neighborhood meetings for months. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, be a responsible citizen, not just complain. But now, the plant needed me. If I left, production would stall even longer, and I\u2019d let my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to have a say in my own community. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands, caught between the urgent needs of my job and my responsibility as a citizen."}
