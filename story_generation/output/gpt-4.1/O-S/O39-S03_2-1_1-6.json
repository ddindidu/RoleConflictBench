The carpenter waves, impatient, waiting for me to bring the next load so he can keep working. My foreman expects me to keep the materials coming, no delays, no excuses. But my mind keeps drifting to the flyer in my lunchbox\u2014the community center is running a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and I know how important it is to stay healthy, not just for myself but for everyone around me. I\u2019ve also got my tax documents sorted, ready to file, doing my part as a responsible citizen. But if I leave the site, even for a short while, the work slows down, and the crew will be frustrated. If I stay, I might miss the clinic, and who knows when I\u2019ll get another chance. The weight on my shoulders feels heavier than the lumber\u2014pulled between the demands of my job and my duty to my community, I stand frozen, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
