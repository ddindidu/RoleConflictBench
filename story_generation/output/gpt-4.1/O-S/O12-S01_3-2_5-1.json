The product launch date had just been moved up, and everyone was waiting on me to finalize the API specs. Slack notifications kept popping up\u2014\u201cCan you jump on a call?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re blocked until you decide.\u201d My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need to collaborate fast, or the whole release slips.\u201d\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a different kind of urgency. The volunteer coordinator\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed today. Please be at the center before the doors open. Every minute counts.\u201d I pictured the line of people waiting for help, the other volunteers counting on me to show up on time.\n\nMy heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the team and delay the project. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my commitment to the people who needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I sat frozen, torn between two promises I couldn\u2019t keep."}
