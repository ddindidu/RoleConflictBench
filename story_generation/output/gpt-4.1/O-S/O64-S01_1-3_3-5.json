Today, I noticed a small discrepancy in my register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still, it\u2019s my job to report it. My manager expects me to be vigilant, to document every irregularity, no matter how minor. Later, as a volunteer at the community clinic, I\u2019m sorting through files filled with sensitive medical histories. The coordinator reminds me how crucial it is to respect the privacy of every person whose name appears in those folders. I can\u2019t help but think about the trust placed in me here, the expectation that I\u2019ll keep every detail confidential. The two roles pull at me\u2014one demands transparency and strict adherence to rules, the other absolute discretion and protection of privacy. As I sit at the volunteer desk, the weight of both expectations presses on me, and I find myself caught between the urge to report every irregularity and the responsibility to guard secrets that aren\u2019t mine to share."}
