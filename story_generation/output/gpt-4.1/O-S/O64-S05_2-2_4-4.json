As a cashier, I was expected to follow store policies to the letter\u2014no returns without a receipt, no exceptions. Today, a woman approached, her eyes pleading as she explained she\u2019d lost her receipt but desperately needed to return a faulty blender. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t make exceptions, or everyone will expect it.\u201d I felt the weight of the store\u2019s rules pressing down on me.\n\nBut I was also an advocate, trained to fight for my clients, to see the person behind the problem and ensure their voice was heard. In court, I\u2019d argue passionately for someone in her position, highlighting the fairness and reasonableness of her request. Now, I felt torn\u2014my duty as a cashier demanded strict adherence to policy, but my advocate\u2019s heart urged me to help her, to find a way around the rules. My hands trembled slightly as I looked at her, caught between the rigid expectations of my job and the compassion that defined my other role."}
