As a delivery person, I knew the drill: hand it directly to the recipient, verify their ID, and get a signature. No shortcuts, especially with something this important. But as I waited at the door, my mind kept drifting to the community center. I was supposed to volunteer right after my shift, and the coordinator had just emailed a suggestion\u2014if I had time, could I reorganize the supply closet? She\u2019d hinted it would really help, and I wanted to show I was reliable.\n\nThe minutes ticked by. No answer at the door, and I couldn\u2019t just leave the package. My phone buzzed again: a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my job demanded I stay until the delivery was complete, but my volunteer role expected me to be flexible and proactive. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between doing my job by the book and not letting down the team at the center. I stood there, package in hand, caught between two sets of expectations, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
