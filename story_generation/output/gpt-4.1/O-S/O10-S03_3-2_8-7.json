Their tone is sharper this time: no payment, no more shipments. As the company\u2019s accountant, I know how critical this is. I\u2019m expected to negotiate, reassure, and somehow buy us more time, but the numbers don\u2019t lie. We\u2019re stretched thin, and I can\u2019t conjure money from nowhere.
