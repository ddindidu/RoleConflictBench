My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways wear gloves, especially when handling chemicals or cleaning the bathrooms. It\u2019s for your safety and the guests\u2019.\u201d I usually did, but sometimes, when I was in a rush or the task seemed minor, I skipped them. Today, though, I felt the pressure more than usual. The hotel was busier than expected, and I was behind on my rooms. \n\nAt the same time, I kept glancing at my phone, checking the time. It was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but I knew if I fell further behind, I\u2019d have to rush my cleaning or risk staying late. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my supervisor and maybe even put guests at risk by cutting corners. If I waited, I worried I\u2019d get too tired or forget to vote altogether. The gloves felt heavy in my hands, and I wondered how I could meet everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014my own included\u2014without letting someone down."}
