The whistle around my neck felt heavier than usual. My phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the last day to vote. I\u2019d planned to stop by the polling station during my break, but the pool was busier than ever. Just as I was about to leave, I spotted a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool. I couldn\u2019t look away, not even for a second. My duty was to watch, to be ready to jump in at any sign of trouble.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. At the polling station, an official explained that my registration didn\u2019t match. I had to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station would close in ten minutes. The official\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to comply immediately. My mind raced\u2014if I left my post, even briefly, I\u2019d risk someone\u2019s safety. But if I didn\u2019t act now, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between the urgent needs of my job and my duty as a citizen."}
