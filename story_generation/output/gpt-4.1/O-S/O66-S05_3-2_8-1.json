My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked me through the app, their words urgent, demanding I arrive faster. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on punctuality and professionalism, but the city\u2019s congestion was beyond my control. At the same time, my other phone vibrated with a call from a client. Their case, already tangled, had just taken a complicated turn. They needed clear, immediate legal advice, and I could hear the anxiety in their voice when I answered.
