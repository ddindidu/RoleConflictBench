The bench trial I just concluded was complicated, and the parties are waiting for my judgment. I know the law requires me to write a clear, detailed opinion\u2014every fact, every conclusion, every nuance must be precise. The deadline is strict: thirty days, no excuses. My mind is already sorting through the evidence, outlining arguments, but my phone buzzes with a reminder. My volunteer shift at the food pantry starts in twenty minutes. I promised to be on time, to set an example for the new volunteers. I know others can cover if I\u2019m late, but I hate the idea of letting them down. My robe feels heavy on my shoulders, the weight of justice and community both pressing in. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the duty to the court and my commitment to serve. My heart pounds as I try to decide which expectation I can afford to disappoint."}
