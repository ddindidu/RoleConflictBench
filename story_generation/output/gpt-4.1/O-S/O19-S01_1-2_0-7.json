The medication matched the label, and I was about to hand it over when I remembered the new safety steps from my volunteer work. Just last night, our volunteer coordinator had stressed the importance of applying these steps everywhere, not just at the community center. She\u2019d said, \u201cWe\u2019re all responsible for safety, no matter where we are.\u201d But here, as a pharmacist, my main job was to dispense medications accurately and efficiently. The pharmacy was busy, and my manager expected me to keep the line moving. If I paused to apply the extra safety checks from my volunteer training, I\u2019d slow everything down and maybe even annoy customers and coworkers. But if I ignored those steps, I\u2019d feel like I was letting down the volunteer team and risking someone\u2019s health. My hands hovered over the prescription bag, my mind torn between the expectations of my two worlds, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
