She\u2019s been coming to me for years, always eager to catch up and unwind. The receptionist is free, but Mrs. Patel looks straight at me, waiting for our usual cheerful greeting. I know she expects me to make her feel welcome, to ask about her grandkids and offer her favorite tea. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the polling station closes in ten minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote today, that I\u2019d do my part as a citizen. My heart pounds as I look from Mrs. Patel\u2019s hopeful face to the clock on the wall. If I greet her and settle her in, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote. If I rush out, I\u2019ll let her down, shattering the comfort she finds in our routine. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between the expectations of my profession and my responsibility as a voter."}
