As a subway operator, I was expected to perform the pre-departure check, even if it was just for the non-critical systems. Safety and punctuality were non-negotiable; the city depended on me to keep the trains running smoothly. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the advocacy meeting was about to start across town. As an advocate, I was expected to be present, to speak up for those who couldn\u2019t, and to never be late\u2014especially not for these routine meetings that set the tone for our work.\n\nMy mind raced. If I delayed the check, I\u2019d be risking the trust of my passengers and my team. If I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d let down my colleagues and the people we represented. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. I stood on the platform, torn, the train humming quietly behind me, my phone vibrating insistently in my pocket, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
