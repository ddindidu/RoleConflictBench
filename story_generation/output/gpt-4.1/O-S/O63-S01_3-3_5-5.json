My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just a few hours left. My phone buzzes with a reminder: volunteer shift at the community center. I rush over, heart pounding, and sit down to sort files. The folders are thick with medical histories, names, diagnoses, addresses\u2014private details entrusted to us. As I work, I notice a familiar name: someone I know from my sales list, someone who might be a perfect lead. My mind races. If I use this information, I could make the sale, help my team, and keep my job secure. But I remember the volunteer coordinator\u2019s words: \u201cConfidentiality is everything. These people trust us.\u201d My hands tremble as I hold the file, torn between the pressure to perform at work and the promise I made to protect these people\u2019s privacy. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the knot of anxiety tightening in my chest."}
