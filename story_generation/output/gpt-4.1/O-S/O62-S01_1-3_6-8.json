As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, and today, swimmers kept slipping into the shallow area without supervision. My job was to keep them safe, to intervene immediately, but just as I was about to step in, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator. The directive was clear: all volunteers had to follow a new set of procedures, effective immediately, or risk the entire service being shut down. I was supposed to report to the office and help implement the changes right away. My heart pounded as I looked from the swimmers to the office door. If I left my post, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as a lifeguard. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring the coordinator\u2019s instructions and putting the volunteer program at risk. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, unable to satisfy either expectation without letting the other down."}
