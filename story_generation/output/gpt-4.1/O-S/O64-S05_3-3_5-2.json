The line had finally thinned, but I still had to count the day\u2019s cash and fill out the deposit forms exactly as the store\u2019s policy demanded. Every step had to be perfect\u2014no shortcuts, no mistakes, or I\u2019d risk an audit and my job. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from a client, desperate for legal advice. Their situation was urgent, and I knew they depended on me to give them clear, accurate guidance right away. My hands shook as I sorted the bills, my mind racing between the numbers in front of me and the legal statutes I needed to recall. The store manager expected me to finish the deposit by the book, but my client expected me to be present, focused, and precise. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of mistakes. My heart pounded as I stared at the cash, my phone lighting up again, torn between the rules of my job and the needs of someone counting on me."}
