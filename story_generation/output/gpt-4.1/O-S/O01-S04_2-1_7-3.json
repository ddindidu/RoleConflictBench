The site meeting with the contractors was running late, and I could see the tension in their faces as we discussed the delays in the delivery of steel beams. As the architect, I was expected to keep everything on schedule, to be the calm center holding the project together. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote today. I\u2019d planned to slip out during lunch, but now, with the project teetering on the edge of another setback, I couldn\u2019t just leave. \n\nYet, as a voter, I knew I had a responsibility too. I\u2019d set my ID aside this morning, but in my rush, I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d packed the right one. If I didn\u2019t have it, I could fetch another later, but that would mean leaving the site again, risking more time lost. The contractors looked to me for decisions, the city expected my vote, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding I choose which expectation to meet first."}
