The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I could see tempers flaring between the two groups. As a police officer, I was expected to keep the peace, to step in if things turned violent. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014just minutes ago, I\u2019d rushed from the polling station, where I\u2019d tried to cast my vote. The election official had told me there was a registration mismatch, and I\u2019d need to fill out a provisional ballot before the station closed in ten minutes. I glanced at my watch, feeling the seconds slip away. My duty demanded I stay and prevent chaos, but as a citizen, I had the right\u2014and the responsibility\u2014to vote. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences if I failed. My heart pounded as I watched the protestors, torn between the oath I\u2019d sworn and the voice I wanted to raise in the election."}
