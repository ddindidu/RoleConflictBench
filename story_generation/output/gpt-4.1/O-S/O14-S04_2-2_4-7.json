As a scientist, I know I must document and report my findings with precision, even if the results are incomplete or uncertain. My supervisor expects a clear summary, and I feel the weight of that responsibility pressing on me. Just as I\u2019m about to finalize my notes, I remember I need to vote before the polls close. At the polling station, I carefully fill out my ballot, but as I seal the envelope, the poll worker notices a smudge on my signature. She asks me to re-sign so my vote won\u2019t be rejected. I hesitate, recalling the strict instructions: sign only once, no alterations. As a voter, I\u2019m supposed to follow every rule exactly, but now I\u2019m being told to break one for the sake of my ballot\u2019s validity. My mind races\u2014should I trust the poll worker\u2019s advice or stick to the official guidelines? The same tension I felt in the lab\u2014between accuracy and expectation\u2014now follows me into the voting booth, leaving me torn between my roles, uncertain which demand to honor."}
