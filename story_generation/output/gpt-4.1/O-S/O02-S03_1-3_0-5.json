As an engineer, I know the project is still in its early stages\u2014nothing is set in stone, and I can always propose alternative solutions later. Yet, my manager expects a preliminary design by the end of the day, and I want to impress with a thoughtful, innovative approach. \n\nBut then my phone buzzes: a reminder that the polling place down the street closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change the zoning laws on my block, and as a citizen, I feel a responsibility to vote and make my voice heard. I promised myself I\u2019d stay engaged, participate, and give feedback on issues that matter to my community. \n\nI glance at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I leave now, I\u2019ll lose precious time on the design. If I stay, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my attention, each important in its own way. My mind churns, torn between my duty to my profession and my responsibility as a citizen."}
