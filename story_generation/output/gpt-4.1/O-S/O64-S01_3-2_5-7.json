As a cashier, I knew the end-of-shift deposit was serious business\u2014every bill counted, every form signed, no shortcuts. The store manager had drilled it into us: follow the procedure, or risk an audit nightmare. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter. They needed me now, and the new safety steps\u2014just announced at the last briefing\u2014were non-negotiable. I was supposed to be there in fifteen minutes, ready to help, following every new protocol to the letter. My stomach twisted. If I rushed the deposit, I\u2019d be breaking store policy. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the team at the shelter and ignore the coordinator\u2019s clear instructions. Both roles demanded my full attention, both had rules I couldn\u2019t bend. I stood there, torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
