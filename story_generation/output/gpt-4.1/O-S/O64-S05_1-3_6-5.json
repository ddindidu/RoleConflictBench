The store is quiet, and I should feel at ease, but my mind is elsewhere. In just a few hours, I\u2019m due in court, where my client\u2019s future hangs in the balance. As an advocate, I\u2019m expected to be sharp, prepared, and wholly focused on their case. The weight of that responsibility presses on me with every beep of the scanner. I catch myself glancing at the clock, anxiety twisting in my stomach. My manager expects me to be present, attentive, and cheerful, but my thoughts are tangled in legal arguments and evidence. I worry that my divided attention will let someone down\u2014either the customers who deserve my best, or my client who needs my unwavering commitment. The demands of both roles pull me in opposite directions, and I can feel the tension building as I try to be everything to everyone, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll have to betray."}
