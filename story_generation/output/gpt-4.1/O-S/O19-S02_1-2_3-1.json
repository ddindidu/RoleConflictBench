The protest march was about to start, and I was supposed to be at the front, megaphone in hand, leading the first chant. My phone buzzed with messages from fellow activists, urging me to hurry. But just as I was about to slip away, a woman approached the counter, her face pinched with pain. \u201cWhich painkiller should I take for my headache?\u201d she asked, holding up two boxes. I knew I should take a moment to counsel her properly, ask about her symptoms, allergies, and other medications. That was my duty as a pharmacist\u2014to ensure her safety, to provide care. But the minutes ticked by, and the weight of my activist role pressed on me. The crowd was gathering, waiting for me to lead. I felt torn, caught between the responsibility to my patient and the cause I believed in. My mind raced, my hands trembled, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
