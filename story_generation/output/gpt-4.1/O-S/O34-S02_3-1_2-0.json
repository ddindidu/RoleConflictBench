A major route closure has just been announced, and now dozens of flights are stacking up, waiting for my instructions. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, tense and expectant, relying on me to keep them safe and the airspace flowing. I know every second counts; a single misstep could mean chaos in the sky.\n\nMy phone buzzes on the desk, a message from Maya: \u201cWe\u2019re live now. More people needed. Can you come?\u201d I glance at the stream\u2014my friends, holding signs, their voices echoing for justice. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d help amplify our cause.
