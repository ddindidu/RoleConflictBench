My eyes caught the blinking red light on the filtration system\u2014a warning I couldn\u2019t ignore. As a lifeguard, I knew the importance of keeping the equipment in top shape; a malfunction could put every swimmer at risk. I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested I reorganize the supply closet if I had a spare moment, emphasizing how it would help everyone. I wanted to be reliable, to show I could follow instructions and be a team player. But the pool\u2019s safety was urgent, and I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the immediate danger at the pool and the expectation to support my fellow volunteers. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of both roles, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
