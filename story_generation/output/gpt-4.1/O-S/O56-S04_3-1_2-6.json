I\u2019d planned everything down to the minute, but the bridal party arrived early, nerves jangling, and I could see the tension in their eyes. My job was to greet them warmly, keep the mood light, and make sure everyone felt pampered and calm. But my mind kept drifting to the polling station, where I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before my next client. When I finally arrived, the line was long, but I was relieved to be on time. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line was barely moving, but the official\u2019s voice was firm. I hesitated, thinking of the bride and her schedule, the expectation that I\u2019d be back in the salon soon, and the rule that I must follow the official\u2019s instructions. My heart pounded as I stood between the two lines, torn between being the reliable hairdresser and the responsible voter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
