Weeks of preparation had led to this moment; the samples were ready, and the hypotheses I\u2019d crafted needed data to stand or fall. But as I set up the first run, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the advocacy meeting downtown. It was routine, but my presence was expected, my voice needed to support the community\u2019s case in court. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 disappointment if I missed the experiment, and I could picture the advocates\u2019 faces if I failed to show up, letting down those who counted on me. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach. I weighed the irreplaceable data against the cause I\u2019d sworn to champion, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart."}
