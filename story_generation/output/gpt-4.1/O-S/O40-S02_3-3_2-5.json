Today, I was supposed to inspect every tool before we started framing the new house\u2014protocol demanded it, and I knew how easily accidents happened when corners were cut. My crew depended on me to keep them safe, and I took that responsibility seriously. But as I reached for the checklist, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could gut environmental protections, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to use my voice and experience to sway the vote. My heart pounded as I looked from the phone to the tools, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left the inspection unfinished, I\u2019d be risking my crew\u2019s safety. If I ignored the call, I might lose the chance to make a difference on an issue I cared about deeply. The seconds ticked by, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
