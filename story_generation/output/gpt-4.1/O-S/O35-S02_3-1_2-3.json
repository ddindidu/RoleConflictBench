A red alert flashed on the console: brake system malfunction. My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report immediately and bring the train to a halt. Dozens of passengers depended on me for their safety and timely arrival. But my phone buzzed with a different urgency. The activist group I\u2019d poured my heart into was about to send a crucial petition to a lawmaker, a rare chance to push for the transit reforms I believed in. I had seconds to add my name, to stand with my fellow advocates. My duty to the passengers pressed on me, but so did the weight of my convictions. My finger hovered between the emergency brake and my phone, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of the uniform I wore and the cause I lived for."}
