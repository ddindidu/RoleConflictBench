The client wanted it delivered by the end of the week, and I needed to estimate the wood and hardware before the supplier closed for the day. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the court session I was due to attend in less than an hour. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late; my client\u2019s case hinged on my presence and preparation. Yet, if I didn\u2019t finalize the order now, the project would be delayed, disappointing another client who trusted my craftsmanship and reliability. My mind raced, torn between the precise measurements on the page and the legal arguments I\u2019d rehearsed all morning. Both roles demanded my full attention, both clients expected nothing less than my best. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I glanced between the ticking clock and the unfinished order form, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
