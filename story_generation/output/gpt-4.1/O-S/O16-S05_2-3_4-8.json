The diagnosis was new, overwhelming, and she looked to me for answers\u2014how to manage her condition, what to expect, how her life would change. I could see the fear in her eyes, the need for reassurance and clarity. As her doctor, I knew I owed her my time, my patience, and my empathy. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder that the court session for my advocacy case was about to begin. My presence there was non-negotiable; the outcome could hinge on my testimony. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my patient\u2019s hope for guidance, the legal team\u2019s expectation of punctuality. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the duty to comfort and the obligation to advocate."}
