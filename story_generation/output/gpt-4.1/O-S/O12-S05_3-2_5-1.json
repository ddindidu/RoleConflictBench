As a software developer, I was supposed to be in a meeting with architects from three different teams, hashing out the final details for a feature that needed to be ready two weeks earlier than planned. They were all waiting for my input, and the project manager\u2019s messages grew more urgent by the minute. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my client, whose case I was advocating for, had just sent a long email. Their situation had taken a complicated turn, and they needed a thorough, well-researched response before the end of the day. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: my team needed me to unblock their work, and my client depended on me for clear, accurate advice. My mind raced, torn between the technical decisions that couldn\u2019t wait and the legal guidance that couldn\u2019t be rushed. I sat frozen, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
