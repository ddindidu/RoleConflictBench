As a police officer, I scan the faces, watching for signs that the protest might tip into chaos. My radio crackles with updates\u2014tensions are rising, and I\u2019m expected to keep order, to be the calm in the storm. But my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks, the one person who might help push the bill I believe in over the finish line. I have ten minutes, maybe less, to make my case. My sergeant\u2019s voice comes through the radio, sharp and urgent, demanding my attention on the line. I feel the weight of my badge and the cause I fight for pressing against each other, both demanding everything from me at the same moment. My heart pounds as I stand between the crowd and the law, between duty and conviction, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
