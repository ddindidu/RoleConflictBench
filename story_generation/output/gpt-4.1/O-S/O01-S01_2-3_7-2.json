The contractor was late for our morning site meeting, and I knew every minute lost could throw the whole project off schedule. As the architect, it was my job to keep things running smoothly, to anticipate problems and keep everyone on track. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open the doors and start the breakfast service. I could picture their faces, the expectation in their eyes. But here, on the construction site, the team looked to me for answers, for leadership. If I left now, I\u2019d risk missing a crucial decision and delaying the project. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people who needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
