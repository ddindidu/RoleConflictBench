As a pharmacist, I knew I should take time to counsel her properly\u2014ask about her symptoms, allergies, and other medications. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator at the community clinic where I help out. The message was marked urgent: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, or the clinic risked being shut down. The coordinator\u2019s instructions were clear\u2014drop everything and help with compliance, no exceptions.\n\nI glanced at the woman, who waited expectantly, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My duty as a pharmacist was to ensure the patient\u2019s safety and understanding, but as a volunteer, I was expected to respond instantly to the coordinator\u2019s call. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my patient and the urgent needs of the clinic. I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment."}
