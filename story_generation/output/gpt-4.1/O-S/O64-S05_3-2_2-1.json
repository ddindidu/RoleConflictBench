As a cashier, I was responsible for closing out the register, counting every bill and coin, making sure the numbers matched to the cent. The manager expected nothing less\u2014one mistake, and the whole day\u2019s balance would be off. My hands moved quickly, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a message from a client. As their advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, thorough legal advice, and their case had just taken a complicated turn. They needed answers now, and I could sense their anxiety through the screen. I glanced at the growing line of customers, the register drawer open, the cash exposed. My heart pounded. If I paused to help my client, I risked making a costly error at the register. If I focused on the money, I\u2019d leave my client in the dark, possibly jeopardizing their case. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of accuracy and advocacy, unable to move."}
