The city\u2019s safety standards were strict, and I knew that even the smallest oversight could put lives at risk. My responsibility was clear: ensure every detail met compliance, no exceptions. But as an advocate, I was also the first point of contact for our clients, who often stopped by my office for quick, informal consultations. Today, one of them\u2014a hospital administrator\u2014asked for a casual rundown of our progress and any legal hurdles. She expected clarity and reassurance, not a lecture on technicalities or a list of potential setbacks.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I glossed over the unresolved safety concerns, I\u2019d be failing my duty as an architect. But if I shared every uncertainty, I risked alarming her unnecessarily, possibly jeopardizing the project\u2019s momentum. My roles pulled me in opposite directions: the architect in me demanded strict adherence to safety, while the advocate in me wanted to provide calm, confident guidance. My heart pounded as I weighed my words, caught between the need for transparency and the urge to protect my client\u2019s peace of mind."}
