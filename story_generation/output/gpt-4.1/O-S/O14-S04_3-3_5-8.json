My data is finally clean, my report nearly perfect, but I still need to upload the finalized datasets. As I\u2019m about to hit \u201csubmit,\u201d my phone buzzes: a reminder to vote. I rush to the polling station, only to be told there\u2019s a registration mismatch. The official hands me a provisional ballot form, explaining I must fill it out before the station closes in ten minutes. My mind races. As a scientist, I\u2019m bound to report my findings with precision and integrity, and the deadline is non-negotiable. As a voter, I have a civic duty to follow every instruction and ensure my vote counts. I feel the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, my hands trembling as I clutch the ballot form and my phone, torn between the demands of truth and democracy, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both perfectly in the time I have left."}
