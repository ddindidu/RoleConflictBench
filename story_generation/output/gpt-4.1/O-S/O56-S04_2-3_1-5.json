Her eyes darted around, uncertain, and I remembered how important it was to greet new clients warmly, to make them feel at ease. I started toward her, rehearsing my most welcoming smile, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder flashed: \u201cLast chance to vote\u2014bring your ID!\u201d My heart skipped. The polls would close in less than an hour, and I\u2019d left my ID in the glove compartment of my car, parked two blocks away. \n\nThe woman\u2019s anxious gaze met mine, silently pleading for reassurance. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice: \u201cFirst impressions matter. Don\u2019t keep clients waiting.\u201d But the weight of civic duty pressed on me, too\u2014if I missed this window, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be present and attentive for my client, and the urgent need to fulfill my responsibility as a voter. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
