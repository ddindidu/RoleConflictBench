As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep the house spotless, but lately, I\u2019d only had time for the basics\u2014tidying up the obvious messes, running a cloth over surfaces, and making sure the shared spaces looked presentable. Today, while I worked, one of the residents started chatting with me. It was friendly, nothing too deep, but as a volunteer, I knew I was supposed to respect their privacy and keep anything I heard confidential.\n\nBut as I picked up a stack of magazines, I noticed a note with a name and phone number on it, left out in the open. My cleaner\u2019s instinct told me to organize it, maybe even mention it to the resident so it wouldn\u2019t get lost. But the volunteer in me hesitated\u2014was it really my place to point it out, or should I pretend I hadn\u2019t seen it? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me: keep things tidy, but don\u2019t intrude. I stood there, cloth in hand, torn between what I should do next."}
