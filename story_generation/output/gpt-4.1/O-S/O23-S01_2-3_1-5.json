The deadline for filing was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch every loophole. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. I\u2019d promised to help sort files, and I knew how important it was to respect the privacy of the people whose medical histories I\u2019d be handling. As a lawyer, confidentiality was second nature, but the pressure to finish my legal review gnawed at me. If I brought the contract to the center to work on during breaks, I risked mixing sensitive information from both roles. But if I left the agreement at the office, I might not finish in time. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities, each demanding my full attention and absolute discretion. I stared at the clock, feeling the tension build, torn between the trust my client placed in me and the promise I\u2019d made to the people at the center."}
