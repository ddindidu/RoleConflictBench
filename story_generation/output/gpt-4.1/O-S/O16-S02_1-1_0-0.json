The patient in front of me sniffles, describing a sore throat and mild fever\u2014classic signs of a common cold. I listen carefully, knowing my responsibility is to diagnose with precision, to ensure nothing more serious is overlooked. Yet, my phone buzzes insistently in my pocket. A message flashes from a fellow activist: \u201cWe need more people at the protest\u2014police are here, and we\u2019re outnumbered. Can you come?\u201d I feel the weight of expectation pressing from both sides. As a doctor, I must give my patient my full attention, not rush, not miss a detail. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to stand in solidarity, to be present when it matters most. My mind races, torn between the quiet urgency of my patient\u2019s health and the loud call for justice echoing from the streets. I can\u2019t ignore either, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice, caught between the oath I took in the clinic and the cause I fight for outside its walls."}
