As the lead engineer, everyone looked to me for a realistic timeline. I knew I should focus, listen carefully, and give an estimate that would set the pace for the next few months. But my phone buzzed with a notification: the activist group I belonged to was about to send a crucial petition to a state lawmaker, and I had just minutes to add my name. My mind raced. If I missed this, I\u2019d let down the people counting on me to stand up for change. But if I got distracted now, I might miss a key detail and give a sloppy estimate, letting down my team. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my responsibility to my colleagues, and my commitment to the cause. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, as the conversation in the room and the urgency of the petition both demanded my attention."}
