My sales numbers were soaring this week\u2014management would be thrilled. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s praise, feel the relief of job security. But as I glanced out the window, the city shimmered under the heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. The news had warned everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, to make sure they had water and working fans. I felt the weight of civic duty settle on my shoulders. Should I step away from my desk, risk missing calls and losing momentum, to check on her? Or should I stay, keep dialing, and secure my place at the top of the sales board? My manager\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind, but so did the silent plea of a neighbor who might need help. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibilities of being a good citizen."}
