As a police officer, I knew how important it was to stay fit\u2014my duty to protect citizens depended on it. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d hit the gym today, just for an hour, to keep up my strength. But as I pulled into the parking lot, my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close at seven. I still hadn\u2019t voted, and the polling station was across town. \n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My community expected me to be vigilant, strong, and ready for anything, but as a citizen, I also had a responsibility to vote. If I skipped the gym, I\u2019d be letting down my commitment to my job. If I missed voting, I\u2019d be neglecting my civic duty. The minutes ticked by, and I stood in the locker room, torn between two roles that both demanded my time, both equally important, both impossible to ignore."}
