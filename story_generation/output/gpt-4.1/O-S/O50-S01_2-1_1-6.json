The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime\u2014find the fault, fast.\u201d I knelt, tools in hand, tracing wires and checking the sensor, my mind racing through possible causes. Thirty minutes had already slipped by, and the pressure to get the line running again was suffocating.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was the volunteer coordinator\u2019s email: a gentle reminder about reorganizing the supply shelves if I had a spare moment. I\u2019d promised to help after my shift, and her words\u2014\u201cIt would really help the team\u201d\u2014carried their own weight. I pictured the cluttered shelves, the other volunteers waiting for me to pitch in, and guilt gnawed at me.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions.
