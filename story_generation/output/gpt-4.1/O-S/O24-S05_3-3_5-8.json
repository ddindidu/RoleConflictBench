As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear, detailed order for the defendant\u2019s release\u2014every condition needed to be precise, every word scrutinized. The defendant\u2019s attorney was waiting, the jail was waiting, and the defendant\u2019s family was waiting. But my phone buzzed insistently: as an advocate, I was due in another courtroom across the hall, where my client\u2019s fate hung in the balance. The judge there would not tolerate tardiness, and my absence could tip the scales against my client. My hands hovered over the keyboard, mind racing. If I rushed the order, I risked ambiguity and legal error. If I left now, I\u2019d be late, possibly jeopardizing my client\u2019s case. Both roles demanded my full presence, my undivided attention, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the duty to justice and the duty to my client, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
