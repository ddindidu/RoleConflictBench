As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. Yet, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the live radio show starts in five minutes. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to speak passionately and clearly, to educate the public about our cause. My mind races. If I read now, I\u2019ll be late and unprepared for the show, letting down those who count on my voice. If I go on air, I\u2019ll miss the chance to absorb new legal theories that could shape my next decision in court. The weight of both robes\u2014judicial and activist\u2014presses on my shoulders. I glance at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the silent call of the journal and the urgent buzz of the radio studio."}
