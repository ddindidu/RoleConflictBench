She glared at her reflection, voice rising, demanding I fix the cut she hated. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, silently urging me to handle it with grace, to keep the salon\u2019s reputation intact. But in my pocket, my voter ID pressed against my leg\u2014a reminder that tonight was the last chance to cast my ballot. The polling station would close in less than half an hour, and if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my only opportunity to vote. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the duty to my client, to my job, to my sense of professionalism, against my responsibility as a citizen. I could see the disappointment in my client\u2019s eyes, but I could also imagine the regret I\u2019d feel if I missed my chance to have a say in the election. The minutes slipped away, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
