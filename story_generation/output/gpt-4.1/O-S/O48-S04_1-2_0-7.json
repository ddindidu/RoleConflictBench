My mind was already racing, knowing today was Election Day and I had to vote before my shift ended. As soon as I finished with Mrs. Lee, I rushed to the polling station, still in my scrubs, hoping to make it back before the next round of medication checks. At the polling booth, the worker handed back my ballot envelope, pointing out a smudge on my signature. \u201cCould you please re-sign this? Otherwise, your vote might not count,\u201d she said. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of my responsibilities tugging at me. If I took the time to fix the ballot, I\u2019d be late returning to the care home, and my patients depended on me for their morning care. But if I rushed back, my vote might not be counted. I stood there, pen in hand, torn between my duty to my patients and my responsibility as a voter, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
