The ambulance rumbled beneath me as I navigated city traffic, en route to the satellite station for the shift change. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always. No exceptions.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014no rushing, no shortcuts, even if the roads were clear. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the court session starting in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client depended on me to be there, to argue their case at a critical hearing. The judge had warned: any delay, and the case could be dismissed.
