It\u2019s a slow afternoon, just a few customers in line, but each expects me to be quick and precise. I catch myself double-checking the price of a can of beans, aware that even a small mistake could throw off the till. At the same time, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my client, desperate for advice as their case takes a complicated turn. They\u2019re counting on me to provide clear, accurate guidance, but I can\u2019t step away from the register. My manager expects flawless transactions, no distractions. My client expects immediate, thoughtful answers. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the beep of the scanner and the buzz of my phone, knowing that whichever role I choose to focus on, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
