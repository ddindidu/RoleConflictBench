A woman approached, holding a blender and looking flustered. \u201cI lost my receipt, but it\u2019s broken. Can I return it?\u201d she pleaded. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, but the woman\u2019s anxious eyes made me hesitate. I wanted to help, but I also had to follow procedures.\n\nLater that evening, I was excited to play music with friends in my apartment. We\u2019d planned this for weeks, but as I set up my speakers, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours had just started. My neighbor\u2019s windows were open, and I could hear her TV. As a citizen, I knew I should respect her right to peace and follow the building\u2019s rules. But my friends were already buzzing with anticipation.\n\nThe weight of these expectations pressed on me\u2014at work, I was supposed to be firm and impersonal; at home, considerate and law-abiding. I felt torn, caught between doing what was right for the store, for my neighbor, and for myself."}
