I\u2019m already ahead of my sales quota for the week, but management\u2019s emails keep reminding us: \u201cPush harder, every call counts.\u201d My fingers hover over the dial button, but my phone buzzes with a reminder. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be live on the radio, talking about environmental justice, the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. I promised my activist group I\u2019d use this platform to educate and inspire action. My manager expects me to keep dialing, to squeeze in one more sale before the end of my shift. My activist friends expect me to be present, passionate, and articulate. My stomach knots as I stare at the blinking cursor, torn between the pressure to perform at work and the responsibility to my cause. The seconds tick by, and I can feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
