As a telemarketer, I knew management watched our break logs like hawks, especially with the phone queue never letting up. If I left even a minute early, it would be flagged. But today, my volunteer shift at the community center started at 3:00 p.m. sharp. I\u2019d promised to help set up for the after-school program, and though I knew other volunteers could cover the first few minutes, I hated the idea of letting them down. My supervisor at the call center expected strict adherence to break times, no exceptions, while the volunteer coordinator counted on me to be reliable and punctual. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, feeling the pressure build in my chest. Should I risk management\u2019s disapproval by sneaking out early, or let my fellow volunteers handle things without me for a while? The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
