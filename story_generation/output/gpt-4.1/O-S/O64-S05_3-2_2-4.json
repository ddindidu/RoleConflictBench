My hands moved quickly, counting out bills for a high-value transaction, double-checking every note. The store manager expected nothing less than perfection\u2014one mistake, and the end-of-day balance would be off, raising questions I couldn\u2019t afford. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of my other life. My client\u2019s hearing was in fifteen minutes, and I was supposed to be there, ready to argue their case. They were counting on me to be their voice, to catch every detail and fight for their rights. My mind raced, torn between the register and the courtroom.
