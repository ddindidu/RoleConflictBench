As an architect, I was expected to keep everything running smoothly, but I\u2019d always managed by checking in casually, trusting my team to keep things moving. Today, though, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was voting day. I needed to bring valid identification, but I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I could use a spare card, but it was in my car, parked blocks away. I told myself I could fetch it later, but the project review was in an hour, and my team was waiting for my feedback. The expectation to manage the project efficiently pressed on me, but so did the civic duty to vote, with all the rules about proper identification. I felt the tension rising, torn between the easygoing approach I took with my work and the strict requirements of voting. My mind raced, weighing the importance of each role, feeling the stress of being pulled in two directions at once."}
