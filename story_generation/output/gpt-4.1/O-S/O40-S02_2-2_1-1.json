As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping the site spotless\u2014one stray nail could mean a trip to the hospital. My boss had just reminded me this morning: \u201cSafety first, always. No shortcuts.\u201d But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The protest was about to start, and as one of the lead activists, I was expected at the front, megaphone in hand, to kick off the march. People were counting on me to set the tone, to show up and speak out. My heart pounded as I glanced between the mess at my feet and the message on my phone.
