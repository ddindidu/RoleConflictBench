As a judge, I knew the expectation: every detail must be reviewed, every argument weighed with care. The case was complex, and the parties deserved my full attention. Yet, as I reached for another file, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the city\u2019s survey on bus routes. As a citizen, I believed in participating, giving feedback, helping shape the community I lived in. The survey was open only through next week, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d contribute. But the trial loomed, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I paused to complete the survey, would I shortchange my duty as a judge? If I ignored it, was I neglecting my responsibility as a citizen? My mind churned with the tension, torn between the demands of justice and the call of civic engagement, uncertain which obligation should come first."}
