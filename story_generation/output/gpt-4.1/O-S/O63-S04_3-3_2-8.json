My script told me to stay calm, answer every question, and never let a customer feel dismissed. I could hear the frustration in his tone, and I knew I had to handle this carefully\u2014my supervisor was always listening for how we managed objections. But as I tried to explain the offer\u2019s legitimacy, my eyes darted to the clock on the wall. I was at the polling station, squeezed into a corner, headset on, waiting for my turn to vote. An election official called my name, explaining that my registration didn\u2019t match and I\u2019d need to fill out a provisional ballot form\u2014immediately, before the station closed in ten minutes. My heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t hang up on Mr. Jenkins, not without risking my job, but if I didn\u2019t follow the official\u2019s instructions, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. Torn between the demands of my job and my civic duty, I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing for a way to satisfy both worlds."}
