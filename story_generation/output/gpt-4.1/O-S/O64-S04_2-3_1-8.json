My manager expects me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, especially now, during the after-work rush. I glance at the clock\u2014almost closing time at the polling station. I\u2019d planned to vote on my break, but the rush never let up. My phone buzzes: a reminder about the election. I finally dash over, only to be told by the official that my registration doesn\u2019t match. If I want my vote to count, I have to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station closes in ten minutes. The official\u2019s voice is firm: I must follow every step, no shortcuts. My mind races\u2014if I stay, the line at work will get even longer, and my manager will be furious. If I leave, I might lose my chance to vote. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
