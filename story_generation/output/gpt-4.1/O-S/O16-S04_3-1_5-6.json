As their doctor, I owed them honesty and compassion, but I knew the news would devastate them. My pager buzzed, reminding me of my civic duty\u2014I had just enough time to vote before my next shift. At the polling station, the official announced, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name began with B. The new line was longer and slower, but the rules were clear. I glanced at my watch, anxiety rising. If I waited, I\u2019d be late to the hospital, and Mrs. Patel\u2019s family would be left in limbo, dreading the unknown. But if I cut the line or ignored the official\u2019s instructions, I\u2019d be disrespecting the process and the other voters. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my patient against my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
