My inbox pings with a reminder: the new safety standard documentation for our project is due by midnight, and I\u2019m the lead engineer responsible for ensuring every line of code and every test result is accounted for. The updated regulations are strict, and any oversight could mean a costly delay or, worse, a safety risk. My team is counting on me to double-check everything before the final submission.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with another reminder: the polling place down the street closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure up for vote that will directly impact my neighborhood\u2014zoning changes that could bring new development or disrupt our community. As a citizen, I believe in participating, in making my voice heard, in shaping the place I call home.\n\nMy mind races. If I leave now, I\u2019ll lose precious time on the compliance review. If I stay, I might miss my chance to vote. Both roles demand my attention, both feel urgent, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety of letting someone down\u2014my team, my neighbors, or myself."}
