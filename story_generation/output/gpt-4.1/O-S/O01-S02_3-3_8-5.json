The project was already behind schedule, and the client was breathing down my neck, expecting me to resolve the latest dispute between the electrical and plumbing teams. I could feel the weight of their expectations\u2014every minute counted, and I was the one holding it all together. \n\nThen, my activist group\u2019s alert flashed on my screen: the state legislature was holding a surprise, tie-breaking vote on the environmental bill we\u2019d fought for all year. The only undecided representative was taking calls for the next hour. If I didn\u2019t reach out now, we could lose everything we\u2019d worked for.
