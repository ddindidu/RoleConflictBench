As a cashier, I\u2019m supposed to be the calm in the storm, smiling and patient, even as the woman in front of me complains about the price of wrapping paper. I nod, apologize, and try to soothe her, but my mind keeps drifting to the polling place three blocks away. The ballot measure on street repairs\u2014one that could finally fix the potholes on my block\u2014closes in less than two hours. As a citizen, I know I should be there, casting my vote, making my voice heard. But the store is short-staffed, and my manager is counting on me to keep the line moving and the customers happy. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I want to do right by my community and my job, but I can\u2019t see how to do both."}
