My foreman\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the sweep-up, and make sure everything\u2019s spotless. Safety first!\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was ending, but I was already late for my volunteer work at the community clinic. There, I was trusted to sort confidential medical files, a task that demanded my full attention and absolute discretion. As I rushed to finish sweeping, my phone buzzed: a reminder from the clinic coordinator about the importance of privacy and punctuality. My mind raced. If I left the site untidy, I\u2019d be letting my crew down and risking someone\u2019s safety. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the clinic, possibly leaving sensitive files unattended or rushed through, risking a breach of trust. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my loyalty, each unforgiving of neglect. I stood frozen, broom in hand, torn between the safety of my coworkers and the privacy of those I\u2019d promised to protect."}
