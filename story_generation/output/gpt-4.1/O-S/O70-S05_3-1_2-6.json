The medical supply box on the seat beside me was marked \u201cUrgent\u2014Hospital Delivery.\u201d I knew the hospital depended on these supplies for patient care, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never be the reason someone didn\u2019t get what they needed. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the advocacy meeting I was supposed to attend in fifteen minutes. My colleagues counted on me to be there, to speak up for our clients, to show that I was reliable and committed. I could picture the empty chair at the table, the disappointed looks if I didn\u2019t show up. The hospital was ten minutes away, but traffic was unpredictable, and the meeting was in the opposite direction. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urgent delivery and my responsibility as an advocate. Both roles demanded my presence, both were important, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
