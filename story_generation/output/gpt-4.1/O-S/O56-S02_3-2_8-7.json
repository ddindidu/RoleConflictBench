My heart pounds. The client in my chair, Mrs. Lee, has thick, curly hair matted with weeks of product. She\u2019s here for a fresh cut, but I can\u2019t even get a comb through the tangles. I know I\u2019m expected to wash and condition her hair thoroughly, to treat her scalp with care, to make her feel pampered and respected. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cLive radio interview in 5 minutes\u2014don\u2019t forget to share the petition link!\u201d As an activist, I\u2019ve promised my team I\u2019ll use this opportunity to educate listeners, to speak up for our cause. I can\u2019t let them down. But Mrs. Lee is watching me in the mirror, trusting me to do my job. My hands tremble as I reach for the shampoo, torn between the client in front of me and the community counting on my voice. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I can give at once."}
