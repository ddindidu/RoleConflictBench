She explains she lost her receipt but needs to return it\u2014the blender broke after just a week. Store policy is clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expects me to enforce this, no exceptions. I see her frustration, and I want to help, but I know I could get in trouble for bending the rules. \n\nAt the same time, my mind drifts to my other responsibilities. I\u2019ve been carefully organizing my tax documents, determined to file early and do my part as a responsible citizen. I also saw the flyer for the free vaccine clinic this weekend. I want to volunteer, to help my neighbors stay healthy, but I\u2019m scheduled for a long shift at the store. \n\nI feel pulled in different directions\u2014by the rules I\u2019m supposed to uphold at work, and by my desire to support my community and do what\u2019s right. The woman\u2019s hopeful eyes meet mine, and I hesitate, caught between the expectations of my job and my sense of duty as a citizen."}
