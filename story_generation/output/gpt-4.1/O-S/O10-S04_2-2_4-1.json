The quarterly tax filing deadline looms, and my desk is buried in spreadsheets and receipts. As the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m expected to ensure every number is accurate, every form compliant with tax laws. My boss has made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. But today is also election day. As a voter, I feel a civic duty to show up at the polling station before it closes. I\u2019d planned to leave early, but a last-minute discrepancy in the accounts has kept me glued to my chair. Now, with only a couple of hours left before the polls close, I\u2019m torn. If I rush the tax filing, I risk errors and possible penalties for the company. If I stay to finish the work, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety of letting someone down\u2014my employer, or my own sense of civic duty."}
