The deadline for closing the books is tonight, and I still have two accounts to reconcile. As an accountant, accuracy is everything\u2014one mistake, and the whole report could be off. But here I am, standing in a long line at the polling station, laptop in my bag, spreadsheets swirling in my mind. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with B. The new line is longer, barely moving, but the official\u2019s voice is firm. I know I\u2019m supposed to follow instructions, but every minute here is a minute lost from my work. My boss expects the books to be perfect and on time. The election officials expect me to comply without question. I feel torn, my sense of duty to my job clashing with my responsibility as a voter. My heart pounds as I weigh the pressure of both roles, caught between the rules of the polling place and the ticking clock of my professional life."}
