The route closure had thrown everything into chaos, and my headset buzzed with pilots\u2019 anxious voices. As an air traffic controller, I was expected to keep the skies safe, to untangle this mess and prevent disaster. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, reminding me of the stakes: \u201cWe need you focused. No mistakes.\u201d But my phone vibrated on the desk, flashing a reminder: the radio show. In five minutes, I was supposed to be live, educating the public about our cause, a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago as an activist. The community was counting on me to speak up, to make our voices heard. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the urgent demands of the airspace and the promise I\u2019d made to my fellow activists.
