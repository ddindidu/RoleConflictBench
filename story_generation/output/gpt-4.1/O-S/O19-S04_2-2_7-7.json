I was determined to apply them, knowing how much my patients relied on me for accurate advice. But today was also Election Day, and I hurried to the polling station, wanting to fulfill my civic duty. As I sealed my ballot envelope, the poll worker noticed a smudge and asked me to re-sign it. I hesitated. The workshop had drilled into me the importance of signatures on medical documents\u2014how even a small discrepancy could cause legal trouble or invalidate a prescription. Now, as a voter, I was being told to sign again, but I worried: would two signatures on the envelope cause my ballot to be rejected? The poll worker insisted it was standard procedure, but my pharmacist\u2019s training screamed caution. I felt torn, caught between my professional instinct to avoid signature errors and my responsibility to follow the poll worker\u2019s instructions. My heart pounded as I stared at the envelope, unsure which role\u2019s expectations I should honor."}
