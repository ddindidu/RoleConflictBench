They need a ruling within the hour.\u201d I nodded, already feeling the familiar pressure. As a judge, I knew the expectation: review every detail, analyze every argument, and ensure justice is served. I opened the file, scanning the first page, but my phone buzzed with a new email. It was from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter, where I spent my lunch breaks. \u201cIf you have time today, could you try organizing the supply closet differently? It might help us find things faster.\u201d I glanced at the clock. I\u2019d promised to help after court, but now, with this urgent case, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d have a spare minute. My mind raced between the desperate plea in the motion and the simple, hopeful request from the shelter. Both roles mattered to me, but their demands were pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the file, heart pounding, torn between the law\u2019s urgency and the quiet needs of the shelter."}
