As a lifeguard, my duty was clear: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and intervene immediately if someone was in danger. My heart pounded as I prepared to act, but my mind raced with another worry. This weekend, the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic, and I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d take them. As a responsible citizen, I felt obligated to support public health efforts, especially after organizing our tax documents early to do my part. Now, with the child\u2019s safety at stake and my civic responsibilities looming, I felt torn. Should I focus solely on my lifeguard duties, or could I somehow balance both roles? The weight of these expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the urgent demands of my job and my commitment to my community."}
