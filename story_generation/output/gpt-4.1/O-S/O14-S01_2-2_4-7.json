As a scientist, I knew the importance of presenting my findings accurately, even if the results were still preliminary. My supervisor expected a clear, honest report, and I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my shoulders. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from the community center\u2014tonight was my volunteer shift. The coordinator had emphasized the new safety steps at our last briefing, insisting we all follow them to the letter. I remembered her stern look, the way she said, \u201cNo exceptions.\u201d \n\nI glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the center on time, but my summary would remain unfinished. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my shift and risk letting down the team, maybe even putting someone at risk if I missed the safety protocol review. My mind raced, torn between my duty to scientific integrity and my commitment to the people who relied on me as a volunteer. The expectations from both sides felt like a vise, tightening with every passing minute."}
