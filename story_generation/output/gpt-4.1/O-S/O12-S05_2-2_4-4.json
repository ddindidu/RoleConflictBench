As a software developer, I knew the other teams were waiting for my technical input\u2014without it, the new feature couldn\u2019t move forward, and the deadline was looming. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the client\u2019s hearing was in two hours. As their advocate, I needed to review the case files again, prepare my arguments, and ensure I represented them with the diligence they deserved. My inbox pinged with another message from the product manager, asking for an update. At the same time, my client\u2019s anxious email sat unread, the subject line pleading for reassurance. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the duty to my client. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both carried consequences if I failed. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
