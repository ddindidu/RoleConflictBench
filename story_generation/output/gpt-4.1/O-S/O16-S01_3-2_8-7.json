A patient had just been rushed in, feverish and shaking, the infection spreading so quickly that every second mattered. As a doctor, I knew exactly what to do: prescribe the strongest antibiotic, start the IV, and act fast. But as a volunteer, I\u2019d just been briefed on new safety protocols\u2014no medication could be administered without double-checking the new checklist, even in emergencies. The volunteer coordinator had been clear: no exceptions, not even for doctors. My mind raced. The patient\u2019s life depended on immediate action, but the new rules demanded a pause, a careful review. I could feel the eyes of the nurses and other volunteers on me, waiting for my lead. My hands hovered over the medication tray, torn between my oath to heal and my promise to follow the guidelines. The seconds ticked by, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
