There\u2019s a minor delay up ahead\u2014nothing dangerous, but it means I have to adjust my speed, keep the ride smooth, and still try to make up lost time. The passengers trust me to get them where they need to go, safely and on schedule. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I know without looking that it\u2019s from the group chat. A fellow activist is live-streaming from a demonstration just a few stops away, asking for more people to join. I feel the familiar tug in my chest\u2014the cause is urgent, and my friends are counting on me to show up, to stand with them. But right now, I\u2019m responsible for hundreds of lives, and every decision I make in this cab matters. The train hums beneath me, the city rushing past, and I\u2019m caught between the weight of my uniform and the call of the street, heart pounding as I wrestle with what I owe to each."}
