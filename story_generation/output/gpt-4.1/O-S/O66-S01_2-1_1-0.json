The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, but I also knew my volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there promptly, and I hated letting the team down, even if others could cover for a while. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. Should I speed up, risking a ticket or accident, just to get him there faster? Or do I stick to the rules, knowing he might miss his train and I\u2019ll still be late for my shift? The pressure built in my chest, my mind racing with the demands of both roles, each pulling me in a different direction."}
