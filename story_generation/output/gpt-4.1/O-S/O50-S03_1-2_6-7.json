As a machine repairer, I knew it was my job to guide her, to make sure she felt confident and safe using the equipment. I started explaining, but my mind kept drifting to the heat advisory blaring on the news. Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. The city had urged everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, to make sure they had water and a cool place to stay. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a citizen pressing against the professional obligation to my client. My words to her became automatic, my thoughts split between the manual\u2019s instructions and the image of Mrs. Lee possibly struggling in the sweltering heat. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the person on the line needing my expertise and the neighbor who might need my help even more."}
