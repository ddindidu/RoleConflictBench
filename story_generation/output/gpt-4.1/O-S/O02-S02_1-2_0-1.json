As an engineer, I was expected to contribute ideas for the new project, even though we were still in the early stages. My manager had just asked me to stay for an impromptu brainstorming session\u2014he wanted fresh perspectives, and I knew my input could shape the direction we\u2019d take. But my phone buzzed with urgent messages from my activist group. The main protest march was about to begin, and I was supposed to be at the front, leading the first chant, setting the tone for the demonstration. My friends were counting on me to help raise awareness for a cause I deeply believed in. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my team at work expecting technical leadership, my fellow activists needing my voice. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between two parts of myself, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
