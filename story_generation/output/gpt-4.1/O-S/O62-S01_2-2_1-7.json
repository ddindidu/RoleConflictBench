Every muscle in my body was tense, ready to spring into action if needed. The volunteer coordinator\u2019s words from the morning briefing echoed in my mind: \u201cRemember, everyone, the new safety steps must be followed at all times. No exceptions.\u201d I was supposed to check the chemical levels every hour and log them immediately, a new rule after last week\u2019s incident. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014time to do the check.\n\nBut just then, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, flailing awkwardly, their strokes growing weaker. My training as a lifeguard screamed at me to keep my eyes glued to the water, to never look away, not even for a second. Yet, the expectation as a volunteer pressed on me to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions to the letter.
