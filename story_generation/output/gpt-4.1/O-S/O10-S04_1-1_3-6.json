As an accountant, I felt the weight of responsibility to stay ahead of every regulation, every change that could affect my clients. The seminar had been clear: upcoming tax law changes were likely, and I needed to be prepared. But now, as a voter, I was just another citizen in line, waiting to cast my ballot.\n\nSuddenly, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line was longer, and the original line was moving quickly. I hesitated. The official\u2019s instructions were clear, and as a voter, I was expected to comply without question. But the accountant in me, trained to analyze and optimize, balked at the inefficiency. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach\u2014should I follow the rules, or trust my judgment and stay put? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I found myself frozen, caught between compliance and practicality, unable to move forward."}
