Every bill, every receipt, had to be perfect\u2014one mistake could mean a huge loss for the store, and I knew my manager was counting on me to get it right. My hands moved quickly but carefully, double-checking each entry, feeling the pressure mount as the clock ticked closer to closing time.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was urgent: a new directive had come down, and every volunteer had to follow the updated procedures immediately, or the service we provided would be shut down for the day. I was supposed to be there in fifteen minutes, ready to help and strictly adhere to the new guidelines. The coordinator\u2019s expectations were clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays.\n\nMy mind raced. I couldn\u2019t leave the register until every transaction was accounted for, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the coordinator\u2019s instructions. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of accuracy and duty, unable to see how I could possibly meet both expectations."}
