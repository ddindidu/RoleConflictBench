As the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep the apartment spotless, but with my busy schedule, I often only managed to tidy up the visible mess and do a quick sweep of the shared spaces. Tonight, though, my mind was elsewhere. My friends and I had planned a late-evening music session in my living room\u2014a rare chance to unwind. But as I set up the speakers, I noticed my neighbor\u2019s windows were wide open, and the building\u2019s quiet hours had just begun. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the rules and my neighbors\u2019 right to peace. Yet, I felt torn. I wanted to enjoy my evening, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the reason someone\u2019s rest was disturbed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood there, music in hand, caught between what I wanted and what I knew was right."}
