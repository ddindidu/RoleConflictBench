Their anxious chatter filled the air, and I could see the tension in the bride\u2019s clenched hands. As a hairdresser, I knew my job was to greet them warmly, offer reassurance, and create a calm oasis before the whirlwind of her big day. I smiled, ushering them to their seats, promising everything would run smoothly. But as I reached for my comb, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the court session I was due to attend in less than an hour. As an advocate, my presence at this high-stakes proceeding was non-negotiable; the outcome of the case could hinge on my arguments. My heart pounded as I glanced between the expectant faces in my salon and the relentless ticking of the clock. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I could only be in one place. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between duty and responsibility, unable to move forward."}
