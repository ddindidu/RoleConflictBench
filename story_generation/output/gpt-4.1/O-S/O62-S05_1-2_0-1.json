My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder that every second, every glance, mattered. A few swimmers drifted toward the deep end, not in danger yet, but I knew how quickly things could change. My phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014my client, desperate for legal advice. Their case had grown tangled, and they needed clarity, now more than ever. I could almost hear their anxious voice, waiting for guidance only I could provide. But my duty here was just as urgent; I was responsible for every life in the water. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to never let my guard down and the obligation to be present and thorough for my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the armrest, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that refused to let go."}
