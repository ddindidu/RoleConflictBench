She\u2019d just had surgery, and her movements were slow and painful. As I gently helped her sit up, she winced, and I reminded myself to be patient, to move at her pace. My mind kept drifting to the election\u2014today was voting day, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it. I\u2019d even set my ID aside last night, but in my rush this morning, I realized I\u2019d left it at home. I could fetch it later, but that meant leaving the ward during my break, maybe even cutting my lunch short. The thought made my stomach twist. My supervisor expected me to be present and attentive, especially with patients like Mrs. Carter. But I also felt the weight of my civic duty, the expectation that I\u2019d show up and make my voice heard. As I helped Mrs. Carter into her robe, I felt torn\u2014between the needs of my patient and the responsibility I owed to my community. The clock ticked on, and I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing I\u2019d have to choose soon."}
