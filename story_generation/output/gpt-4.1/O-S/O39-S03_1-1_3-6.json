As a construction laborer, I\u2019m expected to sweep up my area, making sure it\u2019s safe and clean for the next crew. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts\u2014leave it spotless.\u201d I glance at the clock. It\u2019s late, and I promised myself I\u2019d get my tax documents sorted tonight, just like a responsible citizen should.
