The mandatory pre-shift briefing on the new operational procedures is about to start, and as a subway operator, I know I can\u2019t miss it. Management has been clear: attendance is non-negotiable, and these updates are crucial for passenger safety. But my mind keeps drifting to the envelope of tax documents I\u2019ve organized at home. As a citizen, I pride myself on being responsible\u2014filing early, following every guideline, doing my part. And this weekend, the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic. I\u2019ve been meaning to volunteer, to help neighbors who can\u2019t get there on their own. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. My job demands my full attention and presence, but my sense of civic duty tugs at me, reminding me that being a good citizen means more than just showing up for work. I stand in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both worlds swirling inside me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
