One delivery, a bag of groceries, was marked \u201curgent\u201d\u2014the customer had called twice, desperate to have everything before dinner. I could picture them waiting, maybe with kids, counting on me to be on time. But as I scanned the list, my eyes caught the sticky note I\u2019d left for myself: \u201cVote today\u2014polls close at 7.\u201d The polling place was just a few blocks away, and the ballot measure could change parking rules on my street.
