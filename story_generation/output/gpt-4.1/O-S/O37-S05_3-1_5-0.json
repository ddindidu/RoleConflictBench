My client expected everything spotless, and I was responsible for managing supplies, but I hadn\u2019t noticed we were running low. As I stood in the supply closet, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from another client, asking for a quick explanation about their legal situation. As an advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate advice, not just general explanations, but I was in the middle of my cleaning duties. My mind raced: should I drop everything to research and give the client the detailed legal advice they deserved, or focus on finding a solution for the missing cleaning product? Both clients expected me to be fully present and competent in my roles, but I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of their expectations pressing down on me."}
