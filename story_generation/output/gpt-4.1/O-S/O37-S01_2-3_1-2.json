The dust had been piling up all week, and I knew the supervisor expected every corner to shine. I could already hear her voice in my head, reminding me that a spotless house was the mark of a good cleaner. But as I wiped down the last counter, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and people would already be waiting outside, hoping to get in on time. My heart pounded. If I left now, the house wouldn\u2019t be as clean as it should be, and I\u2019d risk disappointing my boss. But if I stayed to finish, I\u2019d be late opening the center, letting down the people counting on me. I stood frozen, mop in hand, torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to the community."}
