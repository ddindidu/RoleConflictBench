No one answered the door, so I snapped a photo for proof and set it gently on the mat, glancing at my phone. A flurry of messages from my activist group popped up: \u201cPolice are blocking exits! We need to coordinate\u2014now!\u201d My heart pounded. As a delivery person, I was expected to secure every package, confirm delivery, and move on to the next stop. But as an activist, I was responsible for the safety of my friends, for helping them stay calm and organized in the face of sudden danger. I could picture the crowd, the tension, the fear. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between calling the customer to ensure their package was safe and jumping into the group chat to help guide people out. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each urgent in its own way. I stood frozen on the porch, caught between duty and conviction, the world waiting for me to choose."}
