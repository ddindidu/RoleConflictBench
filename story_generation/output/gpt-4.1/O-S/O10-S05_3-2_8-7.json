The message was blunt: no payment, no more shipments. As the accountant, it was my job to respond, to negotiate, to keep the business running smoothly. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014court in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I couldn\u2019t be late; my client\u2019s case depended on my presence and preparation. My boss expected me to resolve the supplier crisis immediately, but the courthouse was across town, and traffic would be brutal. I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing through possible solutions. Should I call the supplier now and risk being late to court, or leave the financial crisis hanging and focus on my client\u2019s legal battle? Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, pulling me in two directions at once."}
