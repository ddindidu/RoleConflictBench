As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to help them load up, make them comfortable, and get them to their destination efficiently. They smiled gratefully, explaining they\u2019d split the fare, and I nodded, already calculating the best route in my head. But as I reached for the first bag, my phone buzzed\u2014a notification from the activist group I\u2019d joined. The petition to the lawmaker was about to close, and this was my last chance to add my name, to stand up for the policy changes I\u2019d spent months advocating for. My passengers were waiting, expecting prompt, professional service. At the same time, my fellow activists were counting on me to be part of the collective voice. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the immediate needs of my job and the long-term goals of my activism. My hand hovered over my phone, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which role to honor in this moment."}
