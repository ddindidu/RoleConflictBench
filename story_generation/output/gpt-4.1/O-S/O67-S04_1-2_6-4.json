My shift is ending, and I\u2019m supposed to move the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackles with routine updates, but my mind is elsewhere. Today is the only morning I can swing by my apartment to grab my ID\u2014without it, I can\u2019t vote tomorrow. The polls are open another day, but my schedule is packed, and I know I won\u2019t have another chance. \n\nAs an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to follow protocol, keep the vehicle safe, and be punctual for the shift change. But as a citizen, I\u2019m expected to vote, to do my part. The station is in the opposite direction from my apartment. If I detour, I\u2019ll be late, and the next crew will be waiting. If I don\u2019t, I might lose my chance to vote. My hands tighten on the wheel, heart pounding as I weigh the responsibility of my job against my duty as a voter, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in different directions."}
