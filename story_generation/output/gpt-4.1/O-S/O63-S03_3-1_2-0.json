The man on the other end was furious, his voice sharp as he accused our company of misleading offers. As a telemarketer, I was trained to stay calm, answer every question, and never let a customer feel dismissed. My script urged me to reassure him, to explain the offer\u2019s legitimacy, to keep him on the line. But his anger grew, and I felt the pressure to defend the company, even as doubts crept in about the fairness of the deal.\n\nLater, I tried to clear my head with a walk in the park. The sun was warm, and I sipped a soda, lost in thought. As I finished, I noticed the trash bin a few steps away, but I was tired, and the urge to just leave the can on the bench was strong. The no-littering signs glared at me, reminding me of my duty as a citizen to respect public spaces. I stood there, can in hand, torn between the easy way out and the responsibility I owed to others, the same way I\u2019d felt torn between my job and my conscience just hours before."}
