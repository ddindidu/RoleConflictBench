But as I waited for the next customer to pick up, my phone buzzed with a notification from the activist group I\u2019d joined. The petition to ban single-use plastics was about to be sent to the state senator, and they needed just one more signature\u2014mine could make a difference. I stared at the screen, torn. Management expected relentless focus on sales, no distractions, especially today. But my activist friends counted on me to stand up for what I believed in, to be present when it mattered most.
