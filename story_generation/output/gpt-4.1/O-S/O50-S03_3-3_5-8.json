As the machine repairer, I knew what was at stake\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours of production and risking my reputation. I grabbed my tools, heart pounding, already mapping out the steps to get the machine back online. But then the building alarms blared, echoing off the metal walls. The emergency lights flashed red, and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. Through the window, I saw water creeping up the street, neighbors scrambling to move cars and sandbag doors. As a citizen, I was expected to help, to look out for my community, to follow safety protocols and maybe even evacuate. But the machine\u2019s wail was urgent, and so was the rising water. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my job and my duty to my neighbors, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
