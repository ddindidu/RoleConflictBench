She smiled, but then hesitated, \u201cCould you just trim a little more here?\u201d Her tone was gentle, and I knew she trusted me to get it right. I wanted her to leave happy, as always. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the minor hearing I was due to attend as an advocate in less than half an hour. The case wasn\u2019t high stakes, but my client was counting on me to represent them, to show up prepared and focused. I felt the pressure mounting: the expectation to be present and attentive for my hairdressing client, and the responsibility to advocate effectively in court. My hands trembled slightly as I weighed the minutes, torn between perfecting a fringe and preparing my legal notes. Both clients deserved my best, but I couldn\u2019t give both at the same time. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
