My volunteer shift at the shelter started in twenty minutes, and I prided myself on always being punctual. But just as I was about to leave, an assistant from my law firm stopped by my office, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files. She said it would save her hours of work if I could quickly grant her access before I left. I knew she wasn\u2019t familiar with the case, and the rules about client confidentiality were strict\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. Yet, her request seemed so simple, and she looked genuinely overwhelmed. If I took the time to explain the protocols and ensure everything was handled properly, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift. I knew the shelter could manage without me for a while, but I hated letting them down. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to my client\u2019s trust and my commitment to the people who counted on me at the shelter. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my profession and my promise as a volunteer, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
