As a telemarketer, I was supposed to handle customer objections smoothly, but today, every prospect seemed to have technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script only half-answered. My supervisor expected me to keep the calls moving, but I could hear the frustration in the customers\u2019 voices when I couldn\u2019t give them the details they wanted. My phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive. The community service I volunteered for was at risk of being shut down unless we followed new, strict procedures immediately. I was supposed to review the guidelines and help implement them right away. My mind raced. I wanted to help the customers on the phone, but I also knew the volunteer service depended on me. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the script in front of me and the urgent instructions on my phone."}
