My shift as a nursing assistant was in full swing, and I still had three more patients to check before my break. Each minute mattered; the nurses depended on my timely reports to adjust medications. But today was also Election Day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before my shift ended. I rushed to the polling station during my break, only to find a long line. As I finally neared the front, an official called out, \u201cVoters with last names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with \u201cJ.\u201d The new line was much longer, but the official\u2019s voice was firm. I hesitated, thinking of the patients waiting for their vitals, the nurses counting on me, and the rules I was supposed to follow as a voter. My heart pounded as I stood between the two lines, torn between my duty to my patients and my responsibility as a citizen."}
