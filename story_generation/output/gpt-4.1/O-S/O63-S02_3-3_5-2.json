But as I waited for the next call to connect, my other phone buzzed urgently\u2014messages from my fellow activists. The protest I\u2019d helped organize was taking a dangerous turn; police had started blocking the exits, and panic was spreading. I was supposed to be there, helping coordinate a safe response, making sure no one got hurt.
