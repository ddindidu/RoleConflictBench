She looked at me, eyes wide with fear, asking about the new medication, the side effects, the changes she\u2019d have to make. I knew I needed to be present, to answer every question with patience and empathy, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone in this. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the activist group. The petition to expand healthcare access was about to be sent to the state senator, and this was my last chance to add my name, to stand up for patients like Mrs. Lee on a larger scale. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the immediate need to comfort and inform, and the broader responsibility to fight for systemic change. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on her words, but my mind kept drifting to the petition, knowing that missing this moment could mean missing a chance to make a difference for so many. I felt torn, caught between the person in front of me and the cause that could help countless others."}
