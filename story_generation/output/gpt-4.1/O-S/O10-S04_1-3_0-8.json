The deadline for filing was tonight, and I knew every number had to be perfect\u2014my job depended on it. Just as I was about to finalize the last spreadsheet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was election day. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, no matter how busy work got. \n\nI rushed to the polling station, only to be told by an official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closed\u2014in just ten minutes. My mind raced. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk missing the filing deadline and jeopardizing my professional integrity. If I left, I\u2019d forfeit my right to vote, something I believed in deeply. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between duty to my profession and duty to my democracy."}
