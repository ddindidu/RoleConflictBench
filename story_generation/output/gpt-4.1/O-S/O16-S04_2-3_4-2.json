The polling station closes in ten minutes, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote today. But in front of me sits Mrs. Patel, her eyes wide and anxious, clutching the pamphlet I just handed her. She\u2019s just learned she has diabetes, and her questions tumble out\u2014about food, medication, what this means for her future. I know my duty as her doctor is to listen, to explain, to reassure her and her daughter who sits beside her, equally worried. Yet, the minutes slip away. If I leave now, I can just make it to the polling station, fulfill my responsibility as a citizen. But if I rush, I\u2019ll leave Mrs. Patel confused and scared, failing her when she needs me most. My mind races, torn between the promise I made to myself and the oath I made to my patients. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I feel paralyzed, caught between two worlds that both demand all of me."}
