A passenger had collapsed in the third car, and protocol demanded I stay calm, alert emergency services, and provide assistance if needed. My heart pounded as I prepared to leave the operator\u2019s cabin, but just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I had only minutes left to cast my vote at the nearby polling station. I rushed over during my break, determined to fulfill my civic duty.\n\nInside the polling station, I hurriedly filled out my ballot, but as I sealed the envelope, a poll worker noticed the signature was smudged. \u201cPlease re-sign, or your vote might not count,\u201d she said gently. I glanced at the clock, torn. My radio crackled with updates about the medical emergency on my train, and I knew my presence was needed. Yet, the poll worker\u2019s eyes were insistent, reminding me of the importance of following every instruction to ensure my vote was valid. I stood frozen, caught between the urgent needs of my passengers and my responsibility as a voter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
