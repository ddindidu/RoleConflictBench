As a construction laborer, I knew safety was everything. My supervisor always said, \u201cKeep your eyes open, keep your crew safe.\u201d Just as I was about to leave for my volunteer shift at the community kitchen, I spotted Joe, headphones in, about to walk under a massive load dangling from the crane. My heart pounded. I had to shout, to warn him\u2014no question. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder that my volunteer shift started in ten minutes across town. They counted on me to be on time, to set an example. Still, I knew the kitchen would be fine for a while without me; there were plenty of hands today. But here, on this site, one careless moment could mean disaster. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent need to keep my coworker safe and the commitment I\u2019d made to the people waiting for me at the kitchen."}
