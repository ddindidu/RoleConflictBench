The hearing was two weeks away, but the expectation was clear: I must review every detail, no matter how routine the matter seemed. My eyes skimmed the first page, but my mind kept drifting to the clock. In less than fifteen minutes, I was expected in another courtroom\u2014not as a judge, but as an advocate. My client\u2019s future hinged on my punctual presence; the opposing counsel was notorious for exploiting any delay. I felt the pressure mounting, the judge in me insisting on diligence and preparation, the advocate in me demanding urgency and focus elsewhere. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to read, but the words blurred. I couldn\u2019t ignore either role, yet fulfilling one seemed to betray the other. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest as I wrestled with the impossible expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
