My job was to monitor every swimmer, never letting my attention waver. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from a client\u2014someone I\u2019d been helping as an advocate. She was anxious, asking for clarification about her legal rights in a situation that was growing urgent. I knew she needed a clear, accurate answer, not just the general advice I\u2019d given her before. But my gaze kept flicking back to the water, watching for any sign of trouble. The expectation to be fully present for both roles pressed in on me. If I focused on my phone, I might miss a swimmer in distress. If I ignored my client, I\u2019d fail her when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, knowing I had to choose which responsibility to answer first."}
