She\u2019d asked for a precise bob, but these tangles would make it nearly impossible to get clean lines with my scissors. I knew I should take extra time to wash and condition thoroughly\u2014my clients expect nothing less. But as I worked, my phone buzzed in my pocket. The city newsletter reminder flashed: \u201cBus Route Survey\u2014Last Day Tomorrow!\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, since the new routes could affect my commute and my clients\u2019. As a citizen, I want to be involved, to give feedback that matters. But right now, Mrs. Lee is waiting, and so is my next client. If I rush the wash, her cut will suffer. If I take my time, I might miss the survey deadline. My hands keep working, but my mind is split, tugged between my duty to my client and my responsibility to my city."}
