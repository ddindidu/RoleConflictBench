My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, feeling the pressure mount with every passing minute. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my advocacy client was tomorrow morning. I had promised to review their case files tonight, to be fully prepared to represent them. Their future depended on my diligence; a single oversight could change everything for them. My headset felt heavier as I weighed my options. Should I push through more calls, risking exhaustion and a half-hearted review of the case? Or should I stop now, sacrificing my sales target to give my client the attention they deserved? My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my job and my responsibility as an advocate, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
