Can you respond?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20146:45 a.m. My shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes, and I was the only one with the keys. People would already be lining up, waiting for breakfast and a warm place to sit. But as a police officer, I couldn\u2019t ignore the call. The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed the expectation: maintain order, respond to every complaint. Yet, as a volunteer, I knew the guests depended on me to open the doors on time. My stomach twisted with anxiety. If I went to Maple Street, I\u2019d be late, leaving vulnerable people outside in the cold. If I skipped the call, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as an officer. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, radio in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
