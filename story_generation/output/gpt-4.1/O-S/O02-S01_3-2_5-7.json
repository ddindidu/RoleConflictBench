As the lead engineer, I was responsible for making sure every piece of equipment met strict safety standards. The inspector\u2019s concerns were serious\u2014if I didn\u2019t address them right away, the entire operation could be shut down. My team was looking to me for direction, waiting for my call on what to fix first.\n\nBut I was also here as a volunteer, and the coordinator\u2019s words from the morning briefing echoed in my head: \u201cEveryone must follow the new safety steps, no exceptions.\u201d The new procedures were clear, but they would slow us down, making it nearly impossible to resolve the inspector\u2019s issues before the deadline. If I pushed my team to move faster, I\u2019d be ignoring the coordinator\u2019s guidelines. If I insisted on following the new volunteer protocols, I risked failing my duty as an engineer.\n\nMy chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. I could feel the eyes of my colleagues and the volunteers on me, waiting for my next move, and I wasn\u2019t sure which responsibility I owed more."}
