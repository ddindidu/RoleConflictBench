The new safety standard was stricter, and our product release was scheduled for tomorrow. I was the only engineer with the documentation ready to prove we met the requirements, and the team was counting on me to submit it before the end of the day. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my activist group: the state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could undo years of environmental progress. The vote was tied, and the only undecided representative was someone I\u2019d built a relationship with. They needed me to call now, to make the case one last time. My mind raced\u2014if I missed the compliance deadline, the release would be delayed, costing the company and my team dearly. But if I didn\u2019t act as an activist, the bill might fail, and I\u2019d let down everyone who trusted me to fight for change. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which part of myself to betray."}
