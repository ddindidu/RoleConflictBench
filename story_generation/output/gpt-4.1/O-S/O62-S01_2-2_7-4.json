As a lifeguard, I was trained to enforce safety rules without hesitation. Today, a group of teenagers laughed and pushed each other dangerously close to the no-diving signs. My supervisor expected me to intervene immediately, to keep everyone safe and set a clear example. But just as I took a step forward, a woman at the volunteer check-in table tugged at my sleeve. She whispered a private concern about her son, her voice trembling, trusting me to keep her words confidential. As a volunteer, I was expected to respect her privacy, to listen and not draw attention. My mind raced\u2014should I blow the whistle and call out the teens, risking the woman\u2019s trust and exposing her vulnerability? Or should I stay with her, offering comfort, while the pool rules went unenforced? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, caught between the urgent need for safety and the quiet plea for confidentiality."}
