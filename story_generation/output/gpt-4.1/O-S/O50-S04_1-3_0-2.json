The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime, even now. Find the problem before the next shift.\u201d I\u2019d already spent an hour running diagnostics, but the glitch was maddeningly inconsistent, vanishing whenever I thought I\u2019d pinned it down. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polling station would close in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after everything that had happened. But if I left now, the machine might act up again, and I\u2019d be letting down the team. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down myself, my community. My hands hovered over the control panel, torn between the duty to fix what was broken here and the responsibility waiting for me across town. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest."}
