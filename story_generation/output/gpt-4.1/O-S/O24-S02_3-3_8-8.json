Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, in bold. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was citing. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to halt, review the new ruling, and ensure every word I spoke reflected the law as it stood this very minute. The courtroom waited, eyes fixed on me.\n\nAt that exact moment, my phone buzzed in my pocket. The major news network. They needed me, now, live on air, to correct a wave of misinformation about the cause I\u2019d devoted years to as an activist. The public was listening, and my voice could make a difference. But here, in this courtroom, I was the law\u2019s voice, not the movement\u2019s.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The expectation to be impartial, current, and authoritative as a judge. The demand to be passionate, vocal, and present as an activist. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, the silence in the courtroom growing heavier with every second."}
