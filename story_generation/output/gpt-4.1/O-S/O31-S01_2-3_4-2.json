My radio crackled with updates, and I could see the anxious faces of the drivers, waiting for me to wave them through. As a police officer, I knew my duty was to keep everyone safe, to make sure the scene was secure and that no one else got hurt. But as I glanced at my watch, my heart sank. I was supposed to be across town in ten minutes, unlocking the doors to the community center where a line of people\u2014some elderly, some with children\u2014would already be waiting for the food pantry to open. I was the only volunteer scheduled this morning. I could picture their disappointment, their frustration if I didn\u2019t show up on time. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, the badge on my chest and the volunteer lanyard in my bag, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I stood in the rain, torn, as the minutes ticked by."}
