As a judge, I know the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail matters, every argument must be considered with care. The parties expect a fair, thorough review, and I owe them nothing less. My phone buzzes, jolting me from my concentration. It\u2019s the news network, asking for an immediate on-air comment. There\u2019s a breaking story, and misinformation is spreading fast. As an activist, I\u2019ve always believed in the power of truth, in the necessity of speaking up when it matters most. The community looks to me to clarify, to educate, to defend our cause. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the silent demands of justice on my desk and the urgent call to action in my hand. I feel the pressure mounting, the expectations of both roles pressing in, and I wonder how I can possibly do right by them both."}
