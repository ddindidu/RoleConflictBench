My heart thudded with excitement and nerves. As an activist, I\u2019d been waiting for this chance to speak about workers\u2019 rights and safety. But as I hurried down the hallway, mop in hand, I noticed the cleaning cart was missing gloves and disinfectant. The new supervisor had been cutting corners, and I knew I should stop, find the right equipment, and follow every hygiene protocol. That was my duty as a cleaner: to keep everyone safe, to set an example.\n\nBut the radio host was already waiting for my call. If I delayed, I\u2019d miss my slot and let down my fellow activists who counted on me to raise our voices. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the world outside these walls. I stood frozen, torn between the expectation to protect health here and now, and the responsibility to speak out for change. My hands trembled as I weighed the risks, feeling the pressure of both uniforms I wore\u2014one for cleaning, one for fighting."}
