My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning\u2014water was already pooling at the curb outside. I could see neighbors peering out their doors, some shouting about the rising water. As a delivery person, I was supposed to keep calm, smile, and hand over the package with a polite greeting, no matter what. Mrs. Lee opened her door, looking anxious, expecting the usual professional courtesy. But as a citizen, I felt a surge of responsibility\u2014shouldn\u2019t I be helping people evacuate, warning others, maybe even calling for help? My mind raced, torn between the company\u2019s expectation to finish my delivery with composure and the urgent need to act for the safety of everyone in the building. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the package in my hand and the sirens echoing through the hall."}
