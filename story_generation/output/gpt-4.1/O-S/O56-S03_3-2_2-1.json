My job as a hairdresser was clear: greet them warmly, offer reassurance, and create a calm oasis before the whirlwind of the wedding. I smiled, ushering them to their seats, promising everything would run smoothly. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t ignore the other role tugging at me. Tonight, after the last appointment, I\u2019d planned a small celebration for my friend\u2019s band\u2014music, laughter, a way to unwind after a long week. But the building\u2019s quiet hours started at eight, and my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open, sensitive to every sound. As I listened to the bride\u2019s anxious chatter, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to be the perfect, accommodating hairdresser, and the responsibility to be a considerate citizen, respecting the peace of those around me. My stomach twisted as I wondered how I could possibly meet both demands."}
