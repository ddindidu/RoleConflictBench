I knew the finance team relied on these timely responses to keep our records clean and our relationships professional. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started at 5:00 p.m. sharp. The coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind: \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed today, so please be on time. Every minute counts.\u201d I pictured the line of people waiting outside, the doors opening, and the need for every hand on deck. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting the reply and grabbing my coat. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my responsibility to my job, my commitment to the shelter. I could feel my heart race as I tried to decide which role to honor first, knowing that either choice meant letting someone down."}
