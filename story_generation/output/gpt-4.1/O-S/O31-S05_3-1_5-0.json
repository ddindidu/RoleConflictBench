As a police officer, my training screamed at me to act fast, to protect everyone, to stop the violence before anyone else got hurt. But as I moved forward, I recognized the man at the center of the chaos\u2014my client from last week\u2019s legal clinic, the one I\u2019d advised about his rights and the consequences of self-defense. He caught my eye, panic written across his face, and I remembered our conversation, the legal advice I\u2019d given him, the trust he\u2019d placed in me as his advocate. Now, the expectations of my badge clashed with the responsibility I felt toward him as his advisor. Should I treat him like any other suspect, or should I consider the context I knew from our confidential talks? The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, torn between the duty to protect and the duty to guide."}
