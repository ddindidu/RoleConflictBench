My radio crackles: \u201cMedical emergency in car three.\u201d Instinctively, I prepare to stop at the next station, my mind racing through the safety protocols I\u2019ve memorized. Passengers depend on me to act quickly, to keep them safe, to coordinate help. But as I reach for the intercom, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my client, desperate for legal advice. Their case is at a critical juncture, and they\u2019re waiting for my guidance to make a decision that could change everything for them.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. The passengers need my focus, my calm authority. My client needs my expertise, my clarity. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both expect me to be fully present, fully committed. My heart pounds as I stare at the emergency button and the glowing screen of my phone, torn between the lives in my care and the trust placed in my counsel."}
