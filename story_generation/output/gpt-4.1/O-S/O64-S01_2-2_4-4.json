Can I return it?\u201d she asked. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo returns without a receipt, no exceptions.\u201d I could see her frustration mounting as I explained the policy, her voice trembling as she pleaded for understanding.\n\nLater that afternoon, I switched hats and sat at the check-in table at the community center, volunteering as I did every week. A man I recognized from the store came in, filling out forms with shaking hands. He leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal struggle, trusting me to keep it private.\n\nNow, as I watched him leave, I felt torn. As a cashier, I was expected to enforce rules strictly, but as a volunteer, I was entrusted with people\u2019s vulnerabilities. The woman\u2019s desperate eyes at the store haunted me, while the man\u2019s trust weighed heavily on my conscience. I felt pulled in two directions, wrestling with the demands of both roles, unsure how to honor both without betraying one."}
