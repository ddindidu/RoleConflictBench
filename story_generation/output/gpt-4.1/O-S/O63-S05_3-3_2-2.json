As a telemarketer, I was expected to remain calm, handle his objections, and convince him of the offer\u2019s legitimacy. He demanded a thorough explanation, his voice rising with each question. My script felt flimsy against his skepticism, but I couldn\u2019t let him feel dismissed. At the same time, my other phone buzzed insistently\u2014a message from a client in crisis, desperate for clear legal advice. As their advocate, I was expected to provide precise, immediate guidance, knowing their next steps depended on my words. My mind raced, torn between the obligation to reassure Mr. Harris and the urgency of my client\u2019s legal predicament. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I failed. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which voice to answer first, feeling the impossible pull of incompatible expectations."}
