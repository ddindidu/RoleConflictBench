Each call blurred into the next, but today, prospects kept firing off technical questions the script barely touched. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle objections, don\u2019t let them off the line.\u201d I fumbled through half-answers, feeling the pressure mount with every skeptical pause on the other end. Glancing at the clock, my heart skipped. Only two hours left before the polls closed, and I still had a list of calls to finish. As a voter, I knew I had a civic duty to show up, but as a telemarketer, I was expected to stay until my shift ended, especially on a campaign this important. My stomach twisted with anxiety. If I left early, I\u2019d let my team down and risk my job. If I stayed, I might miss my chance to vote. The demands of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, headset in hand, torn between responsibility and responsibility."}
