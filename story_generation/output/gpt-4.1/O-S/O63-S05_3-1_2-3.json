How do I know this offer is even real?\u201d As a telemarketer, I was trained to stay calm, to handle objections, to reassure him with practiced explanations. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse, where in less than an hour, I was supposed to represent a client at a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but as an advocate, I owed my client my full attention and preparation. Yet here I was, caught in a script, trying to soothe an irate customer who deserved honesty, while my briefcase sat unopened by my desk. My supervisor expected me to close the call with a sale, but my client expected me to stand up for them in court. I felt my heart race, torn between the demands of two worlds, each pulling at me with its own urgency, and I wondered which expectation I would fail first."}
