The safety audit team is due any minute, and I\u2019m still tightening the last bolts on the centrifuge, hoping it\u2019ll pass inspection this time. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another citation. Double-check everything.\u201d I wipe sweat from my brow, but my phone buzzes with a reminder\u2014polls close in ten minutes. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. Civic duty tugs at me; I\u2019ve always believed in the importance of participating in elections. But the lab is my responsibility, too. If something goes wrong, it\u2019s on me. I stare at the door, torn between the hum of the machines and the distant promise of the polling station. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that refuse to wait for each other."}
