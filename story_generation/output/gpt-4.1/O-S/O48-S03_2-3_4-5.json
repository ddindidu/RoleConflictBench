As a nursing assistant, I know I need to check Mr. Lee\u2019s vital signs again\u2014his temperature and pulse have been a bit high since his procedure, and the nurse wants close monitoring. I can see him resting, but I worry about missing something important if I don\u2019t act soon. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place down the street closes in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure that could change parking rules on my block, and I promised my neighbors I\u2019d vote and share my thoughts. I feel the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me. My job expects me to be vigilant and thorough, to put my patients first. But as a citizen, I know my voice matters, and I don\u2019t want to let my community down. I stand in the hallway, torn, feeling the minutes slip away as I wrestle with what to do next."}
