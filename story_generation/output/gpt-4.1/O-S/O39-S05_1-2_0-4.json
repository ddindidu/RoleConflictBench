My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMove those unused materials to the back storage before you clock out.\u201d I glanced at the growing stack, calculating how long it would take. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my client\u2019s hearing was in less than two hours. The case was complicated, with crucial evidence I still needed to review. As an advocate, I owed my client my full attention, to represent them with care and precision. But here, on the construction site, I was expected to finish the heavy lifting, no excuses. My muscles ached, and my mind raced, torn between the physical demands of my labor and the intellectual responsibility of my advocacy. Both roles demanded my best, but there was only so much of me to give. I stared at the pile of materials, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which duty I could afford to let down."}
