As a subway operator, I know the importance of the pre-departure check\u2014even if it\u2019s just the non-critical systems today. The schedule is tight, and any delay could ripple through the entire line. My supervisor expects precision and punctuality; the city depends on me to keep things moving safely.\n\nBut my phone buzzes in my pocket. I glance at the screen: a message from my client\u2019s family. The trial is in less than an hour, and they\u2019re desperate for reassurance. As their advocate, I\u2019m supposed to be present, prepared, and persuasive. Their future hangs in the balance, and I can\u2019t let them down.\n\nMy heart pounds as I weigh the demands. If I rush the check, I risk safety and my job. If I focus on the train, I might miss the chance to help my client when they need me most. The pressure from both sides is suffocating, and I can feel myself pulled in two directions, unable to ignore the expectations of either role."}
