As a cashier, I was supposed to close out my drawer and double-check every cent, following store policy to the letter. Today, though, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. It didn\u2019t affect the total sales, but the rules were clear: report and resolve any irregularity before leaving. My manager expected nothing less.\n\nBut I was also an advocate, and my client\u2019s court session was scheduled in less than half an hour. Missing it could jeopardize their case, and punctuality was non-negotiable in my profession. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I stay and sort out the register, risking my client\u2019s future, or leave now and possibly violate store policy? The expectations from both sides clashed in my mind, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
