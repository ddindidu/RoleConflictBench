The sun was barely up, but already a line of people waited outside the community center, shuffling their feet in the morning chill. As the only volunteer scheduled to open up, I knew they were counting on me to be on time. But at the same moment, I stood in the workshop, surrounded by saws and drills that needed a thorough inspection before I could start the day\u2019s carpentry work. My boss had drilled it into me: safety first, always. If I skipped checking the tools, I risked an accident\u2014maybe not today, but someday. Yet, if I stayed, the people outside would keep waiting, some of them elderly, some with kids, all depending on the center\u2019s warmth and services. My hands hovered over the toolbox, torn between the responsibility to my trade and the promise I\u2019d made as a volunteer. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
