It was already 6:45 p.m.\u2014later than I\u2019d hoped, but technically still within the delivery window. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was starting now. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch it live, ask questions, and finally get involved in the issues that mattered to my neighborhood. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to be informed, to participate, to make my voice heard. But as a delivery person, I knew Mrs. Lee was probably waiting by her window, expecting her medication before nightfall. My supervisor always stressed the importance of punctuality and accuracy\u2014one late delivery could mean a complaint, or worse, a reprimand. I sat in my van, torn between the duty to my job and the duty to my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
