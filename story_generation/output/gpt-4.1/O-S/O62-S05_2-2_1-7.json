My phone buzzed on the bench behind me\u2014a reminder that the court session for my client was starting in fifteen minutes. I was supposed to be there, advocating for someone whose future depended on my presence and preparation. But right now, my duty was here, watching every ripple in the water. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t leave my post, not with someone in distress. Yet, the clock was ticking, and I knew the judge wouldn\u2019t wait. My client\u2019s case was on the line, and so was this swimmer\u2019s safety. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of delay. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of the pool and the silent plea from the courthouse, feeling the weight of both roles crushing me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
