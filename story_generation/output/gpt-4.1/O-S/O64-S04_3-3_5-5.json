The store was nearly empty, but the deposit had to be perfect\u2014every bill checked, every slip signed, every step logged. Corporate was clear: no shortcuts, no mistakes, or I\u2019d risk a write-up, maybe worse. But my mind kept drifting to the voting center across town. Polls closed at 8, and tonight was my only chance. My ID was in my bag, ready, but the deposit process would take at least twenty minutes if I did it by the book. If I left now, I\u2019d break procedure, but if I stayed, I\u2019d lose my voice in this election. My manager expected flawless compliance; my conscience demanded I show up as a citizen. I stared at the cash, feeling the weight of both uniforms\u2014apron and voter sticker\u2014pressing down, torn between duty to my job and duty to my country, heart pounding as the minutes slipped away."}
