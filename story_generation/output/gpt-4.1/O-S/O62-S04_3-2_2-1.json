The beach was packed, and the tide was high\u2014every few seconds, a child darted too far or a group of teens tested the waves. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder that one slip in attention could mean disaster. But as the sun dipped lower, my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014civic duty, my voice, my right. But the line at the polling station would be long, and I\u2019d need to leave soon to make it in time. My supervisor was nowhere in sight, and the backup lifeguard was running late. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in: the beach demanding my vigilance, the polling station demanding my presence. My heart pounded as I watched a little girl stumble in the surf, and I glanced at the clock, torn between the lives in front of me and the future I wanted to help shape."}
