Can you come?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just past noon. My laptop screen is filled with error logs and performance graphs; the critical service I helped build is buckling under load, and the traces point straight to the functions I merged last night. My team expects me to fix this, and fast. Clean, maintainable code is my mantra, but right now, I\u2019m patching and firefighting, my mind racing through possible optimizations.\n\nBut Maya\u2019s message tugs at me. The protest is small, and every person counts. We\u2019ve been planning this for weeks, and I promised to be there if I could. The cause matters deeply to me\u2014raising our voices, showing up, making a difference. Yet, my team is counting on me too, and if I leave now, the service could fail for thousands of users. My heart pounds as I stare at the two worlds colliding on my screens, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself to answer."}
