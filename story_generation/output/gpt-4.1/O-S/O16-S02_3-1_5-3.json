The family waited outside, their faces drawn with worry. As a doctor, I knew I had to explain the diagnosis with compassion, to answer their questions and offer support, no matter how painful the news. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my activist group. The petition to push for better healthcare funding was about to close, and my signature, as a physician, would add weight. I could picture the legislator\u2019s office, the stack of names, the hope that maybe this time, change would come. But the family was waiting, and they deserved my full attention, my empathy, my presence. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the immediate needs of the people before me and the broader fight for justice that could help so many more. I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
