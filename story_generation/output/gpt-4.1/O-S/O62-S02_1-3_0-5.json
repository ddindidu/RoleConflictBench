The sun glinted off the water, and I watched as a few swimmers drifted toward the deep end. No one seemed in trouble, but I knew my job was to never look away, not even for a second. My phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a message from my activist group. The state legislature was about to vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to share my story and sway the vote. My heart pounded. If I looked away from the pool, even briefly, I\u2019d be breaking the trust placed in me as a lifeguard. But if I didn\u2019t act, the policy I believed in could fail. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
