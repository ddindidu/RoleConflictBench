As an engineer, management was pressing for my time estimates for the new project. They needed firm numbers for the quarterly roadmap, and I knew how much the team depended on my input to set realistic goals. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a client. As their advocate, they were counting on me for clear, accurate legal advice about an urgent issue that could impact their business within hours. I could hear the anxiety in their voice from our last call\u2014they needed guidance now, not later. My mind raced, torn between the technical details I needed to analyze for the project plan and the legal research I had to finish for the client. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both had people relying on me. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly give both the attention they deserved at the same time."}
