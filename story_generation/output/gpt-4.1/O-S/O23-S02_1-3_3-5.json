In thirty minutes, I was due in court for a procedural hearing\u2014a minor matter, one that could be postponed with a quick call. As a lawyer, I knew my client expected me to be there, to represent them with the same diligence I gave every case, no matter how small. But my phone buzzed with an urgent message from my activist group: a surprise, tie-breaking vote on a bill we\u2019d fought for all year was happening in less than an hour. The undecided representative was taking calls now, and my voice, as a constituent and advocate, could tip the balance. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my client\u2019s trust in my reliability, my movement\u2019s need for my action. I stared at my phone, torn between the courtroom and the cause, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
