As a doctor, I was expected to diagnose quickly, to save lives with precision. I scanned the monitors, ordered labs, and tried to piece together the puzzle of his symptoms\u2014nothing fit, and every second mattered.

As a citizen, I knew I was supposed to help ensure everyone\u2019s safety, to follow emergency protocols, maybe even help evacuate others.
