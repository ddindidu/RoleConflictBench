The termite damage was worse than I\u2019d feared\u2014her house wasn\u2019t safe, and she was counting on me to give her a repair plan before the end of the day. She hovered nearby, anxious, asking if her family would have to move out. I promised her I\u2019d figure it out, but as I reached for my tape measure, my phone buzzed again. It was a legislative aide from Senator Kim\u2019s office\u2014finally calling back after weeks of emails. I had ten minutes, right now, to make my case for the housing bill I\u2019d been fighting for. My mind raced: Mrs. Patel needed answers, but this call could change policy for hundreds of families like hers. I could see her watching me, hope and worry in her eyes, while my phone kept vibrating in my hand. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from all sides."}
