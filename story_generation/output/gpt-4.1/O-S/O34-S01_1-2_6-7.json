As an air traffic controller, I was responsible for coordinating with my colleagues to ensure every aircraft moved safely and smoothly. Right now, Flight 482 was about to cross into the neighboring sector, and I needed to hand it over seamlessly, just as we always did. But my mind kept drifting to the new safety steps the volunteer coordinator had emphasized\u2014steps that were supposed to be applied without exception, even in the smallest tasks. I could almost hear her voice reminding us how important consistency was for everyone\u2019s safety.\n\nThe radio crackled, and my colleague in the next sector asked for a quick update. At the same time, I noticed a minor irregularity in the handover process\u2014something that, according to the new volunteer guidelines, would require me to pause and double-check before proceeding. But in the tower, any delay could disrupt the flow and frustrate my team. My hands hovered over the controls, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the expectations of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at this moment."}
