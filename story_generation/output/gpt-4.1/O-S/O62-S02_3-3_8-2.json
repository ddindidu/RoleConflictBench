My training as a lifeguard kicked in: I had to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe, no exceptions. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The protest I\u2019d helped organize was suddenly in chaos; police were blocking the exits, and my fellow activists needed me to help coordinate a safe, calm response. I could hear the panic in the group chat, and I knew my presence could make a difference. My heart pounded as I looked from the struggling child to my phone. Both roles demanded my immediate action\u2014one to save a life in the water, the other to protect the safety and rights of my friends. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
