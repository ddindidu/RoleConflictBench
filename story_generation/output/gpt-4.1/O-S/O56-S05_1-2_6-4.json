She smiled at me in the mirror, explaining she\u2019d just shampooed at home. As a hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting, ensuring the best results and upholding salon standards. My manager was strict about this policy, and skipping it could mean a reprimand. But Mrs. Lee was also my client in a legal dispute, and as her advocate, I was supposed to represent her interests, respect her wishes, and build trust. She looked tired, clearly hoping for a quick appointment before our meeting at the courthouse. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding adherence to procedure, the other urging me to honor her autonomy and comfort. My mind raced, torn between the salon\u2019s rules and my duty to support her as her advocate. I hesitated, unsure which expectation to meet, feeling the tension knotting in my stomach as I prepared to speak."}
