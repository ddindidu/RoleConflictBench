As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. I glance at the clock, calculating how much I can read before the polling station opens. Today is election day, and as a voter, I\u2019m expected to bring valid identification. I check my wallet: my driver\u2019s license is there, but my passport and other IDs are at home. I could fetch them later, but the thought nags at me\u2014what if I get caught up in court business or the journal\u2019s articles and forget? The pressure mounts. My judicial duty urges me to immerse myself in the journal, to be the best judge I can be. Yet, the civic responsibility of voting tugs at me, reminding me that my participation matters. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. I stand at my desk, journal in hand, wallet in the other, uncertain which expectation to meet first."}
