She\u2019d called me in a panic this morning, worried her grandkids might get hurt if the deck wasn\u2019t fixed before their visit. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d get it done today, and I could see the relief in her eyes when I arrived. My tools were scattered around me, and I was halfway through replacing the worst of the boards when I glanced at my phone. Ten minutes until the polling station closed. I\u2019d meant to finish early, but the rot was worse than I thought. \n\nAs a carpenter, I knew the responsibility I carried\u2014people trusted me to keep their homes safe. But as a voter, I felt the weight of my civic duty pressing on me. If I left now, Mrs. Lee\u2019s deck would be unsafe, but if I stayed, I\u2019d lose my chance to have a say in the election. My hands trembled, torn between the expectations of my craft and my role as a citizen. The clock ticked louder in my mind, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
