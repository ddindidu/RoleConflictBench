As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted; my job was to watch every swimmer, ready to leap in at the first sign of trouble. Today, though, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due in court for a minor hearing, representing a client who couldn\u2019t afford to lose even a small case. As an advocate, I owed them my full attention and best effort. But as I watched the pool, I noticed a swimmer in the middle, floundering, their strokes growing weaker. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d fail my duty to protect these swimmers. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my client down, possibly costing them more than they could bear. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I felt torn, paralyzed by the weight of responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left unprotected."}
