She clutched my hand, her eyes pleading for me to stay just a little longer. I knew how much she relied on these moments, how the quiet company seemed to ease her loneliness. My heart ached to sit with her, to offer the comfort she so clearly needed. But my mind was already drifting to the walk home through the park, a small ritual I cherished. As I strolled, I noticed a group of teenagers laughing, tossing empty snack wrappers onto the grass right beneath a no-littering sign. I felt a surge of frustration\u2014my duty as a citizen demanded I say something, to protect the park and respect the law. Yet, the memory of Mrs. Lee\u2019s longing gaze tugged at me. Should I have stayed longer with her, or should I confront the littering now? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I found myself frozen, torn between the needs of one person and the good of the community."}
