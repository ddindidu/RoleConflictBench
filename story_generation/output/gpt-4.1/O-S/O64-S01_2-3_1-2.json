My manager expects me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, especially during the evening rush. I glance at the clock\u2014my volunteer shift starts in fifteen minutes, across town. I\u2019m the only one with the keys tonight, and I know people are already waiting outside the community center, hoping for a warm meal and a place to rest. My phone buzzes with a reminder, and my stomach knots. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my manager and coworkers, who are already stretched thin. If I stay, the people at the center will be left in the cold, maybe thinking no one cares. My hands tremble as I hand a customer their receipt, my mind torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility I feel as a volunteer. The minutes tick by, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
