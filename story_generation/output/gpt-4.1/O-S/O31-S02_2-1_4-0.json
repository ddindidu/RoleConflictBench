My radio crackled with updates, and I kept my voice steady, reassuring shaken drivers and making sure the paramedics had space to work. This was my duty as a police officer\u2014protecting people, keeping order, making sure everyone got home safe. But as I handed a blanket to a trembling teenager, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist: \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Police are moving in. Can you come?\u201d I glanced at the accident scene, then at the message. My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised to stand with my friends, to fight for justice and raise our voices. But right now, these people needed me too. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the badge on my chest, the cause in my heart\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. The world expected me to be two people at once, and I didn\u2019t know which part of myself to answer."}
