As an ambulance driver, I was trained to get patients help as quickly as possible, but also to drive safely\u2014no matter how urgent the call. Today\u2019s dispatch was for a sprained ankle, not a heart attack, but the traffic was thick and impatient. I could feel the weight of every eye on me as I nudged the ambulance forward, careful not to cut off anyone or run a red light. \n\nLater, off duty, I strolled through the park, enjoying the rare peace. I finished my coffee and glanced at the trash bin a few steps away. The no-littering signs were clear, and as a citizen, I knew I should set an example. But my phone buzzed\u2014another call, another life waiting. I hesitated, cup in hand, torn between tossing it quickly to rush to the ambulance or taking the extra moment to do what was right for the community. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, caught between duty and responsibility, unsure which to honor first."}
