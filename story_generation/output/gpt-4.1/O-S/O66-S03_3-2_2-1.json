As a taxi driver, I have a passenger in the back seat, nervously checking his watch every few seconds. The snow is coming down hard, and the roads are slick. He tells me his flight leaves in less than an hour, and he begs me to hurry. I know he\u2019s counting on me to get him there safely and on time, but every red light and cautious turn feels like a betrayal of that trust.\n\nBut I\u2019m also a citizen, and my mind drifts to the plans I made for later\u2014meeting friends for music in my apartment. The problem is, it\u2019s late, and the building\u2019s quiet hours have started. My neighbor, who always leaves her windows open, has a newborn. I know loud music will disturb her, but my friends are excited, and I don\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nCaught between the anxious passenger urging me to speed through the storm and my own anticipation for a night of music, I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. I grip the wheel tighter, heart pounding, torn between the demands of the road and the responsibilities waiting at home."}
