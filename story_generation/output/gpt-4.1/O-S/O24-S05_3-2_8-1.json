The law was my guide, and I prided myself on staying current with every shift in precedent. Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014an urgent Supreme Court ruling had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My heart pounded. As a judge, I was expected to halt, reassess, and ensure the law was applied correctly, even if it meant disrupting the entire process.\n\nBut another part of me\u2014the advocate\u2014flared up. I thought of my client, waiting anxiously for guidance as their case grew more tangled by the hour. They depended on me for certainty, for advice rooted in the most up-to-date law. Now, everything I\u2019d told them was in question. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the judge, bound to impartiality and accuracy in the courtroom; the advocate, desperate to provide clarity and reassurance. My mind raced, torn between the duty to the court and the responsibility to my client, as I stood frozen, the courtroom silent, waiting for my next move."}
