The siren wailed, echoing through the storm, and the paramedic in the back shouted updates about the patient\u2019s dropping blood pressure. Every instinct screamed at me to push the ambulance faster, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I had to get us there safely\u2014lives depended on it. \n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the community center earlier that day, where I volunteered. A woman, eyes darting nervously, had leaned in while filling out her forms and whispered a secret about her home life. She\u2019d trusted me, expecting confidentiality. Now, as I navigated the treacherous streets, her words echoed in my head. Should I tell someone to get her help, or keep her trust? \n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me: the patient\u2019s life in my hands, the woman\u2019s trust in my heart. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
