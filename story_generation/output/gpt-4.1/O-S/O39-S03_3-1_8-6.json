As a construction laborer, I know the drill: when the alarm sounds, you don\u2019t hesitate. You leave everything and head straight to the muster point, no questions asked. The foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my head\u2014protocols are strict for a reason, and the team depends on everyone following them. But as I join the line of workers shuffling toward the exit, my mind drifts to the envelope of tax documents sitting on my kitchen table, all sorted and ready, and the flyer I saw this morning about the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. As a citizen, I feel the weight of responsibility to do my part\u2014paying taxes on time, staying healthy, and helping others do the same. The demands of both roles press in on me, each urgent in its own way. I feel torn, caught between the immediate safety of my coworkers and the broader duty I owe to my community. My chest tightens as I wrestle with which expectation should come first."}
