As a scientist, I knew the importance of routine\u2014every piece of equipment needed to be checked, every protocol followed, even if nothing seemed wrong. The safety of my colleagues depended on it, and the university\u2019s expectations were clear: no shortcuts, no exceptions. But as an advocate, my client\u2019s hearing was tomorrow, and the case was complicated. They were counting on me to be prepared, to catch every detail, to fight for them with everything I had. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I focused on the lab, I might miss something crucial for my client. If I poured myself into the case, I risked neglecting the safety standards I\u2019d sworn to uphold. My mind raced, torn between the silent hum of the lab and the urgent voices of those who needed me in court."}
