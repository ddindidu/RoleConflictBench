As a telemarketer, my manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My team was counting on me, and the pressure to meet the target was suffocating. But my other phone buzzed with a reminder: my client\u2019s hearing was about to start. As their advocate, I was expected to be fully present, to argue their case with precision and care. Their dispute was complex, and any misstep could cost them dearly. My heart pounded as I stared at the sales script in one hand and the legal brief in the other. I knew I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded at the same time. The weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressed against the responsibility I owed my client. My mind raced, torn between dialing the next number and logging into the virtual courtroom, knowing that whichever I chose, someone would be let down."}
