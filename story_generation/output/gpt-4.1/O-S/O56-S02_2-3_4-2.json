She hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected.\u201d My heart sank\u2014I knew how important it was to make her feel heard and satisfied, especially as a new visitor. I started to apologize and explain how we could adjust the tone, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. A message from my activist group flashed on the screen: \u201cPolice are blocking exits\u2014need help coordinating safe routes NOW.\u201d My mind raced. As a hairdresser, I needed to stay calm, reassure my client, and fix her colour. But as an activist, I was expected to act immediately, to help protect my friends and the cause I cared about. I felt my hands tremble, torn between the woman in my chair and the people in the streets, both counting on me in different ways."}
