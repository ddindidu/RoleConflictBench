As I approached the main square, I saw a crowd gathered\u2014protesters waving signs, police setting up barricades. My passenger, tense and impatient, asked me to take a shortcut through a side street blocked off by the demonstration. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to follow traffic laws, avoid restricted areas, and keep everyone safe. But as a citizen, I also felt the weight of respecting public property and the rights of others, especially during such a charged moment. Suddenly, a protester knocked on my window, urging me to drive past the barricade, insisting it was for a good cause. My passenger echoed the plea, promising a big tip if I just went through. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, torn between my duty to obey the law and my empathy for the people outside, all while feeling the pressure from the person in my back seat."}
