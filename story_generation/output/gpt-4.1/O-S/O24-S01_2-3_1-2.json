As a judge, I knew the importance of reviewing every detail\u2014missing something could mean an unfair outcome. The case was complex, and both parties had submitted lengthy, intricate arguments. I needed to give them my full attention, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center, and people would already be waiting outside, relying on me to open the doors and start the morning service. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours of preparation. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people counting on me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my commitment. I stared at the clock, feeling the tension build, torn between my duty to justice and my promise to serve."}
