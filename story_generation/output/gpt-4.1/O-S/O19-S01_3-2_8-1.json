Today was the first day of the national continuing education program\u2014an event I\u2019d registered for months ago to keep my pharmacist license current and stay sharp on the latest treatments. The opening session was scheduled for 8:00 a.m. sharp, and I knew missing even a portion could mean falling behind on critical updates. But as I checked my phone, a reminder popped up: my volunteer shift at the community food bank started at 8:00 a.m. too. The coordinator had sent a message last night, stressing how tight the roster was and how every volunteer needed to be there the moment the doors opened. I could almost hear her voice, \u201cWe can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d My heart pounded as I pictured the faces of the people who counted on us for their meals, and then the faces of my colleagues, expecting me to be up-to-date and reliable. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
