The external auditor\u2019s voice was brisk: \u201cWe need the quarterly financials by noon for review.\u201d My heart skipped. As the company\u2019s accountant, accuracy and timeliness were non-negotiable. I glanced at the spreadsheets, knowing they needed another hour of careful checking. But my calendar flashed a reminder\u2014court in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I was expected to represent my client, even if today\u2019s hearing was minor. My client was counting on me to be present, to speak for them, no matter how small the stakes. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of mistakes. My mind raced, torn between the numbers that needed my precision and the client who needed my voice. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
