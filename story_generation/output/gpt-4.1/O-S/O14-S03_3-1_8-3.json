As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, I know the warning lights mean a possible leak\u2014protocol demands I check it immediately, log the incident, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My mind races through the checklist: gloves, mask, evacuation plan. But as I reach for my lab coat, my phone buzzes with a reminder\u2014the city\u2019s transit survey closes in an hour. As a citizen, I\u2019ve always believed in participating, giving feedback to improve our bus routes, especially since my neighbors have been complaining about the new schedule. I promised myself I\u2019d fill it out, and I know my input matters. But the equipment\u2019s alarm grows louder, echoing the urgency of my scientific duty. My hands tremble as I hover between the lab bench and my phone, torn between the immediate safety of my colleagues and the civic responsibility I feel toward my community. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my attention, each too important to ignore."}
