My inbox pings again: another team needs my input to resolve a dispute. I rub my temples, glancing at the calendar. \n\nA sticky note reminds me: \u201cTax docs ready\u2014file by next week.\u201d I\u2019ve always prided myself on being a responsible citizen, paying taxes early, following every guideline. This weekend, the community center is hosting a free vaccine clinic, and volunteers are needed. I want to help, to show up for my neighbors, especially after the year we\u2019ve all had.

I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
