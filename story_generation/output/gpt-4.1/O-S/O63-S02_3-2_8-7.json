My headset itched against my ear as I dialed another number, the automated compliance system watching every second. If I left my desk even a minute early, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d risk a warning or worse. But the radio host\u2019s email flashed on my phone: \u201cWe\u2019re live in five. Ready?\u201d My heart pounded. I\u2019d promised my activist group I\u2019d speak, to educate listeners and rally support. But my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo unscheduled breaks. The system tracks everything.\u201d I stared at the blinking cursor, torn. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray my cause. If I left, I\u2019d risk my job. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach."}
