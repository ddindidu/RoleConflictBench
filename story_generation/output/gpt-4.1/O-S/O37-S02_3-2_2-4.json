I hesitated, glancing at the clock\u2014my supervisor expected every room spotless by noon, and I still had the kitchen and two bedrooms left. But the caller ID made my heart race: it was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist, a chance to push for the bill that could change so many lives. The aide only had ten minutes, and if I missed this call, I might not get another chance. Yet, if I stopped cleaning now, I\u2019d fall behind, and my supervisor had already warned me about missing deadlines. My hands trembled, torn between the mop and the phone, between the expectations of my job and the demands of my cause. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the bleach and the ringing phone, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
