The national continuing education webinar was in full swing, and the speaker was finally addressing the new guidelines for hypertension\u2014something I needed to master to better serve my patients and keep my license current. My notepad was already half-filled with scribbles and questions, but my mind kept drifting to the reminder on my phone: the polling place down the street would close in less than two hours. There was a ballot measure that could change the way our block handled traffic and safety, something my neighbors and I had debated for weeks. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to cast my vote, to be part of the decision that would shape our daily lives.

The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, torn between my duty to my profession and my duty to my community."}
