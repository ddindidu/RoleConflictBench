As the lead carpenter, I know the crew looks to me to set the standard, especially when it comes to safety. Before we can even think about lifting a beam, I need to inspect every tool\u2014check the saw blades, tighten the drill bits, make sure the ladders are steady. It\u2019s tedious, but I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone skips a step. The foreman expects me to keep everyone safe, and I take that seriously.\n\nBut today is also Election Day. I promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014civic duty and all that. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, but I can\u2019t shake the worry. What if the inspection takes longer than usual? What if something\u2019s wrong with the equipment and I have to fix it? I feel the pressure mounting: the crew waiting on me, the responsibility to keep them safe, and the nagging thought that if I don\u2019t get to the polls in time, I\u2019ll let myself\u2014and maybe others\u2014down. I stand there, tools in hand, torn between two roles that both matter deeply."}
