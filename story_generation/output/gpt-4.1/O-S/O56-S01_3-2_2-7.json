I smiled, welcoming them, trying to ease their tension. They were early, and the schedule was already tight\u2014every minute counted. As I led them to their seats, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a reminder about the new safety steps we\u2019d just been briefed on. I was supposed to implement them immediately, even here at the salon, since I\u2019d agreed to help with community outreach and safety awareness.\n\nThe bride\u2019s mother looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d start right away to keep everything on track. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no exceptions, everyone must follow the new guidelines. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the need to be the calming, efficient hairdresser, and the responsible, rule-abiding volunteer. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for my tools, caught between the anxious eyes of my clients and the strict instructions from the coordinator, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
