The carpenter caught my eye, tapping his foot impatiently\u2014he needed the wood now, and I knew any delay would throw off the whole crew\u2019s schedule. My foreman expected me to keep things moving, no excuses. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that I was due at the community center in ten minutes. As a volunteer, I was trusted to sort confidential medical files, making sure no one\u2019s private information was left exposed. The director had stressed how important it was to respect people\u2019s privacy, and I took that responsibility seriously. My mind raced\u2014if I left the site now, I\u2019d let down my team and slow the build. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, risking the trust placed in me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the lumber in my hands and the files waiting for me across town."}
