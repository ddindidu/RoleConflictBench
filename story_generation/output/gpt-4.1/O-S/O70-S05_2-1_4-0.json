As a delivery person, I was expected to secure every parcel and confirm delivery, especially for items like this\u2014moderately valuable, signature required. I rang the bell, and the door swung open to reveal Mrs. Kim, one of my pro bono legal clients. She smiled, recognizing me instantly. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you! I was hoping to ask about my landlord situation,\u201d she said, reaching for the package.\n\nMy scanner beeped, reminding me of the company\u2019s strict policy: no signature, no delivery. But Mrs. Kim\u2019s eyes were anxious, and I knew she\u2019d been waiting for advice. As her advocate, I was supposed to provide clear, accurate legal guidance, not just casual reassurances. Yet, here I was, in my delivery uniform, not my advocate\u2019s hat. She started asking questions, her hand hovering over the scanner. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding strict procedure, the other compassion and clarity. My mind raced, torn between the rules of my job and the needs of my client, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
