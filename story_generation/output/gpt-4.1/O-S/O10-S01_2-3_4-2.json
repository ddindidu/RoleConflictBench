My manager had made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014I was supposed to unlock the community center doors at 8:00 a.m. sharp. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to start the breakfast service. I was the only volunteer scheduled this morning. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time on the tax forms, risking errors or missing the deadline. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the people who depended on me, some of whom had nowhere else to go. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between my responsibilities as an accountant and my commitment as a volunteer."}
