As an engineer, I was under pressure\u2014stakeholders wanted a working prototype by next week, and their emails grew more urgent by the hour. They needed something tangible to show the board, something that would secure the funding we desperately needed. Every minute I spent away from the design felt like a step closer to failure.\n\nBut as an advocate, my phone buzzed with reminders about tomorrow\u2019s hearing. My client\u2019s case was complex, with disputes that could change the course of their business. They trusted me to represent them with care and precision, to pore over every detail and anticipate every argument. I knew how much was at stake for them.\n\nThe expectations pulled at me from both sides. If I focused on the prototype, I risked letting my client down in court. If I devoted myself to the case, the project might stall, and everyone\u2019s hard work could unravel. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
