Dust motes swirl in the sunlight, taunting me from the living room shelves. I know I should tackle them now\u2014Mrs. Lee, my supervisor, expects every corner to shine, and I take pride in leaving no streak or crumb behind. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district is starting. I promised myself I\u2019d be more involved this year, to listen, to vote, to speak up about the issues that matter in our neighborhood. The candidates are discussing policies that could affect my job, my rent, my family\u2019s future. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding spotless floors, the other demanding my voice. My mop leans against the wall, the laptop glows on the table. My heart pounds as I stand between them, torn by the expectations of the cleaner who must not miss a speck, and the citizen who must not miss a chance."}
