As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping my workspace tidy\u2014one stray nail or misplaced saw could mean a nasty accident. My supervisor always reminded us: safety first, no exceptions. I started gathering scraps, but my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the online candidate forum for our district was starting. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to tune in, to stay informed and maybe even ask a question about the new zoning laws that could affect small businesses like mine. The forum was only live for an hour, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate this time. But the mess at my feet nagged at me, a silent warning of what could go wrong if I left it for later. I stood there, torn between my duty to keep my worksite safe and my obligation to be an engaged member of my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
