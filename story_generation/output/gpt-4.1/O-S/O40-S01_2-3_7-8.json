The homeowner hovered nearby, anxious, explaining how the deck was the only safe way for her elderly mother to get outside. She needed it fixed today, and I could see the worry in her eyes. As a carpenter, I knew I had to replace the damaged planks and reinforce the railing\u2014anything less would be unsafe.\n\nBut the message from the coordinator was marked urgent. There\u2019d been a compliance issue at the shelter, and all volunteers were required to report immediately for a briefing and to implement new safety procedures. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear: if we didn\u2019t act now, the service might be shut down, leaving dozens without support.\n\nI stood there, tools in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The homeowner\u2019s hope, the coordinator\u2019s urgency, and my own sense of responsibility collided inside me. I stared at the deck, then at my phone, torn between the two calls for help, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
