As a lawyer, I knew my client expected a thorough review, even if the deadline was weeks away. The legal language was dense, and I wanted to ensure every clause protected their interests. Yet, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the weekly advocacy meeting was about to start. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable\u2014my colleagues relied on my presence and input, and missing even a routine session could be seen as neglecting my commitment to the cause.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left the contract now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and risk missing subtle details. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the meeting, letting down the team and possibly missing important updates. My mind raced, torn between the silent expectation of meticulous legal work and the vocal demand for my advocacy. The tension twisted in my chest as I weighed the importance of each role, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be falling short somewhere."}
