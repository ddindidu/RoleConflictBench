As a lifeguard, I knew I had to watch every swimmer, especially the kids who sometimes drifted toward the deep end. My whistle hung around my neck, ready for action. But today, I was also on volunteer duty, sorting confidential medical files for the community health program. The files were stacked beside me, each one a reminder of the trust people placed in us to keep their information private.\n\nAs I tried to focus on the paperwork, I caught sight of a group of teenagers edging closer to the deep end. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on them, but the files demanded my attention too\u2014names, conditions, private details that couldn\u2019t be left out in the open. I felt pulled in two directions: the responsibility to protect swimmers from harm, and the obligation to safeguard the privacy of those who had entrusted us with their secrets. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give either role the full attention it deserved."}
