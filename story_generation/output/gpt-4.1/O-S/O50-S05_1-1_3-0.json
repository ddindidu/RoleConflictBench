As the machine repairer, everyone counted on me to keep the line running smoothly. The planned downtime was my only window to clean and service the machines\u2014if I missed it, the risk of breakdowns would skyrocket, and the team would be furious. But as I was reviewing the checklist, my phone buzzed. It was a client, anxious and insistent, asking for a quick consultation. As their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, accurate legal advice, even in these informal chats. They trusted me to explain their rights and options, and I could hear the worry in their voice. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the machines needed my hands, but the client needed my mind. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the hum of the factory and the urgency in the client\u2019s words, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
