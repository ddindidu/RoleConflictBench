As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle customer objections smoothly, but today, every call seemed to veer off-script. Prospects wanted technical details\u2014real answers, not the vague reassurances my script offered. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d But I could hear the frustration in the customers\u2019 voices, and it gnawed at me.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I had a minor hearing to attend as an advocate in an hour. The stakes were low, but my client still deserved to be represented effectively. I was supposed to be their voice, to fight for their interests, no matter how small the case.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions. On one hand, I was expected to be a compliant telemarketer, following the company\u2019s rigid guidelines. On the other, I was an advocate, trained to dig deeper, to answer questions, to stand up for people. The demands clashed inside me, and I stared at the clock, heart pounding, unsure which role I could honor without betraying the other."}
