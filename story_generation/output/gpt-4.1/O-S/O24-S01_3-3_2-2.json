The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk, the file thick with urgent affidavits. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to weigh the evidence with care before making a ruling that could change someone\u2019s life. The hearing was set for less than an hour from now. I reached for the first page, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the community center this morning, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, some of them desperate for warmth and a hot meal. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d fail in my duty to the court and the people depending on a swift, fair decision. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the volunteers and the community members who counted on me. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of delay. I stared at the motion, then at my keys, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
