The script in front of me was useless now; it barely scratched the surface of what they wanted to know. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, handle objections, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d I could feel my frustration mounting, but I forced myself to smile through my words, jotting down their concerns for the next call.\n\nSuddenly, my personal phone buzzed. It was the news network. My heart skipped. They needed me\u2014now\u2014to go on air and counter the misinformation spreading about our cause. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist: a chance to educate, to set the record straight, to speak from the heart. But I was still tethered to my headset, expected to keep dialing, keep selling, keep following the script. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my cause. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to answer first."}
