As a construction laborer, I was always alert, always watching for hazards. Today, my mind was split\u2014half on the site, half on the courthouse across town. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that my client\u2019s trial was about to begin. Their future hung in the balance, and I was supposed to be there, standing by their side, ready to argue their case.\n\nBut right now, I saw Joe, my coworker, heading straight for a suspended load. My heart pounded. I knew the rules: safety first, always. I had to shout, to stop him before disaster struck. Yet, my phone kept buzzing, the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressing on me. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to fulfill my duty on the site, the other aching to be in that courtroom, fighting for someone\u2019s life. The expectations crashed together inside me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the urgent demands of both worlds."}
