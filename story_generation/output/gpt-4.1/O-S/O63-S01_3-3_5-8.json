My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d Every call, every pitch, every polite rejection piles on the pressure. I glance at my phone\u2014an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator flashes on the screen. There\u2019s a new directive: all volunteers must follow a strict new intake procedure today, or the service risks being shut down. I\u2019m supposed to be on shift in fifteen minutes, helping people who rely on us. But if I leave my desk now, I\u2019ll let my sales team down. If I stay, I\u2019ll be breaking the coordinator\u2019s trust and risking the future of the service. My stomach knots as I stare at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to the people who need me."}
