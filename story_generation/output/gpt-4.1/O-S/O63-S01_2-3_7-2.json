My headset buzzed with another call, but I knew I had to log out soon\u2014management was strict about break times, and the phone queue was relentless. I glanced at my phone, where a reminder flashed: \u201cVolunteer shift at 3:15. Don\u2019t forget the keys!\u201d I was the only one opening the community center today, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to unlock the doors and start the service. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo early breaks, no late returns. We\u2019re watching the logs.\u201d But if I waited until my official break, I\u2019d be late to the center, leaving everyone stranded. My stomach twisted as I weighed the disappointment of my manager against the letdown of the people who needed me. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which expectation I was about to break."}
