My next customer, a woman with tired eyes, placed a blender on the counter and quietly explained she\u2019d lost her receipt but needed to return it. As a cashier, I knew the store\u2019s policy was strict\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce it, no exceptions. But as an advocate, I was used to listening, understanding, and helping people navigate rules that often felt unfair. She looked at me, hopeful, and I could see she was struggling. I wanted to explain her rights, maybe suggest a way she could still get help, but I also knew I couldn\u2019t bend the store\u2019s policy. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my employer and my instinct to support someone in need. The register beeped, the line grew longer, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, each demanding something different."}
