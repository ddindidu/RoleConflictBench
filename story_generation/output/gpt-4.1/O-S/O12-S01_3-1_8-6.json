My heart raced as I scanned the logs, realizing the outage traced back to a piece of code I\u2019d written last week. My manager\u2019s messages pinged in rapid succession, each one more urgent than the last. Fixing this wasn\u2019t just a priority\u2014it was a crisis.\n\nBut as I was about to dive in, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes. I remembered the coordinator\u2019s email from this morning, suggesting we reorganize the supply room if we had time. She\u2019d emphasized how much smoother things would run if we could get it done today. I knew she was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nI stared at my screen, torn. The weight of customers\u2019 frustration pressed on me from one side, while the quiet trust of the volunteer team pulled from the other. My mind raced, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet expectations of my volunteer role, unsure which responsibility I should answer first."}
