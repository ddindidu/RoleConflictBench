As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, and the law was clear\u2014this was a violation. But the driver was a fellow advocate, someone I often worked with, and I knew the meetings inside were routine but strictly timed. If I issued the ticket, I\u2019d be upholding the law, but I\u2019d also be making it harder for a colleague to fulfill their own professional obligations. If I let it slide, I\u2019d be compromising my duty as an officer. My radio crackled, reminding me I was already late for my own meeting. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one demanding impartiality, the other demanding solidarity and punctuality. My hand trembled as I hesitated, caught between the expectations of justice and the demands of advocacy, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
