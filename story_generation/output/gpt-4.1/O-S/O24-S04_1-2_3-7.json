The deadline loomed, and I knew the attorneys would expect clarity and precision in my legal opinion. My mind was tangled in statutes and timelines when my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that today was the last day to drop off my ballot. I rushed to the polling place, legal arguments still swirling in my head.\n\nAt the counter, the poll worker frowned at my envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the signature is smudged. Could you please re-sign so your ballot isn\u2019t rejected?\u201d I hesitated, pen in hand. As a judge, I was trained to follow procedure to the letter, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. But as a voter, I was expected to comply with the poll worker\u2019s instructions. My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of my ballot being invalidated against the fear that re-signing might be misconstrued. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, pen hovering, caught between the demands of duty and the rights of citizenship."}
