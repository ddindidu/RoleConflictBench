As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was sacred. My assistant, new and eager, knocked on my door, asking for access to files she didn\u2019t need, just to make her work easier. I could see her frustration when I hesitated, but the trust my clients placed in me was not something I could risk, not even for office efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a fellow activist. The protest downtown was smaller than expected, and they needed more people to make an impact. I felt the pull\u2014my heart beat faster at the thought of joining them, raising my voice for justice. But I was still at work, and the assistant lingered, waiting for my answer. I could feel the expectations from both sides: to be the reliable, ethical lawyer, and the passionate, present activist. My mind raced, torn between duty and conviction, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
