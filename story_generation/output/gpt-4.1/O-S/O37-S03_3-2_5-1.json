The client expected me to keep their home spotless, and I prided myself on never missing a detail. But now, with the shelves bare, I couldn\u2019t finish the job properly. I glanced at the clock\u2014stores were closed, and the only way to get more was to borrow from the supply closet in the building\u2019s common area, meant strictly for public use. As a citizen, I knew the rules: those supplies weren\u2019t for private apartments, and taking them would be crossing a line, disrespecting shared property.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder about the music night I\u2019d planned for myself. I\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, but the building\u2019s quiet hours had just started, and I could hear my neighbor\u2019s window open, their laughter drifting in. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding I deliver perfect service, the other insisting I respect the community\u2019s rules and peace. My hands trembled as I stood between the supply closet and my own apartment, torn by the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
