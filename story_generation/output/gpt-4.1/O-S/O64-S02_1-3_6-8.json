I smile at Mrs. Lee as I bag her groceries, making small talk about the weather, just as my manager expects\u2014friendly, attentive, never distracted. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I glance at the screen. It\u2019s a message from the activist group: a major news network needs me on air, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounds. This is the moment I\u2019ve been preparing for, the chance to educate thousands, maybe millions, and set the record straight. But here, I\u2019m the cashier, expected to be present, polite, and focused on each customer. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to the people in front of me, and my responsibility to the movement I believe in. My hands tremble as I hand Mrs. Lee her receipt, my mind racing, torn between the expectations of my job and the urgent call to activism."}
