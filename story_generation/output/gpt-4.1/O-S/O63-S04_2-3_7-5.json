As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to stick to my scheduled breaks, no exceptions, especially now when every call counts. But as I glance at the clock, my heart pounds. The polling station closes in less than an hour, and tonight is my only chance to vote. I need to bring my ID, which is locked in my car outside. If I leave my desk now, I\u2019ll miss my break window and risk a write-up\u2014or worse, a lecture about team commitment. But if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote, something I\u2019ve waited for and believe in deeply. My headset feels heavier as I weigh the demands: loyalty to my job, or my right as a citizen. The phone rings again, and I stare at the blinking light, torn between two worlds that refuse to wait for me."}
