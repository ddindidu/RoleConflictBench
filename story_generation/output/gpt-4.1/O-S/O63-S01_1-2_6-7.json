My supervisor had mentioned we could be flexible with our breaks, as long as we didn\u2019t leave the floor empty. I considered taking my break early, just this once. But then my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer group chat: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone, to follow the new safety steps at the shelter today. Consistency is key!\u201d The volunteer coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I was supposed to help set up the shelter\u2019s entrance during my lunch break, making sure every new safety measure was in place before the doors opened. If I left my telemarketing desk early, I could get to the shelter on time and help out as expected. But if I bent the rules here, was I letting my work team down? My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014flexibility at work versus strict adherence at the shelter. I stared at my phone, torn between the two roles, feeling the pressure of both responsibilities closing in."}
