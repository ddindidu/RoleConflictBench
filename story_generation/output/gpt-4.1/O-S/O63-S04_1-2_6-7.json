I felt a rare sense of freedom, a small perk in an otherwise rigid job. I decided to use the time to drop off my mail-in ballot at the polling station down the street. When I arrived, the poll worker inspected my envelope and frowned. \u201cThe signature is smudged. Could you please re-sign it? Otherwise, your vote might not count.\u201d I hesitated, pen in hand. My telemarketer training drilled into me the importance of following company schedules, even if supervisors were lenient. But as a voter, I knew I had to follow every instruction from election officials to ensure my ballot was valid. My mind raced\u2014should I risk being late returning from break, or ignore the poll worker\u2019s request and hope my vote would still count? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my loyalty, and I stood there, torn, unable to move."}
