The journal\u2019s submission portal would close in less than two hours, and I still needed to double-check my datasets for accuracy. As a scientist, I knew the importance of precision\u2014one overlooked error could undermine months of work. My phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised to help serve dinner, and I knew they counted on me to be there on time. Still, I also knew that a few of the other volunteers could cover the first part of the shift if I was late. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety. The lab demanded my meticulous attention, but the kitchen needed my presence. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, and I wondered which expectation I would ultimately let down."}
