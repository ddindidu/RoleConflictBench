She\u2019s anxious, tapping her foot, urging me to hurry. As a taxi driver, I feel the pressure to get her there safely and on time. But as we approach the city center, traffic grinds to a halt. A street demonstration blocks the main road, and police have set up barricades. A man in a reflective vest leans into my window, whispering that if I just drive past the barricade onto the restricted lane, I can bypass the jam and make it to the station in time. My passenger\u2019s eyes plead with me, but I know as a citizen I\u2019m expected to respect the law and public property. My hands tighten on the wheel. The urge to help my passenger clashes with my responsibility to follow the rules. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014should I break the law for her sake, or uphold my duty as a responsible citizen?"}
