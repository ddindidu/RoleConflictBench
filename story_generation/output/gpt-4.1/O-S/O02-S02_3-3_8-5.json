Client\u2019s waiting.\u201d As the lead engineer, I knew the contract couldn\u2019t move forward until I broke down the hours for every task, and the team was counting on me to keep the project on track. But just as I opened my laptop, my activist group\u2019s alert popped up\u2014an urgent call to action. The state legislature was about to vote on a bill I\u2019d spent months fighting for, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. I was the only one with a personal connection, and my call could tip the balance. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my colleagues needed my technical expertise, but my fellow activists needed my voice. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the responsibility to my team and the cause I believed in. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
