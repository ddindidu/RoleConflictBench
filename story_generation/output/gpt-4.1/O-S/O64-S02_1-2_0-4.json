Only two customers wait behind the woman in front of me, their baskets half-full, their faces patient. My phone, tucked beneath the counter, vibrates insistently. I glance down and see the name: the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. My heart leaps\u2014this is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, a chance to push for the bill that could change so much. But I\u2019m on shift, responsible for every cent and every smile, expected to keep the line moving and the drawer balanced. I can\u2019t just walk away, not without risking my job or letting down my manager, who trusts me to keep things running smoothly. Yet if I miss this call, the window for real change might slam shut. My hands tremble as I hand the customer her receipt, my mind torn between the beep of the register and the urgent buzz of my phone, caught between duty to my job and duty to my cause."}
