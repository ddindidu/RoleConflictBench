The new line was barely moving, but the official\u2019s eyes met mine, expecting me to comply. I hesitated, glancing at my watch. My shift as an ambulance driver had just ended, but my radio was still clipped to my belt. Suddenly, it crackled to life: \u201cAll units, multi-vehicle collision, Highway 17, critical injuries reported.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew every second counted in an emergency, and I was trained to respond without delay. But here, as a voter, I was expected to follow the official\u2019s instructions, to wait my turn, to respect the process. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other requiring patience and order. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call to save lives and the civic duty to follow the rules, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
