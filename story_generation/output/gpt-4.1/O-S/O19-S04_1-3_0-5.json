My shift was supposed to end at 6:30, but a last-minute customer slid a prescription across the counter. It was for a common cold, nothing complicated, but I knew the expectation: double-check every detail, no matter how routine. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014accuracy above all else. I scanned the label, compared it to the prescription, and felt the pressure mounting. If I hurried, I might make it to the polling station in time, but if I rushed this check, I could make a mistake that would cost someone their health. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my patient against my right\u2014and responsibility\u2014to vote. The minutes ticked by, and I felt torn, caught between the white pharmacy lights and the distant promise of the ballot box, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both roles perfectly tonight."}
