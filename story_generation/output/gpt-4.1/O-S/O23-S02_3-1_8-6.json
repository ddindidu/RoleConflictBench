As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and the opposing counsel\u2019s recent email was a thinly veiled attempt to pry loose information that could devastate my client\u2019s case. I could almost hear my law professor\u2019s voice: \u201cNever betray your client\u2019s trust.\u201d Yet, my phone buzzed with notifications. The activist in me saw the opportunity: a viral post about our cause, thousands of people hungry for the truth, and I had the facts that could educate and mobilize the public. But those facts were tangled with details from my client\u2019s case\u2014details I was sworn to protect. My heart pounded as I hovered over the comment box, torn between my duty to my client and my responsibility to the movement. The world was watching, waiting for my voice, but so was my client, trusting me to keep their secrets safe."}
