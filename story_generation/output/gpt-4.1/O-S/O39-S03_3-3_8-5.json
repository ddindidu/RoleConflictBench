Protocol is clear: leave everything, head straight to the muster point, no exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014safety first, always. But as I join the stream of workers, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling place closes in two hours. Today\u2019s ballot measure could change the zoning on my block, maybe even affect my rent. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who shows up, who cares. But now, stuck behind the chain-link fence, I can\u2019t just slip away. My team counts on me to follow the rules, to be accounted for. My city counts on me to make my voice heard. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, sweat prickling my neck, torn between duty to my crew and duty to my community."}
