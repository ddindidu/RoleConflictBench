As the lead engineer, I was expected to address every safety concern before the next shift began. The pressure was intense\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, the plant could be shut down, affecting dozens of workers and the company\u2019s reputation. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s survey on new bus routes was closing soon. As a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself to be more involved, to give feedback that could improve public transit for everyone, including my own family. But the survey would take time I didn\u2019t have, and my mind was already racing with technical solutions and regulatory checklists. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. I wanted to be a good engineer, to keep everyone safe, but I also wanted to be a good citizen, to have my voice heard in decisions that shaped our community. The clock ticked, and I stared at the two open tabs, feeling the tension build inside me."}
