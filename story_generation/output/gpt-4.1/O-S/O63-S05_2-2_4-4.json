My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, feeling the pressure mount. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my client\u2019s hearing was in thirty minutes. As an advocate, I owed them my full attention, especially with the stakes so high in their case. I knew I needed to review the evidence and prepare my arguments, but the sales target loomed over me like a storm cloud. If I focused on my client, I\u2019d likely miss my quota and face my manager\u2019s disappointment. If I kept dialing, I\u2019d risk letting my client down in court. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the demands of two worlds, each expecting my undivided commitment. My heart pounded as I weighed which responsibility to honor, feeling the tension twist inside me."}
