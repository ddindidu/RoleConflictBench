I promised I\u2019d be there on time. But now, standing in the crowded polling station, my heart pounded for a different reason. The election official frowned at my ID, then explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a registration issue. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form. We close in ten minutes.\u201d I looked at the clock, then at the line of people ahead of me. If I stayed, I might miss Mrs. Patel\u2019s delivery window and let her down.

Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing in from every side."}
