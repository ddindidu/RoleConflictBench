I forced a calm smile, my scissors trembling in my hand. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to listen, apologize, and fix her cut\u2014no matter how tired or frustrated I felt. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my activist group: the petition to ban single-use plastics was about to be sent to the city council. I had one last chance to add my name, to stand up for something I believed in. My heart pounded. If I stepped away now, I\u2019d risk making Mrs. Patel even angrier, maybe even lose her as a client. But if I missed this moment, I\u2019d let down my fellow activists and my own convictions. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, scissors in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the demands of my two lives."}
