I knew this was my only chance to vote; if I missed it, my voice wouldn\u2019t count this year. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, and I could already picture the patient, pain etched across their face, waiting for help that only I could bring. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and care, to stabilize and reassure. As a citizen, I was expected to show up, ID in hand, and participate in the one act that gives us all a say. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding as I weighed the responsibility of a patient in need against the duty to cast my vote.
