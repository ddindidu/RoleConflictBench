The protest downtown had taken a turn\u2014police were blocking exits, and panic was rising. As a cleaner, I was drilled to never leave my post without properly sanitizing, never remove my gloves or mask, and always follow protocol. But as an activist, I was expected to be present, to help coordinate a safe, calm response, to protect my friends and the cause we all believed in. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d But my friend\u2019s text\u2014\u201cWe need you now, people are scared\u201d\u2014pulled at my heart. I stared at my gloved hands, torn between the sterile world of my job and the urgent, messy reality outside. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, caught between duty and conviction, unable to move."}
