As a lifeguard, I was trained to never let my attention waver, to watch every swimmer, especially the ones who drifted toward the deep end. Today, a few teenagers kept edging farther out, laughing, not realizing how quickly things could change. My heart thudded with the familiar pressure\u2014constant vigilance, no room for distraction.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently in my bag. I knew it was about my client\u2019s case, a dispute that could change their life. As their advocate, I was expected to be available, to respond quickly, to prepare for the hearing that was just hours away. My client was counting on me to represent them with focus and care.\n\nI felt the demands of both roles pulling me apart. If I answered the call, I\u2019d break my watch over the pool. If I ignored it, I risked failing my client. My hands tightened on the armrests, my mind racing, caught between the safety of the swimmers and the needs of my client, unable to ignore either responsibility."}
