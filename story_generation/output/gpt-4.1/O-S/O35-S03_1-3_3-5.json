The intercom crackles\u2014someone\u2019s asking for directions to the museum, their voice tinged with confusion. I know I\u2019m supposed to help, to keep the ride smooth and safe, to be the calm voice guiding passengers through the city\u2019s veins. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder: the polling place closes in two hours, and the ballot measure could change everything about my block\u2014parking, noise, even rent. As a citizen, I should be there, casting my vote, making my voice heard. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. The train rumbles on, the passenger waits for my answer, and the clock ticks down on my chance to participate. My hands tighten on the controls. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both expect me to show up."}
