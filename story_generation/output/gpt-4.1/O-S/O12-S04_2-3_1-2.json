My team expects me to deliver code that\u2019s not just functional, but elegant and efficient. I want to meet their standards, to prove I\u2019m not cutting corners. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. I feel the weight of civic duty pressing on me\u2014my voice matters, and I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way. Yet, if I rush out, I\u2019ll leave my team hanging, and the code could go live with flaws. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between fixing one more bug and grabbing my jacket. The minutes slip away, and I can feel the expectations from both sides tightening around me, demanding I choose."}
