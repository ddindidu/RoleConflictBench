In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be on air, live, talking about the urgent need for affordable medications in our community. But right now, Mrs. Lee sits across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. She\u2019s confused, worried, and I can see why: blood thinners, diabetes meds, a new heart pill. I know how dangerous these combinations can be. As a pharmacist, I owe her my full attention, to explain every risk, every interaction, to make sure she\u2019s safe. But my phone buzzes with reminders: the radio host is waiting, the community is counting on me to speak up, to educate, to fight for change. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to this one patient, and my responsibility to the many who need a voice. My hands tremble as I try to focus, torn between the person in front of me and the cause that drives me."}
