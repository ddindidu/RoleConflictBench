Dozens of flights circle in tight stacks, pilots\u2019 voices tense over the radio. My job is to keep them safe, to manage the congestion and prevent disaster. Every second counts, and the pressure is suffocating. I can\u2019t afford a single mistake.\n\nLater, I try to clear my head with a walk in the park. The air is fresh, and I pass a no-littering sign near a trash bin. My empty coffee cup feels light in my hand, but my mind is heavy with the day\u2019s stress. I know the rules\u2014respect public spaces, keep the park clean. But my phone buzzes with an urgent message from the tower: they need me back, now. I hesitate, cup in hand, torn between rushing to my post and doing what\u2019s right as a citizen. The weight of both roles presses down, and for a moment, I stand frozen, wrestling with the expectations that refuse to let go."}
