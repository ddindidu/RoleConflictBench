My friends were waiting for me to join them for a late-evening music session in my apartment, something we\u2019d planned for weeks. As I handed a customer a box of ibuprofen, she asked, \u201cIs this okay for a headache?\u201d I knew I should offer more thorough counseling, but my mind was already half out the door. I gave her a quick, simple answer, feeling a twinge of guilt as she nodded and left.\n\nWalking home, I thought about the music plans. The building\u2019s quiet hours started soon, and my neighbor\u2019s windows were open. As a citizen, I knew I should respect the rules and my neighbor\u2019s right to peace. But as I unlocked my door, the excitement of unwinding with friends tugged at me. The expectations of my roles pressed in from both sides\u2014my duty to my patients for proper care, and my responsibility to my neighbors for quiet. I stood in my living room, torn, the music equipment waiting and the weight of my choices heavy on my mind."}
