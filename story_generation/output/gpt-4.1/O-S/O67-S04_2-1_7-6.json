Dispatch had said the patient\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t life-threatening, but I still felt the weight of urgency pressing on me. My training echoed in my mind: drive safely, no matter what. I couldn\u2019t risk anyone\u2019s life, not the patient\u2019s, not the people weaving between cars, not my own. But every red light, every honking horn, made my pulse race with the knowledge that someone was waiting for me.\n\nEarlier that morning, I\u2019d stood in a long line at the polling station, my voter registration card in hand. When the officials announced that voters with last names A\u2013M should move to a new line, I hesitated. The original line was moving faster, but the rules were clear. I was supposed to follow instructions, even if it meant waiting longer. I felt the eyes of the officials on me, expecting compliance, while my own impatience gnawed at me.\n\nNow, as I navigated the ambulance through the chaos, the memory of that moment lingered. The pressure to do what was right in both roles\u2014safe driving, following rules\u2014pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me caught between duty and desire, expectation and instinct."}
