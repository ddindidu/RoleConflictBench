As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, and the law was clear\u2014this was a ticketable offense. But I also wore another hat here: I volunteered at this very center, and the car belonged to Mrs. Lee, the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d just emailed me, asking if I could help reorganize the supply room if I had a spare moment. I knew she was stretched thin, and her suggestion felt more like a plea. If I ticketed her, it would seem cold and ungrateful, especially when she was just trying to keep things running smoothly. But if I let it slide, was I compromising my duty as an officer? My mind raced, torn between the expectations of fairness in my uniform and the loyalty I felt as a volunteer. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something different from me, and I hesitated, caught in the middle."}
