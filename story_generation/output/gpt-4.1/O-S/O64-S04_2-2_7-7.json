As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep the line moving and greet each customer with a smile, even as the register beeps nonstop and the line snakes past the bakery. I do my best, chatting with regulars and apologizing for the wait, but my mind keeps drifting to the voting booth set up in the corner of the store. I finally get my break and hurry over, ballot in hand, eager to do my civic duty. The poll worker examines my envelope and frowns, pointing out a smudge on my signature. \u201cI need you to re-sign this, please,\u201d she says, her tone firm. I glance back at the clock, knowing my break is almost over and the line at my register is only getting longer. I feel torn\u2014my manager expects me to be back on time, customers expect quick service, but as a voter, I\u2019m supposed to follow every instruction to make sure my vote counts. My heart pounds as I stand there, caught between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a citizen, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
