Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, and I\u2019m supposed to report it, no matter how minor. My manager expects me to be meticulous, to follow every procedure to the letter. But my phone vibrates urgently in my pocket. I glance at the screen and my heart races. The group chat is exploding\u2014police have started blocking the exits at the protest downtown, the one I helped organize. People are scared, and I\u2019m supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure no one gets hurt. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I leave the register now, I\u2019ll be breaking store policy and letting my coworkers down. If I stay, I\u2019m abandoning people who are counting on me to help them stay safe. My hands tremble as I stare at the register, torn between the rules I\u2019m paid to follow and the cause I believe in."}
