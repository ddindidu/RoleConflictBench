She\u2019s waiting for me to work my magic, trusting me to detangle, wash, and condition before I even think about picking up my scissors. I glance at the clock\u2014her appointment is running late, but I can\u2019t rush this. If I don\u2019t do it right, I\u2019ll damage her hair, and she\u2019ll leave disappointed, maybe even angry. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I see frantic messages from my activist group. The protest I helped organize is turning tense; police are blocking the exits, and people are scared. They need me to help coordinate a safe response, to use my voice and presence to keep everyone calm and protected. My hands tremble as I lather shampoo, torn between the woman in my chair and the friends in the street. I feel the weight of their expectations\u2014one needs my care and skill, the other my leadership and courage. My heart pounds as I try to decide where I\u2019m needed most, caught between two worlds that both demand all of me."}
