My shift was almost over, but the line hadn\u2019t shrunk, and the end-of-day cash count loomed. Every bill and coin had to be perfect\u2014one mistake, and I\u2019d be called in for a meeting, maybe even written up. My manager expected precision, especially with the high-value transactions that always seemed to pile up at closing. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating with messages from my fellow activists. The protest was starting in minutes, and I was supposed to lead the first chant, my voice setting the tone for the march. They were counting on me to be there, to stand up for what we believed in. My heart pounded as I handed a customer their change, torn between the responsibility in front of me and the cause waiting just outside. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the register and the rallying crowd."}
