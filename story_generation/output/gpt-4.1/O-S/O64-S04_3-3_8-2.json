I force a smile as the woman in front of me slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp and accusing about a sale price she thinks I missed. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay calm, be friendly, no matter what.\u201d I nod, apologize, and try to fix the issue, but my eyes keep darting to the clock above the door. The polling station closes in ten minutes, and if I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll lose my chance to vote. My civic duty tugs at me, but so does the expectation to serve every customer with patience. I feel my heart pounding, torn between the woman\u2019s angry glare and the ticking clock. If I rush her, I\u2019ll fail as a cashier. If I stay, I\u2019ll fail as a voter. The register beeps, the line shuffles forward, and I stand frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019m about to let down."}
