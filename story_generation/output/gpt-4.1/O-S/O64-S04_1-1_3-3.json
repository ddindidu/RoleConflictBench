Today, while closing out my register, I notice a small discrepancy\u2014just a few cents off. It doesn\u2019t affect the total sales, but the rules say I should report any irregularity, no matter how minor. My manager expects me to be thorough, and I know I could get in trouble if I let it slide. But I\u2019m also a voter, and today is election day. I have just enough time to get to the polling station before my break ends, but I realize I\u2019ve left my main ID at home. I have a backup card in my wallet, which is technically acceptable, but I know some poll workers are stricter than others. If I take the time to fetch my primary ID, I\u2019ll be late returning to work, risking my job. If I stay to sort out the register issue, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between being the diligent cashier and the responsible voter."}
