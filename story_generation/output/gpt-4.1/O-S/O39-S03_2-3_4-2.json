My supervisor always drilled into us: safety first, keep the site clean, don\u2019t let anyone get hurt. I knew I had to grab the mop and warning signs, but just as I turned, the noise from the street outside grew louder. The demonstration was swelling, voices echoing off the buildings. I\u2019d come out during my break to see what was happening, wanting to stand with my neighbors for a cause I believed in. Suddenly, someone beside me nudged my arm, whispering, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s cross\u2014show them we won\u2019t be fenced in.\u201d The barricade was right there, city property off-limits, police watching. My mind spun: as a worker, I couldn\u2019t leave that spill\u2014someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be responsible. But as a citizen, I felt the pull to join, to make my voice heard, even if it meant breaking a rule. My heart pounded as I stood between the spill and the barricade, torn by the weight of both duties."}
