I log out and step outside, grateful for the fresh air. The city is buzzing, and as I walk down the block, I stumble upon a demonstration. People are chanting, waving signs, and the energy is contagious. Suddenly, someone next to me nudges my arm and urges me to step past a police barricade, saying, \u201cCome on, we need more people to show we\u2019re serious!\u201d I hesitate, feeling the weight of my two worlds. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m used to following schedules and rules, but today I have the freedom to choose. As a citizen, I know I should respect the law and public property, but the cause tugs at my conscience. My heart pounds as I stand at the edge, torn between joining the crowd and staying behind the line, wrestling with what\u2019s right in both roles."}
