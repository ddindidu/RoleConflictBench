As a judge, I was expected to craft a thorough, well-reasoned judgment\u2014one that would stand up to scrutiny, with every fact and legal conclusion clearly laid out. The deadline loomed, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. Yet, today was also Election Day. As a citizen, I was expected to show up at the polling station, to participate in the democratic process. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but every time I considered stepping away, guilt gnawed at me. If I left now, I\u2019d lose my momentum, and the judgment might be delayed. If I stayed, I risked missing my chance to vote, betraying my civic duty. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, my attention, my integrity. I stared at the clock, torn, the cursor blinking on a blank page, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice."}
