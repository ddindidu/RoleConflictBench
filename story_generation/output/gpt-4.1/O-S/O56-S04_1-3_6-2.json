Only ten minutes left before the polling station closed. My last client of the day, Mrs. Lee, settled into my chair, her hair still damp and fragrant from a recent wash. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she smiled, \u201cso you can skip that part.\u201d But the salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before any cut or style. My manager had reminded me just this morning\u2014no exceptions, even if the hair seemed clean.\n\nYet, the thought of missing my chance to vote gnawed at me. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way of my civic duty. But Mrs. Lee expected the full salon experience, and my boss expected me to follow the rules. If I rushed her or skipped the wash, I\u2019d risk a complaint or worse. If I did everything by the book, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. My hands trembled as I reached for the shampoo, torn between my responsibilities as a professional and as a citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
