The manager had just reminded me that every corner needed to be spotless today\u2014no shortcuts, no missed spots. I could already hear her voice in my head, \u201cWe have guests coming, everything must shine.\u201d My hands moved faster, but the grime in the grout was stubborn, and I still had two more rooms to deep clean. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was supposed to be there on time, ready to help set up for the community lunch. I knew the others could cover for me if I was late, but I hated the idea of letting them down. They counted on me to be reliable, to show up when I said I would. \n\nI felt torn, my mind racing between the expectation to leave every room immaculate and the commitment I\u2019d made to the volunteer team. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment of my manager against the trust of my fellow volunteers, both demanding more than I could give at once."}
