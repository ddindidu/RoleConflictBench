The safety audit was in two hours, and I\u2019d already been warned about the aging centrifuge and the loose gas valve. As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, it was my responsibility to double-check every piece of equipment, to make sure nothing would endanger my team or our research. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another reminder from my activist colleagues. The state legislature was about to vote on a bill that could gut environmental protections, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to use my expertise and passion to sway the vote. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands: the safety of my lab, the trust of my team, the urgency of the political moment, and the hope of making a difference. I felt pulled apart, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
