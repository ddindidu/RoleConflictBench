She\u2019d booked a quick trim, but her hair was so tangled and coated with product that I knew I\u2019d need extra time just to get my scissors through. As a hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition thoroughly before cutting, but the process was taking much longer than usual. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I had a call scheduled in ten minutes with another client, this time as their advocate. Their legal case had grown more complicated overnight, and they were counting on me to provide clear, accurate advice. I could feel the pressure mounting: Mrs. Lee needed my full attention to avoid a botched haircut, but my legal client needed me to be focused and prepared, not distracted by the scent of conditioner and the sound of running water. My heart pounded as I tried to untangle Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair, torn between the demands of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either client what they truly deserved if I tried to do both at once."}
