The list of supplies to restock was growing longer, and I knew the manager expected everything to be in order before the end of my shift. I scribbled down what we needed, but my mind kept drifting to the clock. The polling station would close in just a couple of hours, and I still had to finish the bathrooms and mop the hallways. Voting was important to me\u2014my voice, my right\u2014but so was doing my job well. If I left early to make it to the polls, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking a reprimand. If I stayed to finish the inventory and cleaning, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my time, each refusing to wait. I stood in the supply closet, torn, the ticking clock echoing my growing anxiety."}
