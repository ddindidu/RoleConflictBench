The architects from three teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions today, or the whole project stalls.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just enough time to vote before my next meeting. At the polling station, the line was long but moving. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cVoters A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with B. The new line looked chaotic, but the official\u2019s voice was insistent. I hesitated, torn. As a developer, I was expected to collaborate and not be the bottleneck. As a voter, I was supposed to follow instructions, even if it meant waiting longer. My phone buzzed again\u2014another urgent message. I felt the pressure mounting, caught between the demands of my team and my civic duty, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
