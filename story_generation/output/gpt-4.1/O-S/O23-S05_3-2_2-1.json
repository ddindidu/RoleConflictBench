As a lawyer, I knew I had to review every clause meticulously\u2014one overlooked detail could expose my client to immediate financial disaster. The pressure was mounting; the deadline loomed, and the stakes were high. Yet, my phone buzzed with another urgent message from the client. Their case was growing more complex by the hour, and they needed clear, accurate advice to navigate the shifting landscape. As their advocate, I was expected to provide guidance, to be present and responsive, to answer every question with confidence. But how could I do that when I hadn\u2019t finished analyzing the contract? My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect my client from hidden legal traps and the responsibility to offer them the advice they desperately sought. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I stared at the clock, knowing I had to choose where to focus my energy next."}
