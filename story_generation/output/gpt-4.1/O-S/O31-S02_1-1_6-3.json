As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to enforce the law without bias. The car belonged to a local organizer, someone I knew from my work as an activist. She was inside, leading a meeting about a new bill that would make parking regulations more equitable\u2014a cause I deeply believed in. My phone buzzed with a notification: the online petition to support the bill was about to be sent to the state legislator, and I had one last chance to add my signature. I felt the weight of my badge and the urgency of my beliefs pressing against each other. Should I issue the ticket, upholding the law as written, or use my discretion, knowing the bigger fight for justice happening inside? My thumb hovered over the petition link, my pen over the ticket, torn between the expectations of my uniform and the demands of my conscience."}
