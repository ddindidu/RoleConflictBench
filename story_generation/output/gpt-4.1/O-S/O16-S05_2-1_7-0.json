As her doctor, I knew her autoimmune disease demanded a strict, ongoing treatment plan\u2014one that required careful monitoring and precise medication. She looked at me with anxious eyes, asking about the insurance forms and whether her employer could legally reduce her hours due to her illness. As an advocate, I felt the pull to give her clear, accurate legal advice, to explain her rights and the protections she might have under the law. But I was also her physician, and my primary responsibility was her health. I worried that if I gave her legal advice, I might overstep my boundaries as a doctor, or worse, give incomplete information that could harm her case. Yet, if I stayed silent, I\u2019d be failing her as an advocate, leaving her vulnerable and confused. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to say next."}
