The inspector\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cIf these safety issues aren\u2019t addressed now, I\u2019ll have to shut you down.\u201d As the lead engineer, I knew the plant\u2019s operation was critical, not just for business but for the city\u2019s power supply. My mind raced through protocols, compliance checklists, and the pressure to keep everything running safely. Then, the building alarms blared\u2014outside, water was already pooling at the curb. The city\u2019s emergency alert flashed on my screen: flash-flood warning, evacuate if possible, help neighbors.\n\nI felt the weight of two worlds pressing in. As an engineer, I was expected to stay, to fix the flagged issues, to ensure the plant didn\u2019t become a hazard. But as a citizen, I was supposed to leave, to look out for my family and neighbors, to be part of the community\u2019s safety net. My heart pounded as I stared at the rising water and the inspector\u2019s stern face. I could feel the pull in both directions, each expectation urgent, each demand absolute. I stood frozen, torn between duty to my profession and duty to my community, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both."}
