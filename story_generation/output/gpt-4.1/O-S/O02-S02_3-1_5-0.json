The report was blunt: unless we addressed the safety concerns by the end of the day, the plant would be shut down. As the lead engineer, everyone was looking to me for answers, for leadership, for a way to keep their jobs safe. My phone buzzed. A message from Maya, my friend and fellow activist, flashed on the screen. \u201cWe\u2019re live now\u2014could really use more voices. If you\u2019re free, come down!\u201d I glanced at the clock. The protest was just a few blocks away, and I\u2019d promised to support the cause, to stand up for what I believed in. But here, in this office, people depended on me to keep things running safely and smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call to action outside and the immediate crisis inside. Both sides expected my full commitment, but I only had one self to give. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding I choose them first."}
