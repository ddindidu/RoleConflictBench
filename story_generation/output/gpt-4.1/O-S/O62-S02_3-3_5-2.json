A quick check confirmed my suspicion\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if I didn\u2019t act fast, swimmers could be at risk. I needed to shut down the pool and call for repairs, but my phone buzzed urgently. The protest I\u2019d helped organize was suddenly in chaos; police had started blocking the exits, and my friends were counting on me to help coordinate a safe, calm response. My mind raced. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety here, making sure the equipment was working and the pool was secure. But as an activist, I was expected to be present, to lead, to protect my community in a tense moment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention, each with real consequences if I failed. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between two urgent calls for help."}
