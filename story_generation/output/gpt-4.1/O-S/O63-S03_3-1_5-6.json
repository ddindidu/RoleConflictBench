It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I know I should be dialing, pushing through the script, convincing strangers to buy. But my thoughts keep drifting to the community center down the street, where volunteers are setting up for the free vaccine clinic. I promised my neighbor I\u2019d help, and I know how important it is\u2014especially now, when public health feels so fragile. My tax documents are already sorted, but this is different. I want to be the kind of citizen who shows up, who does their part. Yet, if I leave my desk, I risk letting my team down, maybe even costing them money they\u2019re counting on. My stomach twists as I stare at the clock, torn between the ringing phone and the call to serve my community, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
