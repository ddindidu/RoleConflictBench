Normally, I\u2019d be relieved. But today was voting day, and the polling station closed at 6:00 p.m. I still had to run a quick errand before heading over, and the station was a good twenty minutes away. \n\nAs a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my scheduled breaks, but with the light call volume, the rules were relaxed. Still, I felt uneasy about leaving my desk early, even with permission. My team counted on me to be available, and I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was taking advantage. But as a voter, I knew I had a civic duty to show up before the polls closed. The pressure built inside me\u2014should I take my break now and risk disappointing my team, or wait and risk missing my chance to vote? My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my job and my responsibility as a citizen."}
