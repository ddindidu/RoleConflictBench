As a software developer, I was expected to join the upcoming brainstorming session with the product team. It was marked as \u201coptional,\u201d but I knew from experience that my absence would be noticed. My input on new features was valued, and skipping the session could mean missing out on shaping the product\u2019s direction. At the same time, my role as an advocate weighed heavily on me. One of my clients had just sent a frantic email\u2014her case was growing more complex by the hour, and she needed detailed, accurate legal advice. She was counting on me to guide her through the maze of regulations and options. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: the team\u2019s unspoken expectation that I\u2019d be present and engaged, and my client\u2019s urgent need for clarity. My mind raced, torn between the collaborative energy of the brainstorming session and the responsibility I felt toward my client. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
