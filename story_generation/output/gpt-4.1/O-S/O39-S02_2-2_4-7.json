My supervisor always says safety comes first, and I know how quickly someone could slip and get hurt. I reached for the mop, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I was due on the radio in five minutes to talk about workers\u2019 rights. I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, and the community was counting on me to speak up. My heart pounded. If I left the spill, someone could get injured, and I\u2019d be failing my crew. But if I missed the radio slot, I\u2019d let down everyone who believed in our cause. I stared at the spill, mop in hand, torn between the urgent needs of the site and the voices waiting to be heard on air."}
