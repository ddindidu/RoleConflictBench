A major route closure had just been announced, and now dozens of flights were circling, waiting for my instructions. The pressure was immense\u2014every decision I made could mean the difference between order and chaos in the crowded airspace. My headset felt heavier than usual, pressing against my temples as I tried to keep my voice steady for the pilots depending on me.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, another responsibility gnawed at me. Today was election day, and I had promised myself I would vote. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was supposed to be light, but now, with the sudden crisis, I couldn\u2019t see how I\u2019d get away.
