A woman hovered at the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. As a hairdresser, I knew my job: greet her warmly, offer her a seat, make her feel at ease. I smiled and started toward her, rehearsing my friendly introduction. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t shake the worry gnawing at me. Tonight, my friends and I had planned a music session in the break room\u2014something we\u2019d all been looking forward to after a long week. But the building\u2019s quiet hours started at eight, and my neighbor, who lived just above the salon, always left her windows open in the evenings. As a citizen, I was expected to respect the law and my neighbor\u2019s right to peace and quiet. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me: the client\u2019s anxious face, the anticipation of my friends, the rules I was supposed to follow. I felt my smile falter for a split second as I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations tonight."}
