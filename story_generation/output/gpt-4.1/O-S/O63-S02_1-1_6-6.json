As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to stick to the schedule, but today the call volume is unusually light, and my supervisor just told us we could take our breaks whenever we wanted. My phone buzzes with notifications. The activist group I\u2019m part of just had a post go viral, and people are flooding the comments with questions. This is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for, the perfect chance to educate the public and maybe even change some minds. But if I take my break now, I\u2019ll be off the phones earlier than planned, and I know my team relies on me to keep things running smoothly. I stare at the blinking cursor in the comment box, my fingers itching to type out a thoughtful response. My headset feels heavy, and I can almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding me about fairness and teamwork. I want to do right by both sides, but the expectations are pulling me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t ignore the knot of anxiety tightening in my chest."}
