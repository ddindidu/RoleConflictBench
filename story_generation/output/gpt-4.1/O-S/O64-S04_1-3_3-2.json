But as I started to close out my drawer, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for before leaving. My manager always reminded us, \u201cNo shortcuts, no exceptions.\u201d I could already hear her voice in my head, warning me about the consequences of ignoring procedure.\n\nBut the polling station was only a few blocks away, and if I left now, I could just make it. My civic duty tugged at me\u2014voting was important, and I\u2019d waited weeks for this day. Yet, the responsibility of my job weighed just as heavily. If I left the discrepancy unresolved, I\u2019d be breaking store policy and risking my job.
