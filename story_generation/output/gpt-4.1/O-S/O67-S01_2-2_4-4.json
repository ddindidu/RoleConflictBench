As the driver, I was expected to move quickly, assess the patient, and provide initial care. Inside, I found Mrs. Patel, cradling her arm, her face pale with pain. I knelt beside her, offering calm words and gentle support as I stabilized her arm and prepared her for transport. \n\nBut just as I finished, a volunteer coordinator waved me over to the check-in table in the lobby. A new client, eyes downcast, was filling out forms. As a volunteer, I was trained to listen and respect privacy. The client leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal concern about their living situation. I could see the pain in their eyes, the need for reassurance and confidentiality.\n\nMy radio crackled\u2014dispatch needed an update on Mrs. Patel. I felt torn, caught between my duty to provide immediate medical care and my responsibility to honor the trust of someone seeking help. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I could only be in one place at a time. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
