The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids rushed in, all nerves and chatter, glancing at their watches. I smiled, welcoming them, trying to project calm and warmth, even as I felt their anxiety seep into the room. I knew how important this day was for them, and I wanted to make them feel at ease, to give them the perfect start to their wedding.\n\nBut as I reached for my scissors, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder: the minor court hearing for my advocacy client was starting soon. The case wasn\u2019t high stakes, but my client was counting on me to be there, to speak up for them, to show that their concerns mattered. I could picture their face, waiting for me in that sterile courtroom, hoping I\u2019d show up.\n\nI felt my heart race, torn between the expectant eyes of the bridal party and the silent plea of my legal client. Both needed me, both deserved my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, scissors in hand, caught between two worlds."}
