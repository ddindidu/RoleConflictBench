She always expects a warm welcome, a cup of tea, and a few minutes of friendly chatter before her appointment. The receptionist was at the desk, but Mrs. Patel looked straight at me, her eyes lighting up in anticipation. I could see she wanted that personal touch, the comfort she\u2019s come to expect from me. But as I reached for the kettle, my mind flashed to the voting booth across town. Today was election day, and I\u2019d just realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I had a backup, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. I could fetch the right card later, but the thought gnawed at me\u2014what if I got too busy and missed my chance? I felt torn, the weight of Mrs. Patel\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and my civic duty, with its own set of rules and requirements, pulling on the other. My hands hesitated over the teacups, my mind racing between the salon and the polling station, caught in the tug-of-war between being the hairdresser everyone counted on and the responsible voter I wanted to be."}
