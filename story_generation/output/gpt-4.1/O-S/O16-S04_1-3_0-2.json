The polling station will close in ten minutes, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote today\u2014my civic duty, my voice. But here I am, white coat on, stethoscope around my neck, sitting across from a patient who\u2019s come in for a routine check-up. She\u2019s coughing, her nose red, and she looks at me with tired, hopeful eyes. The symptoms seem like a common cold, but what if I miss something more serious? My role as a doctor demands thoroughness, accuracy, and care. I can\u2019t rush this, not if her health is at stake. Yet, the weight of my other responsibility presses on me. If I leave now, I might make it to the polling station in time. If I stay, I risk losing my chance to vote. Both roles matter deeply to me, and the expectations feel like a tug-of-war inside my chest. I take a deep breath, torn between the patient in front of me and the ballot waiting across town, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both perfectly."}
