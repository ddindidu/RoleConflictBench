The family waits just outside, their faces drawn with worry. As a doctor, I know I must be clear and compassionate when I tell them the diagnosis\u2014news that will change their lives. I rehearse the words in my mind, searching for the right balance of honesty and empathy. My phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder that the online candidate forum for my district is starting. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to stay informed, to listen, to participate in the decisions shaping our community. I promised myself I\u2019d watch, maybe even submit a question about healthcare policy. But the family is waiting, and their need feels immediate and personal. My heart pounds as I weigh my duty to them against my duty to my community. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demand my full attention. I take a deep breath, torn between the expectations placed upon me, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
