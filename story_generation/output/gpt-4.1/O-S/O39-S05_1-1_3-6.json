Make sure your area\u2019s clean before you go.\u201d My boots crunched over scattered nails and sawdust, and I knew the safety inspector would be by in the morning. As a construction laborer, I was expected to leave the site spotless\u2014no shortcuts, no excuses. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating with a reminder: \u201cAdvocacy meeting in 20 minutes.\u201d As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. Missing a meeting meant letting down clients who counted on me to speak for them, to show up when it mattered.\n\nI glanced at the mess around me, then at the time. If I stayed to clean properly, I\u2019d be late for the meeting. If I left now, the site would be unsafe, and I\u2019d be shirking my responsibility to my crew. My stomach twisted with anxiety. Both roles demanded my full attention, both had people depending on me, and I couldn\u2019t see a way to meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once. I stood frozen, broom in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
