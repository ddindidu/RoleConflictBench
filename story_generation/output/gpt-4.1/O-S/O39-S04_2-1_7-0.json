It\u2019s non-negotiable; missing it means risking a write-up or worse, letting the crew down. But today is election day, and the polling station is just a few blocks away, open now and quiet before the rush. I promised myself I\u2019d vote early, do my part, not let apathy win. My boots are caked with mud, my hard hat already on, but my mind is split. If I slip away now, I\u2019ll miss the briefing and maybe jeopardize my job. If I stay, I might get caught up in work and forget to vote, or run out of time. The team expects me to be reliable, present, part of the unit. My conscience expects me to show up as a citizen. My heart pounds as I stand at the edge of the site, torn between the whistle\u2019s call and the quiet duty waiting down the street."}
