The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor just told us we could take our breaks a bit flexibly. My phone buzzes with a reminder: I\u2019m supposed to be on a live radio show in five minutes, talking about the environmental campaign I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The station producer is counting on me to educate listeners, and I know how important this exposure is for our cause. But technically, I\u2019m still on the clock as a telemarketer, and I\u2019m expected to stick to my break schedule unless it\u2019s an emergency. My headset feels heavier than usual as I weigh my options. If I step away now, I risk bending the rules at work, even if the supervisors seem relaxed today. If I wait, I\u2019ll miss the radio segment and let down my fellow activists. My stomach knots as I hover over the \u201clog out\u201d button, torn between my commitment to my job and my responsibility to my cause."}
