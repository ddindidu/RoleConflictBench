The foreman\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, reminding everyone that the safety briefing starts in two minutes. I know the drill\u2014show up, listen, sign off. It\u2019s non-negotiable, and the crew depends on everyone being there, no exceptions. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, and I see the reminder: the court session starts in fifteen minutes across town. As an advocate, my client\u2019s future hangs in the balance, and my absence could tip the scales against them. My boots are caked with mud, my hard hat still on, but my mind is already in the courtroom, rehearsing arguments. The team expects me to be present, focused, and reliable. My client expects me to fight for them, to show up when it matters most.
