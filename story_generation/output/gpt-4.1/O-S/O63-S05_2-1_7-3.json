My headset itched against my ear, and the phone queue blinked red\u2014calls waiting, management watching. I knew if I took my break now, as I was supposed to, my supervisor would see another gap in the log, another mark against me. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the minor hearing for my client was about to start. As their advocate, I was expected to be present, to speak for them, even if the stakes were low. My client trusted me to show up, to care. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding I stay glued to my seat, the other pulling me toward the courthouse, toward my client. My heart pounded as I imagined the disappointment in my supervisor\u2019s eyes, the letdown in my client\u2019s voice. I sat frozen, headset in hand, torn between the demands of two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
