My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDouble-check everything\u2014mistakes at closing can cost us.\u201d I focused on the numbers, counting bills and receipts, but my mind wandered to the community center where I volunteered. Just yesterday, I\u2019d chatted with a regular, Maria, who\u2019d mentioned her new job. Now, as I rang up a customer, I realized it was Maria\u2019s cousin, who asked, \u201cDid Maria seem happy with her new job?\u201d It felt harmless, just small talk, but I remembered the volunteer coordinator\u2019s reminder: \u201cRespect everyone\u2019s privacy, even in casual conversation.\u201d My hands hesitated over the register keys. I could answer and be friendly, or I could keep Maria\u2019s confidence, but the customer was waiting, and the line was growing. The pressure to be efficient as a cashier clashed with my duty as a volunteer to protect privacy. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, caught between the need for accuracy and the responsibility of trust."}
