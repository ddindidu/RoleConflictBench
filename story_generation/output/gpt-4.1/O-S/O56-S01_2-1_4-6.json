She was a first-time visitor, and I could see her lips press into a thin line as she studied her reflection. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I asked, my heart thumping. She hesitated, then admitted the colour was a bit warmer than she\u2019d hoped. I felt the familiar pressure to make things right\u2014client satisfaction was everything in this job. I wanted to sit with her, talk through options, maybe offer a quick toner.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. The volunteer coordinator\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I remembered her email from this morning: if I had time after my shift, could I reorganize the supply closet at the shelter? She\u2019d suggested a new system, and I knew she counted on me to follow through. I could picture the cluttered shelves, the other volunteers waiting for someone to take the lead.\n\nI stood there, caught between the disappointed client in my chair and the responsibility waiting for me at the shelter. Both needed me, both expected me to do my best. My mind raced, torn between staying to fix the colour and leaving to help the team."}
