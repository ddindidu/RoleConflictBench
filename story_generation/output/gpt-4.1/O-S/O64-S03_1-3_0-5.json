The ballot measure today could change the way our block handles parking, and I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who shows up. But it\u2019s a slow afternoon, and my manager asked me to cover for a coworker who called in sick. Only a few customers trickle in, but each one expects me to scan their groceries with care, double-check prices, and make small talk. I know the store relies on me to keep things running smoothly, especially when we\u2019re short-staffed. Still, my mind keeps drifting to the polling place just a few blocks away. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to my job, to accuracy and reliability, and my responsibility as a citizen, to participate and make my voice heard. My hands move automatically over the register, but inside, I\u2019m torn, wrestling with the urge to ask for a break and the guilt of leaving my post. The line grows a little, and I wonder if I can do both, or if I\u2019ll have to let someone down."}
