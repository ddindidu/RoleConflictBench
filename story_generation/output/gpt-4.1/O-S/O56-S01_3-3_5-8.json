She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, silently urging me to handle it with grace and professionalism. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the volunteer coordinator. I glanced at it quickly: an urgent directive, mandatory procedures that had to be followed tonight or the service would be shut down. My heart pounded. I was expected to stay and resolve the client\u2019s concerns, to not leave until she was satisfied. But the volunteer role demanded immediate action, strict adherence to the coordinator\u2019s instructions. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. My hands trembled as I tried to reassure the client, my mind racing with the knowledge that every second I spent here was a second lost for the volunteer work that mattered so much. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
