As a lawyer, I was expected to represent my client fiercely in the upcoming court hearing\u2014a contested motion that could make or break their case. My client depended on me to be their champion, to argue persuasively and protect their interests at all costs. Yet, as their advocate, I was also expected to provide clear, honest legal advice, even if it meant telling them hard truths. Just yesterday, during a casual consultation, I explained the risks and weaknesses in their position, watching their confidence waver. Now, I felt torn. Should I focus on reassuring them and fighting with every tool at my disposal, or should I emphasize the reality of their situation, risking their trust in my abilities? The expectations of both roles clashed within me, leaving me restless and uncertain as the hearing approached."}
