As a judge, I\u2019m expected to review every detail, even for cases that seem routine. The court expects diligence, and I pride myself on never letting anything slip through the cracks. But tonight, I\u2019m not just Judge Patel\u2014I\u2019m also a volunteer at the community center, helping people fill out forms for housing assistance. \n\nAs I guided a woman through the paperwork, she leaned in and whispered a private concern about her landlord\u2014something she didn\u2019t want anyone else to know. I nodded, reassuring her that her words would stay between us. But as she spoke, a chill ran through me. Her landlord\u2019s name matched the respondent in the file waiting on my desk. \n\nMy mind raced. The court expects me to be impartial, to know nothing outside the case file. But as a volunteer, I\u2019m bound to protect her confidentiality. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
