His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a taxi driver, I knew he expected me to get him there safely and on time, weaving through traffic without risking our lives. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the trial for my client was starting in less than an hour. As an advocate, I was expected to be present, prepared, and focused\u2014my client\u2019s future depended on my performance in court today. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding. If I rushed, I could get my passenger to the station, but I might be late for court, letting down someone who trusted me with everything.
