No one answered the doorbell, so I snapped a photo of the box on the porch, making sure it was tucked behind a flowerpot\u2014secure, as my supervisor always reminded me. As I turned to leave, I patted my pocket and realized my wallet was missing. Panic prickled at my skin. My ID was in there, and I needed it to vote later today. I remembered the polling station was open until evening, and I could fetch a spare card from home if needed, but the thought of leaving packages unattended or delaying my route gnawed at me. My job demanded I stay on schedule and ensure every delivery was safe, but my civic duty pressed on my mind too. I stood on the porch, torn between retracing my steps to find my wallet and pushing through my deliveries, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pulling me in opposite directions."}
