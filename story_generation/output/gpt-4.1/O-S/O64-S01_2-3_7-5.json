As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to greet every customer with a smile, keep the line moving, and make small talk to brighten their day. I notice Mrs. Carter, a regular, waiting with her basket. She\u2019s always chatty, and today she mentions her recent health scare. I nod sympathetically, but my mind flashes back to the morning, when I was volunteering at the community clinic. There, I sorted confidential medical files\u2014one of which belonged to Mrs. Carter. I know more about her condition than she realizes, but I\u2019m sworn to secrecy. Now, as she asks if I\u2019ve heard about her situation, I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The customers behind her are growing impatient, expecting quick, friendly service, while my volunteer training demands absolute discretion. My heart pounds as I try to balance being supportive without revealing what I know, caught between the expectations of warmth and confidentiality."}
