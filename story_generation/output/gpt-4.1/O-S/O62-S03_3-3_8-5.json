Suddenly, I spotted a small child flailing in the deep end\u2014an area clearly marked off-limits for non-swimmers. My training kicked in: I had to enforce the rules and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But as I prepared to intervene, my phone buzzed with a reminder. The polling place down the street would close in two hours, and today\u2019s ballot included a measure that could change parking regulations on my block. I\u2019d promised my neighbors I\u2019d vote, and I believed in participating in decisions that shaped our community. My supervisor expected me to stay vigilant and enforce every rule, but as a citizen, I felt the weight of my civic duty. My heart pounded as I glanced between the struggling child and the clock, torn between the immediate responsibility to protect and the long-term responsibility to participate."}
