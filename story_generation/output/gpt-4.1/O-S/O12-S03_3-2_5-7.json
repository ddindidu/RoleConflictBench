The launch date had been moved up, and now everyone was blocked until I could help define the new features. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions ASAP.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing the whole project was at a standstill because of me.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a local alert: a heat advisory for the day. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. She didn\u2019t have air conditioning, and last summer she\u2019d fainted during a similar heatwave. As a citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her get to a cooling center.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. If I left my desk, I\u2019d delay the whole team. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring someone who might need urgent help. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014my team\u2019s reliance on me, and my responsibility to my community. I sat frozen, torn between two roles, unable to move."}
