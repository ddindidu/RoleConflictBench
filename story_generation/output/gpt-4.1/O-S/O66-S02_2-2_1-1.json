My train leaves soon,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with urgency. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, to be reliable for people who counted on me. But my phone buzzed with a message from my fellow activists: \u201cWe\u2019re starting the march now. We need you at the front.\u201d I was supposed to lead the first chant, to stand with my friends and raise our voices for justice. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of delivering my passenger versus the commitment I\u2019d made to the cause. Both roles demanded my presence, both expected me to put them first. I felt torn, the city\u2019s traffic lights blinking ahead like questions I couldn\u2019t answer, my mind racing as fast as the meter."}
