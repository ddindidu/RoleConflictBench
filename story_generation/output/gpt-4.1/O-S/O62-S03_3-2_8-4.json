As a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate\u2014my district\u2019s future felt personal, and I\u2019d even prepared questions to ask the candidates. But just as I was about to sneak a glance at the live stream, I noticed a small figure flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits for kids. My training kicked in: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. But my mind raced\u2014if I missed the forum, I\u2019d lose my chance to hold our leaders accountable, to be the engaged citizen I aspired to be.
