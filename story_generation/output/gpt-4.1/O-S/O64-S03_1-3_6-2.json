I smiled at the next customer, greeting them warmly as I rang up their groceries, just as I\u2019d been trained. Friendly service, always. Later, on my way home, I found myself in the middle of a street demonstration. The crowd\u2019s energy was electric, voices raised for a cause I believed in. Suddenly, someone beside me nudged my arm and whispered, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s step past the barricade. We need to make them listen.\u201d I looked at the metal barrier, the police officers watching us closely. As a cashier, I was used to following rules, keeping things orderly, and treating everyone with respect. But as a citizen, I felt the pull to stand up for what was right, to join others in demanding change. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the law-abiding, respectful person I was at work, and the passionate citizen I wanted to be here. I hesitated, caught between the urge to act and the need to obey."}
