The new staff from the client\u2019s factory were clustered around the old mixer, fumbling with the controls. I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t been briefed on the safety protocols, and the batch they were about to run was hazardous. My job was clear: I had to guide them, make sure no one got hurt, and ensure the machine was used properly. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014today was my only window to swing by home and grab my ID, the one thing I needed to vote. The polls would be open tomorrow, but I\u2019d be out of town for a service call. If I missed this chance, I\u2019d lose my voice in the election. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me: the expectation to keep these workers safe, and the civic duty to participate in the vote. My heart pounded as I stood between the factory floor and the exit, torn by the demands of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both at once."}
