My training kicked in: I had to report the issue and bring the train to a halt immediately, for the safety of everyone on board. My heart pounded as I reached for the radio, but then my phone buzzed with a new email notification. It was from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter, where I\u2019d promised to help after my shift. She\u2019d sent a suggestion: if I had time, could I reorganize the supply room according to her new plan? She trusted me to handle it, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014passengers\u2019 safety in my hands, and the coordinator\u2019s faith in my reliability. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be falling short of someone\u2019s expectations. My fingers hovered over the controls, my mind racing between duty and commitment, as the train sped through the tunnel."}
