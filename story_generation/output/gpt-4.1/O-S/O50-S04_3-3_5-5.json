I knew what that sound meant\u2014if I didn\u2019t get it fixed now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours of production and risking my reputation as the go-to repairer. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime today. Stay sharp.\u201d I reached for my toolkit, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPolls close at 8 PM. Don\u2019t forget your ID.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014barely enough time to make it across town, and I\u2019d have to dig my ID out of my locker, all the way at the other end of the plant. My chest tightened. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, that I wouldn\u2019t let work swallow up my civic duty. But the machine\u2019s wail grew louder, and I could almost feel the eyes of my coworkers and boss on me, expecting me to save the day. I stood frozen, torn between the screeching metal and the weight of my own promise."}
