The beach was packed, high tide swelling the surf, and I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could spell disaster. My lifeguard training drilled into me: never look away, never let your guard down. But then, my phone buzzed\u2014my client, desperate for advice, was waiting for a quick call. As an advocate, I owed them clarity, reassurance, and careful guidance, even in these casual consultations. I could hear the anxiety in their voice, the expectation that I\u2019d be present and thorough, not distracted or rushed. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, guilt gnawing at me. If I focused on the call, I might miss a swimmer in distress. If I ignored my client, I\u2019d fail them in a different way. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of mistakes. I stood there, torn, the phone in my hand and the ocean before me, caught between two worlds that refused to wait."}
