I\u2019ve been with your company for years, but this sounds fishy.\u201d My script told me to reassure her, to answer every question with patience and clarity, but my eyes kept darting to the clock. The polling station would close in ten minutes, and if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote. My supervisor expected me to handle every call professionally, never rushing, never cutting corners. But as Mrs. Carter demanded more details, my mind raced with the weight of my civic duty. I could almost see the polling station doors swinging shut, locking me out.
