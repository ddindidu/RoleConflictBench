As a lifeguard, my duty was clear: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and act fast. I was already moving, adrenaline surging, when the building\u2019s flood alarms blared. Through the glass, I saw water surging down the street, rising fast, threatening homes and businesses. As a citizen, I knew my responsibility extended beyond the pool\u2014helping neighbors, following emergency protocols, maybe even evacuating or assisting others outside. My mind raced, torn between the immediate danger in the water and the growing crisis outside. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own set of expectations. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, caught between the desperate cries from the pool and the wailing sirens outside, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
