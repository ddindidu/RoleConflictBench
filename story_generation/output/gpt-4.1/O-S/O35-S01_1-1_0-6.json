My checklist for the pre-departure inspection was in my hand, and I knew I had to make sure everything was in order before the first passengers boarded. The non-critical systems\u2014air conditioning, intercom, lights\u2014weren\u2019t urgent, but the rules were clear: check them before every run. As I started the routine, my phone buzzed with a new email. It was from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter, where I\u2019d spent last night sorting donations. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supplies, asking us to try it out if we had a spare moment. I could picture the cluttered storeroom and her hopeful face, trusting me to help. But now, with the train\u2019s schedule pressing and the checklist in front of me, I felt torn. The subway demanded my focus and punctuality; the shelter needed my initiative and flexibility. My hands hesitated over the controls, my mind pulled between the tracks and the storeroom, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
