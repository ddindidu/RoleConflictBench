As a scientist, I know I should be prepping for the experiment I\u2019ve planned for weeks. The equipment is ready, and the data could be crucial for my research. But I also know the experiment can wait; there are other slots available, and nothing will be lost if I postpone. \n\nThen my phone vibrates again\u2014a message from Maya, a fellow activist, live-streaming from a protest downtown. \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d I feel the familiar tug in my chest. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to show up, to stand in solidarity, to help amplify our cause. I know my presence could make a difference, even if the crowd is small. \n\nI glance at the lab bench, then at the screen showing Maya\u2019s anxious face. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my time, my energy, my loyalty. I close my eyes, caught between the quiet order of the lab and the urgent call of the street, unsure which part of myself to answer."}
