My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles white, as the ambulance skidded slightly on a curve. In the back, the paramedic\u2019s voice was tense, relaying the patient\u2019s dropping vitals. Every instinct screamed at me to push the speed, to get to the hospital before it was too late. But the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing, and I knew one wrong move could send us spinning. \n\nMy phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a reminder for the advocacy meeting I was supposed to attend in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d already missed two this month, and the coordinator had warned me: punctuality was non-negotiable. My presence was needed to speak for a client whose case depended on my testimony. I could picture the judge\u2019s stern face, the client\u2019s anxious eyes. \n\nCaught between the life in my care and the life waiting for my voice, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
