As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to smile, to be the calm in the holiday storm, even as the woman in front of me slams her groceries on the belt and snaps about the wait. I force a gentle tone, apologizing, scanning as quickly as I can, but my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from a client. As their advocate, I know they\u2019re waiting for urgent legal advice, something that can\u2019t wait, not with the deadline looming. My mind races: I owe them clarity, precision, and my undivided attention. But here, I\u2019m tethered to the register, to the expectation that I\u2019ll be present, patient, and unflappable. My heart pounds as I juggle the demands\u2014one role asking for warmth and composure, the other for focus and expertise. I feel the weight of both, the impossibility of being fully present for either, and I\u2019m caught in the moment, torn between the needs of the person in front of me and the one reaching out for help."}
