I answered, putting on my best professional tone. \u201cHello, this is your delivery driver. I\u2019m so sorry, but there\u2019s been a delay with your package\u2014\u201d The customer\u2019s frustration was immediate, and I tried to reassure them, even as my other phone vibrated urgently in my pocket. I glanced at the screen: messages from my activist group, panic in every word. The police had started blocking the exits at our protest downtown, and I was supposed to help coordinate a safe response, making sure everyone stayed calm and found a way out. My heart pounded. The customer demanded answers, expecting patience and professionalism. My friends at the protest needed me to act fast, to be decisive and brave. I felt split in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I failed. I stood there, torn, the world waiting for me to choose."}
