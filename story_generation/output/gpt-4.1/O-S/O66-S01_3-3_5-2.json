I pictured the line of people already waiting outside, some of them elderly, some with children, all depending on me to let them in and start the morning service. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t be late!\u201d I pressed the gas a little harder, hoping to make up for lost time. \n\nSuddenly, I hit a construction detour. Orange cones funneled traffic into a single lane, right as I approached a school zone. Children clustered near the curb, some darting unpredictably. The speed limit dropped, and a crossing guard raised a hand, signaling me to slow down. My heart pounded. If I followed the rules and drove carefully, I\u2019d be late, letting down everyone at the center. But if I rushed, I\u2019d be risking the safety of these kids and breaking the law. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I gripped the wheel, torn between duty and responsibility, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
