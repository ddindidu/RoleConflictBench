My manager\u2019s email was clear: the stakeholders needed a working demo by tomorrow, or the project might lose funding. Every minute counted. But my phone buzzed with a notification from the activist group I\u2019d joined\u2014an urgent reminder that the online petition to ban harmful e-waste exports was closing in ten minutes. If I didn\u2019t add my signature now, I\u2019d miss the chance to stand with my peers and make our voices heard by the lawmaker reviewing the bill. My mind raced. As an engineer, I was expected to deliver solutions, to focus, to meet deadlines. As an activist, I was supposed to seize these moments, to act when it mattered most. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between finishing the code and opening the petition link, my heart pounding as the seconds slipped away."}
