As the lead architect, I was expected to keep everything running smoothly, but I\u2019d gotten used to reviewing timelines with a casual eye, trusting my team to handle the details. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an unknown number. I almost ignored it, but something made me answer. It was a legislative aide, the one I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks about the green building bill. She said she had ten minutes to talk, right now. My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for as an activist, the chance to push for real change. But my project manager was still talking, waiting for my input on a critical decision. I could see the expectation in her eyes: be present, be efficient, keep the project on track. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full attention to both at once."}
