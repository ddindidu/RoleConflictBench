My headset itched against my ear as I wrapped up a call, eyes darting to the compliance system\u2019s red warning: \u201cUnscheduled downtime will be flagged.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014every minute accounted for, every break pre-approved. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due in court for a minor hearing, representing a client who couldn\u2019t afford to lose even a small case. As an advocate, I owed them my full attention, even if the stakes were low. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014if I logged off now, the system would flag me, and I risked disciplinary action. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my client down, failing in my duty to represent them. The pressure built in my chest, torn between the rigid structure of my telemarketing job and the unpredictable needs of my client. I stared at the clock, seconds ticking away, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each demanding more than I could give."}
