The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch any loopholes or hidden risks. Every clause demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my calendar was unusually light, but the thought of leaving my desk\u2014even for an hour\u2014filled me with anxiety. As a citizen, I believed in the importance of voting, of making my voice heard. But as a lawyer, I knew missing a single detail in this contract could have serious consequences for my client. My mind raced, torn between civic duty and professional obligation, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, unable to shake the feeling that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
