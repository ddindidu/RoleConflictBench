My job as a lifeguard was clear: keep everyone safe, enforce the rules, and never let my attention waver. But today, my mind was split. I had just received a call from the election station across the street\u2014my registration had a mismatch, and if I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot before the station closed in ten minutes. The official was firm: no exceptions, no extensions. I glanced back at the pool, where a group of kids had started drifting into the shallow end without supervision, giggling and splashing. I knew the rules\u2014no one in the water without a lifeguard watching. But the clock was ticking, and the right to vote was something I valued deeply. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
