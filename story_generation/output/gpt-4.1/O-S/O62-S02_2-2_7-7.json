The bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs were right in front of them, but they ignored them, their excitement growing louder. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, to keep everyone safe, no exceptions. My supervisor had made it clear: zero tolerance for unsafe behavior.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I was due on a live radio show in five minutes. As an activist, I\u2019d been working for months to get this opportunity, a chance to educate the community about our cause and inspire real change. The station was counting on me, and so were the people who believed in our movement.\n\nMy heart pounded as I glanced between the teenagers and my phone. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to reach hundreds of listeners. If I stayed, I might let down everyone who needed to hear my message. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between the urgent demands of safety and the promise of advocacy."}
