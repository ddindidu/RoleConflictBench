A woman hovered at the entrance, her hands twisting nervously. As a hairdresser, I knew my first job was to greet her warmly, to make her feel at ease in this unfamiliar space. I smiled, ready to welcome her, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the court hearing scheduled in less than an hour. As an advocate, my client was counting on me to be present, to argue her case with everything I had. Her future, her freedom, depended on my preparation and focus. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the expectation to be present and comforting here, and the demand to be sharp and unwavering in the courtroom. My heart pounded as I stood between the nervous client in the salon and the desperate client awaiting justice, torn by the impossibility of being fully present for both."}
