The beach was packed, high tide sending unpredictable waves crashing in, and I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to look away for even a second. My radio crackled, but it was my phone that buzzed urgently\u2014reminding me that the polling station would close in ten minutes. I\u2019d already been told by the election official that, due to a registration mismatch, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form in person before the deadline. The expectation was clear: follow every instruction, or lose my chance to vote. But as I glanced at the line of swimmers bobbing in the water, I felt the weight of my other duty\u2014never leave my post, not even briefly, especially now. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice: abandon my watch for a few minutes to fulfill my civic responsibility, or stay and risk losing my voice in the election. The demands of both roles pressed in, each urgent, each unforgiving, and I sat frozen, torn between them as the minutes ticked away."}
