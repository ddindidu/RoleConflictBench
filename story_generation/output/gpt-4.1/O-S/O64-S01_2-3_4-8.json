My training as a cashier was clear: no returns without a receipt. The store manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions, or we\u2019d risk disciplinary action. As I started to explain the policy, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator at the shelter where I help out after work. The text was urgent: \u201cAll volunteers must follow the new intake procedure tonight, or we risk being shut down. Please confirm you understand.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. I was expected to enforce the store\u2019s rules here, but I was also needed at the shelter, where following instructions was critical for everyone\u2019s safety. The woman\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my loyalty, each with consequences if I failed. I hesitated, torn between the policies I was supposed to uphold and the urgent call to serve elsewhere."}
