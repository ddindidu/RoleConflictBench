As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay current, to absorb every nuance of new legal theories. I\u2019ve been waiting for this issue, knowing it could shape my understanding and, ultimately, my rulings. Yet, as I reach for the journal, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polls close tonight. This is my only chance to vote, and I must bring my ID\u2014no exceptions. The courthouse is a maze of responsibilities, but the polling station is across town, and I haven\u2019t even found my ID yet. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I stay, I fulfill my duty to the law, but risk losing my voice as a citizen. If I go, I might miss the chance to deepen my expertise, possibly affecting my judgments. My mind races, torn between the expectations of impartial wisdom and civic participation, knowing I can\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
