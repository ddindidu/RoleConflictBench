I hesitated, thinking of the strict instructions I\u2019d read: sign only once, no alterations. As a voter, I wanted to follow every rule, to do my civic duty without error. But as a lawyer, my mind raced with the memory of last week\u2019s trial, when opposing counsel tried to coax privileged information from me, insisting it was just a minor detail. I\u2019d felt the weight of my oath then, the need to protect my client at all costs, even under pressure. Now, standing here, I felt the same tension\u2014two sets of rules, two authorities, both demanding my loyalty. If I re-signed, was I breaking the rules? If I refused, would my vote be tossed aside? My heart pounded as I stared at the envelope, caught between the lawyer\u2019s code of unwavering adherence to protocol and the voter\u2019s trust in the officials guiding me."}
