The survey about the new bus routes stared up at me, a reminder of my responsibility as a citizen to give feedback that could help shape our community. I\u2019d seen firsthand how public transport decisions affected people\u2019s lives\u2014especially those who relied on the bus to get to work or school. I wanted to make sure my voice was heard, to advocate for the routes that served the most vulnerable.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled to testify in court next week, right in the middle of the survey\u2019s open period. As a police officer, I knew how important it was to act with integrity and fairness, to provide honest testimony that could impact someone\u2019s future. The court expected my full attention and presence, and I couldn\u2019t risk being distracted or unprepared.\n\nI felt the tension building inside me. Both roles demanded my time and focus, but I only had so much to give. I stared at the survey, then at my court summons, torn between my duty to the law and my duty to my community."}
