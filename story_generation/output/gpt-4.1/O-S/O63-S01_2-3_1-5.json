My script only skimmed the surface, and I could feel my voice falter as I tried to improvise answers, knowing I wasn\u2019t supposed to go off-script. My supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly, but I was floundering, anxious about giving out incorrect or incomplete information.\n\nLater that afternoon, I hurried to the community center for my volunteer shift. I was assigned to sort confidential medical files\u2014names, diagnoses, treatments\u2014all private, all sensitive. The coordinator reminded us, \u201cRemember, nothing you see here leaves this room.\u201d As I sifted through the papers, I recognized a name from one of my calls earlier.
