As a cashier, I had to make sure every bill and coin matched the receipts, especially now, handling the day\u2019s largest transactions. Any mistake could mean hours of reconciliation or worse, suspicion from my manager. My hands shook slightly as I double-checked the numbers.\n\nBut as a citizen, I couldn\u2019t ignore the heat advisory blaring from my phone. Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone on the floor above. She struggled with her air conditioner and relied on others to check in during these dangerous heat waves. I knew she\u2019d be vulnerable today. The expectation to help, to be a good neighbor, pressed on me as heavily as the responsibility to close my register without error.\n\nI glanced at the clock, then at the stack of bills, feeling the weight of both roles. Should I rush through the count to check on Mrs. Lee, or stay and ensure every cent was accounted for? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
