The cab was spotless, just as the company expected\u2014no crumbs, no wrappers, not even a fingerprint on the glass. I prided myself on that, on being the kind of driver people trusted for a clean, professional ride. As the passenger settled in, my phone buzzed with a notification. The activist group I belonged to was about to send an urgent online petition to a lawmaker, and this was my last chance to add my name. My heart pounded. I knew how much my signature mattered, how every voice counted in pushing for the policy change we\u2019d been fighting for. But the rules were clear: no distractions, no phone use while driving. My passenger expected a safe, undisturbed ride. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding spotless service, the other demanding my voice. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between duty and conviction, as the light turned green."}
