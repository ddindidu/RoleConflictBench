As a software developer, I knew these sessions were where new features were born, and even though attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory, my team always expected me to contribute ideas and insights. I wanted to be there, to show I was invested in the project\u2019s future.\n\nBut tomorrow was also election day. As a voter, I felt a strong responsibility to show up at the polling station. The polls would be open all day, and my workload was light, so there was no real excuse to skip voting. Yet, the brainstorming session overlapped with the time I\u2019d planned to vote, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that missing either would mean letting someone down\u2014my team, or my own sense of civic duty.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the pull of my professional commitment and the weight of my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the tension build as I tried to figure out how to be present for both."}
