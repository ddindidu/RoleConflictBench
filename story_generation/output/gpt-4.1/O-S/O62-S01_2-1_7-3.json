As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. That\u2019s when I noticed a group of teenagers laughing and edging closer to the deep end, clearly ignoring the bold \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My training screamed at me to intervene, to call them out before someone got hurt. But then, as a volunteer, I\u2019d just been chatting with one of those teens about their summer plans, building trust, making them feel comfortable. I was supposed to respect their privacy, not embarrass them in front of their friends or make them feel singled out. My mind raced\u2014should I blow the whistle and risk shattering the rapport I\u2019d worked so hard to build, or stay quiet and hope they\u2019d listen to the rules on their own? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I hesitated, caught between duty and empathy."}
