It was a new client, her voice tentative as she asked for some basic tips on the machine I\u2019d just serviced last week. I could hear the uncertainty in her tone, and I knew how important it was to make her feel confident\u2014part of my job was to guide clients, not just fix their equipment. But my mind kept drifting to the envelope on my kitchen table: my only valid ID, which I needed to vote. Today was the only window I had to pick it up before the polls closed tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I stayed on the call, I\u2019d risk missing my chance to get home before the office closed. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down a client who needed me. My responsibilities pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
