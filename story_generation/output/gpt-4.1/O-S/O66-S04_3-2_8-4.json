My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked me through the app, asking if I was close. I could almost hear the impatience in their words. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable, getting people where they needed to go, fast and safe. But today, my mind was split. I had to swing by my apartment to grab my ID if I wanted to vote. It was the only window I had before my shift stretched into the night, and tomorrow\u2019s schedule looked just as tight. The polling station would be open, but without my ID, I\u2019d be turned away. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my passenger counting on me to show up, my civic duty demanding I be prepared. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the expectations, the minutes ticking by, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
