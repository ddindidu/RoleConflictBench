Tomorrow, I\u2019d start the biggest project of my career\u2014a custom library for the city\u2019s new community center. The plans were intricate, every measurement crucial. I needed to study every detail tonight, to be sure I\u2019d get it right. But as I traced the lines with my finger, my phone buzzed with a reminder: polls close at eight. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I\u2019d do my part for the community. Yet, after a long day of errands, I had only a couple of hours left. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s build. If I stayed, I might miss my chance to vote. The weight of responsibility pressed on me from both sides\u2014my duty as a craftsman, and my duty as a citizen. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my trade and the call to participate in something bigger than myself."}
