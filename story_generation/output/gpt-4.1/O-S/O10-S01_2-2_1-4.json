The end-of-month deadline loomed, and I still had three accounts to reconcile before the finance manager\u2019s review. Every number had to be perfect\u2014no room for error. My phone buzzed with a reminder: volunteer shift at the community center in fifteen minutes. I sighed, saved my work, and hurried out.\n\nAt the check-in table, I greeted clients, helping them fill out forms. An older woman hesitated, then leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. She confided a personal concern, something sensitive that explained why she needed extra help. I nodded, listening, but my mind raced. I knew I should keep her words confidential, but the forms required certain disclosures. At the same time, my accountant\u2019s brain nagged me about accuracy and transparency\u2014two values drilled into me at work.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the duty to protect her privacy as a volunteer and the ingrained habit of thorough record-keeping as an accountant. My hands trembled slightly as I held her form, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
