Two minutes until the safety briefing\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. The foreman had made it clear: everyone needed to be there, on time, ready to listen. As a construction laborer, I knew the importance of sticking to protocols and being a reliable part of the crew. But just as I was about to head out, my phone buzzed. It was a message from one of the people I volunteer with at the shelter, someone who rarely reached out. I answered, and our conversation drifted into personal territory\u2014not anything sensitive, but I could sense they needed to talk. I felt torn. The team was counting on me to be present and focused, but as a volunteer, I was expected to respect and support the people I helped, especially when they reached out. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, caught between the demands of the site and the quiet trust of someone in need."}
