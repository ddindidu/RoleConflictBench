As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, and today, a few pool chairs were out of line. They weren\u2019t dangerous, just a little messy, but I knew my supervisor liked everything perfect. I started straightening them, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in ten minutes across town. The coordinator had been clear\u2014no late arrivals, especially today with so few of us on the roster. My heart pounded as I looked from the chairs to the exit. If I left now, the pool area would look sloppy, and I\u2019d be letting down my lifeguard team. But if I stayed to fix everything, I\u2019d be late for my volunteer shift, disappointing the coordinator and the people counting on me. I stood frozen, torn between two sets of expectations, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
