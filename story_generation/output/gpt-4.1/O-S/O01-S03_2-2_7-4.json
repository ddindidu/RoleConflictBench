My phone buzzes with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district is starting. As a citizen, I\u2019ve always believed in staying informed, voting, and giving feedback. I promised myself I\u2019d watch, maybe even submit a question about the city\u2019s new zoning plans. But my laptop screen is filled with construction schedules, emails from contractors, and a blinking message from the site manager: \u201cWe need your decision on the material order tonight, or we\u2019ll lose a week.\u201d As the architect, I\u2019m expected to keep this project on track, to coordinate every detail so nothing slips. My team is counting on me to respond quickly, to avoid costly delays. Yet, as a citizen, I feel the weight of my responsibility to participate, to help shape the community I\u2019m building for. My heart pounds as I hover between the forum link and the contractor\u2019s urgent email, torn by the demands of both roles, knowing I can\u2019t give my full attention to both at once."}
