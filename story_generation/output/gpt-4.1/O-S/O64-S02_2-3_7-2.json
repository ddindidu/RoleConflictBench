I smile, scan items, and make small talk, trying to keep the mood light. My manager expects me to be quick and friendly, and I can see her watching from the end of the aisle. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014three urgent messages from my activist group. The police have started blocking the exits at the protest downtown, and people are scared. I\u2019m supposed to be helping coordinate a safe response, making sure everyone knows their rights and can get out safely. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to a customer, my mind split between the anxious faces in front of me and the friends who might be trapped. I know both sides are counting on me, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The next customer steps forward, and I force another smile, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me."}
