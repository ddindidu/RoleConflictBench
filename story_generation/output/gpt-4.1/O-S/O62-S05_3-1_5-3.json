As I walked along the edge, I noticed the water looked cloudy\u2014too cloudy. I checked the filtration system and realized it was malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t fix it right away, swimmers could be at risk. My heart pounded. I knew the maintenance manual by heart, but repairs would take time, and the pool was opening soon.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: I had to appear at a minor hearing in half an hour. As an advocate, I owed it to my client to be present, even if the case was low-stakes. They were counting on me to represent them, to show up and speak for them. But if I left now, the pool would open with a dangerous filtration system. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my client down.\n\nI stood there, torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. The pool doors rattled as the first swimmers arrived, and my phone buzzed again, demanding my presence in court. I took a deep breath, feeling the impossible pull of both roles, knowing I had to choose."}
