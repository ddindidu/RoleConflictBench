As a software developer, I was expected to collaborate with other teams, and next week\u2019s optional brainstorming session was a chance to help shape new features. Product had made it clear that fresh ideas were welcome, and I knew my input could make a difference. But the same afternoon, I was scheduled to volunteer at the community center, sorting files filled with sensitive medical histories. The coordinator had emphasized the importance of confidentiality\u2014no distractions, no phones, no chance of accidentally sharing information.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting. If I skipped the brainstorming, I might miss out on key discussions and let my team down. But if I rescheduled my volunteer shift, I\u2019d be leaving the center short-handed, and I\u2019d risk breaking the trust of people who counted on my discretion. My mind raced, weighing the expectations from both sides, feeling the stress of being pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
