I glanced at the screen\u2014my legal client, desperate for advice, the subject line screaming \u201cURGENT.\u201d Maria caught my distracted look and smiled, \u201cCould you just take a little more off the side?\u201d Her trust in me was clear; she expected me to focus, to make her feel cared for, to leave her looking her best. But my mind raced with the legal case: if I didn\u2019t respond now, my client might make a costly mistake. I could hear the expectation in their last message\u2014clarity, accuracy, immediate guidance. My scissors hovered, my heart pounding. I wanted to be present for Maria, to honor her loyalty, but the weight of my other client\u2019s crisis pressed on me. I felt split in two, each role demanding my full attention, each client relying on me for something only I could give."}
