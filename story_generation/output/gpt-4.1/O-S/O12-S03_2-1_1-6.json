But this new feature is tangled, and fixing it will take hours I hadn\u2019t planned for. I glance at the calendar. Saturday is the free vaccine clinic at the community center, and I promised to help organize the lines and answer questions. As a citizen, I want to do my part\u2014pay my taxes, follow the rules, and show up when my community needs me. My tax documents are already sorted, but this clinic is a one-time chance to make a difference. My manager pings me: \u201cCan you address the review comments by Monday?\u201d I feel the pressure mounting from both sides. My team needs me to deliver quality work, but my neighbors are counting on volunteers. I sit at my desk, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which responsibility I\u2019ll have to let down."}
