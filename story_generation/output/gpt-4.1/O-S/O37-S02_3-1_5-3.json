Mrs. Patel always insisted on that specific brand, and I knew she\u2019d be upset if I used anything else. I checked the supply closet twice, hoping I\u2019d missed a spare, but there was nothing. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the activist group. The petition to ban single-use plastics was about to close, and this was my last chance to add my name before it went to the state senator. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: Mrs. Patel expected her home spotless and her rules followed, but my fellow activists counted on every signature to show lawmakers we cared. My hands shook as I stared at the empty bottle, torn between running to the store for supplies and grabbing my phone to sign. Both choices felt urgent, both felt right, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of the home and the hope for change."}
