As an engineer, I knew the updated regulation would apply to our next product release, and I was responsible for ensuring every detail was compliant. The company expected me to gather evidence, double-check every calculation, and leave no room for error. But as an advocate, clients often reached out for quick, informal advice. Today, a client asked for a general explanation about how the new standard might affect their project. They wanted clarity, reassurance, and a simple answer.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I gave a straightforward answer, I risked oversimplifying the complex requirements and possibly misleading the client. But if I withheld information or insisted on a formal consultation, I might seem unhelpful or evasive. My engineering side demanded precision and strict adherence to the rules, while my advocate side urged me to be accessible and supportive. The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I could feel the tension building as I hovered over the keyboard, unsure of how to respond."}
