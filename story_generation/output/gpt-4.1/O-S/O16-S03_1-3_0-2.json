As a doctor, I knew I had to be thorough\u2014ask the right questions, order the right tests, make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything serious. My mind was focused on her symptoms, the subtle differences between a harmless cold and something more severe. But outside, the city was alive with noise. The demonstration I\u2019d planned to join as a citizen was in full swing. I\u2019d promised myself I would stand up for what I believed in, respect the rights of others, and follow the law. \n\nAfter my shift, I hurried to the protest, still thinking about my patient\u2019s case. The crowd surged, and someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s step past the barricade\u2014make them listen!\u201d My heart pounded. As a citizen, I wanted to be heard, to fight for justice. But the barricade was there for a reason, and crossing it would break the law. I felt the weight of my white coat, the trust my patients placed in me, and the responsibility to set an example. I stood at the edge, torn between my duty as a doctor and my convictions as a citizen, unsure which path to take."}
