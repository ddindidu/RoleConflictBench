The attorney\u2019s email was still open on my screen, highlighting a fresh appellate decision that could shift the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. As a judge, I knew I had to read and analyze it thoroughly\u2014justice demanded I be current and impartial. But then, my phone rang again. It was the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks, finally available for a brief call about the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into as an activist. This was my chance to push for real change, to make my voice heard where it mattered. My mind raced: if I took the call, I\u2019d lose precious time to study the new precedent; if I ignored it, I might miss the only window to influence the legislation. Both roles demanded my full attention, both carried weighty consequences. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the law and the cause I believed in."}
