My shift was almost over, but I had just received an email from management about a professional development seminar. They wanted us to sign up if we were interested, and I knew responding promptly would show my commitment to the job. At the same time, I glanced at the clock and felt a jolt of anxiety\u2014polls at my local voting station would close in ten minutes. If I didn\u2019t get there in time, I\u2019d lose my chance to vote, something I believed was my civic duty. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of quick, professional communication, and I didn\u2019t want to seem indifferent to career growth. But the thought of missing my chance to vote gnawed at me. I stared at my phone, torn between composing a thoughtful reply to the seminar invitation and rushing out the door to make it to the polling station before it locked. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of my job against my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
