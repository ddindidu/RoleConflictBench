Mrs. Patel, a regular, smiled warmly, her eyes expectant. I was supposed to greet her, offer tea, and make her feel at home\u2014she always said my chair was her safe space. The receptionist was idly scrolling through her phone, but I knew Mrs. Patel preferred my welcome. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the law office: the trial for my advocacy client was about to begin, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation in court. My heart pounded as I looked from Mrs. Patel\u2019s hopeful face to the urgent message on my phone. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one expecting warmth and comfort, the other demanding sharp focus and unwavering commitment. I stood frozen, torn between the scissors in my hand and the legal brief in my mind, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
