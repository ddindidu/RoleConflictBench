My supervisor had been clear: \u201cMove those to the new storage area before you clock out.\u201d It was a straightforward task, but the pile was heavy, and the day was already slipping away. As I planned out how to tackle it, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested, \u201cIf you have a moment, try organizing the supply shelf by category\u2014it\u2019ll help everyone.\u201d I\u2019d promised to help out after my shift, and I knew she counted on me to follow through, especially since the last few volunteers hadn\u2019t finished the job. \n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I focused on the construction site, I might not have the energy or time to organize the supplies as asked. But if I rushed through my laborer duties, I risked disappointing my supervisor and possibly making mistakes. Both roles expected me to be reliable and thorough, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to meet both demands. My mind raced, torn between the weight of bricks and the weight of expectations, unsure which responsibility to shoulder first."}
