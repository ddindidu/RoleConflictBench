As her doctor, I knew I needed to prescribe the right antibiotics and ensure she understood her treatment. My pager buzzed with a reminder: after clinic hours, I was scheduled to help organize medical supplies as a volunteer. The coordinator had emailed earlier, suggesting a new system for sorting the supplies\u2014one that would take extra time and effort, but she emphasized it would help everyone in the long run.\n\nI glanced at the clock. The clinic was running behind, and my patient needed careful attention. Yet, I also felt the weight of the coordinator\u2019s expectations; she trusted me to follow her guidelines and set an example for the other volunteers. My mind raced with questions: Should I rush through my patient\u2019s care to get to the supply room on time? Or should I focus on my medical duties and risk disappointing the volunteer team? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, caught between my responsibilities as a doctor and my commitment as a volunteer."}
