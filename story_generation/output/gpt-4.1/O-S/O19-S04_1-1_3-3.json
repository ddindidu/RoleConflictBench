I glanced at the clock\u2014my voting window was tight, and I still needed to double-check which ID I\u2019d brought. I knew I should take a few minutes to counsel her properly, ask about her allergies, other medications, and explain side effects. But the line behind her was growing, and my mind kept drifting to the polling station\u2019s closing time. If I left now, I could swing by home for my passport, just in case my driver\u2019s license wasn\u2019t accepted.
