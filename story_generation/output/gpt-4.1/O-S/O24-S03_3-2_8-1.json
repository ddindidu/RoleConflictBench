My heart skips. The Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I\u2019m referencing. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay current, to ensure justice is served according to the latest law. I pause, mind racing, knowing I must halt the proceedings and rework my instructions. The courtroom waits, expectant.\n\nBut my thoughts flicker to later tonight. I promised friends we\u2019d play music in my apartment, a rare chance to unwind. Yet, as a citizen, I\u2019m bound to respect the building\u2019s quiet hours and my neighbors\u2019 peace. I remember Mrs. Lee, who always leaves her windows open, and how sound carries in the old hallways.\n\nThe weight of both roles presses on me. In court, I must be the impartial arbiter, instantly adapting to new legal realities. At home, I\u2019m just another resident, expected to follow the rules and respect others\u2019 rights. I feel the tension\u2014between the public duty to uphold the law and the private desire to relax, between the authority of the bench and the humility of being just another neighbor."}
