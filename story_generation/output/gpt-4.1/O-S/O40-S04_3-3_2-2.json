My hands were deep in the guts of the table saw, checking the blade alignment and making sure the safety guard was secure. The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts, safety first.\u201d I knew how quickly things could go wrong if I didn\u2019t inspect every tool before we started the day\u2019s structural work. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the polling station would close in ten minutes. If I left now, I could just make it to vote, fulfilling my duty as a citizen. But if I rushed this inspection, I\u2019d be risking not just my own safety, but my crew\u2019s as well. My heart pounded as I stared at the half-assembled saw, torn between the responsibility to my team and the obligation to have my voice heard in the election. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach as I wrestled with what to do next."}
