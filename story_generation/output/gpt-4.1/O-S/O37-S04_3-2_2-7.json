As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew every corner had to shine\u2014no shortcuts, no missed spots. My supervisor expected nothing less, and I took pride in meeting those standards. But today was also Election Day, and I rushed to the polling station, still in my uniform, determined to fulfill my duty as a voter. When I handed in my ballot, the poll worker frowned and pointed out a smudge on the envelope. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to re-sign this, please, so your vote counts,\u201d she said. I hesitated, remembering the strict instructions: follow every step exactly, no alterations, or the ballot could be voided. My mind raced\u2014should I trust the poll worker\u2019s guidance, or stick to the official instructions I\u2019d read? The pressure of doing everything \u201cright\u201d in both roles pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of precision and obedience, unsure which expectation to honor."}
