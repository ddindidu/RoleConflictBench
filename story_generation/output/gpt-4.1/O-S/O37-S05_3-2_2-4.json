Every corner needed to shine; the supervisor would check for dust behind the fridge, and I couldn\u2019t afford another warning. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my client. The court hearing was in two hours, and new evidence had just surfaced. They needed me to review it, to be sharp and ready to defend them. My heart pounded. If I left now, the house wouldn\u2019t pass inspection, and I might lose this job. But if I stayed, I\u2019d risk letting my client down, maybe even jeopardizing their case. The mop felt heavier in my hand as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the spotless floors and the courtroom\u2019s demands."}
