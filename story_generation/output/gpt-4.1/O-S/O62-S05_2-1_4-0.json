As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in top shape, so when I spotted the frayed lane rope, my stomach tightened. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the class could be thrown into chaos. I grabbed the repair kit, but my phone buzzed\u2014my client, anxious about their upcoming hearing, wanted to talk. As their advocate, I\u2019m supposed to provide clear, accurate advice, not just vague reassurances. But I was already behind on my lifeguard duties, and the broken rope demanded my immediate attention. My mind raced, torn between the pool\u2019s safety and my client\u2019s trust. I could hear the swim instructor\u2019s footsteps approaching, and my phone kept vibrating in my pocket. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the whistle and the call."}
