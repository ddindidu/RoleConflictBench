The manager had asked me to keep a close eye on supplies, especially after last week\u2019s complaints about running out. I scribbled notes, double-checking the list, knowing I\u2019d have to report the shortage and maybe even run out to restock. But my phone buzzed, jolting me. The radio station\u2019s producer: \u201cYou\u2019re on in five.\u201d I was supposed to be the voice for our movement today, to explain why our cause mattered, to inspire people to act. I could already picture the listeners waiting, the host ready to introduce me. My mind raced\u2014if I left now, the cleaning wouldn\u2019t be finished, and I\u2019d let down my boss and the team. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to reach hundreds, maybe thousands, with our message. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between duty and passion."}
