Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to clean and service the machines\u2014if I missed it, the whole line could slow down, and everyone would know I\u2019d dropped the ball. My supervisor had already reminded me twice: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime, not now.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a different urgency. The activist group chat was exploding\u2014someone had managed to get our petition in front of a key lawmaker, and there was a last-minute chance to add my signature before it was sent. \u201cEvery name counts,\u201d the message read. I knew how much this policy change meant, how hard we\u2019d fought for this moment. If I didn\u2019t act now, I\u2019d be letting down the cause, my friends, and maybe even my own beliefs.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the humming machines that needed my hands and the digital petition that needed my voice. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014reliable repairer, passionate activist\u2014each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
