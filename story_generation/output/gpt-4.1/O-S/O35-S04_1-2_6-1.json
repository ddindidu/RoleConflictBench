My shift is almost over, but my mind is racing. An email notification blinks on my phone: the company is offering a professional development seminar, and they want us to sign up if we\u2019re interested. It\u2019s not mandatory, but management always seems to remember who participates. I know I should respond promptly, show I\u2019m committed to my job and to improving my skills. But today is also election day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polling station closes in just a couple of hours, and I still have to finish my route, park the train, and get across town. I feel the pressure from both sides\u2014my duty as a subway operator to be diligent and responsive, and my responsibility as a citizen to cast my vote. My phone buzzes again, and I feel my chest tighten. I can\u2019t do both at once, and I\u2019m not sure which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
