She was frail, her hands trembling as she described her symptoms. I knew how crucial it was to ensure she understood every detail\u2014missing a warning or interaction could be dangerous. My mind, however, kept drifting to the polling station across the street.

Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d I hesitated. The new line was barely moving, but the instructions were clear.
