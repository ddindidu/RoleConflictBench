My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 voices, all waiting for clearance. I could feel the tension in my shoulders as I calculated holding patterns, trying to keep the airspace safe and efficient. Every minute mattered; a single mistake could ripple through the entire system. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed, so please be on time. Every role is critical.\u201d I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it. But the planes kept coming, and the holding delays were stacking up. I felt torn, caught between the responsibility to hundreds of passengers in the sky and the commitment I\u2019d made to my team on the ground. My hands hovered over the console, mind racing, as I tried to figure out what to do."}
