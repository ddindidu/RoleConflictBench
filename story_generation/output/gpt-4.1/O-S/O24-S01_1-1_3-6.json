As a judge, I was expected to write clear and detailed legal opinions, and this week, I needed to draft a standard scheduling order for a new case. The deadline loomed, and I could already feel the pressure mounting. My mind kept drifting, though, to the email I\u2019d received from the volunteer coordinator at the community center. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supplies\u2014nothing urgent, just a brief note that it would be helpful if I could try it out this week. I wanted to help; I\u2019d promised to be reliable, to follow her instructions and support the team. But every time I thought about heading over to the center, I felt the weight of the unfinished order pulling me back. I knew both roles mattered, and both had expectations I didn\u2019t want to let down. My thoughts tangled as I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of the bench and the quiet call to serve."}
