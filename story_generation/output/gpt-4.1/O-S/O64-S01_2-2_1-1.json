My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything, especially when it\u2019s busy.\u201d I can\u2019t afford mistakes, not with so many eyes watching and the queue growing longer. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift starts in fifteen minutes across town. The coordinator\u2019s message from this morning flashes in my memory: \u201cWe need everyone on time today. The doors open right at noon.\u201d I glance at the clock, my heart pounding. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my team here, but if I stay, I\u2019ll be late for the volunteers who are counting on me. The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I feel torn, caught between the demands of my job and my commitment to help. I grip the register tighter, my mind racing as I try to figure out what to do."}
