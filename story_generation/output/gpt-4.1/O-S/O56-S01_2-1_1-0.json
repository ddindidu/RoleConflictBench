A woman hovered at the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I knew that look\u2014first-time jitters. As a hairdresser, it was my job to greet her warmly, to make her feel at ease, to show her she was in good hands. I started toward her, rehearsing my most reassuring smile. But then I glanced at the clock. My volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in fifteen minutes. I was supposed to be there on time, to set an example, to show commitment. Still, I knew the others could handle things if I was a little late. My heart thudded as I hesitated, torn between the anxious client who needed comfort and the promise I\u2019d made to the kitchen. Both roles tugged at me, each with its own expectations, and I stood frozen, caught between the welcoming words on my lips and the ticking clock in my mind."}
