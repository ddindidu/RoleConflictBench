As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything orderly and safe, and the manager had just reminded us that even small details mattered for the facility\u2019s reputation. I could hear the distant hum of voices gathering outside\u2014the protest was about to start. As an activist, I was supposed to be at the front, leading the first chant, setting the tone for the march. My phone buzzed with a message: \u201cWe need you now!\u201d I looked back at the chairs, then at the exit. If I left them as they were, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking a reprimand. But if I stayed to fix them, I\u2019d miss the opening of the protest, and everyone was counting on me to lead. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the pool deck and the call to action outside, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
