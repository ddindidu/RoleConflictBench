My manager expects me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays\u2014especially now, during the after-work rush. I glance at the clock: 4:55. In five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be on air, live, talking about the environmental campaign I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The radio host will call my cell, and I\u2019m supposed to inspire listeners, answer questions, maybe even recruit new volunteers. My phone vibrates in my apron pocket\u2014a reminder. I feel sweat bead on my forehead. If I leave the register, I\u2019ll let down my coworkers and the customers who just want to get home. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss my chance to reach hundreds of people, to make a difference.
