My manager expects me to keep the line moving and treat everyone with warmth, even as the line snakes past the bakery. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014three urgent messages from my activist group. The state legislature is about to vote on a bill I\u2019ve spent months fighting for, and the outcome hinges on one undecided representative. They need me to call now, to share my story and persuade her before the vote. I glance at the clock; there\u2019s barely an hour left. The next customer steps up, chatting about the weather, and I force a smile, but my mind is racing. I know my team is counting on me to make a difference, but my manager and these customers expect my full attention. My hands tremble as I hand over the receipt, torn between the demands of my job and the cause I believe in."}
