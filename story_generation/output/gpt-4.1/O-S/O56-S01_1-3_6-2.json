My next client, Mrs. Lee, settled into my chair, her hair still damp and smelling of fresh shampoo. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she smiled, \u201cso you can skip the wash.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d be relieved, but today, I was scheduled to unlock the community center for the morning meal service. I was the only volunteer assigned, and people would already be waiting outside, hungry and anxious. \n\nBut here, in the salon, skipping the wash felt wrong\u2014my boss expected every client to get the full treatment, and I worried about complaints or a bad review. Yet, if I stayed, I\u2019d be late opening the center, letting down the people who counted on me. My mind raced, torn between the rules of my job and the responsibility I felt as a volunteer. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
