Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My training kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report it and stop the train immediately, no exceptions. The safety of hundreds depended on my quick, calm action. But as I reached for the radio, my mind flashed to the voter ID card I\u2019d left at home. Today was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before my shift ended. I could fetch my spare card later, but the polling station was only open for a few more hours, and lines would be long. My duty as a subway operator was clear\u2014safety first, always. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of my responsibility to vote, to have my voice heard. The pressure from both sides pressed in, my hand hovering over the emergency stop, my thoughts racing between the lives in my care and the ballot I might miss."}
