My manager\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dial another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my friend from the activist group. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d I watch the stream for a moment\u2014just a handful of them, holding signs, their voices barely rising above the city noise. My heart twists. I promised I\u2019d be there if they needed me. But if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss my target, and I can\u2019t afford another warning from my boss. My headset feels heavier, the office air stifling. I stare at the phone, torn between the call I\u2019m supposed to make and the call I feel in my chest."}
