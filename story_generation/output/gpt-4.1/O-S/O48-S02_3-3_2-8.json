As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was here, helping him through the agony, making sure he ate enough to keep his strength. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an urgent call from the activist group. The news was spreading misinformation about our cause, and the network wanted me on air, now, to set the record straight. My heart pounded. I could picture the faces of those who depended on my voice, the community waiting for someone to speak up. But here was Mr. Harris, trembling, needing me just as much. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down. The expectation to be present, compassionate, and reliable for my patient clashed with the demand to be a vocal, unwavering advocate. I stared at the phone, then at Mr. Harris, my hands shaking, caught between two urgent calls for help."}
