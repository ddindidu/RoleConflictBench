As a construction laborer, I know the drill\u2014drop everything, no questions, and head straight to the muster point. Safety is non-negotiable, and the foreman\u2019s eyes are always sharp for stragglers. But today, I\u2019m also wearing my volunteer badge, manning the check-in table for the community shelter. Just as the alarm blares, a woman leans in, her voice trembling as she confides a private worry, trusting me to listen and keep her secret. My heart pounds. The team expects me to move, now, no exceptions. But the woman\u2019s eyes plead for understanding, for a moment of safety in her own way. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other quiet presence. I stand frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the whispered confession, knowing I can\u2019t honor both at once."}
