The deadline wasn\u2019t pressing, but I wanted to do it right\u2014clean, maintainable, efficient. I could almost hear my team lead\u2019s voice in my head, praising a job well done. But then my phone buzzed, a reminder: polls close in two hours. I\u2019d planned to vote after work, but errands had eaten up my afternoon. Now, if I dove into the code, I\u2019d lose track of time, as I always did. If I left now, I\u2019d have to abandon the flow I\u2019d finally found, and the code would stay messy for another day. My civic duty tugged at me\u2014voting mattered, my voice mattered. But so did my pride in my work, and the trust my team placed in me. I sat frozen, torn between the keyboard and the ballot box, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, neither willing to let go."}
