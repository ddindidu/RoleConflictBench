My mind was already at the polling station, rehearsing the steps to cast my vote before it closed. As I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. It was only a few dollars, nothing that would affect the total sales, but store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, and any issue reported immediately. My manager expected nothing less.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the polling station would close soon. I remembered the election official\u2019s words from earlier: because of a registration mismatch, I\u2019d need to fill out a provisional ballot form, and it had to be done before closing. No exceptions. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. If I stayed to resolve the register issue, I might lose my chance to vote. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking store policy and risking my job. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations pressing in on me, torn between my responsibility as a cashier and my right as a voter, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both."}
