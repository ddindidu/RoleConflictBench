The bottle was empty. I checked the supply closet\u2014nothing. My client expects me to keep track of these things, to make sure everything is stocked and ready. I felt a knot in my stomach; the marble needed that cleaner, and I was supposed to manage the supplies better.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. The city newsletter popped up, reminding me about the bus route survey. They wanted feedback from residents like me, and the deadline was next week. I\u2019d been meaning to fill it out\u2014public transport is a big deal in my neighborhood, and I always tell myself I should be a responsible citizen, stay involved, make my voice heard.\n\nBut now, I was torn. Should I stop and order the cleaner right away, maybe even run out to buy it, so I don\u2019t let my client down? Or should I take a few minutes to fill out the survey, knowing how important it is to participate in civic life? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations."}
