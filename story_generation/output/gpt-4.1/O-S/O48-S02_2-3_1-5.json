He winced with every movement, and I could see how much he depended on me to help him get dressed and feel safe. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my activist group. The vote on the patient rights bill was happening in less than an hour, and the outcome depended on one undecided representative. They needed me to call now, to share my story as a nursing assistant and urge the legislator to vote yes. My heart pounded. Mr. Jenkins looked at me, trusting and vulnerable, waiting for my help. But the message on my phone felt urgent, too\u2014if I didn\u2019t act, the bill might fail, affecting patients like him everywhere. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need was greater in that moment."}
