My whistle hangs heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to keep every swimmer safe. Suddenly, my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Maya, my fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from the city square, her voice urgent: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come. The turnout is small, and the press just arrived.\u201d My heart pounds. I know how important this protest is; we\u2019ve worked for weeks to organize it, and my presence could make a difference. But as I glance back at the pool, I spot a swimmer floundering near the middle, their strokes growing weaker. I can\u2019t look away, can\u2019t leave my post, not even for a moment. The weight of both worlds presses down on me\u2014my responsibility to protect lives here, and my commitment to fight for justice out there. I grip the armrest, torn, as the demands of both roles pull me in opposite directions."}
