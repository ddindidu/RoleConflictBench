Nearest unit, respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. I glanced at the clock\u2014less than an hour until the polls closed, and I still needed to get home to grab my ID. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after everything that\u2019s happened. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, and I knew every second counted for those people on the highway. As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to drop everything and race to the scene, lives depending on my speed. As a citizen, I\u2019m expected to show up, ID in hand, and cast my vote\u2014my only chance today. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the blaring siren in my mind and the quiet, insistent call of my civic duty. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
