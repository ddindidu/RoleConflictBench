My hands are already reaching for my tools, mind racing through the steps\u2014shut down, clean, lubricate, replace if needed. The supervisor\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Keep everything running.\u201d But then my phone vibrates, and I see the name flash on the screen\u2014a legislative aide, the one I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. This is the moment to push for the bill, to make my case for safer working conditions, to be the voice for my fellow workers. I have ten minutes, maybe less, to make an impact.
