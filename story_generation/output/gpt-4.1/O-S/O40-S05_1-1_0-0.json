My shift as a carpenter started in fifteen minutes, and I was expected to be on site early to check the safety equipment and brief the crew. The foreman had been clear: no shortcuts, no late arrivals, and above all, follow every safety protocol. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was a client from my legal practice, desperate for advice about a contract dispute. She was anxious, her voice trembling, and I knew she needed more than just a quick answer. As an advocate, I owed her clarity and accuracy, even in a casual consultation. My mind raced\u2014if I stayed to help her, I\u2019d be late to the site, risking both my reputation and the safety of my team. If I left now, I\u2019d be failing her when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the workshop door and the phone in my hand."}
