My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked me through the app, asking if I was close. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable and professional, getting people where they needed to go, on time. But today, the city felt slower, every light red, every lane blocked.\n\nAt the same time, a different urgency gnawed at me. The polling place for the ballot measure that could change the zoning on my block would close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who didn\u2019t just complain but participated. I knew my neighbors were counting on every vote, and I\u2019d spent weeks reading up, talking to people, forming my opinion. But now, with the passenger waiting and the minutes slipping away, I felt torn. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014someone needed me to be a professional, someone else needed me to be a citizen. My hands tightened on the wheel as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
