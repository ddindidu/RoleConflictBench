Tomorrow marked the start of a high-stakes jury trial\u2014my client\u2019s future and millions of dollars hung in the balance. As their lawyer, I was expected to be in court, fully prepared, every morning. There was no room for delay; the judge had made it clear that the trial would proceed as scheduled, no exceptions. \n\nBut tomorrow was also my weekly shift at the community center, where I volunteered to serve breakfast to families in need. I\u2019d promised the coordinator I\u2019d be there at 7 a.m., sharp. I knew the other volunteers could cover for me if I was late, but I hated the idea of letting them down. They counted on me, and I\u2019d always prided myself on being reliable.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My client\u2019s anxious calls echoed in my mind, while the memory of grateful smiles at the center tugged at my conscience. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be disappointing someone who depended on me. I sat at my desk, unable to shake the feeling that I was failing at both."}
