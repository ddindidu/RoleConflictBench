A young woman hovered at the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. As a hairdresser, I knew my job: greet her warmly, offer her tea, make her feel at ease. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the minor hearing scheduled in half an hour. As an advocate, I was expected to be present, prepared, and focused, even if the stakes were low. My heart thudded as I weighed the expectations. The client\u2019s anxious gaze met mine, silently pleading for reassurance. At the same time, my mind raced with legal arguments and the responsibility to represent my other client effectively. I felt torn, rooted to the spot, the scissors in my hand suddenly heavy.
