Today, at work, the project manager reminded me that our new system is still in the exploratory phase\u2014nothing is set in stone, and I can propose alternative approaches later. That flexibility is a relief, but it also means I need to keep my mind open, constantly analyzing and reanalyzing possibilities.\n\nAfter work, I head to the community center for my volunteer shift. I\u2019m sorting through files\u2014stacks of folders filled with detailed medical histories. The coordinator is clear: privacy is paramount. I must not discuss or disclose anything I see, not even in passing.\n\nAs I sift through the files, I notice patterns\u2014recurring issues that, as an engineer, I instinctively want to solve. My mind races with ideas for a secure, efficient system to help the center manage these records. But to design it, I\u2019d need to reference some of the data I\u2019m seeing now. The urge to help clashes with the strict confidentiality I\u2019ve promised to uphold. I feel the tension building inside me, torn between my drive to innovate and my duty to protect the privacy of those I\u2019m here to serve."}
