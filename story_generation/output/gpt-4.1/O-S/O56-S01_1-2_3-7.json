I nodded, reaching for my scissors, but my mind flashed back to the volunteer briefing from last night. The coordinator had been clear: \u201cNo sharp tools left unattended, even for a second. Safety first, always.\u201d I\u2019d promised to follow every new step, and I knew I was expected to set an example for the other volunteers at the shelter later today.\n\nBut here, in the salon, my client expected me to focus on her needs, to listen and make sure she left happy. I could see she trusted me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. Yet, the thought of the new safety rules tugged at me. Should I pause and double-check every step, even if it meant slowing down and possibly making Mrs. Lee feel uneasy? My hands hesitated, scissors poised, as I wrestled with the demands of both worlds, feeling the weight of responsibility from each side pressing in."}
