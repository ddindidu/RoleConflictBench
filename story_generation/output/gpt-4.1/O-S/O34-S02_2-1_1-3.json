Holiday travel always means chaos, and today the approach fixes are stacked with holding patterns. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, all waiting for my instructions. I can\u2019t let the delays get worse; every second counts for safety and efficiency. But my phone buzzes on the console, a reminder from the activist group. The online petition to push for new airspace management policies is about to close. I\u2019ve spent weeks rallying for this, urging others to sign, and now I have a final chance to add my own name before it\u2019s sent to the lawmaker. My supervisor expects my full attention on the traffic, but my fellow activists expect me to stand with them, to be counted. My hand hovers between the radar and my phone, heart pounding, torn between the immediate demands of the sky and the long-term change I believe in."}
