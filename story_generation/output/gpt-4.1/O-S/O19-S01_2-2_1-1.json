My volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions.\u201d But in front of me, a prescription for Mrs. Lee waited, complicated and crucial. She depended on these medications to keep her heart and diabetes in check, and I knew any mistake could have serious consequences. I double-checked the dosages, my hands trembling slightly as I remembered the shelter\u2019s doors opening soon, the line of people who would be waiting for me. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my duty as a pharmacist to ensure every pill was right, and my promise as a volunteer to be there for those who counted on me. The pressure built in my chest, and I stared at the prescription, torn between the two worlds that both needed me, both right now."}
