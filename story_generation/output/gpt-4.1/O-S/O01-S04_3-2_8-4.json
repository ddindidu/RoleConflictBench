The project was behind schedule, and as the lead architect, everyone looked to me to resolve the latest dispute between the electrical and plumbing teams. The client\u2019s deadline was non-negotiable, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders. \n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the election. I\u2019d planned to vote tomorrow, but I\u2019d just realized my ID was at home\u2014across town, a forty-minute drive each way. Today was my only window to retrieve it, but leaving now would mean abandoning my team at a critical moment. If I stayed, I risked losing my chance to vote; if I left, the project could slip further behind. \n\nMy phone buzzed again\u2014another urgent question from the site. I stared at the screen, torn between my responsibility to my team and my duty as a citizen. The pressure built inside me, each role demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
