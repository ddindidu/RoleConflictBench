The app is throwing intermittent errors, and users are getting frustrated. QA is pinging me, asking for a hotfix before the end of the day. I know how important it is to keep the system stable\u2014people rely on this software, and I take pride in being the one who can solve these problems quickly. But then I glance at the clock and remember the ballot measure. The polling place is only open for two more hours, and this vote could change the way our block is zoned. I\u2019ve read up on the issue, and I know my voice matters. As a citizen, I feel a responsibility to show up, to be counted, to help shape the future of my neighborhood. My laptop screen blinks with error logs, while my civic duty tugs at me from across town. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whichever role I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014my users, my neighbors, or maybe even myself."}
