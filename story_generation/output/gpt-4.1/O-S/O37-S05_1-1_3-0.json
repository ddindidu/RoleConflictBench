It was a client, texting with a question about their upcoming hearing. As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep everything in order\u2014no running out of soap or paper towels on my watch. But as an advocate, I was supposed to be available, ready to provide clear, accurate advice, even in casual moments like this.\n\nI glanced at the nearly empty shelf of glass cleaner, making a mental note to reorder, but my mind was already racing through the legal jargon I\u2019d need to explain the client\u2019s options. My supervisor expected spotless rooms and well-stocked carts, while my client needed reassurance and clarity. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the immediate, tangible demands of my cleaning duties and the weighty responsibility of guiding someone through a legal maze. My hands hovered over the phone, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
