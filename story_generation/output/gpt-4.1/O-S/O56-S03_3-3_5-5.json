She glared at her reflection, voice rising, demanding I fix the cut she hated. My hands trembled as I apologized and offered solutions, knowing I was expected to remain patient and professional, no matter how late it got. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the polling place just a few blocks away. The ballot measure on tonight\u2019s vote would directly impact my neighborhood, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, like any responsible citizen should. The polls closed in two hours, but if I stayed to resolve this client\u2019s complaint, I might not make it in time. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my client against my responsibility to my community, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
