As a telemarketer, I was expected to keep this momentum, to push harder, to meet and exceed the targets my manager set. Every call was a chance to close another deal, and this week, I was on fire. But as an advocate, my phone buzzed with messages from a client whose case was spiraling into complexity. She needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed careful, accurate legal advice, the kind that took time and focus. My manager\u2019s emails reminded me to keep dialing, to not let up, while my client\u2019s anxious voice on the other end of the line pleaded for clarity and reassurance. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the thrill of smashing my sales quota and the responsibility to guide someone through a legal maze. My hands hovered over the phone, my mind racing with the demands of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
