A few swimmers drifted toward the deep end, but nothing seemed urgent\u2014just the usual ebb and flow. Still, I knew my job: vigilance, always. But today, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the online candidate forum for my district was streaming live. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more involved this year, to listen, to vote smart, to give feedback that mattered. The forum was only an hour, but it was happening now. I felt the tug: my duty to the swimmers, to keep them safe, versus my responsibility as a citizen, to be informed and engaged. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014could I risk a few minutes with one earbud in, or would that be a betrayal of my post? The pool sparkled, the voices from the forum beckoned, and I sat, torn, unable to move."}
