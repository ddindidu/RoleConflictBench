She hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected.\u201d My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I know how important it is to make clients feel heard and happy, especially new ones. I wanted to reassure her, talk through options, maybe even adjust the tone right away. Just then, my phone buzzed in my apron pocket. It was a call from a legislative aide\u2014someone I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks about the bill I\u2019m fighting for. The message was urgent: \u201cI have ten minutes to talk now.\u201d My mind raced. If I missed this window, it could set our campaign back. But if I stepped away, I\u2019d leave my client feeling dismissed and dissatisfied. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
