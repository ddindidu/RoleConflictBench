He winced with every bite, his hands trembling as he tried to lift the spoon. As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to help him eat, to make sure he got enough nutrition and comfort. He looked at me, pain etched on his face, and started talking about his family, how he missed his old home. The conversation drifted, and soon another volunteer, Sarah, joined us. She asked about his children, and Mr. Lee, perhaps grateful for the company, began to share more about his life.\n\nAs a volunteer, I was trained to respect privacy, to never push for personal details or let conversations go too far. But as a nursing assistant, I felt responsible for his emotional well-being, to let him talk if it eased his pain. I could see Sarah\u2019s uncertain glance, as if asking whether we should gently steer the conversation back. I felt torn\u2014should I encourage Mr. Lee to share, knowing it might help him, or should I protect his privacy, even if he seemed willing to talk? The expectations of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which path to take."}
