The clock ticked past midnight, and I knew every minute mattered\u2014if I missed something, my client could face devastating financial loss. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning, and moments later, the building alarms blared. I looked out the window; water was already pooling in the street, creeping toward the entrance. As a lawyer, I was expected to keep my focus, to scrutinize every word of the contract before dawn. But as a citizen, I was supposed to help\u2014check on neighbors, follow evacuation orders, maybe even assist the elderly couple down the hall. My heart pounded as I weighed the contract in my hands, the sirens echoing in my ears, torn between the duty to my client and the responsibility to my community."}
