A new appellate court decision, handed down just last week, could shift the entire direction of the case before me. As a judge, I knew I had to review it thoroughly before the next session\u2014my duty demanded nothing less. I reached for the printed opinion, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in ten minutes. I had promised myself I would vote today, fulfill my civic responsibility, and have my voice counted. The courthouse was only a few blocks from the station, but if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time to study the new precedent. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. My mind raced, torn between the weight of justice and the pull of democracy. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and both mattered deeply to me. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, feeling the pressure of two worlds colliding, unsure which duty to honor first."}
