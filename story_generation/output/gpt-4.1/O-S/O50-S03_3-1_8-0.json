They looked uncertain, fumbling with the controls, and I knew they hadn\u2019t been properly trained. As the machine repairer, I was expected to step in, guide them, and make sure they understood the safety protocols before starting any batch\u2014especially one as hazardous as this. But I was already running late, and my mind was elsewhere. Earlier, during my walk through the park, I\u2019d seen someone toss a coffee cup near a trash bin, ignoring the no-littering signs. As a citizen, I felt the urge to say something, to uphold the law and respect for public spaces, but I hesitated, not wanting to cause a scene. Now, standing in the factory, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the responsibility to protect these workers from harm, and the duty to set an example in my community. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which expectation to meet first, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
