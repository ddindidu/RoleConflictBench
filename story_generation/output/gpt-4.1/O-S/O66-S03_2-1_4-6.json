As a taxi driver, I knew I had to drive defensively, especially with cars darting between lanes and brake lights flaring unpredictably. My job demanded vigilance\u2014one mistake could mean an accident, a ticket, or worse. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of other responsibilities pressing in. My tax documents were finally in order, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d help at the free vaccine clinic this weekend, just like last year. The community needed volunteers, and I wanted to do my part. But the rain meant longer hours on the road, more anxious passengers, and less time for anything else. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014should I focus on my job, keeping every ride safe and legal, or should I carve out time to serve my community, even if it meant less rest and more stress? The demands of both roles pulled at me, and I wasn\u2019t sure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
