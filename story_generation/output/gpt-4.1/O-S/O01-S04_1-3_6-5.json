As the lead architect, I was expected to keep projects on track, and today was no different\u2014my team waited for my review before moving forward. I skimmed the timelines, making mental notes to follow up on a few lagging tasks, but my mind kept drifting. The polls closed at eight, and I had only this evening to vote. I needed my ID, but it was at home, a thirty-minute drive away. My team expected me to be present, to answer questions and keep things moving, but the weight of my civic duty pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d let my colleagues down, possibly delaying the project. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote, failing to meet the simple but crucial requirement of bringing my ID. The pressure built inside me, torn between professional responsibility and personal obligation, as the minutes ticked by and the decision loomed."}
