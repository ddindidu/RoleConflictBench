My phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my client\u2019s trial was about to begin. As their advocate, I was expected to be present, to argue their case with every ounce of skill I possessed. Their future, their freedom, depended on me. But here, at the pool, I was the lifeguard. I was responsible for every life in the water, expected to watch every movement, to leap in at the first sign of trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, their strokes growing desperate. My heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t let my attention slip for a second. Yet, the courtroom called to me, my client\u2019s anxious face flashing in my mind. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full presence, each unforgiving of distraction. I gripped the armrest, torn between the urgent needs before me, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left unguarded."}
