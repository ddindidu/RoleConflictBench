The demonstration was louder than I expected, voices rising in a chorus of demands for change. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m used to handling objections, keeping my cool when customers push back or ask tricky questions. My job is to stick to the script, answer calmly, and never lose my composure. But here, the script was gone. A fellow protester, eyes bright with urgency, grabbed my arm and urged me to step past the barricade onto the restricted city lawn. \u201cWe need to make a statement,\u201d she insisted. My mind raced. As a citizen, I know the law is clear\u2014respect boundaries, don\u2019t trespass, don\u2019t disrupt public order. But the crowd\u2019s energy was infectious, and the pressure to join in was real. I felt the same tension I do when a customer throws a curveball\u2014except this time, the stakes were higher. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the expectation to follow the law and the demand to stand up, to not let the moment pass me by."}
