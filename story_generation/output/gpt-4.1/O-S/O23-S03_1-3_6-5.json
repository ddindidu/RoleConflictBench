As a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything, not even the smallest detail. Client confidentiality was sacred, and my professional ethics demanded absolute discretion. But as a citizen, I felt the pull to engage, to be open and share insights, especially since the case could impact our community. The conversation shifted, and someone mentioned the ballot measure closing soon. I glanced at my watch\u2014barely two hours left to vote. I wanted to discuss the measure, maybe even encourage others to participate, but the specifics of my client\u2019s case were tangled up in the issue. My mind raced, torn between my duty to protect my client and my responsibility to contribute meaningfully as a member of this neighborhood. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising as I tried to decide what to say, and what to do next."}
