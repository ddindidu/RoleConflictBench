As the ambulance driver, I knew every second counted; I had to keep him stable, monitor his vitals, and radio updates to the hospital. My hands shook as I checked his pulse, trying to remember my training, trying to stay calm. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift started in ten minutes. I was the only one with the keys to the community center, and people would already be lining up outside, waiting for warmth and food. I pictured their faces, the trust they placed in me to open the doors on time. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both needed me now. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the life in my care and the community depending on me."}
