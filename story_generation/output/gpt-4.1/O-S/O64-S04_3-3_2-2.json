My shift was supposed to end at seven, but the line of customers seemed endless, each transaction more complicated than the last. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDouble-check every bill, especially at closing. Mistakes cost us.\u201d I felt the weight of the cash drawer, the responsibility to balance every cent. But tonight was also election night, and the polling station down the street would lock its doors in ten minutes. I kept glancing at the time, heart pounding, knowing I had to be there to cast my vote. My civic duty tugged at me, the expectation that I would show up, make my voice heard. But if I rushed, I risked making a costly error at work\u2014something I couldn\u2019t afford. The customers\u2019 impatient faces blurred with my own anxiety. I was torn, caught between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a citizen, feeling the pressure mount as the seconds ticked away."}
