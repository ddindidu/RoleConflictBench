Management\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind\u2014no unscheduled breaks, every minute logged, every absence scrutinized. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure to stay put, to keep dialing, to not let the team down. Suddenly, the building\u2019s alarm blared, and a message flashed across my screen: \u201cFlash-flood warning. Evacuate immediately.\u201d I looked out the window and saw water creeping up the street, neighbors scrambling to help each other. As a citizen, I knew I should act\u2014help the elderly woman next door, check on the kids upstairs, follow the evacuation plan. But my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head insisted, \u201cStay at your station unless on break.\u201d My heart pounded, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my community. I stared at my break log, finger hovering over the button, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both."}
