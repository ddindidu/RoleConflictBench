My team\u2019s messages kept popping up\u2014everyone was waiting on me. The project manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your part is done.\u201d I knew the pressure was on; the whole build was stalled because of me. But then my phone buzzed with a city alert: a heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. She didn\u2019t have air conditioning, and last summer she\u2019d fainted from the heat. As a citizen, I felt responsible to check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her get to a cooling center. But if I left my desk now, the project would fall even further behind, and my team would be frustrated. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my job and the quiet, pressing duty to my community. I sat frozen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role I should answer first."}
