My script urged me to stay calm, answer every objection, and keep him on the line. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Address every concern.\u201d I took a deep breath, ready to explain the fine print for the third time.\n\nBut as I glanced out the window, the city shimmered under the heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. The news had warned everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, to make sure they had water and a fan. My conscience nagged at me\u2014was she okay? Should I run over and check on her? Yet, my job demanded I stay, handle Mr. Jenkins\u2019 objections, and not lose a potential sale. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my job against my responsibility as a citizen. The seconds ticked by, and I felt torn, caught between the voice on the phone and the silent plea from down the hall."}
