As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless\u2014customers expected nothing less, and I\u2019d built a reputation for it. Today, though, my mind kept drifting to the polling station a few blocks away. It was election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote. The polls were open all day, and my schedule was light, but every time I thought about taking a break, a new ride request popped up. Each passenger expected a clean, comfortable ride, and I couldn\u2019t risk a bad review by rushing or leaving the cab unattended. Yet, the hours ticked by, and the pressure to fulfill my civic duty grew heavier. I felt torn\u2014should I keep serving my passengers and maintain my standards, or step away and risk disappointing someone, just so I could cast my vote?
