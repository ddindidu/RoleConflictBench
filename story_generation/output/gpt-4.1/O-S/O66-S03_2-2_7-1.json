As a taxi driver, I pride myself on delivering professional service, so when two travelers flagged me down, arms full of suitcases, I jumped out to help. They wanted to split the fare, which is technically against company policy, but I know it\u2019s common and helps people save money. I hesitated, feeling the pressure to keep my passengers happy and my ratings high.\n\nBut as a citizen, I\u2019m also aware of the rules\u2014both in my cab and in my apartment building. After my shift, I\u2019d planned to unwind with some music, but it\u2019s already late, and the building\u2019s quiet hours have started. My neighbor\u2019s windows are open, and I know sound carries. I want to respect their right to peace, but I also crave a little relaxation after a long day.\n\nCaught between wanting to help my passengers and follow company rules, and wanting to enjoy my music without disturbing others, I feel the tension building inside me. I can\u2019t seem to satisfy both sides of who I am."}
