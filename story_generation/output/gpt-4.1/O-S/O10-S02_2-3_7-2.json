I glanced down\u2014my client, Mr. Patel, wanted clarification on a disputed charge in his latest invoice. He expected a prompt, professional response, and I knew the firm counted on my reliability. But outside, the protest I\u2019d helped organize was suddenly shifting. Police had started blocking the exits, and panic was rising among the crowd. As an activist, I was supposed to help coordinate a safe, calm response, to make sure no one got hurt or arrested. My colleagues were texting me, asking for direction, while my inbox pinged again with a follow-up from Mr. Patel. I felt my heart pounding, torn between the urgent need to support my fellow activists and the professional obligation to address my client\u2019s concerns. Both sides expected me to be present, focused, and dependable, but I could only be in one place\u2014mentally and physically\u2014at a time. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossibly far apart."}
