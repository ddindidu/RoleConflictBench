As the lead scientist, I\u2019m expected to ensure every piece of equipment is checked, every safety protocol followed, even if nothing seems amiss. It\u2019s a responsibility I take seriously\u2014one overlooked detail could mean disaster. But today is also election day. As a voter, I\u2019m expected to show up with valid ID, ready to participate in the process I believe in. I have my driver\u2019s license, but my passport and other cards are at home, just in case. I could fetch them later, but the lab\u2019s schedule is tight, and my team relies on me to oversee the checks. My mind races: if I rush the checklist, I risk missing something critical; if I delay voting, I might not make it back in time before the polls close. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stand in the lab, torn, the hum of machines echoing my inner turmoil."}
