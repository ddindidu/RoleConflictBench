As a construction laborer, I know the drill: drop everything, don\u2019t ask questions, and get to the muster point. Safety is non-negotiable, and the foreman\u2019s voice rings in my head\u2014protocols save lives. But today, I\u2019m also a volunteer, sorting confidential medical files in the site\u2019s makeshift community room. The files are spread out, names and histories exposed, and I\u2019m the only one here. I remember the training: never leave sensitive information unattended, not even for a minute. My heart pounds as I glance at the open folders, then at the door. The alarm blares, demanding I leave now, but the files beg for protection. I feel torn in two\u2014responsible for my team\u2019s safety, but also for the trust of the people whose stories lie in these papers. I stand frozen, caught between the urgent call to evacuate and the silent plea for confidentiality, unsure which duty I can bear to betray."}
