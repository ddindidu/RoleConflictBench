As a delivery person, I knew the drill: leave the package where it won\u2019t get stolen, snap a photo, and move on. But today, my shift overlapped with my volunteer hours at the community center. I was still wearing my volunteer badge when I arrived at the next house. The door was ajar, and Mrs. Lee, a regular at the center, peeked out. She recognized me and, while signing for her package, leaned in and whispered about her struggles at home\u2014details she\u2019d only ever shared in confidence at the center. My delivery app pinged, reminding me to confirm the drop-off. I felt torn. As a delivery person, I needed to finish my route quickly and document the delivery. As a volunteer, I was expected to protect Mrs. Lee\u2019s privacy and not let her vulnerability slip into my work log. My mind raced, caught between the ticking clock of my delivery job and the trust Mrs. Lee placed in me as a volunteer."}
