As a police officer, I was expected to keep the peace, to step in if things turned violent. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you here until this is under control.\u201d But as the sun dipped lower, I glanced at my watch\u2014just two hours left before the polls closed. Today was election day, and as a citizen, I had a duty to vote, a right I valued deeply. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it, not this year. Yet here I was, caught between the uniform on my back and the ballot in my mind. The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my post. If I stayed, I might lose my chance to have a say in my country\u2019s future. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the expectations of duty and democracy."}
