The medical supply box in the backseat was marked \u201cURGENT\u2014HOSPITAL DELIVERY.\u201d I knew the hospital was counting on me to get it there on time; a delay could mean real trouble for patients. But as I turned onto Main Street, my mind kept drifting to my wallet, sitting on my kitchen counter at home. Today was the only morning I could swing by and grab my ID before work, and I needed it to vote. The polls would be open tomorrow, but my shift was packed\u2014no chance to get home then. My supervisor had drilled it into us: no late deliveries, especially not to the hospital. But I also felt the weight of my civic duty, the expectation that I\u2019d show up prepared and cast my ballot. My heart pounded as I neared the intersection\u2014one way led to the hospital, the other to my apartment. I could feel the pressure from both sides, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
