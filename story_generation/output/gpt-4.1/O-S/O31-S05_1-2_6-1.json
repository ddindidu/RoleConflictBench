As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, and the law was clear: this was a no-parking zone. But the driver, my client from my advocacy work, had just rushed into the building, desperate to file urgent legal documents before the deadline. I knew her case was growing more complex by the day, and she relied on me to provide clear, accurate legal advice\u2014advice that included following the law to the letter. Yet here I was, holding the power to issue a ticket or let it slide, knowing that either choice would compromise one of my roles. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, but so did my responsibility to guide her through the legal maze. The conflicting expectations pressed in on me, and I felt the tension coil in my stomach as I hesitated, caught between duty and loyalty, fairness and compassion, unable to move forward."}
