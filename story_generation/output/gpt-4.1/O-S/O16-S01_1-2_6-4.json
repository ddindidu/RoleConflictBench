As a doctor, I was seeing patients in the clinic, and my first appointment was a young woman with a sore throat. She looked anxious, and after a quick exam, I was confident it was strep throat. I knew I needed to prescribe antibiotics and explain the treatment plan clearly, as my patients expect thorough care and reassurance from me. But just as I was about to write the prescription, my phone buzzed with a message from the community center where I volunteer. One of the clients I\u2019d helped earlier in the week had quietly confided in me about a sensitive family issue while filling out forms. Now, the center\u2019s coordinator was asking if I could share any details to help connect her with resources. I felt torn\u2014my duty as a doctor demanded my full attention to my patient, while my role as a volunteer required me to protect the client\u2019s privacy. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
