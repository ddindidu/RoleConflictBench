As a carpenter, I knew the drill\u2014inspect every tool, check the blades, tighten the bolts, make sure nothing would put anyone at risk. Safety wasn\u2019t just a rule; it was a promise I made to myself and my crew. But as I glanced at my watch, my stomach tightened. My volunteer shift at the community center started in twenty minutes, and the coordinator had sent a reminder: \u201cWe need everyone on time. The kids count on us the moment the doors open.\u201d I could picture their eager faces, waiting for someone to show up and care. But here I was, torn. If I rushed the inspection, I\u2019d be breaking my own code and risking an accident. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the team and the kids who needed me. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
