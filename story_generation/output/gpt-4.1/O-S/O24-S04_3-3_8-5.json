My heart skipped\u2014Supreme Court ruling, it read, overturning the very precedent I was explaining. I froze, mind racing. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, to uphold the law as it stood, not as it was five minutes ago. I had to stop, reconsider, and possibly rewrite everything on the spot. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder: polls close in thirty minutes. I had my ID, but if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d lose my only chance to vote. The law demanded my presence here, but my civic duty as a voter demanded I be elsewhere, presenting my ID before the doors shut. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the courtroom silent, the clock ticking, my own expectations and responsibilities tearing me in two."}
