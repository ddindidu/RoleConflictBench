My scanner beeped: next stop, Mrs. Lee\u2019s apartment, two floors up. The package was marked \u201csignature required\u201d\u2014company policy, especially for anything over fifty dollars. I knocked, but there was no answer. I remembered the heat advisory blaring on the radio this morning, and I knew Mrs. Lee lived alone. She was in her eighties, and last week she\u2019d mentioned her air conditioner was acting up. \n\nAs a delivery person, I was supposed to secure the package, get the signature, and move on\u2014no exceptions. But as a neighbor, as a citizen, I felt a tug of responsibility. What if she was in trouble? Should I try the door, call out, or maybe alert the building manager? But then, what about the package? If I left it, I\u2019d be breaking protocol. If I waited, I\u2019d fall behind on my route, and my supervisor had already warned me about delays. My hand hovered over the doorbell, heart pounding, torn between the rules of my job and the duty I felt to someone who might need help."}
