My eyes caught a small child flailing in the deep end\u2014a clear violation of the swimming rules. My heart pounded; I knew I had to act fast to enforce safety and possibly save a life. But just as I prepared to intervene, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in five minutes. I was the only one assigned to unlock the community center, and a line of people was already waiting outside, relying on me to begin the day\u2019s service. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every life in the pool. As a volunteer, I was the key to opening the doors for those counting on our help. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
