As an architect, I knew the rules\u2014every detail mattered, every measurement had to be exact. Even if these inconsistencies seemed minor, I couldn\u2019t ignore them. Safety and compliance were non-negotiable, and my reputation depended on it. But as I traced the lines, my phone buzzed with another reminder: the advocacy meeting was starting in ten minutes. I was expected to be there, to represent my client, to show up on time as always. The meetings were routine, but my absence would be noticed, and I\u2019d let people down. My heart pounded as I weighed the plans in my hands against the clock on the wall. If I left now, I\u2019d have to push aside the nagging worry about the plans. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late\u2014again\u2014and risk my credibility as an advocate. The pressure built inside me, two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, caught between the demands of precision and presence."}
