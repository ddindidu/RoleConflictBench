As a judge, I knew the importance of reviewing every detail in the final briefs before tomorrow\u2019s complex civil trial. The parties had poured months of work into their arguments, and I owed them a fair, thorough analysis. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the high-stakes proceeding where I was expected as an advocate was set to begin in less than eight hours. My client\u2019s future hinged on my punctual presence and sharp focus. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding careful, solitary reflection, the other requiring immediate, public action. My mind raced with legal arguments and procedural questions, but my heart pounded with anxiety. I couldn\u2019t let either side down, but the hours were slipping away, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, each expectation as urgent and unforgiving as the other."}
