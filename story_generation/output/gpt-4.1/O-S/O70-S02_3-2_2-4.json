The package sits beside me, marked urgent, and I know a delay could mean real consequences for someone\u2019s care. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks, finally calling back. This is my chance to make a difference, to push for the bill that could change lives. But if I take the call now, I\u2019ll be distracted, maybe even late with the delivery. My supervisor has made it clear: on-time deliveries are non-negotiable, especially for medical runs. Yet, as an activist, I\u2019ve promised my group I\u2019d seize any opportunity to speak up. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility to the patient waiting for these supplies against the rare chance to influence policy. The phone keeps ringing, and I grip the steering wheel, torn between two urgent calls to action."}
