The signal ahead flickered yellow\u2014a minor delay, but enough to throw off the tight schedule. As a subway operator, I knew my responsibility: keep the train safe, avoid sudden stops, and do everything possible to stay on time. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I was the only one with the keys to the community center, and people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and start the morning service.\n\nMy mind raced. If I slowed down too much, I\u2019d be late for my shift, leaving a line of people in the cold. But if I pushed the train too hard, I\u2019d risk passenger safety and break the rules. Both roles demanded punctuality and reliability, but right now, I couldn\u2019t satisfy both. My heart pounded as I stared at the signal, torn between the expectations of my uniform and the trust of those waiting for me at the center."}
