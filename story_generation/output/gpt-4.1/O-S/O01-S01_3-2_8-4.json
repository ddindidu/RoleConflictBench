As the lead architect, I was expected to keep everything on track\u2014no delays, no excuses. The project was already behind, and my team looked to me to resolve every hiccup.

She leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal concern, trusting me to keep it private. My phone vibrated again\u2014another crisis at the site.
