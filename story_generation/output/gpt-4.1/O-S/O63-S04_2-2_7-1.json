As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my scheduled break, not a minute more, and never outside the allotted time. Today, though, my mind isn\u2019t on the next call. I keep glancing at the clock, calculating how long it\u2019ll take to get to the polling station. I have to vote before the polls close, but my break isn\u2019t for another hour, and the lines at the station are always long. If I leave early, I\u2019ll be flagged for not following protocol. If I wait, I might miss my chance to vote. The pressure from both sides is suffocating\u2014my duty to my job, my responsibility as a citizen. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between the demands of my employer and the call to participate in something bigger than myself."}
