She\u2019d been waiting all morning, and my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014timeliness is everything. But I was also due at the community center, where I volunteer every Thursday. Today, I was assigned to sort confidential medical files, a task that demanded my full attention and absolute discretion. The coordinator had stressed how important it was to respect the privacy of every person whose name appeared in those folders.\n\nAs I drove, my mind raced. If I rushed the delivery, I might make it on time, but I\u2019d be distracted, thinking about the files waiting for me. If I focused on the files, I risked another late delivery, disappointing Mrs. Lee and possibly getting a warning from my boss. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding speed and accuracy, the other requiring patience and trust. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the ticking clock and the silent promise of confidentiality."}
