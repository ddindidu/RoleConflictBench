As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Today, a few swimmers kept slipping into the shallow area without supervision, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on me. But my shift was ending, and I needed to get to the polling station before it closed. When I arrived, the line was long, but I was relieved to see it moving quickly. Suddenly, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name fit, but the new line was barely moving. The official\u2019s instructions were clear, and as a voter, I was supposed to follow them. But as a lifeguard, I was trained to assess situations and act for safety and efficiency, not just follow orders blindly. I felt torn\u2014should I obey the official, or stay in the faster line to make sure I could vote before my break ended? The expectations of both roles clashed inside me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between duty and obedience."}
