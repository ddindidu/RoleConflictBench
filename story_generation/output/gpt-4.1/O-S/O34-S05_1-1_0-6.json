The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the darkness. I savor the calm, knowing it won\u2019t last. My headset crackles with a routine check-in, and I respond, my voice steady, my mind alert for any sign of trouble. But my phone vibrates on the desk\u2014a reminder of the advocacy meeting scheduled in less than an hour. Attendance is mandatory, punctuality expected. I glance at the clock, calculating the time it would take to hand over my shift, the time it would take to reach the courthouse. \n\nMy supervisor expects unwavering focus, even when the skies are clear. The advocacy team expects my presence, my voice, my commitment. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the weight of two worlds pressing in. If I leave early, I risk letting my team down here. If I stay, I\u2019ll be late\u2014again\u2014for the meeting, and my credibility as an advocate will erode further. The radio crackles again, and I hesitate, caught between the silent sky and the waiting courtroom, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
