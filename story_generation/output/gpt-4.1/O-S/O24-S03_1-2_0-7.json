As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. The hearing was in two weeks, but I prided myself on being thorough and prepared well in advance. Just as I opened the first page, my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor who lived alone down the hall. As a citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some cold water or help her set up her fan. The courthouse demanded my focus, but the community expected my compassion. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one urging me to stay, the other to go. My mind raced, torn between the silent authority of the law and the quiet call of neighborly duty, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
