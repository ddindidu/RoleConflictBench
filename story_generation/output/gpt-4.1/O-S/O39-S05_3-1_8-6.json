Protocol is clear: leave everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014teamwork, safety, no delays. But as I join the stream of workers, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder for the advocacy meeting I\u2019m supposed to attend in twenty minutes, a meeting I can\u2019t afford to miss. They count on me to be there, to speak up, to show up on time. I picture the faces around the table, waiting, expecting my punctuality and commitment. My boots crunch gravel as I walk, torn between the urgent demands of the site and the equally pressing responsibility to my advocacy work. The weight of both roles presses on my chest, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I clench my fists, caught in the middle, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
