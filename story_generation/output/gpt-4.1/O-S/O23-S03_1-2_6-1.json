The networking event buzzed with laughter and conversation. A colleague, half a stranger, leaned in and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the juiciest case you\u2019re working on?\u201d My mind flashed to my client, trusting me with secrets that could ruin lives if spilled. I smiled, dodging the question, but the curiosity in the air pressed in.\n\nLater, as the event wound down, my friends texted, urging me to join them for music in my apartment. I hesitated, glancing at the clock\u2014quiet hours had started. My neighbor\u2019s window was open, and I remembered the last time she\u2019d asked for peace to study. As a citizen, I wanted to respect her rights and the building\u2019s rules. But as a friend, I didn\u2019t want to disappoint or seem uptight.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me: the lawyer, bound by confidentiality, and the citizen, bound by respect for others. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between loyalty, law, and the simple desire to belong."}
