As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, detailed opinion\u2014every fact, every conclusion meticulously justified. The deadline loomed, and I knew the parties were waiting for closure. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was my shift at the community center, where I volunteered to help people navigate difficult times. There, I was trusted to respect the privacy of those I served, to never let their stories slip beyond those walls.\n\nDuring a break, a colleague at the courthouse asked about my volunteer work. The conversation drifted, innocently enough, toward the people I\u2019d met. I felt the urge to share a story\u2014nothing sensitive, just a small anecdote. But even that felt like a betrayal of trust. At the same time, my mind kept circling back to the judgment I needed to write, the clarity and transparency expected of me as a judge. I felt torn, caught between the duty to be open and thorough in my legal role and the absolute confidentiality demanded by my volunteer work. The tension gnawed at me, and I hesitated, unsure which expectation to honor."}
