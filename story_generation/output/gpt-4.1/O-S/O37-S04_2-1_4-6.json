My client expects everything spotless, and I\u2019m responsible for making sure supplies don\u2019t run out. The next cleaning is in three days, and I know I should pick up more cleaner before then. But today, I\u2019m not just a cleaner\u2014I\u2019m also a voter. I rush to the polling station, my mind still on the supply list. The line is long, but I\u2019m relieved to be here on time. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name is right in the middle of that range. The new line is barely moving, while the original one is almost at the door. I hesitate, feeling the pressure to follow instructions, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about the errands I still need to run for work. If I wait longer, I might not have time to buy the cleaner. My roles are pulling me in opposite directions, and I stand there, torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
