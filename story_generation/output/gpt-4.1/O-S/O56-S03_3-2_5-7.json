I tried to stay calm, remembering my duty as a hairdresser: listen, apologize, and fix what I could, no matter how tired I felt. But as she ranted, my phone buzzed with a weather alert\u2014another heat advisory. My mind flashed to Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. She struggled in the heat, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check on her after work, just as any responsible citizen should. Now, I felt torn. The client\u2019s demands pressed on me from one side, the urgent need to ensure Mrs. Kim\u2019s safety from the other. My heart pounded as I weighed my professional obligation against my responsibility to my community, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me in opposite directions."}
