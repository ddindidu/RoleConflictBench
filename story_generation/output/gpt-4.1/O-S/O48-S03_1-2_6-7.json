She looked up with a hopeful smile, her eyes searching for company. I knew how much she cherished these moments, and as a nursing assistant, I felt the weight of my responsibility to offer her comfort and a listening ear. I sat beside her, holding her hand, trying to be present. Just then, my phone buzzed with an alert: a heat advisory had been issued. My mind flashed to Mr. Patel, my elderly neighbor who lived alone in my apartment building. As a citizen, I knew I should check on him, make sure he had water and his air conditioning was working. The expectation to help in emergencies pressed on me, but so did Mrs. Lee\u2019s need for companionship. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by my duty to my patient, the other by my responsibility to my community. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, uncertain which role I should answer first."}
