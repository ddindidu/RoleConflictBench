As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s part of my duty to protect citizens and property. But today was also election day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before anything else. The line at the polling station was long, but I joined it, glancing at my watch, calculating how much time I had before I needed to hit the gym.\n\nSuddenly, an official called out, \u201cVoters with last names A through M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with B. The new line was barely moving, while my original line was inching forward steadily. As a voter, I knew I should follow the officials\u2019 instructions, but as a police officer, I felt a responsibility to use my time wisely\u2014my fitness impacts my ability to serve. I could see the frustration on other faces, and I felt it too. Should I obey the official\u2019s request, or stay put to save time for my workout and, ultimately, my duty? The conflicting expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, heart pounding."}
