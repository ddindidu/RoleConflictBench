The deadline for closing the books was just hours away, and my manager had made it clear\u2014accuracy was everything. Any mistake could mean trouble for the company, and I prided myself on never letting anything slip. But as I double-checked the numbers, my phone buzzed with a local alert: a heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone on my floor. She struggled with the air conditioner and sometimes forgot to drink water. As a citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some cold water or help adjust her AC.
