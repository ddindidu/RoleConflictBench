My mind kept drifting to the trial tomorrow\u2014my client\u2019s fate hanging in the balance. As a cashier, I was supposed to follow every store policy to the letter, so when I noticed a small discrepancy in the register, my stomach tightened. It was just a few dollars off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but the rules were clear: report any irregularity, no matter how minor.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my client, desperate for reassurance. As their advocate, I was expected to be fully prepared, to represent them with unwavering focus and commitment. Yet here I was, torn between the obligation to my employer and the responsibility to my client. If I took the time to investigate the register issue, I\u2019d lose precious hours I needed to review case files. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be violating store policy. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the register, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that refused to let go."}
