Today, while waiting in line to vote, my radio buzzes\u2014dispatch needs me to answer a passenger\u2019s request for directions over the intercom. I glance at the voting line ahead; the official calls out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name starts with L. The new line is longer and slower, but the official\u2019s instructions are clear. I feel the weight of my uniform in my bag, a reminder of my duty to help passengers, even off the clock. My phone vibrates again\u2014another message from dispatch. I know I\u2019m expected to follow the election official\u2019s directions, but I also feel responsible for the passenger waiting for help. My mind races, torn between being a responsible voter and a helpful subway operator, both roles demanding my attention at the same moment."}
