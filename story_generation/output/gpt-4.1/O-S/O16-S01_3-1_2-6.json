A patient had just been rushed in, gasping for breath, his skin clammy and pale. As a doctor, I knew every second counted. I needed to focus, to sift through his symptoms and order the right tests, to make a diagnosis that could save his life. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d sent a message earlier, suggesting we reorganize the supply closet if we had a spare moment. It seemed trivial now, but I\u2019d promised to help, and she counted on me to set an example for the other volunteers. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The hospital expected me to be decisive and precise, but the volunteer team needed me to be reliable and supportive. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the quiet expectations of my volunteer commitment. I hesitated, caught in the space between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
