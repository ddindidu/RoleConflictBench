As a laborer, I know the drill\u2014protocol demands I leave everything and head straight to the muster point, no questions asked. My foreman\u2019s eyes sweep the site, counting heads, and I feel the weight of the team\u2019s safety on my shoulders. But my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket. It\u2019s my client, desperate for guidance as their case takes a complicated turn. As their advocate, I\u2019m expected to be available, to offer clarity and reassurance, especially now when every detail matters. I glance at the foreman, then at my phone, torn between the urgent call of safety and the pressing need for legal advice. My mind races, anxiety tightening my chest. If I answer, I risk breaking site rules and letting my team down. If I ignore the call, I fail my client when they need me most. The alarm blares, my phone buzzes, and I stand frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
