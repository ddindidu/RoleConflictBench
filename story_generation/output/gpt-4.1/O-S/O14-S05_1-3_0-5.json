As a scientist, I was expected to run the next phase of my experiment\u2014meticulously planned, but flexible enough that missing this slot wouldn\u2019t derail the project. The data could wait a week or two. But as an advocate, I was also preparing for a trial that could change my client\u2019s life. The hearing was set for the same day as the experiment, and my client\u2019s future hung in the balance. I could see her anxious face in my mind, trusting me to fight for her. My lab team, meanwhile, counted on my expertise to keep our research on track. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding precision and patience, the other urgency and unwavering presence. I felt torn, my loyalty and sense of responsibility pulling me in opposite directions, each role asking for all of me at the same time."}
