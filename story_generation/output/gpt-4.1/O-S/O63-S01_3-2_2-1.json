I want every detail, now.\u201d My script fluttered uselessly in my hand. I was supposed to stay calm, answer every question, and keep him on the line\u2014my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up angry.\u201d But as I tried to explain the offer, my eyes darted to the clock. My volunteer shift at the shelter started in fifteen minutes, and the coordinator had sent a group message this morning: \u201cWe can\u2019t be late today. Every minute counts.\u201d I pictured the shelter\u2019s doors opening, the line of people waiting, and the anxious faces of my fellow volunteers. My stomach twisted. I wanted to help Mr. Harris, to do my job well, but I also couldn\u2019t let the shelter down. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I felt my voice falter as I tried to juggle the demands, torn between the person on the phone and the people waiting for me across town."}
