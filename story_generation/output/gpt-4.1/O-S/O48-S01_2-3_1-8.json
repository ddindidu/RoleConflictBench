He winced with every movement, and I knew he needed extra care to avoid reopening his stitches. As a nursing assistant, my priority was to make sure he was safe and comfortable, so I moved slowly, supporting his back and legs. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive had come through. All volunteers were to immediately implement new safety procedures, or the service would be suspended. The message was clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays. My mind raced. If I left Mr. Lee now to follow the coordinator\u2019s instructions, he could be at risk. But if I ignored the directive, I\u2019d be going against the volunteer guidelines and possibly jeopardizing the entire program. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on Mr. Lee\u2019s needs, but the weight of the coordinator\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stood there, torn between my duty to my patient and my responsibility as a volunteer, unsure which role to answer first."}
