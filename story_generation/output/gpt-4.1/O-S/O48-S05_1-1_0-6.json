My hands moved gently, but my mind raced. As a nursing assistant, I knew how much she depended on me each morning\u2014her arthritis made even the simplest tasks painful. She smiled at me, grateful for the help, and I felt the familiar warmth of purpose. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a sharp reminder that I was expected at the advocacy meeting in less than fifteen minutes. They counted on me to be punctual, to speak up for those who couldn\u2019t, and to show unwavering commitment. I could already imagine the disappointed faces if I arrived late again. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my patient against the expectations of my advocacy team. Both roles mattered deeply to me, but in this moment, I felt pulled apart, unable to give my best to either. I hesitated, torn between finishing Mrs. Lee\u2019s morning routine and rushing out the door to make it to the meeting on time."}
