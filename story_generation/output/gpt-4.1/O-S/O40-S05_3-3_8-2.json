The owner\u2019s voice trembled as she asked how soon I could start repairs\u2014her family couldn\u2019t sleep safely another night. My mind raced with measurements, materials, and the urgency of shoring up the structure before it collapsed.

She was facing a deadline, her case teetering on the edge, and she needed my guidance now, not later. I could hear the panic in her words, the trust she placed in me as her advocate.
