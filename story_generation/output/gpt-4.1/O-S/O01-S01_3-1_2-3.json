The weight of responsibility presses on me\u2014one overlooked regulation could mean disaster for hundreds of lives. Today, after a long morning reviewing fire escape routes, I head to my afternoon volunteer shift at the community center. There, I help recent immigrants adjust to life in the city, offering guidance and a listening ear. During a break, a fellow volunteer asks about my work, and I mention the hospital project. The conversation drifts, and soon I\u2019m asked about the building\u2019s layout and safety features. I hesitate, aware that even general information could be sensitive, especially if it\u2019s about a hospital. My mind races: as an architect, I must be transparent about safety, but as a volunteer, I\u2019m bound to protect the privacy and trust of those I serve. The expectations of both roles tug at me, and I feel the tension rising, unsure how much I can share without betraying either responsibility."}
