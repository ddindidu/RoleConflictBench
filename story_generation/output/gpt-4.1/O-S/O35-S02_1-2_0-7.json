The pre-departure check is routine, but every step matters for safety and punctuality. My supervisor expects nothing less\u2014no shortcuts, no delays. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder that in five minutes, I\u2019m supposed to be live on the radio, sharing the message I\u2019ve poured my heart into as an activist. The community is counting on me to speak up, to educate, to inspire. I can almost hear the host\u2019s voice, waiting for my call, the audience tuning in. My hands tremble as I check the lights and doors, mind racing. If I rush or skip a step, I risk the trust placed in me as an operator. If I miss the radio segment, I let down my fellow activists and the people who need to hear our message. The seconds tick by, each one tightening the knot in my stomach. I\u2019m pulled in two directions, both vital, both demanding all of me."}
