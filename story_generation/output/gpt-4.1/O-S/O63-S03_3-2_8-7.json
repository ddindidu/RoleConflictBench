As a telemarketer, I knew the automated system would flag me if I left my desk even a minute early. The threat of disciplinary action loomed over every second. But as I glanced out the window, the city shimmered in the heat. The advisory had been all over the news\u2014dangerous temperatures, especially for the elderly. Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. I remembered her frail hands and the way she\u2019d smiled at me last week. Should I check on her now, risking a flag from the system and possible trouble at work? Or should I wait for my break, hoping she\u2019d be okay until then? My responsibility as a citizen tugged at me, urging me to act, but the rigid demands of my job held me in place. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the rules of my workplace and the call to help someone in need."}
