His clipboard is ready, eyes sharp, and I know every action will be scrutinized for the next hour. My mind races through the checklist: punctuality, safety, announcements\u2014no room for error. But as the train glides into the next station, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder: the polling place near my apartment closes in two hours, and today\u2019s ballot measure could change the zoning laws on my block. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the kind of citizen who doesn\u2019t just complain but participates. Yet, the schedule is tight, and the supervisor\u2019s presence means I can\u2019t ask for a break or risk being late. My heart pounds with the weight of both roles\u2014professional duty demanding flawless performance, civic responsibility urging me to make my voice heard. I stare at the tunnel ahead, torn between the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both at once."}
