The filtration system\u2019s warning light blinked red, and I knew the water was becoming unsafe. As the lifeguard, it was my duty to act fast\u2014shut down the pool, alert maintenance, and keep everyone out until it was fixed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling station would close in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote today, and I knew how important it was to have my voice heard. The community expected me to show up, just as they expected me to keep this pool safe. I stared at the swimmers, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. If I left now, I could just make it to the polls, but if I stayed, I could prevent a potential accident. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which duty I owed more."}
