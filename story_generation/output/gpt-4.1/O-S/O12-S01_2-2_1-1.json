My code was almost there\u2014a new feature that could really help our users\u2014but the last code review flagged performance issues. My team expects clean, efficient code, and I know if I leave it as is, I\u2019ll be letting them down. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. The shelter opens at 9, and today the roster is tight. They\u2019re counting on me to be there on time, ready to help as soon as the doors open. I could feel the pressure building in my chest. If I stay and fix the code, I\u2019ll be late for my shift, letting down the people who rely on us. If I leave now, I\u2019ll be letting my team down, and the code won\u2019t be up to standard. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
