My mind is half on the beeping scanner, half on my phone buzzing in my apron pocket. I know what it means\u2014the post about our cause is blowing up online, and this is the moment to jump in, to add a comment, to educate thousands who are suddenly paying attention. But I\u2019m a cashier right now, and my manager expects every transaction to be perfect, every customer greeted with a smile, every receipt handed over without delay. I glance at the next customer, an elderly woman counting her change, and feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I pause to type out a thoughtful comment, I risk holding up the line, making mistakes, maybe even getting in trouble. But if I let this viral moment slip by, I might miss the chance to make a real difference. My hands tremble as I hand over the receipt, torn between the beep of the register and the call of the cause."}
