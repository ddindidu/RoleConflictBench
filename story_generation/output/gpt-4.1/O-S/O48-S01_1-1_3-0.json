My morning rounds as a nursing assistant were running behind; Mr. Patel\u2019s room was next, and he always took extra time because he liked to chat. I knew I was supposed to be meticulous\u2014every patient\u2019s vital signs needed to be taken and logged before the nurses\u2019 meeting. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes. I was expected to be on time, to set a good example, even though I knew the other volunteers could cover for me if I was late. Still, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I rushed through my rounds, I might miss something important for a patient. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the volunteer coordinator who counted on my reliability. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the needs of my patients and my commitment to the community center, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
