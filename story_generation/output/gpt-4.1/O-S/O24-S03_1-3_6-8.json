I sat at my desk, the latest law review journal open before me, its pages filled with new legal theories I knew I needed to understand. As a judge, it was my duty to stay current, to ensure my rulings reflected the most recent developments. I was just beginning to lose myself in an article when the building alarms blared, jolting me upright. Through the window, I saw water creeping up the street, swirling around parked cars. The city\u2019s emergency alert flashed on my phone: flash-flood warning, evacuate and assist where possible. As a citizen, I was expected to help\u2014check on neighbors, guide people to safety, maybe even wade into the rising water. But the journal\u2019s pages tugged at me, a reminder of my judicial responsibility. My mind raced, torn between the pressing need to serve my community and the equally vital obligation to uphold the law through knowledge. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of the bench and the call of the street."}
