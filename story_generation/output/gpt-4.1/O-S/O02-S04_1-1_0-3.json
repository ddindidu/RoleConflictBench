As an engineer, I was expected to think ahead, to design solutions that would stand up to scrutiny and meet every requirement. The project was still in its early stages, so I knew I could propose alternative approaches later, but I felt the pressure to get it right from the start. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to vote today. As a voter, I was supposed to bring valid identification. I had my driver\u2019s license, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it had expired. Other IDs would work, and I could fetch a spare card later if needed, but the thought nagged at me. Should I double-check my ID now, or keep working while ideas were fresh? Both roles demanded my attention, each with its own set of expectations. I felt torn, anxious that I might let someone down\u2014my team, my community, or even myself. The weight of these conflicting responsibilities pressed on me as I stared at the clock, caught between the urge to perfect my designs and the civic duty waiting outside my office."}
