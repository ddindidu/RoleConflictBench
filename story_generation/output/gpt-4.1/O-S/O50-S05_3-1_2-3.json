As the hospital\u2019s on-call machine repairer, I was expected to drop everything and rush to the life-support device now flashing critical fault codes. Every second counted; a patient\u2019s life could hang in the balance. But at that very moment, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due in court in twenty minutes to represent a client at a minor hearing. The stakes there were low, but my client was anxious and counting on me to be present, to give them a voice in a system that often felt overwhelming. My mind raced, torn between the urgent technical crisis and my responsibility as an advocate. I could almost feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding immediate action to save a life, the other expecting steadfast support and representation. My hands trembled as I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
