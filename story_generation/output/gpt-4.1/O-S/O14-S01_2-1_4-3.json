The departmental meeting was in two days, and as a scientist, I was expected to present a clear, accurate summary of our findings. The numbers were promising, but the data was still raw, and some of the most interesting trends came from the personal stories shared by the volunteers I\u2019d been working with at the shelter. As a volunteer, I\u2019d promised to respect their privacy, to never share anything that could identify them or betray their trust. Yet, those stories gave context to the numbers\u2014made the research real and compelling. \n\nEarlier that day, a colleague had asked about the project, and our conversation drifted toward the people behind the data. I caught myself, hesitating, feeling the weight of both roles. The department wanted details, anecdotes to bring the data to life, but I could still hear the voices of the people I\u2019d helped, trusting me with their experiences. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my research and the promise I\u2019d made as a volunteer. The meeting loomed, and I still didn\u2019t know how I would reconcile the two."}
