The hospital project was massive, and the final safety inspection was due by the end of the day. Every line, every code, every exit route had to be perfect\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place down the street would close in two hours. There was a ballot measure that could change the face of my neighborhood, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, be the engaged citizen I always urged others to be. But the hospital\u2019s compliance checklist was still incomplete, and the contractor was waiting for my sign-off. If I left now, I\u2019d risk missing a critical error. If I stayed, I\u2019d forfeit my chance to have a say in my community\u2019s future. My mind raced, torn between my duty to public safety and my responsibility as a citizen. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
