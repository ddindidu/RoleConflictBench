The store is quiet, but my mind is racing. I know I have to be precise\u2014one wrong entry, and the drawer won\u2019t balance. My manager expects accuracy, and I can\u2019t afford a mistake, not with this much money. But as I hand the customer their receipt, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder about the free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend. I\u2019ve been meaning to go, to do my part as a responsible citizen, especially with flu season coming. I also have my tax documents neatly organized at home, ready to file early, just like I promised myself. But the clinic\u2019s hours overlap with my shifts, and I can\u2019t ask for time off now, not when we\u2019re short-staffed and the end-of-day balancing is so critical. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to my job, and my responsibility to my community. My hands tremble slightly as I close the register, caught between what I owe to my employer and what I owe to everyone else."}
