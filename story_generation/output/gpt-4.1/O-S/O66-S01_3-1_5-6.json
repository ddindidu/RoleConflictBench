As a taxi driver, I knew I had to slow down, watch for kids, and navigate the sudden lane shift from the construction detour. The traffic crawled, and I felt the pressure of the fare ticking up, but safety had to come first. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: if I had a spare moment before my shift, I should reorganize the supply shelves at the community center. I\u2019d promised to help, and I knew how much smoother things ran when the supplies were in order. But now, stuck in traffic, I realized I\u2019d barely have time to get there, let alone do extra tasks. My mind raced\u2014should I push the speed limit a little to make up time, risking the safety of the kids and breaking the law, or arrive late and let down the coordinator and the people counting on me? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
