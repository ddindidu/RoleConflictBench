My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay friendly, no matter what.\u201d The woman in front of me slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp as she complains about the wait. I force a smile, trying to keep my tone calm and patient, even as my heart pounds. I glance at the clock\u2014my volunteer shift starts in fifteen minutes, across town. I\u2019m the only one with the keys, and people will be waiting in the cold for me to open up. My phone buzzes with a reminder, and guilt twists in my stomach. I want to help everyone, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The customer\u2019s glare brings me back to the present, and I swallow hard, torn between the expectations of my job and my commitment to the people counting on me at the shelter."}
