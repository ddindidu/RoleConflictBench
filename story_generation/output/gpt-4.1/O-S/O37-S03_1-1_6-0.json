As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew the rules: always wear gloves when handling trash, always protect myself and others. But sometimes, when the task seemed small\u2014just a wrapper here, a coffee cup there\u2014I skipped the gloves, telling myself it was just this once. Later, as a citizen enjoying a rare weekend stroll in the park, I noticed a crumpled soda can lying on the grass, just steps from a trash bin. The no-littering signs glared at me, reminding me of my responsibility to keep public spaces clean. I hesitated. If I picked up the can, I\u2019d be doing my part as a good citizen, respecting the law and the community. But I had no gloves, and the cleaner in me recoiled at the thought of touching something potentially dirty, violating the very safety protocols I enforced at work. My hand hovered uncertainly, caught between the urge to do what was right for my city and the ingrained habits of my profession."}
