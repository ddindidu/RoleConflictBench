As a construction laborer, I knew the drill: sweep up my area, make sure every nail and scrap was cleared, and leave the site spotless and safe. But today, my mind was split. Just this morning, at the volunteer center, the coordinator had emphasized new safety steps\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. She\u2019d made it clear: follow the updated guidelines, even if it meant slowing down.\n\nNow, standing in the half-lit site, I glanced at the clock. If I stuck to the usual quick sweep, I\u2019d finish on time and keep the crew happy. But the volunteer coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my head. The new steps would take longer, and I\u2019d risk being late for my next shift. My coworkers expected me to keep pace, not hold them up. But as a volunteer, I was supposed to set an example, even here. My hands tightened around the broom. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between the two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet."}
