As I walked along the edge, I noticed a lane rope was snapped, its frayed end floating in the water. If I didn\u2019t fix it soon, the morning lessons would be thrown into chaos, and the kids\u2019 safety could be at risk. I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders\u2014everyone expected me to keep the facility safe and running smoothly.\n\nBut today was also election day. I\u2019d planned to vote before my shift, and I\u2019d carefully packed my wallet with my ID. As I reached for it, I realized I\u2019d brought the wrong card. I could still vote later, but only if I left the pool during my break to fetch the right ID from home. The thought of leaving the pool, even briefly, gnawed at me. If I focused on the lane rope now, I might miss my window to vote. If I left to get my ID, the swim lessons might be disrupted. The expectations from both roles pressed in, and I stood at the water\u2019s edge, torn between civic duty and immediate responsibility."}
