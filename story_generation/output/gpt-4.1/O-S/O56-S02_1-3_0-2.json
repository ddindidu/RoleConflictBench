I smooth my apron, ready to greet her and offer her a cup of tea, just as she likes. The receptionist is chatting idly, so I know it\u2019s on me to make Mrs. Patel feel welcome. But my phone vibrates urgently in my pocket\u2014a flurry of messages from my activist group. The police have started blocking the exits at the protest downtown, and panic is rising. I\u2019m supposed to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure no one gets hurt or trapped. My heart pounds as I glance at Mrs. Patel, who\u2019s already waving at me, expecting the comfort and attention she always receives here. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the calm, welcoming hairdresser, and the responsible activist who can\u2019t look away when people are in danger. My hands tremble as I try to decide which role I can bear to let down, even for a moment."}
