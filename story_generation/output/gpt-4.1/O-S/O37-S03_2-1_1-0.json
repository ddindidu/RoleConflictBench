Today, on my weekend stroll through the park, I spot a crumpled snack wrapper on the grass, just a few steps from a trash bin. My cleaner\u2019s instinct kicks in\u2014I want to pick it up, to restore order and cleanliness, just as I do at work. But then I notice a group of people nearby, watching. The park has clear no-littering signs, and as a citizen, I know I should respect public property and follow the rules. I hesitate, wondering if picking up the trash might be seen as interfering or even suspicious. Should I act on my urge to clean, or should I respect the boundaries of public space and the expectations of others? The wrapper lies there, and I stand frozen, torn between my two roles, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
