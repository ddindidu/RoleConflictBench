The receptionist was idly scrolling through her phone, but I knew Mrs. Lee expected me to greet her personally, to ask about her family and make her feel at home. I started toward her, scissors still in hand, when my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the law office. My advocacy client\u2019s hearing was in an hour, and new evidence had just come in. The case was complicated, and my client was counting on me to review every detail, to be sharp and ready to defend her interests in court. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectant eyes, the receptionist\u2019s indifference, and the urgent pull of my other client\u2019s legal crisis. My heart pounded as I stood between the salon chair and the back office, torn by the demands of comfort and justice, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved at the same time."}
