As a lawyer, I was bound to protect my client\u2019s secrets, no matter how much opposing counsel pressed me for details. Today, the pressure was relentless\u2014subtle threats, veiled promises, all aimed at prying loose information that could devastate my client\u2019s case. My phone buzzed: a reminder that I was due in court in fifteen minutes, not just as a lawyer, but as an advocate whose punctuality was expected and whose absence could tip the scales of justice. My heart pounded. If I stayed to fend off the counsel\u2019s advances, I risked being late to the hearing, letting down my client and colleagues who counted on my presence. If I left now, I might leave an opening for the opposition to exploit, or worse, appear evasive. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore.
