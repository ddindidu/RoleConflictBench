As a carpenter, I know how important it is to follow safety protocols\u2014being late means rushing, and rushing leads to mistakes. My supervisor always reminds us that one careless move can cause an accident. I hurried through the city streets, toolbox in hand, when I stumbled upon a crowd gathered for a demonstration. The street was blocked by police barricades, and the only way to the site was straight through the restricted area.\n\nA fellow protester caught my eye and urged me to step past the barricade, insisting it was our right to stand up for justice. But as a citizen, I know the law is clear: respect public property and the boundaries set for everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded. If I waited, I\u2019d be late and risk the safety of my coworkers. If I crossed, I\u2019d be breaking the law and disrespecting the city I care about. I stood at the edge of the barricade, torn between my duty as a careful carpenter and my responsibility as a law-abiding citizen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
