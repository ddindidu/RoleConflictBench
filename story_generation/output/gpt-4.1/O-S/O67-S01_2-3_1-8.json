As the ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. My foot hovered over the gas pedal, ready to weave through the city\u2019s midday traffic. But then my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cAll volunteers must follow the new safety checklist before leaving. Non-compliance could shut us down.\u201d My heart pounded. The checklist would take precious minutes, but skipping it risked the entire service. I could almost hear the patient\u2019s pain through the dispatch, but the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the desperate need to reach the patient quickly and the heavy responsibility to uphold the rules that kept our service running. The city\u2019s noise faded as I sat, paralyzed, wrestling with the impossible expectations pressing in from both sides."}
