As the ambulance driver, I knew my first responsibility was to get the vehicle there safely\u2014no rushing, no shortcuts, just steady, careful driving. But as a volunteer, I\u2019d just been at the morning briefing where the coordinator had emphasized new safety steps: a specific route to avoid construction, mandatory stops at every intersection, and a strict speed limit, even if it meant being late. The radio crackled with reminders, and I could almost hear the coordinator\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to follow every guideline to the letter. But the clock on the dashboard ticked closer to the shift change, and I knew the next crew was waiting, counting on me to be on time. My mind raced, torn between my duty to drive safely and my obligation to follow the new volunteer protocols exactly. The weight of both roles pressed on me as I approached the next intersection, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
