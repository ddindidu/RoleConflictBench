The smell of bleach clung to my hands, and I could still see dust in the corners of the hallway. As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to leave every room spotless, and my supervisor had just reminded me that today\u2019s inspection would be extra strict. I knew I couldn\u2019t rush\u2014every surface needed to shine, every bin emptied, every floor mopped until it gleamed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes. The coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind, \u201cPlease be on time\u2014every minute counts today.\u201d I pictured the people waiting at the shelter, counting on us to open the doors right on schedule. My heart pounded as I weighed the mop in my hand, torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to volunteering. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles expected nothing less than my full dedication."}
