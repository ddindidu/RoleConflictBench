She asked question after question, her voice trembling. I knew how important it was to be patient, to explain everything clearly and gently, to make sure she left feeling supported and understood. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the volunteer coordinator. I was supposed to be at the community center in ten minutes, helping with the food drive. They\u2019d just updated the safety protocols, and the coordinator had stressed that everyone needed to be on time and follow the new steps exactly. I could already imagine the disappointment in her voice if I was late or missed the briefing. Torn between my patient\u2019s need for reassurance and my commitment to the volunteer team, I felt the pressure mounting. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how to be the doctor Mrs. Lee needed and the reliable volunteer my team expected."}
