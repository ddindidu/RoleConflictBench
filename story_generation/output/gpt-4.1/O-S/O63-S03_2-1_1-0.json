The script in front of me only skimmed the surface, and I felt the pressure to keep the call going, to handle objections smoothly, to not let the customer sense my uncertainty. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them off the hook. Find a way to answer, keep them interested.\u201d I wanted to do my job well, to meet my targets, to be the telemarketer who could handle anything.\n\nLater, I walked through the park, headset off, scripts forgotten. The sun was warm, and the air was fresh. I sipped my coffee, passing a sign: \u201cNo Littering. Please Use Bins.\u201d My cup was nearly empty, and the trash bin was just a few steps away. But my phone buzzed\u2014another work message, another reminder to be available, to be responsive, even off the clock. I hesitated, cup in hand, torn between tossing it quickly to answer the message or taking the extra steps to the bin. I felt the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding efficiency, the other asking for responsibility. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between what I should do and what I was expected to do."}
