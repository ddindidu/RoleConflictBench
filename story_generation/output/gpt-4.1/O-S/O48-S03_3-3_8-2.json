As a nursing assistant, I knew my job was to be there for her, to offer comfort and a listening ear. I could still feel her trembling hand in mine, her voice barely a whisper as she asked, \u201cWill I be okay?\u201d I wanted to stay longer, to reassure her, but my shift was over and I had promised my friends I\u2019d join them at the demonstration downtown.\n\nThe crowd was thick, voices rising in chants for justice. Suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we mean it\u2014step over!\u201d They pointed to the barricade blocking off city property. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear: respect public property, don\u2019t cross the line. But the energy of the crowd was infectious, and I felt the weight of my own convictions pressing me forward. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to stand up for what I believed in and the responsibility to respect the rules. I hesitated, caught between the expectations of my two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
