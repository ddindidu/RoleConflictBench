As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew I was expected to keep the house spotless, but lately, I\u2019d only managed to tidy up the obvious messes and do a quick sweep of the shared spaces. The residents didn\u2019t seem to notice, but I felt guilty every time I skipped a corner or left dust on the shelves.\n\nJust as I finished stacking the chairs, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. The text was urgent: new procedures had to be followed immediately, or the service would be shut down. The list was long and detailed, and I could already feel the pressure mounting. I was supposed to be thorough at home, but now I was being pulled to follow strict guidelines at the volunteer site, too. My hands trembled as I looked at the clock, torn between the expectations of keeping the house clean and the demands of my volunteer role. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which role to prioritize."}
