The protest I\u2019d helped organize was taking a turn\u2014police had started blocking the exits, and people were scared. My activist friends needed me to help coordinate a safe response, to use my voice and presence to keep everyone calm and protected. But the client for the bookshelf was expecting an estimate by noon, and I still had to calculate the wood, hardware, and delivery costs before placing the order. If I delayed, the project would fall behind, and my reputation as a reliable carpenter would take a hit. My hands trembled, torn between the sawdust and the sirens, between the quiet order of my craft and the urgent chaos of the street. Both sides demanded all of me, right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in, forcing me to choose which part of myself I would let down."}
