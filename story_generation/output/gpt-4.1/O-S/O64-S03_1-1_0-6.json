My mind keeps drifting to the tax documents I organized last night, stacked neatly at home, ready for filing. I pride myself on being a responsible citizen\u2014paying taxes on time, following the rules, and doing my part for the community. This weekend, there\u2019s a free vaccine clinic at the community center, and I feel a strong pull to volunteer. It\u2019s the kind of thing I believe in, helping out where I can.\n\nBut as a cashier, my manager expects me to be here, especially on weekends when the store gets busy. I\u2019m supposed to process every transaction accurately, keep the line moving, and cover shifts when needed. If I ask for time off, I know it\u2019ll put pressure on my coworkers, and I might even risk my hours. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my duty to my job and my responsibility as a citizen. I stand at the register, wrestling with the choice, feeling the tension build as I scan another can of soup."}
