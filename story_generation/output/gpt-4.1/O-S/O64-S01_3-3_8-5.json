My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAlways smile, always be patient.\u201d The woman in front of me is red-faced, her voice rising as she complains about a pricing error. I force a smile, trying to soothe her, even as my heart pounds. I know I need to stay calm, to be the friendly face she expects, but my mind keeps drifting to the volunteer shift I just finished. There, I sorted files filled with private medical histories, each one a reminder of the trust placed in me to keep secrets safe.
