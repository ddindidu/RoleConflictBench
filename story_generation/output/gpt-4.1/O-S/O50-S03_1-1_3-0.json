Next week, I was scheduled to perform the routine maintenance\u2014cleaning, oiling, and checking every bolt\u2014during the planned shutdown. It was my responsibility to make sure everything ran smoothly, and I took pride in keeping the machines in top shape. As I strolled, I absentmindedly reached into my pocket and found a greasy rag I\u2019d used at work. I knew I shouldn\u2019t carry work items around, but old habits die hard. I glanced at the no-littering signs and the nearby trash bin, but the rag was soaked with industrial oil. Tossing it in the public bin could leak chemicals and harm the environment, violating my duty as a responsible citizen. But if I took it home, I risked contaminating my own space and possibly forgetting to dispose of it properly before the next maintenance. I stood there, torn between my role as a careful machine repairer and my responsibility as a law-abiding citizen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
