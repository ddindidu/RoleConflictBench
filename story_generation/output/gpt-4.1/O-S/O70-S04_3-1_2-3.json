The hospital needed these medical supplies within the hour\u2014lives could depend on it. As a delivery person, I prided myself on punctuality and accuracy; every package mattered, but this one felt especially urgent. My phone buzzed with a reminder: today was voting day. I\u2019d planned to stop at the polling station on my route, my ID ready in my wallet. But as I reached for it, I realized I\u2019d left my main ID at home, only my backup card in my bag. I could still vote with the spare, but I\u2019d have to double-check the requirements, maybe even swing by home later if there was an issue. The hospital loomed ahead, but the polling station was just a block away. My mind raced\u2014should I risk a quick detour to vote now, or stick to my delivery schedule and hope I\u2019d have time to return later? The pressure of both roles pressed in, each demanding my attention, each with its own consequences. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed what to do next."}
