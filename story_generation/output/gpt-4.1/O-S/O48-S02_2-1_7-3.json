She\u2019d just come out of surgery, and I could feel her fear in the way she gripped my fingers. \u201cWill I be okay?\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The petition to improve patient care standards was about to be sent to the state senator, and this was my last chance to add my name.
