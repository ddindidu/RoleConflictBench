As a cashier, I know the policy: every cent must be accounted for, and I\u2019m supposed to report even the smallest error. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: I\u2019m scheduled to be on a live radio show in five minutes to talk about environmental justice, the cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The store is busy, and my manager is watching. If I stop to fill out the paperwork and explain the discrepancy, I\u2019ll miss the radio segment. But if I leave it unreported, I\u2019m not following store policy. My mind races\u2014my coworkers expect me to be reliable, my activist friends are counting on my voice, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. I stare at the register, torn, as the seconds tick by."}
