The stakes were high\u2014my client\u2019s future, my reputation, the pressure from the firm. I needed every spare moment to review evidence and witness statements. As I hurried through the park, my phone buzzed with another urgent email from the senior partner. Distracted, I finished my coffee and, without thinking, tossed the empty cup toward the trash bin. It bounced off the rim and landed on the grass. I glanced around\u2014no one seemed to notice, but the no-littering signs were clear, and the bin was only a few steps away. As a citizen, I knew I should pick it up, respect the law, and set an example. But as a lawyer, every minute counted, and I felt the weight of my client\u2019s case pressing down on me. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and my responsibility as a member of the community."}
