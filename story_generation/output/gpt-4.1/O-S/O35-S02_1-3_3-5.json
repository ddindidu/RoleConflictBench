A passenger\u2019s voice crackled through, asking for directions to the transfer line. I knew I had to answer quickly and clearly\u2014passenger safety and assistance were my top priorities. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The activist group chat was exploding: the critical vote on transit funding was happening now, and the undecided representative was taking calls for the next thirty minutes. I was the only one in our group with a personal connection to her. My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t call, we might lose the chance to sway her. But if I got distracted, even for a moment, I could miss a safety alert or fail to help a confused rider. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I gripped the microphone, torn between the voice on the intercom and the call I needed to make, feeling the impossible pull of duty from both sides."}
