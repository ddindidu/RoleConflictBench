My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 voices, all waiting for clearance, and I felt the weight of every decision\u2014one wrong call, and chaos could unfold. The supervisor\u2019s voice reminded me: keep delays minimal, keep everyone safe. But my phone vibrated on the desk, a reminder of my other life.
