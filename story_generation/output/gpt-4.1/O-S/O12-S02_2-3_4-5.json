The product manager pinged me again: \u201cWe need your input on the API design before noon. The other teams can\u2019t move forward without it.\u201d My calendar was already blocked for a cross-team call in fifteen minutes. I knew how much everyone was counting on me to clarify the technical details\u2014if I didn\u2019t, the whole project could stall.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from my activist group. The state legislature was holding a surprise vote on the environmental bill we\u2019d been fighting for all year. The outcome hinged on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a personal connection. \u201cYou have to call now,\u201d the message read. \u201cThis is our shot.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. I could almost hear the clock ticking, each second pulling me in two directions. My team needed me to keep the project on track, but my cause needed me to make a difference\u2014right now. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, and I didn\u2019t know which one I\u2019d let down."}
