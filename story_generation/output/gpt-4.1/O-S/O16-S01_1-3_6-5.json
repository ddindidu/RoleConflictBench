A young woman with a sore throat waited outside, her chart in my hands. As a doctor, I was expected to prescribe the right medication, to listen carefully, and to treat her with the utmost professionalism. But today, I was also here as a volunteer, helping the clinic sort through old files\u2014files filled with sensitive medical histories that I had promised to keep confidential.\n\nAs I flipped through the patient\u2019s chart, I realized her name matched one I\u2019d seen earlier in the confidential files. The file contained information about a condition she hadn\u2019t mentioned during her check-up. My mind raced. Should I bring it up to ensure I prescribed the safest treatment, or should I respect the boundary of confidentiality I\u2019d sworn to uphold as a volunteer? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different. My hands trembled slightly as I closed the chart, caught between my duty to provide the best care and my promise to protect her privacy."}
