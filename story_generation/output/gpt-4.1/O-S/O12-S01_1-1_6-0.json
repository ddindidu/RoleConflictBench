Still, the expectation was clear: as the team\u2019s go-to troubleshooter, I was supposed to jump on these issues, no matter how small. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift started in twenty minutes. I\u2019d promised to be on time, but I also knew the first half hour was always slow, and the other volunteers could easily cover for me if I was late. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head, \u201cWe need quick turnarounds.\u201d At the same time, I remembered the coordinator\u2019s gentle but firm reminder last week: \u201cReliability matters.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the responsibility to my team and my commitment to the community. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I weighed which expectation I would have to let down."}
