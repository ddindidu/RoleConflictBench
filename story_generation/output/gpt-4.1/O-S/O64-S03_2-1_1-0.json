My manager expects accuracy\u2014no mistakes, no shortchanging, no missed barcodes. I feel the pressure mounting with every beep, every sigh from the next person in line. Later, on my walk home through the park, I unwrap a snack, glancing at the \u201cNo Littering\u201d sign and the trash bin just a few steps away. My legs ache from standing all day, and I\u2019m tempted to toss the wrapper onto the grass, just this once. But as a citizen, I know I should respect the rules, keep the park clean for everyone. The wrapper feels heavy in my hand, a symbol of all the little choices I make\u2014at work, at home, in public. I think about the expectations: the store\u2019s demand for efficiency, society\u2019s call for responsibility. My mind races, torn between the urge to cut corners and the duty to do what\u2019s right, even when no one is watching."}
