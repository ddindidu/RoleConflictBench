This morning, an attorney cited a brand-new appellate decision\u2014one I hadn\u2019t yet read. The next session is in a few hours, and I know I must review the opinion thoroughly to ensure a fair ruling. My mind is already racing through the possible implications, the nuances I might miss if I rush. \n\nBut today is also Election Day. I promised myself I\u2019d vote, fulfilling my civic duty. The polling station is open all day, and my schedule is light, but I can\u2019t shake the anxiety. What if I get caught up in legal research and lose track of time? What if the lines are unexpectedly long? I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014justice demands my diligence, democracy my participation. I sit at my desk, torn, the appellate decision open on my screen, my voter registration card in my pocket, wrestling with the impossible expectation to be fully present in both worlds at once."}
