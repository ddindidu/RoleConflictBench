Management would be thrilled, and I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s praise. But now, standing in the polling station, I was just another citizen, ballot in hand. The poll worker peered at my envelope, frowning at the smudged signature. \u201cCould you please re-sign this? It\u2019s for your vote to count,\u201d she said gently. I hesitated, remembering the strict compliance training at work\u2014never alter a document after the fact, always follow protocol to the letter. My telemarketer instincts screamed at me to avoid anything that might look improper, to protect myself from accusations of tampering. But as a voter, I was expected to trust the process and cooperate with officials. My hand hovered over the pen, heart pounding, caught between the rules drilled into me at work and the instructions of the poll worker. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to listen to."}
