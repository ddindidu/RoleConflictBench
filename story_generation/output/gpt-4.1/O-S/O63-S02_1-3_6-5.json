As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to stick to my assigned hours, but today the call volume is unusually light, and my supervisor has casually mentioned we can take our breaks whenever it\u2019s slow. My phone buzzes with a message from my activist group: a crucial, tie-breaking vote on the environmental bill is happening in less than an hour. The group needs someone to urgently call the undecided representative\u2014someone who can make a difference. My heart pounds. I know I\u2019m the best person for this; I\u2019ve built a rapport with the representative\u2019s aide. But if I step away from my desk now, even with the flexible break policy, I risk being seen as unreliable or taking advantage of the system. I stare at my headset, torn between my duty to my job and my responsibility to the cause I care so deeply about. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
