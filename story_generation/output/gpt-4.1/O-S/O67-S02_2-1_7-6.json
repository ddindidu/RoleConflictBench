Dispatch says the patient\u2019s injury isn\u2019t life-threatening, but I know every second counts for their comfort and care. My training echoes in my mind: drive safely, don\u2019t endanger others, no matter the pressure. But my phone buzzes on the dashboard\u2014my activist group\u2019s post is exploding online. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for, the chance to educate thousands, maybe more, if I just add the right comment now. My heart pounds. I can almost see the ripple effect, the awareness we could raise. But my hands are locked on the wheel, eyes darting between brake lights and pedestrians. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014responsibility to my patient, duty to my cause. The urge to reach for my phone is almost physical, but the city\u2019s chaos demands my full attention. I wrestle with the impossible choice, torn between the lives in my care and the movement in my heart, knowing I can\u2019t give both what they deserve in this moment."}
