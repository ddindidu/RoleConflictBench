My client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014rested on my ability to represent them in court. The trial was set, the judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator. The shelter had received an urgent directive: new safety procedures had to be implemented immediately, or we risked being shut down. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear\u2014every volunteer was needed, and I was expected to help lead the changes. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations from both sides closing in. My client needed me in court, but the shelter needed me, too. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between my professional duty and my commitment to the people who depended on our service. The demands clashed in my mind, and I wondered how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
