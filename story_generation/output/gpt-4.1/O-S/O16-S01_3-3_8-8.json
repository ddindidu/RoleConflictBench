A patient had just been wheeled in, feverish and delirious, the infection spreading so quickly that every second counted. As a doctor, I knew I had to act fast\u2014prescribe the strongest antibiotics, start the IV, and monitor every vital sign. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a new directive, strict and non-negotiable, outlining procedures that all volunteers must follow immediately. If I didn\u2019t comply, the entire service could be shut down, leaving countless people without help. My mind raced. The patient\u2019s life depended on my medical judgment, but the coordinator\u2019s rules were clear and urgent. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, caught between the oath I\u2019d taken as a doctor and the commitment I\u2019d made as a volunteer."}
