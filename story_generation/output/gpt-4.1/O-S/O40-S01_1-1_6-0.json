She held out a small, splintered wooden train\u2014her son\u2019s favorite toy, she explained, and asked if I could fix it. I could see the damage was more than superficial; it would take time to repair it properly. She needed a quote before the end of the day, and I could tell how much it meant to her.\n\nBut I glanced at the clock. My volunteer shift at the community kitchen started in twenty minutes. I was expected to be there on time, to set an example for the newer volunteers. Still, I knew the others could handle the first part without me if I was a little late. My hands hovered over the toy, my mind racing between the responsibility to my customer and my commitment to the kitchen. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
