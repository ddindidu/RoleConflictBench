It was Sam, my closest friend, sobbing on the other end. Through broken words, he told me his father had just passed away. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort he needed. I knew he needed me to stay on the line, to let him talk, to just be there.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind drifted to the email I\u2019d read before bed: Product had scheduled a big brainstorming session for tomorrow morning. Attendance was technically optional, but I knew how much my team valued my input, especially since we were about to design a feature I\u2019d been championing. If I missed it, I\u2019d lose my chance to shape the direction, maybe even let my team down.\n\nSam\u2019s voice cracked, pulling me back. I wanted to give him all my attention, but the pressure of my other world pressed in. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, unsure which role needed me more right now."}
