I\u2019m free any evening.\u201d I smiled, picturing her excitement, and scrolled through my calendar. For once, my evenings were open too. I started to type a reply, but my laptop pinged\u2014a Slack alert from work. My heart sank as I read the urgent message: \u201cProduction outage. Users locked out. Root cause: your module. Can you jump on a call ASAP?\u201d \n\nMy mind raced. I knew how much she valued our time together, especially after weeks of late nights and missed plans. She\u2019d been patient, but I could sense her hope for a real evening with me. At the same time, the outage was critical. Customers were frustrated, and my team was counting on me to fix it fast. I felt the pressure from both sides, the weight of her expectations and my responsibility to my job. My fingers hovered over my phone and keyboard, torn between sending her a date suggestion or joining the emergency call. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me tonight."}
