My team\u2019s weekly meeting was starting in five minutes\u2014a routine catch-up, but my manager always expected everyone to participate, to show we were engaged and supportive colleagues. I could already hear the notification pinging on my laptop, the agenda open and waiting. But just down the hall, a family sat in a quiet room, waiting for me. As their doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, and the clearest words I could find to explain the diagnosis that would change their lives. I could picture their anxious faces, the questions they\u2019d ask, the comfort they\u2019d need. My phone buzzed again: \u201cAre you joining?\u201d from a teammate. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I missed the meeting, would my colleagues think I wasn\u2019t committed? But if I delayed the conversation with the family, I\u2019d be failing them at their most vulnerable moment. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two doors, two sets of expectations, and the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
