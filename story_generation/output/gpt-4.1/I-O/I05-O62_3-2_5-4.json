As her mentor, I was expected to share every detail, every nuance, because a single mistake in a real emergency could mean disaster. She looked at me, waiting for my next instruction, her face tense with concentration. Just then, I noticed the lane rope at the far end of the pool had snapped, its frayed end floating dangerously close to the swimmers. As the lifeguard, I was responsible for maintaining all equipment, and a broken lane rope could disrupt the upcoming swim lessons, maybe even cause an accident. My mind raced\u2014should I leave Maya mid-lesson, risking her missing a crucial step, or ignore the broken rope a little longer, hoping it wouldn\u2019t cause trouble? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I hesitated, caught between two urgent needs."}
