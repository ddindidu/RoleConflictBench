He barely looked up from the couch, his shoulders slumped, the email from his boss still open on his laptop. I wanted nothing more than to sit beside him, hold his hand, and tell him everything would be okay. But my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch reminding me about the high-value package I was supposed to deliver within the next thirty minutes. The recipient had to sign in person, and I needed to check their ID. If I missed this window, I could get written up, maybe even lose my job. Alex needed me, but so did my job. My heart twisted as I glanced between him and the package by the door, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I could almost hear the clock ticking, each second stretching the distance between being the girlfriend he needed and the delivery person I was expected to be."}
