My colleague, Sarah, had just messaged me, reminding me that my part of the project was due in an hour. She needed my data to finish her section, and any delay would throw off the whole team\u2019s timeline. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014everyone was counting on me to deliver, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled to life. Dispatch called in a new emergency: a patient with a broken bone, only a few miles away, but city traffic was already building up. As the ambulance driver on shift, I was expected to respond immediately, no hesitation. Every minute could mean more pain for the patient, and I knew how crucial a quick response was.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the unfinished spreadsheet and then at my keys. Both roles demanded my full attention, both urgent in their own way. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
