As a mentor, I was supposed to meet with Maya, my mentee, in an hour. She was on the cusp of a major promotion, and she needed my guidance to navigate the final interview. She looked up to me, trusted me to help her grow, and I wanted nothing more than to see her succeed. But the thick stack of trial transcripts on my desk reminded me of my other role\u2014judge. The bench trial had just ended, and the parties were anxiously awaiting my written judgment. The law demanded clarity, precision, and timeliness; the court expected my findings within thirty days. I could feel the clock ticking, the pressure mounting from both sides. If I devoted time to Maya, I risked falling behind on my judicial duties. If I focused on the judgment, I\u2019d let Maya down at a crucial moment. My mind raced, torn between nurturing a promising career and upholding the integrity of the court. The phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMaya\u2014mentoring session in 15 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded as I stared at the blank page, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
