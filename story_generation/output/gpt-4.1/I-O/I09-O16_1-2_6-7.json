It was Mrs. Lee, my neighbor from across the hall, looking anxious. \u201cCould you please receive my package today? I have to rush to the pharmacy for my mother,\u201d she asked. I nodded, knowing she often missed deliveries and relied on me for these small favors. Just as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the clinic. One of my patients, Mr. Patel, was having a flare-up of his autoimmune disease and needed an urgent adjustment to his treatment plan. The pharmacy was waiting for my prescription, and any delay could worsen his condition. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the neighbor who should be present and helpful, and the doctor who must act swiftly and precisely. My mind raced, torn between staying home for Mrs. Lee\u2019s delivery and heading to the clinic to ensure Mr. Patel got the care he needed. The clock ticked, and I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
