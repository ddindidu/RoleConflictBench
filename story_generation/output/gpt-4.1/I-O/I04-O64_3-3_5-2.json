My shift was almost over, but this was the most important part\u2014balancing the register, making sure every cent matched. My manager trusted me with this responsibility, and I knew any mistake could mean hours of paperwork and suspicion. Just as I was about to finish, my phone buzzed with a frantic call. It was Sam, my best friend. His voice shook as he told me his car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me right now. I could hear the panic in his voice, the cars rushing past him in the dark. My hands trembled as I looked at the cash, then at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my post, risking mistakes and letting down my boss. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting Sam down when he needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between duty and friendship, not knowing which to choose."}
