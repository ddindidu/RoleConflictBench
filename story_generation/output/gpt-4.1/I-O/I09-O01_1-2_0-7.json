As I stepped into the corridor, I nearly collided with Mrs. Lee from next door. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly greeting. I forced a quick hello and a tight smile, but my phone buzzed insistently\u2014another message from the contractor about a delivery delay. I knew I should stop, ask about her weekend, maybe even help her with the groceries she was juggling. That\u2019s what a good neighbor would do. But as an architect, I was already late for a site meeting, and every minute counted toward keeping the project on schedule. My heart pounded with guilt and frustration, torn between the urge to be present for Mrs. Lee and the pressure to manage my team efficiently. I stood there, caught in the corridor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
