My phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. Glancing at the screen during a red light, I saw it was my friend, Sarah. She\u2019d texted, \u201cCan you do a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with these furniture instructions and need your help!\u201d I knew she\u2019d just moved in and was struggling to get settled. As her friend, I wanted to be there for her, especially since she\u2019d helped me so many times before. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to keep my full attention on the road, ensuring the safety of the vehicle and everyone around me. The urge to pull over and help her was strong, but I also felt the weight of responsibility in my hands. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I owed my friend and the duty I owed my job. The phone buzzed again, and I felt my heart pounding, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
