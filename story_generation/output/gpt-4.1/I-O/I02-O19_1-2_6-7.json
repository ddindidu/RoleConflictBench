Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your plans?\u201d The misunderstanding about our weekend plans had clearly upset her, and I knew she expected me to call and talk things through, to resolve it before it grew into something bigger. But as I looked up, the workshop speaker was already introducing the new prescription guidelines\u2014information I needed to stay sharp as a pharmacist and provide the best care for my patients. My supervisor had emphasized the importance of attending, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d pay close attention. My phone buzzed again, Mia\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest. Should I step out and call her, risking missing crucial updates? Or should I stay, hoping she\u2019d understand, even though I knew she needed reassurance now? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
