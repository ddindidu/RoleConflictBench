I always seem to miss the delivery guy.\u201d I smiled and nodded, knowing how much she relied on me for these little favors. But as I glanced back at my workbench, I saw the clutter piling up\u2014scraps of wood, scattered nails, and tools left out. As a carpenter, I knew the risks: a messy workspace could mean a nasty accident, and I\u2019d promised myself to never cut corners on safety. But if I stayed in the garage to tidy up, I might not hear the doorbell or catch the delivery for Mrs. Kim. If I waited by the front window, I\u2019d be leaving my work area in a hazardous state. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn\u2014wanting to be a good neighbor, but also a responsible craftsman. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of two roles I cared about, unsure which to put first."}
