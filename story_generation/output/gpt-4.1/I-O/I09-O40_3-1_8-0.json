She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries, especially since the building was expecting a power interruption. I agreed, knowing how important it was for neighbors to look out for each other. But as soon as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I had to be at the construction site early today. As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to be late; safety briefings start sharp, and missing them means risking not just my job, but everyone\u2019s safety. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I waited for the delivery, I\u2019d be late to the site. If I left now, Mrs. Lee\u2019s packages might sit in the dark hallway, or worse, go missing. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable neighbor she trusted and the responsible carpenter my team depended on. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen in my kitchen, heart pounding, unsure which role to let down."}
