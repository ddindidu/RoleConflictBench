I\u2019m really upset about what you said earlier.\u201d My stomach twisted. As a friend, I knew I had to call him right away, apologize, and explain myself before the misunderstanding grew. Sam always valued honesty and quick resolution, and I owed him that. But as I reached for my phone, my laptop chimed with an urgent email from my firm: the merger contract I\u2019d been waiting for had just arrived. The client was on edge, and the clauses needed immediate review\u2014any delay could cost them millions. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my friend and the responsibility to my client. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone in one hand and the contract in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
