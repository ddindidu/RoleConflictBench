I glance at the screen and see a message from Sam, my closest friend. His reply is curt, and I can tell he\u2019s hurt\u2014he\u2019s misunderstood my earlier text. My chest tightens with guilt. I know I should call him right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding festers. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate openly, resolve things before they grow. But Mrs. Lee is waiting, her eyes anxious as she asks about her recent bloodwork. As her doctor, I owe her my full attention, to answer her questions with patience and empathy. I can\u2019t rush through this, not when she trusts me with her health. My mind races, torn between the urge to step out and call Sam, and the responsibility to be present for Mrs. Lee. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I can\u2019t give at the same time. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next."}
