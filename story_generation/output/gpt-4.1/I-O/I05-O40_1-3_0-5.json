Tomorrow, I\u2019d be starting the biggest carpentry project of my career\u2014a custom library for a local school. The pressure to get every detail right weighed on me; I knew I needed to spend the evening poring over the technical documents, making sure I understood every joint and angle.\n\nJust as I reached for my pencil, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, a junior colleague from work, asking if I had a moment to chat about whether he should take a new job offer. He\u2019d always looked up to me for advice, and I\u2019d made it a point to be there for him, even if it was just for small decisions. I could hear the uncertainty in his message, the expectation that I\u2019d help him sort through his options.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. The blueprints demanded my full attention, but so did Sam\u2019s trust in me as a mentor. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to my craft and the obligation to guide someone who counted on me."}
