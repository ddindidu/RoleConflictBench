She gave me a tight smile, and I could feel her patience wearing thin. I know the building expects us to keep noise down, especially in shared spaces, and I hate the thought of being that neighbor\u2014the one everyone complains about. But as I hurried to the construction site, my mind shifted to the new notice on the board: an optional training session next week. The foreman hinted that those who attend are seen as more committed, and I want to show I\u2019m serious about my job. But the session is in the evening, the same time I usually walk my dog to keep him calm and quiet for the neighbors. If I go to the training, my dog will be cooped up, likely barking and disturbing everyone. If I skip it, I might look like I\u2019m not a team player. The pressure from both sides is building, and I can\u2019t see a way to meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
