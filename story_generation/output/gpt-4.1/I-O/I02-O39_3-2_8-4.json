It\u2019s her\u2014again. We\u2019ve been arguing for days, but this time her message is different: \u201cWe need to talk now. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d My heart pounds. I know if I don\u2019t respond, things could fall apart for good. But as I set the bag down, I spot a slick, oily puddle right in the middle of the walkway. Guys are moving heavy loads back and forth, and if someone slips, it could be bad. My foreman always says safety comes first, and I know I should grab the mop and take care of it right away. But my phone keeps vibrating, her words echoing in my head. I\u2019m torn\u2014if I don\u2019t answer, I might lose her. If I walk away from the spill, someone could get hurt.
