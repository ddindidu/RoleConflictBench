The deadline was generous, and I knew my colleagues could keep working without my part for a few more days. Still, I felt the unspoken expectation to stay on top of things, to be reliable, to not let the team down. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was time to check the cleaning supply inventory at the house I cleaned every afternoon. I pictured the nearly empty bottle of disinfectant and the dwindling paper towels. If I didn\u2019t check and restock today, the supplies might run out before my next visit, and the family would be left without what they needed. I felt the tug of both roles: the responsible colleague who should stay and finish the spreadsheet, and the diligent cleaner who couldn\u2019t let the household down. My chest tightened as I weighed the silent expectations, torn between the neat rows of numbers on my screen and the shelves of supplies waiting for my attention."}
