Why don\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve been arguing more lately, and I know she expects me to call and clear things up right away. I want to fix this, to show her I care, but the headset presses against my ear, grounding me in the tower. \n\n\u201cTower, this is Delta 452, requesting altimeter setting,\u201d crackles the radio. My hand hovers over the mic. The pilots rely on me for precise, timely information\u2014there\u2019s no room for distraction or delay. I can\u2019t let them down, not even for a second. But Mia\u2019s words echo in my mind, the weight of her disappointment heavy. \n\nI stare at the blinking cursor on my phone, torn between the urgent need to reassure her and the unyielding responsibility to the pilots in my airspace. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice, caught between the woman I love and the lives in the sky."}
