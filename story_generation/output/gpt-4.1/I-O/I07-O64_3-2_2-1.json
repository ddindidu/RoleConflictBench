The line at the checkout stretched almost to the entrance, customers shifting impatiently, baskets overflowing. As the cashier, I was expected to keep things moving, scan each item quickly, and handle payments without error. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the team meeting upstairs. As a colleague, I was supposed to be there, especially today, when we\u2019d be finalizing decisions that would affect our whole department. I could already imagine my manager\u2019s disappointed look if I missed it, and the subtle frustration from my teammates if I didn\u2019t contribute. Yet, if I left now, the line would stall, customers would complain, and my supervisor on the floor would be furious. I felt torn, my mind racing between the demands of my team and the needs of the customers in front of me, both expecting my full attention at the same time. My hands trembled slightly as I handed back change, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between my two roles, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to move."}
