My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money, and I knew he expected me to reach out, to smooth things over, to be the one who resolved our conflicts. But my eyes kept drifting back to the plans in front of me. There were small inconsistencies in the design\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to nag at me. As an architect, I was expected to catch these things, to ensure every detail was safe and compliant, even if it meant staying late or double-checking every measurement. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I called Alex now, I\u2019d lose precious time to fix the plans. If I ignored him, the rift between us might widen. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move."}
