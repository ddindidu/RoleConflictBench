My colleagues were dissecting the latest project decisions made by Mark, a mutual acquaintance. I felt the familiar pressure to join in, to nod along or add my own opinion, but I remembered my promise to myself: never gossip, never speak ill of others behind their backs. Yet, as an architect, I had just reviewed Mark\u2019s latest plans and noticed a few elements that, if left unaddressed, could compromise the building\u2019s safety. My professional duty demanded I speak up, to ensure compliance and protect everyone involved. But here, in this group, any comment could easily slip into criticism, feeding the gossip I wanted to avoid. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect my colleague\u2019s reputation and the responsibility to uphold safety standards. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which expectation I could afford to betray."}
