My mentor had managed to squeeze in a short meeting for me today, despite a schedule that was bursting at the seams. I knew how valuable her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of it. At the same time, as the scientist responsible for the lab, I was acutely aware that the equipment maintenance checklist was due soon. No issues had cropped up, but I\u2019d always prided myself on being thorough and never cutting corners with safety. If I left the maintenance for later, I risked running behind or missing something important. But if I stayed to double-check everything now, I\u2019d be late for my mentor, disrespecting her effort to make time for me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and my responsibility to the lab. I could feel my stomach knotting as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, something would have to give."}
