I baked a small cake, hoping to break the ice with my neighbors. As I stepped into the hallway, cake in hand, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled, and I smiled back, ready to introduce myself and offer a slice. But my phone buzzed\u2014my telemarketing shift was starting. I ducked back inside, balancing the cake and my headset, and dialed the first number on my list. The customer on the other end immediately launched into a barrage of technical questions about the new service. My script only covered the basics, and I could feel my voice faltering as I tried to sound confident. At the same time, I heard a gentle knock\u2014Mrs. Kim, probably wondering if I was still coming by. I felt torn, wanting to be the friendly neighbor everyone expects, but also needing to handle the call professionally, as my supervisor demanded. My heart pounded as I stared at the cake, headset pressing into my ear, caught between two worlds and unsure which to choose."}
