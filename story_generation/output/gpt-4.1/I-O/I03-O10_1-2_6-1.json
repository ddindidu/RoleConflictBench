He\u2019s upset because I forgot to mention that I\u2019d be working late this weekend, and now our plans are up in the air. I know he expects me to call, to talk things through and smooth over the misunderstanding before it grows into something bigger. But my laptop screen is filled with spreadsheets, numbers blurring together as the deadline for closing the books looms. My manager has already reminded me twice that everything needs to be perfect\u2014no errors, no delays. I can feel the pressure mounting from both sides: Alex\u2019s disappointment and my boss\u2019s expectations. My heart pounds as I weigh the need to resolve things with Alex against the urgent demand to finish the financial reports. I want to be the supportive girlfriend he needs, but I also can\u2019t afford to let my work slip. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between dialing his number and entering the next set of figures, caught in the middle of two worlds that both need me right now."}
