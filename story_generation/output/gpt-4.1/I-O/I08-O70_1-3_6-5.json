As a delivery person, I knew the drill: hand over the high-value envelope, check their ID, and get a signature. No shortcuts, especially with something this important. But as I waited, I found myself drawn into the conversation swirling around the table. A few acquaintances, including myself, were gathered, and the topic had turned to the recent decisions made by our mutual colleague, Mr. Lee. The group was dissecting his choices, some voices tinged with criticism, others with curiosity. \n\nAs an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken expectation to join in, to nod or add a comment, but I remembered my own rule\u2014never gossip or speak ill of others. Yet, as the delivery person, I was also expected to be friendly and blend in, not stand out as cold or aloof. My heart pounded as someone turned to me, asking what I thought about Mr. Lee\u2019s latest move. At the same moment, I saw Mr. Lee himself approaching, ready to receive his package. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could meet without betraying the other."}
