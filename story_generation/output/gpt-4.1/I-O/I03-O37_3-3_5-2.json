It was our last weekend together before he left for months, and I wanted every moment to count. He\u2019d asked if we could spend the day together, maybe go for a walk or just curl up and talk. My heart ached at the thought of him leaving, and I promised myself I\u2019d make this day special.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my supervisor. Today was the scheduled deep clean for the house. Every room needed to be spotless, every surface sanitized. I could already picture the dust in the corners, the streaks on the bathroom mirror, the kitchen floor that needed scrubbing. My job depended on my reliability, and I knew my boss would check every detail.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My partner was waiting for me to come back to bed, to hold him close before he left. But the mop and cleaning supplies in the closet seemed to call my name, reminding me of my responsibilities. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be both the loving girlfriend and the dependable cleaner, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
