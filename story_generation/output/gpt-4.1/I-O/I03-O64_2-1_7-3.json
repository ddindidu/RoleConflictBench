We\u2019ve been fighting about money all week\u2014how we spend it, how we save it, who pays for what. As his girlfriend, I know I should try to resolve things, reach out, and smooth over the tension. But right now, I\u2019m at work, and my job as a cashier demands my full attention. I notice a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that changes the total sales, but still, store policy says I have to report it. My manager expects me to follow every procedure to the letter. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the urge to text Alex and fix things, the need to do my job right. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014probably Alex, maybe ready to talk. My heart pounds as I stare at the register, torn between the rules of my job and the rules of my relationship, not sure which demand to answer first."}
