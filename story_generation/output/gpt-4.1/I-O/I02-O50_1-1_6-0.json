Why do you always forget?\u201d My chest tightened. She expected me to call, to talk it out, to resolve this before it grew into something bigger. I wanted to\u2014she deserved that. But just then, my supervisor\u2019s voice crackled through the radio: \u201cHey, can you check the old press? It\u2019s acting up again. We can\u2019t afford downtime, even if it\u2019s slow.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The plant was quiet, but the machine\u2019s glitch could become a real problem if ignored.
