It\u2019s a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I know I should review it thoroughly\u2014my job as a lawyer demands attention to detail, even for routine matters. Yet, my phone buzzes with a message from Emily. We\u2019ve argued about money three times this week, and she wants to talk tonight, hoping we can finally resolve things. As her boyfriend, I know she expects me to be present, to listen, to help us find common ground. But the contract nags at me; if I get it done now, I\u2019ll be ahead at work, less stressed tomorrow.
