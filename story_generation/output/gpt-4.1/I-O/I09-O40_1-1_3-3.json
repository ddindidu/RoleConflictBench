As a neighbor, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t hog the curb with extra bins unless they\u2019re full, and always leave space for others. But inside my garage, the scent of sawdust lingered over a new order\u2014an urgent request for a custom bookshelf. I needed to clear out the scrap wood and packaging to make space and get an accurate estimate of what materials I\u2019d need. The easiest way was to fill the bins with my workshop waste, but that would mean taking up more space than usual, maybe even pushing into my neighbor\u2019s side. I could already imagine Mrs. Lee\u2019s frown if she found my wood scraps in her bin area. My mind raced between the pressure to keep my workspace efficient and the responsibility to be a good neighbor. I hesitated, trash bag in hand, torn between the demands of my craft and the quiet expectations of the people living just a few feet away."}
