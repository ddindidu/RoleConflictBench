Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the only evening we have together before I leave for a week, and he\u2019s been looking forward to it for days. I promised him I\u2019d be home early, that I\u2019d leave work on time for once. But as I move down the hospital hallway, clipboard in hand, I hear the charge nurse call my name. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed. Can you cover the next round of vitals?\u201d My heart sinks. I know what\u2019s expected of me here\u2014every patient needs their temperature, pulse, and blood pressure checked, and the team is counting on me. But I also know what tonight means to him, and to us. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my chest tight with guilt and frustration. I want to be the reliable girlfriend he needs, but I can\u2019t ignore the patients who depend on me. I stand frozen in the hallway, torn between the promise I made at home and the duty I have here, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
