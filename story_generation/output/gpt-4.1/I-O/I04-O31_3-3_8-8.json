The words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that about me.\u201d My heart dropped. I replayed last night\u2019s conversation in my mind, realizing too late how my careless joke must have sounded. I knew I had to call Sam immediately, to apologize and explain, to be the friend who listens and makes things right. But just as I reached for my phone, my work radio crackled. Dispatch: \u201cOfficer, you\u2019re needed in court now for testimony.\u201d Duty called\u2014my presence was required, and I knew the importance of acting with integrity, of being reliable and fair in my role as a police officer. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to mend my friendship and the professional obligation I couldn\u2019t ignore.
