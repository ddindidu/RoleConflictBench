I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll help me get more experience.\u201d I could see the uncertainty in Jamie\u2019s eyes, and as a mentor, I knew I should offer thoughtful guidance. I started to answer, but my radio crackled\u2014dispatch was calling. A patient with a sprained ankle needed transport, nothing urgent, but the address was across town, and traffic was already thick.\n\nAs I slid behind the wheel, Jamie climbed in beside me, still waiting for my advice. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. Jamie expected me to listen and guide, but the city\u2019s chaos demanded my full attention as an ambulance driver. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between giving Jamie the support they needed and focusing on navigating the congested streets safely. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to mentor and the duty to drive with care, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet both expectations at once."}
