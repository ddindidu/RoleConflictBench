As a mentor, I had promised to guide my junior colleague through a complex compliance review. She was waiting in the conference room, anxious and eager, relying on me to walk her through the nuances that could make or break her understanding. I knew how much she needed this\u2014how one mistake could have lasting consequences for her confidence and the company.\n\nBut as a lawyer, my inbox pinged with a new message: a client had sent over a standard service contract for review. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but the client expected thoroughness and professionalism, and I prided myself on never letting a document sit too long. My reputation depended on it.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I give my mentee the undivided attention she deserved, or should I start reviewing the contract to maintain my client\u2019s trust? My mind raced, torn between nurturing growth and upholding my professional standards, knowing that whichever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
