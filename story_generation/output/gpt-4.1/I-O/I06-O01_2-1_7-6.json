She\u2019d carved out just fifteen minutes for me, squeezed between her own back-to-back appointments. As her mentee, I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second. But at the same moment, my inbox pinged with a message from my project team: a sudden issue with the site survey had thrown our timeline into question. As the architect, I was supposed to keep everything moving smoothly, to be available for quick decisions and guidance. My mind raced\u2014if I left the team hanging, the project could slip further behind. But if I rescheduled with my mentor, I might not get another chance for weeks. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations: respect for my mentor\u2019s time versus my responsibility to the project. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, caught between two roles that both demanded my immediate attention."}
