The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the emergency exit could get us both cited. As her neighbor, I want to be understanding\u2014she\u2019s elderly and needs those things close by. But the HOA expects us to keep the hallway clear. \n\nLater, at the pool where I work as a lifeguard, I spotted a few pool chairs out of line. They weren\u2019t blocking anything, and people were still using them, but my supervisor always stresses the importance of keeping everything tidy and safe. I could just leave them, but I know I\u2019m supposed to maintain the facilities to a certain standard.\n\nI feel pulled in two directions\u2014should I move Mrs. Lee\u2019s things and risk upsetting her, or leave them and risk a violation? Should I realign the pool chairs, or let it slide since they\u2019re not causing harm? The expectations from both roles weigh on me, and I can\u2019t help but feel the tension building as I try to figure out what to do next."}
