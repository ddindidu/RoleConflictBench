My mind was already tired from a long shift, but I forced a smile as a familiar face approached\u2014someone I\u2019d met just last week at a friend\u2019s gathering. She looked nervous, clutching her wallet, glancing around as if unsure of herself. I remembered how shy she\u2019d been at the party, and I wanted to put her at ease, maybe crack a joke or ask about her day. But as she handed me a stack of bills for a large purchase, my cashier instincts kicked in. I needed to count the money carefully, double-check the receipt, and make sure everything balanced. The pressure of handling high-value transactions at the end of the day weighed on me; one slip could mean hours of paperwork or worse. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on being the friendly, approachable acquaintance she might need right now, or keep my attention locked on the numbers, risking coming off as cold or distant?
