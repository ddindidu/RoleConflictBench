My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had left her old bookshelf in the corridor again, right by my door. I knew the HOA would cite us both for blocking the emergency exit, and she\u2019d be upset if I moved her things without asking. But at work, the pressure was mounting\u2014every minute the machine was down cost the company money, and my manager was already checking in for updates. I could almost hear the frustration in his voice, urging me to focus and get the line running. Yet, the thought of the inspection and the possible fine gnawed at me. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urgent beeping of the production unit and the silent, looming threat of the HOA\u2019s clipboard. Both roles demanded my attention, and I stood there, tools in hand, heart pounding, caught between the needs of my workplace and the expectations of my home."}
