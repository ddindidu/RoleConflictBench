He\u2019d misunderstood my last text, and I could feel the sting in his words. I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, fix things before they fester. But just as I reached for my phone, the radio crackled. Dispatch: \u201cAmbulance 12, respond to a possible fracture, Main and 5th, moderate traffic.\u201d My heart thudded. As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to drop everything and get there fast\u2014someone\u2019s pain, someone\u2019s safety, depends on me. But Jamie\u2019s pain was real too, and I could hear it in his message. My hands hovered, one over the ignition, one over my phone. I felt split in two, the weight of both roles pressing down. I needed to be a good friend, but I also needed to be a good medic. The seconds ticked by, and I was caught in the middle, torn by the demands of both worlds."}
