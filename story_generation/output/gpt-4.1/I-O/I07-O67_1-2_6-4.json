One message from a colleague caught my eye\u2014she\u2019d sent a detailed update about a project, noting there was no immediate action needed, but I knew she valued quick responses. I started typing a reply, wanting to show I was engaged and reliable. Just then, my radio crackled: a call for an ambulance, a patient with a broken arm, pain management needed on scene. My heart raced. I knew my team counted on me to be responsive, to keep communication flowing. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to drop everything and provide care, to be present and focused for the patient. I stared at the half-written email, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I finish the message, risking a delay in care, or leave it unsent, knowing my colleague might feel ignored? The tension twisted in my chest as I grabbed my keys, torn between the demands of the office and the urgent needs of the street."}
