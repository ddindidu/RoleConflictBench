As a mentee, I knew I should email Dr. Patel about the technical glitch that had frozen my project\u2019s progress. She always emphasized transparency, and I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let problems fester\u2014reach out.\u201d But as a judge, I was buried in the final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s civil trial, a case so intricate that every detail demanded my full attention. The parties had waited months for this day, and I owed them a thorough, impartial review. My inbox pinged with a reminder from Dr. Patel, while the stack of case files loomed over me, each page a silent demand. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to the court. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which obligation to answer first."}
