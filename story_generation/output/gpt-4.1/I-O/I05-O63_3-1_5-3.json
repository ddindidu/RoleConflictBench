She was about to handle her first high-stakes client pitch, and she needed my guidance. As her mentor, I knew I should walk her through every detail, share the pitfalls I\u2019d learned the hard way, and make sure she felt confident. But my phone kept flashing with reminders\u2014management was pushing for even higher sales numbers, and I was already on track to exceed my quota this week. If I paused now to help Sarah, I\u2019d lose precious momentum and risk falling behind the new targets. Yet if I ignored her, she might make a costly mistake, one that could have been avoided if I\u2019d just taken the time. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to keep dialing and the responsibility to guide her. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I found myself frozen, unable to choose which expectation to meet first."}
