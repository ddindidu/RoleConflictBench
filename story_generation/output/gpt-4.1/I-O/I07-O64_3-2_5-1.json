The line of customers stretched past the snack aisle, each one shifting impatiently, waiting for me to scan their groceries. As a cashier, I was expected to process every transaction quickly and accurately, especially during the evening rush. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my team chat. The report I was supposed to finish as a colleague was due in less than an hour, and it was the last piece needed for a client delivery. My manager had stressed how critical it was, and I knew everyone was counting on me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the customers\u2019 expectant faces, the looming deadline, the knowledge that any mistake at the register could cause chaos, and any delay in my report could jeopardize the project.
