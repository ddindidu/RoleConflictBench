Just before my train was due, I spotted Jamie, a friend of a friend, lingering near the ticket machines. He looked lost, shoulders hunched, eyes darting nervously. I remembered how I\u2019d promised to help him settle in the city, to be someone he could turn to. He caught my eye, and I offered a reassuring smile, ready to walk over and chat, maybe ease his nerves.\n\nBut just then, my radio crackled. \u201cOperator, this is Supervisor Lee. I\u2019ll be joining you for a performance audit.\u201d My heart skipped. The supervisor\u2019s presence meant every action would be scrutinized\u2014no room for error, no time for distractions. I had to be the model operator: focused, precise, detached from personal matters. Yet, as I stepped into the cabin, I saw Jamie hesitating at the door, looking to me for a sign of welcome. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of a friendly gesture and the cold necessity of protocol. The supervisor\u2019s footsteps echoed behind me, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding opposite things at the very same moment."}
