My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another message from Alex. He\u2019s devastated, barely able to get out of bed since his brother passed away. I promised I\u2019d be there for him, to listen, to hold him, to help him through the pain. But right now, I\u2019m here, in my uniform, smiling at customers and asking about their day. A woman thanks me for my kindness, and I force a cheerful reply, even as my mind drifts to Alex\u2019s tearful voice from this morning. I want to drop everything and rush to him, but I can\u2019t leave my post. My manager expects me to be present, friendly, and efficient. I feel torn in two\u2014my heart aches for Alex, but my body is anchored here, performing the motions of a cashier. Each customer I greet pulls me further from where I feel I should be, and I can\u2019t shake the guilt of not being enough for either of them."}
