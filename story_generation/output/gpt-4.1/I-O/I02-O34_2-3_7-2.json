The route closure has thrown the airspace into chaos\u2014planes circling, fuel ticking down, every second demanding my full attention. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackles in my ear, reminding me that safety is everything. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a message from Mia: \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep fighting like this.\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve argued every night this week about money, about how I never seem present, about how she feels alone. I know she expects me to fix this, to be the boyfriend who listens and makes things right. But right now, dozens of lives depend on my focus. My mind splits\u2014one half calculating flight paths, the other replaying her words, her tears. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both demand all of me. My hands hover over the controls, my heart pounding, caught between the chaos in the sky and the storm at home."}
