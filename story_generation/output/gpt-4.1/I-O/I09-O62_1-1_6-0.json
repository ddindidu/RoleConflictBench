As a lifeguard, I knew I couldn\u2019t let my attention slip, not even for a moment. A few swimmers were drifting toward the deeper end, nothing urgent yet, but I kept a close watch. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my neighbor. She was expecting a package this afternoon, and she asked if I could receive it for her since she\u2019d be out. I\u2019d promised her before that I\u2019d help with deliveries, and I knew how much she relied on me for these small favors. But now, sitting in my lifeguard chair, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left my post, even briefly, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the swimmers. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my neighbor, who trusted me. My mind raced, torn between the pull of responsibility and the tug of neighborly trust, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
