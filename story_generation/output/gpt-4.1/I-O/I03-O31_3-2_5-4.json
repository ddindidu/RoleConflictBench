We\u2019d planned everything\u2014his favorite restaurant, a walk by the river, just us, no distractions. I wanted to be the girlfriend he deserved, present and loving, making every moment count. But as I was getting ready, my phone buzzed: a major traffic accident on Main Street, multiple vehicles, injuries reported. Dispatch needed all available officers. My heart sank. I knew what was expected of me as a police officer\u2014protecting people, keeping order, being there when the city needed me. But I also saw the hope in his eyes, the way he reached for my hand, wanting me to choose him, just this once. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding all of me, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and love, unable to move."}
