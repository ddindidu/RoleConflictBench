My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, was in line, waiting to buy a few groceries. Just this morning, we\u2019d exchanged a cheerful hello in the corridor, and I\u2019d promised myself to always be friendly and polite, as a good neighbor should. Now, as she approached my counter, I felt the weight of my other role pressing in. As a cashier, especially at closing time, I had to focus\u2014every cent had to be accounted for, every transaction perfect. Mrs. Lee smiled warmly, expecting the same friendliness I\u2019d shown earlier, but my mind was racing with numbers and procedures. I could sense her waiting for a bit of small talk, maybe a joke or a kind word, but I was torn. If I let my guard down, I might make a costly mistake. If I stayed focused, I risked seeming cold or unfriendly. My hands hovered over the register, my heart caught between the expectations of a good neighbor and a responsible cashier, unsure which role to let guide me."}
