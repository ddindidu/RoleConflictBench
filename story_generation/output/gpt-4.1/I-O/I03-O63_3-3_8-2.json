We\u2019ve been arguing for hours, and now he\u2019s questioning if we should even stay together. My heart pounds, desperate to fix things, to say the right words and pull us back from the edge. But the call is from work, and as a telemarketer, I can\u2019t ignore it. I force my voice steady, launching into my script, only to be met by a furious customer. She\u2019s been with us for years and now accuses me of lying, demanding proof and explanations I barely have time to give. My boyfriend\u2019s angry footsteps echo down the hall, and I hear him mutter something about \u201cnever listening.\u201d I want to run after him, to resolve our fight, but the customer\u2019s voice sharpens, insisting I answer her questions.

My hands shake as I try to choose which crisis to face first."}
