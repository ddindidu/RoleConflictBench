My boyfriend and I had circled this evening on the calendar weeks ago, the only open slot before I\u2019d be working nights and he\u2019d be out of town. He\u2019d planned dinner, even picked up my favorite wine. But as I was getting ready to leave work, my supervisor called. The new ambulance was missing some supplies, and protocol demanded a full check before tomorrow\u2019s shift. I was the only one available. I stared at the first-aid kit, ticking off items, my phone buzzing with his messages: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d and \u201cShould I start the pasta?\u201d My heart twisted. I knew how much this night meant to him, to us. But I also knew the responsibility I carried\u2014if I missed something, a patient could suffer. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stood in the supply room, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
