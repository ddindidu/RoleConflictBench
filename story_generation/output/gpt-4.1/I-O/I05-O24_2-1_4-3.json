As a mentor, I had promised my team a structured session this afternoon, determined to share the skills they\u2019d need before the looming project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides, anticipating their questions, wanting to give them the confidence I once lacked. But as I reviewed my notes, an email notification flashed: the scheduling order for a new case was due by week\u2019s end. As a judge, I was expected to draft clear, detailed opinions\u2014no room for error or delay. The legal order required my full attention, precision, and time. My mind raced, torn between the eager faces waiting for my guidance and the weighty responsibility of the court. Both roles demanded my best, but I only had so much to give. My heart pounded as I stared at my calendar, feeling the pressure mount, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
