I promised her I\u2019d be back soon, but as I reached the lobby, I saw my neighbors gathered, tense and expectant. The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I knew they expected me to be calm, friendly, and diplomatic\u2014especially since I lived right next to the apartment in question. Smiles felt forced as I tried to greet everyone, my thoughts drifting back to Mrs. Lee waiting for me. I could sense the group\u2019s need for reassurance and fairness, but I also felt the pull of my duty to provide comfort to my patient. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the polite neighbor everyone expected and the caring nursing assistant I promised to be. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
