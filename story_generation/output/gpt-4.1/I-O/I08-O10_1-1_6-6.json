The conversation had turned to the recent decisions made by our mutual colleague, Mark. I felt the familiar pressure of being an acquaintance\u2014someone who should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others. Yet, the group looked at me, expecting me to chime in, maybe even share my own opinion or inside knowledge. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen: a vendor had sent a standard automated confirmation of a recent payment. As the accountant, I was expected to respond promptly and formally, keeping our professional relationships smooth and efficient. My mind raced, torn between the social expectation to participate in the conversation and the professional demand to reply to the vendor. I felt the tension rising inside me, my thoughts pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
