She smiled, expecting the usual friendly greeting. I opened my mouth to say hello, but my headset crackled\u2014my shift as an air traffic controller had started early, and I was on call from home. A pilot\u2019s voice came through, requesting the routine altimeter setting. My mind split in two: one part wanted to offer Mrs. Lee a warm smile and a few kind words, as any good neighbor would. The other part knew I had to respond to the pilot immediately, clear and professional, with no room for delay or distraction. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of both roles pressing on me at once. My neighbor\u2019s expectant eyes met mine, while the pilot\u2019s calm but waiting voice echoed in my ear. I stood frozen, torn between the simple civility of daily life and the critical demands of the skies above."}
