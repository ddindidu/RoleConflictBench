I baked a small cake the night before, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. This morning, I wrapped it up and set it by the door, ready for the first friendly face I\u2019d meet. But as I logged into my telemarketing job from home, the day took its usual turn. The call volume was light, and my supervisor had mentioned we could take our breaks flexibly, as long as we stuck to our hours.\n\nJust as I was about to take a break and head out with the cake, my phone pinged\u2014a reminder that I was still on the clock. I glanced at the time, calculating how much of my break I could spare. At that moment, I heard footsteps in the hallway. My neighbor was right outside, the perfect chance to introduce myself. But if I left my desk now, I\u2019d be stretching the rules, risking a warning if a call came through. I stood frozen, cake in hand, torn between being the friendly neighbor I wanted to be and the reliable employee I was expected to be."}
