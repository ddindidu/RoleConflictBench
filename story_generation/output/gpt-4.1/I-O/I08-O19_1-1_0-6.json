The article on a new anticoagulant was dense, and I was trying to memorize the key side effects before my shift resumed. Suddenly, I noticed Mark, an old college friend, coming from the other end. He smiled and waved, clearly expecting a friendly chat. As an acquaintance, I knew I should stop, ask about his family, and be approachable\u2014he always appreciated those little moments. But as a pharmacist, I felt the pressure to stay updated; my supervisor had just reminded us how crucial it was to know the latest drug information. If I paused now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and might not finish the article before my break ended. My heart raced as I weighed the warmth of a friendly exchange against the professional expectation to stay informed. I could feel the tension building, torn between being the attentive friend Mark expected and the diligent pharmacist my job demanded."}
