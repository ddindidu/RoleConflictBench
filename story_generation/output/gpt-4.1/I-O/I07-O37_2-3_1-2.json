In ten minutes, the team meeting would start\u2014one of those rare sessions where every update mattered, and missing it meant being out of the loop for days. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show I was invested in the project. But as I looked around the house, the mess stared back at me. Today was deep-clean day, and the supervisor had made it clear: every room needed to be spotless, every surface sanitized. No shortcuts, no excuses. I could already imagine the disappointment if I left a job half-done. My phone buzzed with a meeting reminder just as I picked up the mop. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I let my team down or risk my reputation as a reliable cleaner? My hands trembled, caught between the demands of two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
