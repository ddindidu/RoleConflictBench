The wail of the siren barely cut through the roar of the thunderstorm. In the back, the paramedics worked frantically on a patient whose life hung by a thread. My job was clear: get us to the hospital, fast but safe, even as the roads shimmered with water and visibility shrank to a few desperate feet.\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed in the cupholder. It was Sam, my mentee, texting in a panic about a job offer. He needed advice\u2014now, he said, before the deadline passed. I\u2019d always told him I\u2019d be there, that he could count on me for guidance, even for the small things. That was the kind of mentor I wanted to be.\n\nMy heart pounded. The expectation to be a steady guide for Sam clashed with the urgent responsibility to keep everyone in this ambulance alive. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding my attention, each one unforgiving in its own way. The storm outside was nothing compared to the one inside me as I stared at the glowing screen, torn between two worlds."}
