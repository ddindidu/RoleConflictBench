Jamie\u2019s always valued honesty between us, and I know if I don\u2019t call right now to clear things up, the misunderstanding will fester. I reach for my phone, thumb hovering over the call button.\n\nBut just then, the cabin door slides open. Mr. Patel, the transit authority supervisor, steps in, clipboard in hand. \u201cSurprise audit,\u201d he says, his eyes already scanning the control panel. My pulse quickens. I\u2019m expected to be the model operator\u2014focused, alert, no distractions, especially not personal calls. The rules are clear: no phone use while operating the train, especially during an audit.\n\nI glance at my phone, Jamie\u2019s hurt message still glowing on the screen. My friend needs me to explain, to be there, but my job demands unwavering professionalism. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, my mind racing as I stand frozen between the two worlds."}
