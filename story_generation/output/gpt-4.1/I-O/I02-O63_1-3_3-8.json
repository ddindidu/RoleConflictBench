We finally have time.\u201d I could almost hear her excitement, and I wanted to match it. We\u2019d both been so busy, and she deserved my full attention\u2014no distractions, no work calls, just us. But as I scrolled through my schedule, my heart sank. Every evening was technically free, but my telemarketing job had become stricter. The new compliance system tracked every second. If I took a break even a minute off schedule, I\u2019d get flagged.
