My boyfriend had texted me earlier, reminding me that tonight was our only free evening together before I left for a week-long work trip. He wanted to cook dinner, watch a movie, just be together\u2014something we hadn\u2019t done in ages. I promised I\u2019d be home on time. But now, as I scanned groceries for the few customers trickling in, my manager approached and asked if I could stay late. Someone had called out, and the evening shift was short-handed. I knew the expectation: process every transaction carefully, keep the line moving, don\u2019t make mistakes. My heart pounded as I weighed the request. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my boyfriend and break my promise. If I left, I\u2019d let down my team and risk my reputation at work. The beep of the scanner sounded louder than usual, echoing the tension inside me as I tried to decide which role I owed more to tonight."}
