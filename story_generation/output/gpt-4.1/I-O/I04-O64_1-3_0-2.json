It was almost closing time, and the drawer was full of large bills from a busy day. I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend had texted, \u201cUgh, today was endless. I need to vent. Can you talk?\u201d I knew she\u2019d had a rough week, and I wanted to be there for her, to listen and let her unload. But my hands were trembling as I tried to focus on the numbers in front of me. If I made a mistake now, it could mean hours of paperwork and a stern talk from my manager. My friend expected me to be present, to care, to respond right away. My job demanded my full attention, precision, and speed. I could feel the pressure building inside me, torn between the urge to support my friend and the responsibility to finish my shift without error.
