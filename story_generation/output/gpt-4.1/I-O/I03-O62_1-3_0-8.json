He\u2019d just finished a long shift at the hospital, and I could tell he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him that everything would be okay. I reached for his hand, ready to offer comfort, when a sudden splash caught my attention. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small child flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits for non-swimmers. My training kicked in, heart pounding, as I realized I needed to act fast. But Alex\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for a moment of connection, for me to stay and be his anchor. I felt torn in two\u2014my duty as a lifeguard demanded immediate action, but my heart ached to be the supportive girlfriend he needed right now. The seconds stretched, my mind racing between the whistle at my lips and the warmth of Alex\u2019s hand in mine, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds."}
