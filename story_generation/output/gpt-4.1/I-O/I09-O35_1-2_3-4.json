Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, always reminds everyone not to put out the bins unless they\u2019re full, to avoid cluttering the sidewalk. I hesitated, trash bag in hand, thinking about her disapproving look last week when someone ignored the rule. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the control center: a suspicious, unattended bag had been found on my train. As a subway operator, I\u2019m expected to respond immediately, ensuring passenger safety and following strict protocols. My heart pounded. If I left the trash, Mrs. Kim would surely notice and probably complain. But if I delayed responding to the report, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the passengers. I stood there, torn between the quiet expectations of my neighborhood and the urgent responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
