I could see the tension in her eyes, the way her shoulders slumped. She needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. I nodded, squeezing her hand, trying to give her my full attention. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a small boy flailing in the deep end, his arms splashing wildly. The sign clearly said no swimming allowed there, and I was the only lifeguard on duty. My heart pounded. Mia\u2019s voice faded as my training kicked in, but I could feel her grip tighten, sensing my distraction. I knew she wanted me to stay, to be her anchor, but the rules\u2014and that child\u2019s safety\u2014demanded I act. I was torn, caught between being the boyfriend she needed and the lifeguard I was trained to be, my mind racing as I stood on the edge of two worlds, forced to choose."}
