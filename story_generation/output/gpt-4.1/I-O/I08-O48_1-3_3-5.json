Glancing at the screen, I saw a message from Mark, someone I knew from my apartment building. \u201cHey! You know the area well, right? Can you recommend a good restaurant for tonight?\u201d I could almost hear his friendly tone, expecting a quick reply. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help him out, maybe even suggest a few places I liked. But as a nursing assistant, I was on the clock, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s monitor was already beeping, reminding me that her next set of vitals was due. My supervisor had stressed how crucial it was to keep a close eye on her, and I knew any delay could be serious. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the simple expectation to be helpful and the urgent responsibility to my patient, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
