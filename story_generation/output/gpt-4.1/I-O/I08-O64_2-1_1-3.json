He was with a new person, someone who barely made eye contact and clutched their basket tightly. I remembered how awkward it felt to be the newcomer, so I smiled warmly, trying to put them at ease.

Store policy was clear: every error, no matter how minor, had to be reported and corrected immediately. But I could see the nervousness in the new person\u2019s eyes, and I knew that calling attention to the mistake would only make things more uncomfortable for them.
