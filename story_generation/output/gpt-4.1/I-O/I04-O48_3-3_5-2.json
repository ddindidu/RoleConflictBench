I glanced at the screen and saw a frantic message from my best friend: her car had broken down on the highway, it was late, and she was scared and alone. She needed me right away. My heart pounded as I looked at Mr. Carter, his hands trembling, eyes pleading for help. I knew my friend was counting on me\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me in tough times, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her stranded and frightened. But here was Mr. Carter, vulnerable and in pain, relying on me to help him with something as simple as eating. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my mind racing with guilt and worry, torn between the person who needed me as a friend and the patient who depended on me as a caregiver."}
