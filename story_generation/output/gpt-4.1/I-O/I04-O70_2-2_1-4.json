It was Jamie, my best friend, and I could hear the strain in their voice before they even finished saying hello. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d Jamie pleaded, voice trembling. I knew what was expected of me as a friend\u2014drop everything, listen, and be there, especially when Jamie was this upset. But as I glanced at the package on the seat beside me, I remembered the instructions: this one needed a signature, no exceptions. The customer had already called twice to confirm the delivery window, and my supervisor had warned me about the importance of securing signatures for valuable items. I felt my chest tighten as Jamie started to explain the fight with their partner, tears audible through the phone. At the same time, I saw the customer waiting at the door, checking their watch impatiently. My mind raced, torn between the urge to comfort my friend and the responsibility to do my job right. I gripped the steering wheel, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
