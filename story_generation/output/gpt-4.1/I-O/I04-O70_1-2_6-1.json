The customer had called earlier, stressing how important it was to get their groceries before six\u2014they had dinner guests coming. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d just make it. But then another message popped up: my friend, sounding confused, asking, \u201cWait, where are we meeting again?\u201d We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I knew I should reply right away to clear things up. She hated being left in the dark, and I\u2019d promised to be more communicative. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn. If I stopped to text her, I might be late for the delivery, letting down a customer who was counting on me. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting down my friend, risking another rift between us. The pressure from both sides squeezed at my chest, and I stood frozen on the sidewalk, phone in hand, caught between two people who needed me in different ways."}
