Trash pickup is tomorrow, and our shared bins are only half-full. She looked at me hopefully, clearly expecting I\u2019d let her use the extra space. As her neighbor, I know I should be considerate, help her out, and make sure the bins aren\u2019t overflowing onto her side. But my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. My passenger\u2019s train leaves in less than thirty minutes, and the station is all the way across town. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be prompt and get people where they need to go safely and on time. I could see Mrs. Kim waiting, her bags heavy in her hands, while my passenger\u2019s anxious message popped up on my screen. My heart pounded as I stood between the bins and my car, torn between being a good neighbor and a reliable driver, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
