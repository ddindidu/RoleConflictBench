The deadline for filing was just hours away, and every clause demanded my full attention. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Maya, my mentee. \u201cQuick question about client meetings\u2014can I pop by?\u201d she wrote. She\u2019d been relying on me for guidance, and I\u2019d promised to be available, even if just for a few minutes during breaks. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I paused now, I risked missing a critical detail in the contract. But if I ignored Maya, I\u2019d be letting her down, failing to share the knowledge she needed to grow. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my legal work and the responsibility I felt as her mentor. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which part of myself to honor first."}
