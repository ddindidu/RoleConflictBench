I had a question about a term in the project brief\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew I was supposed to communicate even small uncertainties. My mentor always emphasized openness, and I didn\u2019t want to seem careless. But as I pulled up to the curb, a group of passengers climbed in, one of them clutching a dripping ice cream cone. I winced, imagining sticky stains on the backseat. My mind split: I needed to politely ask the passenger to be careful, maybe even offer napkins, to keep the cab clean and uphold my reputation as a professional driver. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder from my mentor: \u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I focus on my mentee duties and send the message now, or handle the taxi situation first? Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the tension rising as I tried to decide which expectation to meet."}
