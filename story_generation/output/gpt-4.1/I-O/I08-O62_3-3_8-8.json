One of them, Sarah, leaned over and whispered to me, \u201cDid you hear about Mark? I heard he\u2019s been sneaking in after hours.\u201d I knew the truth\u2014Mark had confided in me that he sometimes stayed late to clear his head, but he wasn\u2019t causing trouble. As an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to protect his privacy and not fuel any gossip. At the same time, as a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce all safety rules, including after-hours restrictions. Before I could respond, I noticed a small child flailing in the deep end, a spot strictly off-limits to non-swimmers. My mind raced. Should I address the gossip, risking Mark\u2019s trust, or focus on the immediate safety issue, possibly letting the rumor spread unchecked? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, caught between loyalty and duty, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
