My boyfriend and I had circled this date on the calendar weeks ago, knowing it was the only evening we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long trial. He wanted to make it special\u2014dinner at our favorite place, just us, no distractions. But as we walked in, I spotted a few colleagues at the bar, and before I knew it, we were swept into a group conversation. One of them, half-joking, asked about the high-profile case I was working on. My boyfriend\u2019s eyes sparkled with curiosity; he\u2019d always wanted to know more about my work, and here was his chance to hear something firsthand. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014his desire to feel included in my world, my colleagues\u2019 casual camaraderie, and my own professional obligation to keep my client\u2019s secrets. My heart pounded as I tried to laugh it off, but inside, I was torn. I wanted to share, to let him in, but I couldn\u2019t betray my client\u2019s trust. The conversation hung in the air, and I felt the tension between the woman he loved and the lawyer I had to be."}
