I miss you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy, but finally, our schedules lined up. I promised her I\u2019d let her know tonight which evening I could take her out. The thought of her waiting, hoping for a real evening together, made my chest ache with guilt and longing.\n\nBut as the shift whistle blew and the guys started packing up, my foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone\u2014clean up your area before you go. Safety first.\u201d I looked at the mess around my station: scattered nails, wood scraps, dust everywhere. If I left it, someone could get hurt tomorrow. But if I stayed late to do it right, I\u2019d miss the window to call her before she went to bed. My phone buzzed again in my pocket. I stood there, broom in hand, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to her and the responsibility I owed my crew. My heart pounded as I weighed what mattered more in this moment, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
