The sector was calm, just the usual handoff coming up\u2014a routine transfer of an aircraft to the neighboring sector. My colleague was waiting for my coordination, expecting a quick, clear update. But my mind kept drifting to the article my mentor had suggested last week. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she\u2019d ask about it soon, and I wanted to show her I was committed. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d read it during a lull, but now, even with things under control, I felt torn. Should I use this quiet moment to catch up on the reading, or stay laser-focused on the traffic, just in case something unexpected happened? The expectation to be a diligent mentee tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to my team and the pilots in the sky. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart thumping, as I weighed which role needed me more right now."}
