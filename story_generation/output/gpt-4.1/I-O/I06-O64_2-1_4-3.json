As a mentee, I\u2019d promised my mentor I\u2019d be upfront about any obstacles. Now, a technical glitch in my project had me completely stuck, and I knew I should reach out. But here at the store, as a cashier, I was expected to follow every policy to the letter. That\u2019s when I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would change the day\u2019s totals, but still, a deviation from the numbers. Store policy said I should report it, but I worried it would slow down the line and draw attention. My phone buzzed in my pocket, probably my mentor checking in. I felt torn\u2014should I step away to call my mentor and risk breaking store protocol, or ignore the register issue and focus on my project? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding honesty and responsibility, but in ways that seemed impossible to balance at the same time. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
