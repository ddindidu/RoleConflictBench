Had a rough day.\u201d My heart sinks. I know he\u2019s been waiting for feedback on his project, and from the tone, it\u2019s not good news. I want to be there for him, to listen and reassure him, to be the girlfriend he needs right now. But as I step into the exam room, my patient is already seated, sniffling and coughing. I put on my professional smile, ask about symptoms, and start my examination. My mind keeps drifting to Alex\u2014how he must be feeling, alone and disappointed. I feel the weight of my white coat, the responsibility to focus, to catch any sign that this is more than a cold. But my heart aches with the urge to comfort Alex, to send a quick message, to be present for him. The expectations pull at me from both sides, and I feel stretched thin, torn between the person I love and the duty I owe my patient."}
