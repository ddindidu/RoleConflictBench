My girlfriend and I finally had a stretch of evenings free, and we\u2019d planned to pick one for a proper date\u2014just the two of us, no distractions. She\u2019d been dropping hints about how much she missed our time together, and I promised her I\u2019d make it special. As I was about to text her, my radio crackled to life: a call for an ambulance, a patient with a broken bone just a few miles away. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, reminding me that every minute counts, even if it\u2019s not life or death. I glanced at my phone, her name lighting up the screen with a hopeful message. My heart twisted. She expected me to be present, to choose her tonight, but my duty demanded I drop everything and get behind the wheel. The city traffic outside was already building, and I knew the patient was waiting, probably scared and in pain. I stood there, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could let down."}
