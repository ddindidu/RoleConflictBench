I\u2019m free all week, just say when.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d promised to spend more time together, to really be present. But as the clock ticked closer to closing, my manager reminded me that tonight I\u2019d be handling the end-of-shift high-value transactions. The numbers had to be perfect\u2014one slip, and the whole drawer would be off, and I\u2019d be responsible. My boyfriend\u2019s texts kept coming, sweet and expectant, while my mind raced with totals and receipts. I wanted to say yes, to pick a night and make him happy, but I couldn\u2019t focus on anything except the pressure of balancing the register. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of his anticipation, the weight of my responsibility. I stared at my phone, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they deserved at the same time."}
