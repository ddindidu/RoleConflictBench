It was Mark, someone I knew from the gym, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for his anniversary dinner. I hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. As an acquaintance, I wanted to be helpful, to respond quickly and thoughtfully. But just beyond the door, a family waited for me\u2014faces drawn, eyes red. I had to tell them that their father\u2019s test results were worse than we\u2019d hoped. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, and clear, gentle words. My mind raced, torn between the casual expectation to be friendly and supportive, and the heavy responsibility to guide a family through heartbreak. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different from me at the same moment. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between the urge to be a good acquaintance and the duty to be a compassionate doctor."}
