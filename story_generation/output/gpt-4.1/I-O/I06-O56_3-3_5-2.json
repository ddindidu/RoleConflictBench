My mentor had always emphasized the importance of transparency, urging me to reach out at the first sign of trouble. Now, a heated argument with my teammates was threatening to derail our project, and I knew I should call my mentor immediately. But just as I was about to step aside, the salon door swung open. The bride-to-be and her entourage bustled in, faces tense, eyes darting to the clock. As their hairdresser, I was expected to greet them warmly, put them at ease, and start their appointments right away\u2014especially with their wedding schedule hanging by a thread. I could feel their anxiety radiating toward me, demanding my full attention. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, a reminder of my responsibility as a mentee. Torn between the urgent needs of my clients and the expectations of my mentor, I stood frozen, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between two worlds."}
