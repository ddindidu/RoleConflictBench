The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the hallway could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate\u2014she\u2019s recovering from surgery, and moving that heavy shelf isn\u2019t easy for her. But I also have my own worries. At the lab, a safety audit is looming, and I\u2019m responsible for making sure our equipment is up to code. Last week, the inspector flagged a few minor issues, and if I don\u2019t fix them today, we could face serious consequences. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides: the expectation to help keep our building safe and harmonious, and the professional demand to ensure my lab is compliant and my team is protected. I glance at the clock, torn between heading to the lab early to double-check the equipment or staying to help Mrs. Patel with her shelf. My mind races, weighed down by the knowledge that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
