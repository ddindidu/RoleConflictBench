She reminded me about her deliveries and the planned power cut, asking if I could keep an eye out and maybe put her groceries in my fridge if they arrived. I assured her I\u2019d help, feeling the familiar warmth of neighborly trust. At the pool, my mind kept drifting to her packages and the blackout schedule. Suddenly, a commotion snapped me back\u2014a child was flailing in the deep end, a spot strictly off-limits. My training screamed at me to act, to enforce the rules and ensure safety. But as I reached for the rescue tube, I remembered Mrs. Patel\u2019s groceries possibly sitting in the heat, spoiling, and her trust in me to help. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other a promise not to be broken. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the urgent call of my duty as a lifeguard and the quiet, persistent expectation of being a good neighbor."}
