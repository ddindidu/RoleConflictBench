It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her voice shaky with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d I glanced down at the package in my hands, the label marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014HAND DELIVER ONLY.\u201d My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions. Deliver in person, verify ID, no delays.\u201d The recipient was expecting me within the hour, and the company tracked every step. But Jamie was counting on me, too. She\u2019d helped me through so much, and I could hear the desperation in her voice. My heart pounded as I stood on the porch, torn between loyalty to my friend and my responsibility as a delivery person. Both needed me, right now, and I couldn\u2019t see how to be in two places at once."}
