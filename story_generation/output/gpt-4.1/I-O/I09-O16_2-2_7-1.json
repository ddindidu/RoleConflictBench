Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, and I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I check in, maybe offer to bring her some supplies or just reassure her? But my mind was already spinning from the day\u2019s last patient: a young man with a fever, rash, and joint pain, none of which fit neatly into any diagnosis I could recall. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d review his labs and research possible rare conditions tonight. My pager buzzed with a reminder. I stood in my kitchen, torn. As a neighbor, I wanted to be present for Mrs. Lee, especially with the storm coming. As a doctor, I owed my patient diligence and focus\u2014lives depended on it. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the warmth of community and the gravity of my profession, unsure which door to open first."}
