I know I should call him right now, explain myself, and listen\u2014he deserves that from a friend. But as I reach for my phone, my laptop pings with a flurry of Slack notifications. The product manager is tagging me, architects from two other teams are waiting for my input on a critical feature. The launch date just got moved up, and everyone\u2019s blocked until I weigh in.
