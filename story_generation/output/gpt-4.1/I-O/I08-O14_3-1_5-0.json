The experiment I\u2019d been planning for weeks was finally ready, and I felt a familiar surge of anticipation. Then I saw the caller ID\u2014Sam, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. I hesitated, but answered. Sam\u2019s voice was shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on the old Mill Road. I don\u2019t know who else to call. Can you help me out?\u201d I glanced at the clock. The experiment could be run on other days, but I\u2019d carved out this time, and everything was perfectly aligned. Still, Sam sounded desperate, and I knew how isolated that road could be. As a scientist, I felt the pull of my commitment to the research, the need to gather data and stick to my plan. But as an acquaintance, I knew I was expected to help, to be there when someone reached out. My mind raced, torn between the sterile promise of the lab and the very real voice of a friend in need. I stood frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
