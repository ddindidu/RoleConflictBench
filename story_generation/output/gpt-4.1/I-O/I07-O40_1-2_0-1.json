The team meeting was about to start in ten minutes, and my phone buzzed with reminders from my colleagues. They expected me to join, share updates, and be present\u2014even if it was just a routine catch-up. I knew the meeting would be recorded, but I also knew how much my participation mattered to the team\u2019s morale.\n\nAt the same time, I looked around the workshop. Sawdust covered the floor, and scraps of wood were scattered everywhere. As the lead carpenter, I was responsible for keeping the site safe and organized. If I left now to join the meeting, I\u2019d be ignoring the safety protocols I drilled into my crew. A messy site could mean accidents, and I couldn\u2019t shake the guilt at the thought of someone getting hurt because I wasn\u2019t there to set the example.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and my duty as a carpenter. I stood frozen, phone in one hand, broom in the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
