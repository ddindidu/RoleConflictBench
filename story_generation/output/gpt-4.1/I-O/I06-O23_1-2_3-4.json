As a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to reach out whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, it\u2019s a minor terminology question\u2014something that\u2019s nagging at me, but not stopping my work. I know my mentor expects me to be proactive, to communicate even the little things so I don\u2019t develop bad habits or misunderstandings.\n\nBut as a lawyer, I\u2019m minutes away from a contested motion. My client is anxious, counting on me to be fully prepared and focused. The stakes are high; one misstep could cost them dearly. I feel the weight of their trust, the expectation that I\u2019ll be their unwavering advocate in court.\n\nMy mind races. If I message my mentor now, I risk losing precious focus before the hearing. If I wait, I\u2019m not meeting the expectations of a good mentee. The pressure builds in my chest, torn between the need to learn and the duty to defend. My fingers hover over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
