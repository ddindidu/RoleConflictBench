I baked a small lemon cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I bumped into anyone. That afternoon, as I was heading out with the cake, I ran into Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly and, to my surprise, mentioned she had an appointment with me at the salon later that day. \n\nWhen she arrived at the salon, she told me she\u2019d just washed her hair and it was still damp. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before starting, to ensure the best results and maintain salon standards. But as her new neighbor, I wanted to be friendly and accommodating, not rigid or impersonal. I could sense she hoped I\u2019d skip the wash this time. \n\nStanding there, cake still on my mind, I felt torn between being the welcoming neighbor and the professional hairdresser. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind wrestling with what each role demanded of me."}
