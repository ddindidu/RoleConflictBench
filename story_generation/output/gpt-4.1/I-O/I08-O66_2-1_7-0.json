We exchanged polite greetings, and I started driving toward his destination. The traffic was light, and he seemed relaxed, scrolling through his phone. Suddenly, he broke the silence, mentioning a mutual acquaintance from work. \u201cDid you hear about Mark\u2019s latest project? Total disaster. I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d He laughed, expecting me to join in.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to avoid gossiping or speaking ill of others, especially since I barely knew Mark\u2019s situation. But as a taxi driver, I was also expected to provide a comfortable ride, which often meant engaging in friendly conversation and making passengers feel at ease. If I stayed silent or disagreed, would he feel awkward or unwelcome? If I agreed, I\u2019d be betraying my own values. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to say, the city blurring past outside the window."}
