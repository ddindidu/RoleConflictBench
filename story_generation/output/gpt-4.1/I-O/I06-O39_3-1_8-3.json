I was still on the construction site, dust swirling around my boots as the foreman barked out, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to sweep up your area before you go!\u201d The broom felt heavy in my hands, but the weight in my chest was worse. My mentor had squeezed me in for this session, right before catching a long flight. I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But the site was a mess, and leaving it unswept would mean risking someone\u2019s safety\u2014and my own reputation as a reliable worker. I could already picture the foreman\u2019s glare if I left early, and the disappointment in my mentor\u2019s voice if I missed our call. I stood frozen, broom in one hand, phone in the other, torn between two worlds that both demanded my best."}
