The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show support. Even though it was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded, I knew my absence might be noticed. But just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the production floor. Some new staff were preparing to run a batch on the old press, and from the frantic tone of the message, it was clear they didn\u2019t fully understand the safety protocols. As the machine repairer, it was my job to guide them, to make sure no one got hurt and nothing went wrong. I could picture the confusion on their faces, the potential for disaster if I didn\u2019t step in. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a present, reliable teammate and the pressing need to prevent a dangerous mistake. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
