Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the only evening we have before I\u2019m on the early shift all week, and she\u2019s flying out for work. I promised her a quiet dinner, no distractions, just time together. But as I step back into the operator\u2019s cabin, the control panel blinks\u2014there\u2019s a signal delay ahead. Dispatch wants me to keep the train as close to schedule as possible, but I know that means I\u2019ll have to stay late, carefully adjusting speed, making sure every stop is smooth and safe for the passengers. My mind races: if I do everything by the book, I\u2019ll miss our evening. If I rush, I risk safety and my job. I feel the weight of Jamie\u2019s hope for tonight pressing against the responsibility of hundreds of commuters depending on me. The train hums forward, and I\u2019m caught between the tracks and the promise I made, heart pounding as I watch the signals and the clock, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
