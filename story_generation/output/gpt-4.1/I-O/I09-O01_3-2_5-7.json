As her neighbor, I know she treasures her little garden, but the HOA inspection is tomorrow, and anything blocking the exit could get us all fined. I should remind her, maybe even help her move them, but my phone buzzes\u2014my contractor\u2019s waiting, and if I don\u2019t answer, the drywall delivery will be delayed, throwing off the whole project. I feel the pressure mounting: as an architect, I\u2019m expected to keep everything on schedule, no excuses. As a neighbor, I\u2019m supposed to be considerate, not just for myself but for everyone on the floor. I stand in the hallway, torn, the weight of blueprints in one hand and the responsibility of community in the other, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
