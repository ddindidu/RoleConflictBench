The project deadline was looming, and I wanted to make sure I shared every bit of knowledge they\u2019d need to succeed. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder to clean the living room before the landlord\u2019s inspection tomorrow. I glanced around; crumbs dotted the counter, dust clung to the shelves, and the trash was nearly overflowing. I knew the expectation: the house had to be spotless, not just presentable. But my mind kept drifting back to the session outline, worrying if I\u2019d covered enough, if my mentees would feel supported.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides. If I focused on cleaning, I\u2019d risk letting my mentees down, leaving them unprepared. If I kept working on the session, the house would stay in its half-tidy state, and I\u2019d face complaints. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the urge to scrub the floors and the responsibility to guide my mentees. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible demands of being both a mentor and a cleaner."}
