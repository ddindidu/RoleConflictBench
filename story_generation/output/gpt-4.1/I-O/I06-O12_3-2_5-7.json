As a software developer, I knew I had to jump in, diagnose, and fix the bugs before they spiraled out of control. But my mind kept drifting back to the heated argument with my teammates earlier. The conflict had left us barely speaking, and our project deadline was now at risk. As a mentee, I was supposed to communicate any challenges to my mentor, but I hesitated. Would telling my mentor about the team conflict make me look incompetent? Would it reflect badly on the group? Meanwhile, the pressure to resolve the user issues mounted, and I felt torn\u2014should I focus on firefighting the bugs, or reach out to my mentor about the team crisis? My inbox pinged with another bug report, and my heart raced as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which demand to answer first."}
