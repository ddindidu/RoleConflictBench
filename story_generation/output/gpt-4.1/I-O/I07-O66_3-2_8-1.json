She sat in the back seat, nervously checking her watch, her expectation clear: get her there safely and quickly. At the same time, my work phone vibrated with a message from my manager, marked urgent. Leadership needed my confirmation on details for an external partner, and I knew they expected a prompt reply. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 voices, reminding me how important it was to respond quickly, not to hold up the team. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the risks\u2014should I pull over to answer, risking my passenger missing her train, or keep driving and risk letting my colleagues down? The pressure from both sides pressed in, my mind racing with the consequences of either choice, caught between the demands of being a reliable colleague and a responsible taxi driver."}
