The siren wails, echoing my own panic. In the back, a patient clings to life, every second precious. My phone buzzes on the dashboard\u2014another message from Jamie. Our argument this morning still burns in my mind, words sharp and final. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d he\u2019d said. Now, he\u2019s texting, desperate for answers, for me to say something that will fix us. My heart aches to respond, to resolve the fight before it\u2019s too late, but my eyes must stay on the slick, winding road. The paramedic shouts for me to slow down, but the hospital is still miles away. I feel torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to save a life, the other desperate to save my relationship. The storm outside is nothing compared to the one inside me, and I don\u2019t know which demand will break me first."}
