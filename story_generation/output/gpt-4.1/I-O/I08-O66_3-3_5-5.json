It was Sam, an old acquaintance, his voice tight with worry. \u201cMy car broke down on Maple Road. Can you come help? I\u2019m kind of stranded.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014rush hour, and the street ahead was crawling with kids just let out of school, darting along the curb. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra cautious, especially here, with the construction squeezing the lanes and children everywhere. But Sam sounded desperate, and as an acquaintance, I felt the pull to drop everything and rush to his aid. My mind raced: if I hurried, I could reach him quickly, but that would mean risking the safety of the kids and possibly breaking traffic laws. If I stayed careful, I\u2019d be late, and Sam would be left waiting, maybe even in danger. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My hands tightened on the wheel as I approached the school zone, torn between loyalty and responsibility, not sure which way to turn."}
