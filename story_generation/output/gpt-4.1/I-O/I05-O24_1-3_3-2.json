She looked eager, notebook in hand, and I could see how much she valued these moments\u2014our informal chats where I shared the lessons I\u2019d learned over the years. I wanted to give her my full attention, to nurture her curiosity and help her grow. But just as she began, my phone buzzed: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had landed on my desk. The clerk\u2019s message was clear\u2014review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. As a mentor, I was expected to be patient and generous with my time, to guide Sarah thoughtfully. As a judge, I was expected to be impartial, thorough, and swift, especially in urgent matters where someone\u2019s safety might be at stake. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my immediate attention, and I stood there, torn, as Sarah waited for my answer and the clock ticked down on the emergency motion."}
