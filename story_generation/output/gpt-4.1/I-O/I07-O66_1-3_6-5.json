I was in the middle of my taxi shift, inching through a construction detour that had squeezed the road into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, the yellow school zone sign flashed, and a group of kids clustered near the curb, their backpacks swinging as they waited for the crossing guard. My foot hovered over the brake, eyes darting between the children and the maze of orange cones. I felt the weight of my colleague\u2019s expectation pressing on me\u2014just a quick reply, just a sign I\u2019m present. But as a driver, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford even a second\u2019s distraction, not here, not now. My phone buzzed again, and my grip tightened on the wheel, torn between the silent demand to be a responsive coworker and the urgent responsibility to keep everyone safe on the road."}
