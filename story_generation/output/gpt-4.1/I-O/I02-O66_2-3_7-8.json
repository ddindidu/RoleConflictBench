My girlfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, her message pleading, \u201cCan we please talk now? I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d We\u2019d been fighting all week about money\u2014her frustration, my defensiveness, both of us exhausted. I knew she expected me to step up, to resolve things, to show her I cared enough to fix what was broken between us.\n\nBut at the same time, the taxi app pinged again. My next passenger was waiting, sending urgent messages: \u201cAre you close? I really need to get to the hospital fast.\u201d As a driver, I was supposed to be reliable, professional, focused on the road and the needs of my passengers. I could almost feel the pressure from both sides, my heart pounding as I stared at the two messages. I wanted to be the boyfriend who could make things right, but I also needed to be the driver who didn\u2019t let people down. The weight of both expectations pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which role to answer first."}
