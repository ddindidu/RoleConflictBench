There was a term in the training manual I didn\u2019t quite understand, and I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. That was the expectation\u2014open communication, no hesitation. But as I pulled out my phone to draft a quick message, I noticed the lane rope in the pool had snapped. Swim lessons were starting soon, and as a lifeguard, it was my responsibility to make sure all equipment was in perfect condition. If I didn\u2019t fix it right away, the lessons could be delayed, or worse, someone could get hurt. My mentor expected me to be proactive and transparent, but my supervisor expected the pool to be ready and safe. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between sending that message and grabbing the repair kit. Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, forcing me to choose which responsibility mattered more in this moment."}
