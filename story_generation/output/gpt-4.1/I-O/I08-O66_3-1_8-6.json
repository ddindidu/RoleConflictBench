As I worked, my phone buzzed with a message from a mutual friend, sharing a rumor about someone we both knew. The information was sensitive, something that could easily damage that person\u2019s reputation if it got out. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t spread it or even hint at it\u2014gossiping was something I tried to avoid, no matter how tempting it was to join in the conversation.\n\nJust then, my next passenger slid into the back seat. To my surprise, it was the very person at the center of the rumor. As I drove, they chatted amiably, unaware of what was circulating about them. I felt the weight of my dual roles pressing in. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be courteous and professional, keeping the ride comfortable and the environment clean. But as an acquaintance, I was now holding a secret that gnawed at me, unsure if I should warn them, stay silent, or risk being seen as a gossip. The tension between my roles made my hands tighten on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
