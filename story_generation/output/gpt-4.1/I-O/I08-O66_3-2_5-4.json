It was Jamie, an old acquaintance. \u201cMy car broke down on Maple Road. Can you help me out?\u201d I could hear the anxiety in their voice, and I knew that stretch of road was lonely, especially in this weather. As a friend, I felt the pull to rush over, to be the person Jamie could count on. But as a taxi driver, I was painfully aware of the chaos outside\u2014cars weaving unpredictably, brake lights flaring in the mist. My job demanded caution, patience, and strict adherence to the rules, especially now. Every instinct screamed at me to hurry, but I also knew that one reckless move could endanger not just myself, but everyone on the road. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the urge to help and the responsibility to drive safely, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
