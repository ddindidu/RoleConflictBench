After a week of mismatched schedules, my girlfriend and I finally carved out a single evening together before I left for a conference. She\u2019d planned a cozy dinner at her place, candles and all, and I promised I\u2019d be there right after my shift. But as I did my final walk-through at the pool, I spotted the broken lane rope\u2014frayed and tangled, a hazard for tomorrow\u2019s swim lessons. As the only lifeguard on duty, I knew it was my responsibility to fix it before morning. If I left it, the lessons would be delayed, parents would complain, and my supervisor would be furious. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late\u2014again\u2014ruining the one night my girlfriend and I had. My phone buzzed with her sweet reminder: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I stared at the rope, heart pounding, torn between the duty I owed to my job and the promise I made to her."}
