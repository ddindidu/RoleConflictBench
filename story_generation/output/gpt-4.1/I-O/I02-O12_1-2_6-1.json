She sounds upset, and I know from experience that if I don\u2019t address this now, it\u2019ll fester. But my laptop screen is filled with red flags from the code review\u2014performance warnings I can\u2019t ignore. The new feature is so close to being done, but if I don\u2019t fix these issues, the whole team will be held up. My lead expects clean, efficient code, and I can\u2019t let them down. Yet, Mia expects me to be present, to resolve things before they spiral. My mind races, torn between the urge to call her and the pressure to dive back into the code. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My fingers hover over the keyboard, my phone buzzes again, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
