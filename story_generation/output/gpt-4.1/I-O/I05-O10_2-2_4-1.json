As a mentor, I had promised my team a session this afternoon to walk them through the new budgeting software\u2014something they desperately needed before the big project deadline next week. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides and examples, determined to give them the confidence I never had when I started. But as an accountant, the end of the month loomed over me like a storm cloud. The financial records were only half reconciled, and the deadline for closing the books was tomorrow. My inbox pinged with reminders from the finance director, each one more urgent than the last. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the team counting on my guidance, the company relying on my accuracy. My mind raced, torn between the faces of eager learners and the rows of numbers demanding my attention. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly give both roles what they needed from me at the same time."}
