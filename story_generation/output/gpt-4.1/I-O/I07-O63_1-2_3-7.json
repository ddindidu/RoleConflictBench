As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish my part of the report by the end of the week. There was plenty of buffer time, and honestly, my teammates could keep moving without my section for a day or two. But as a telemarketer, my break was scheduled for right now, and management had been strict lately\u2014every minute over was flagged, and the phone queue never seemed to shrink. I could feel the pressure mounting: if I took my break late to finish the report, I\u2019d risk a warning from my telemarketing supervisor. If I left the report for later, I\u2019d be letting my colleagues down, even if they said it was fine. My mind raced, torn between the silent expectations of my team and the ever-watchful eyes of the call center managers, both demanding my time in ways that felt impossible to reconcile."}
