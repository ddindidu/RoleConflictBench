His voice trembled\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he sounded scared. \u201cCan you come get me? Please, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As a friend, I knew what was expected: drop everything, help him out, be there when he needed me most. But just as I was about to answer, my radio crackled. Dispatch: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall, possible fracture, patient in pain, immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to provide care, to be the calm in someone\u2019s emergency, to never let a patient down. I stared at my phone, Sam\u2019s name still glowing, and then at the radio, the address echoing in my mind. Both needed me\u2014right now. I felt torn in two, guilt and duty wrestling inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
