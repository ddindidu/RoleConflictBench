As I approached, I recognized one of the drivers\u2014Mina, someone I\u2019d met a few times at community events. She was standing by her car, tears streaming down her face, clearly shaken. My instinct as an acquaintance was to comfort her, to offer a gentle word or a reassuring hand on her shoulder. But as a police officer, I knew I had to remain impartial, gather facts, and treat both drivers equally. Mina looked at me, her eyes pleading for understanding, and I could feel the weight of her expectation for kindness. At the same time, the other driver watched me closely, likely wondering if I\u2019d show favoritism. My badge felt heavier than usual as I struggled to balance the urge to be a supportive friend with my duty to uphold fairness and integrity. The tension between these roles pulled at me, and I hesitated, caught between what I wanted to do and what I was expected to do."}
