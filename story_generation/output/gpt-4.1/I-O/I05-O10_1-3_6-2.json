She\u2019d admitted, almost in a whisper, that she was overwhelmed, missing deadlines, and unsure how to juggle her workload. As her mentor, I felt a responsibility to guide her, to carve out time for a real conversation, to help her find strategies for time management and growth. But just as I was about to send her a message to set up a meeting, my phone buzzed\u2014an email from the external auditor. They needed the quarterly financial statements, and they needed them now. As the accountant, accuracy and timeliness were non-negotiable; any delay or error could have serious consequences for the company. My heart pounded as I stared at the two open windows on my computer: Maya\u2019s chat and the auditor\u2019s request. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention, each too important to ignore. I closed my eyes, torn between the urge to support Maya and the obligation to deliver flawless financial records, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
