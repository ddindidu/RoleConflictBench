My boyfriend sits on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the floor. He barely looks up as I enter. I know that look\u2014he\u2019s had a rough day. I want to drop everything, sit beside him, and listen, to be the supportive girlfriend he needs right now. But my mind is tangled in lines of code. I\u2019ve been thinking all day about the module I\u2019m working on, how I could finally refactor it now that the deadline isn\u2019t breathing down my neck. It\u2019s the perfect time to make the code cleaner, more efficient, and I\u2019ve been itching to dive in. Yet, here he is, needing me. I feel the pull in both directions\u2014my heart aches for him, but my mind races with solutions for my code. I stand in the hallway, torn, laptop still in hand, unsure which role to step into first."}
