As a neighbor, I knew I was expected to be friendly, calm, and polite, especially now when tensions were high. I smiled, nodded, and tried to ease the conversation, even though I could sense the frustration simmering beneath the surface. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I needed to finish the routine check of the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit before my shift started. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to be thorough and precise, making sure every bandage and vial was accounted for and not expired. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I\u2019d seem rude and uncaring to my neighbors, but if I stayed, I\u2019d risk being unprepared for an emergency. My mind raced, torn between the demands of being a good neighbor and a responsible ambulance driver, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I stood there, caught in the middle."}
