I\u2019m stuck and need your advice before the meeting.\u201d I\u2019d promised to be available, to guide them through this tricky project, and I knew how much they depended on my feedback. But just then, two travelers flagged me down, waving frantically beside a mountain of suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019re late for our train, and we\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one called out, urgency in her voice. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable and professional, always ready to lend a hand and get people where they needed to go. My phone buzzed again\u2014my mentee, waiting for guidance. The travelers looked at me expectantly, already starting to hoist their bags. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the responsibility to my mentee and the immediate demands of my passengers. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I stood at the crossroads of two worlds, each expecting me to be fully present."}
