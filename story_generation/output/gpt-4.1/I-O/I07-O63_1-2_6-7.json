I was in the middle of my telemarketing shift, headset pressed to my ear, the call queue never-ending. My break was scheduled in five minutes, and management was strict\u2014every second away from the phone was tracked. If I took a moment now to reply, I\u2019d risk being flagged for not sticking to my break schedule. But if I waited until my break, my colleague might think I was ignoring them or not pulling my weight. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart thumping as I weighed the silent expectations from both sides. I could almost feel the eyes of my supervisor and my teammate, each waiting for me to prove where my priorities lay."}
