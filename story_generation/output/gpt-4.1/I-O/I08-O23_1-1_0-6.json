He smiled and waved, so I did the same, making sure to look friendly and open. We stopped for a quick chat, and I tried to keep the conversation light, just as any good acquaintance would. Later that evening, at a networking event, Mark approached me again, this time with a group of colleagues. The conversation turned to work, and Mark, perhaps trying to impress his friends, asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story behind that big case you\u2019re working on? Must be juicy!\u201d Everyone looked at me, expecting a witty or intriguing answer. As an acquaintance, I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or distant, but as a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything confidential. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my desire to be friendly clashing with my professional duty. My mind raced, searching for a way to honor both roles, but I could feel the tension tightening in my chest as all eyes waited for my response."}
