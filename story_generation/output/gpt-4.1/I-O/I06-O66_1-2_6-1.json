My mentor\u2019s office hours were about to start, and I\u2019d promised to show up early to discuss my project. She\u2019d made it clear how important it was to respect her time, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But just as I was about to park my cab and head inside, a passenger flagged me down, desperation in his eyes. \u201cPlease, can you get me to the station? My train leaves in twenty minutes.\u201d I hesitated, torn. As a taxi driver, I knew the expectation: get him there safely and on time. But as a mentee, I was supposed to be reliable and present for my mentor. The city traffic was unpredictable, and I couldn\u2019t do both. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the responsibility to my passenger against my commitment to my mentor, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
