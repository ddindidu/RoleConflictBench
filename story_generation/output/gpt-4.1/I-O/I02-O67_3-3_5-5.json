It was our last chance before she left for months, and I could see the hope in her eyes as we planned every detail. We sat together at the caf\u00e9, her hand in mine, when my radio crackled. A call came in\u2014possible heart attack, minutes away. My training kicked in, the urgency of saving a life pressing on my chest. But then I looked at her, her smile faltering as she realized what the call meant. She needed me, too, just in a different way. I felt torn, the weight of my uniform and my love both heavy on my shoulders. I could hear the dispatcher\u2019s voice, the expectation clear: someone\u2019s life depended on me.

My heart pounded as I stood between the door and her, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion, not knowing which way to turn."}
