It\u2019s a message from Jamie: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really upset about what you said earlier.\u201d My heart sinks. I replay my words from lunch, realizing too late how they must have sounded. Jamie\u2019s my closest friend, and I know I need to call and apologize, to explain myself and make things right before the misunderstanding grows.\n\nBut as I glance through the window, I see Mrs. Carter sitting up in bed, her hands trembling as she stares at the wall. She\u2019s just come out of surgery, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to listen and help her feel safe. She looks so small and alone, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to be present, to offer comfort.\n\nI stand in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the urgent need to reach out to Jamie and the responsibility I feel toward Mrs. Carter. Both need me right now, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My chest tightens as I wrestle with what to do next."}
