My mentor\u2019s email glared at me from the screen, reminding me that the assignment\u2014an in-depth drug interaction analysis\u2014was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. I knew how much my mentor was counting on me to deliver something thorough and insightful, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But just as I started typing, a nurse rushed in with a high-risk chemotherapy prescription. The patient was waiting, and the medication needed to be dispensed immediately. My mind raced. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake; the margin for error was nonexistent, and a patient\u2019s life depended on my focus and accuracy. Yet, the weight of my mentor\u2019s expectations pressed on me, the fear of disappointing them and jeopardizing my own progress gnawing at my thoughts. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the responsibilities of being a good mentee, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to serve first."}
