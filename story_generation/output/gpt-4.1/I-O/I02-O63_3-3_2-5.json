The pressure was suffocating; missing the quota meant not just losing my bonus, but letting my whole team down. But next to me, my girlfriend lay curled up, her eyes red and swollen from crying. She\u2019d just lost her brother, and every few minutes, a fresh wave of grief would hit her. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I could feel her expectation, unspoken but heavy: to be here, to listen, to hold her together when she was falling apart. But my phone kept lighting up, each message a reminder of the other world I belonged to, where empathy didn\u2019t count for much, only numbers did. My heart twisted as I stared at the screen, torn between the desperate need to be the boyfriend she deserved and the relentless demand to be the telemarketer my job required."}
