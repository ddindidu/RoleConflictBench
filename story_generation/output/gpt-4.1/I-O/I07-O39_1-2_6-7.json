It was from a colleague in the office, marked \u201cinformational\u2014no immediate action required.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond within a reasonable time, show you\u2019re engaged, even if it\u2019s just a quick \u201cthanks, got it.\u201d But the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. Missing it, even by a minute, was frowned upon\u2014teamwork and safety came first out here, no exceptions. My thumb hovered over my phone, mind racing. If I replied now, I\u2019d be late and draw glares from the crew. If I waited, I\u2019d risk seeming unresponsive, maybe even unreliable, to my office colleagues. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each role demanding something different, and I stood frozen, caught between the world of steel and concrete and the world of screens and instant replies."}
