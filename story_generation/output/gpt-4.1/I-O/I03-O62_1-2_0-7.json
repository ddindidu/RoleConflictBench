He\u2019d just finished a long shift at work, and I could tell he needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. I reached for his hand, ready to give him my full attention, when a sudden splash caught my eye. Across the pool, a group of teenagers laughed as they took turns diving off the edge, right beneath the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My heart thudded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and ignoring this could mean someone getting hurt. But Alex\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for reassurance, silently asking for a moment of my care. I felt torn\u2014my duty to enforce the rules and protect the swimmers clashed with my desire to be the supportive girlfriend Alex needed right now. The seconds stretched, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding I choose which expectation to meet first."}
