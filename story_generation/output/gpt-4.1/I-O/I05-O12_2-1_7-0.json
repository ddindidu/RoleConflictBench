My mentee, Priya, had just messaged me, anxious about her upcoming interview for a team lead position. She wanted to meet right away, hoping for last-minute advice and reassurance. As her mentor, I felt the weight of her trust\u2014she looked to me for guidance, for the kind of encouragement that could tip the scales in her favor. \n\nBut my IDE blinked at me, lines of code from a legacy module sprawled across the screen. I finally had the time to refactor it, to make it clean and efficient, something I\u2019d been promising myself and the team for weeks. The deadline was generous, but I knew if I didn\u2019t seize this quiet window, chaos would soon return and the chance would slip away. \n\nMy mind tugged in two directions: Priya\u2019s growth depended on my presence, but the code\u2019s future depended on my focus. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between being the mentor she needed and the developer my team expected."}
