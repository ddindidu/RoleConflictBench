It was Mia, someone I\u2019d met at a community event last month. \u201cHey! You know the area well, right? Can you recommend a good restaurant for my parents\u2019 anniversary?\u201d she texted. As an acquaintance, I felt I should reply quickly and thoughtfully, maybe even look up a few options to help her out. But as I glanced at the cleaning cart, my heart sank\u2014I\u2019d just realized we were out of the special wood polish Mrs. Lee insisted on for her antique table, and I was supposed to clean it next.
