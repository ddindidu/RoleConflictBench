My mentees were counting on me to guide them through the final steps before their big project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing a structured lesson, eager to share the skills they needed. As I set up in the poolside lounge, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. I noticed a few pool chairs were out of line\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standard I was expected to maintain. The facility manager had been clear: everything should be orderly, always. I glanced at my watch. The mentees would arrive any minute, expecting my full attention and expertise. But the misaligned chairs nagged at me, a silent reminder of my responsibility as a lifeguard. Should I pause to fix them, risking a rushed or distracted session? Or ignore them for now, knowing I\u2019d be falling short of my other duty? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
