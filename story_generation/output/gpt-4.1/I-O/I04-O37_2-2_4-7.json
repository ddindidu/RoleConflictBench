It was Jamie, my closest friend, in a panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home! Can you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours!\u201d I could hear the desperation in their voice. As a friend, I knew I should drop everything and help. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014especially in emergencies.\n\nBut as I hung up, I glanced at the cleaning cart. My supervisor had just reminded us about the new safety protocols: gloves, masks, and a strict order for sanitizing every room. I was already behind schedule, and skipping steps or rushing could mean risking my job\u2014or worse, someone\u2019s health. The rules were clear, and I was expected to follow them without exception.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the unyielding demands of my job. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, each pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
