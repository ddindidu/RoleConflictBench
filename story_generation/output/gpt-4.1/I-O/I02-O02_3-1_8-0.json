My girlfriend paced the room, her voice trembling as she recounted every slight, every misunderstanding that had built up between us. She wanted answers, resolution\u2014she needed to know if we could fix what was broken or if we were just prolonging the inevitable. I could see the pain in her eyes, the expectation that I would step up, listen, and help us find a way forward.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the project. The team was waiting for my input on a new design approach, and though the discussions were still early, I knew my ideas could shape the direction we\u2019d take. They expected me to be creative, focused, and ready to propose solutions. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014her need for emotional clarity, their need for technical insight. My heart raced as I tried to be present for her, but the engineer in me kept analyzing, problem-solving, wanting to escape into the logic of circuits and code. I was torn, caught between the person she needed and the professional I was supposed to be."}
