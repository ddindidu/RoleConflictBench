The memory of the supervisor\u2019s stern warning about flagged equipment issues echoed in my head. I knew I had to get everything in order before the auditors arrived. As I hurried down the hallway, I spotted Jamie, someone I\u2019d met at a few campus events, sitting on a bench, shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. My instinct as an acquaintance was to stop, offer comfort, and be the friendly face Jamie might need right now. But the scientist in me felt the pressure of the ticking clock, the weight of responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was up to standard. I could almost hear the hiss of the autoclave that needed recalibrating. My feet slowed, torn between the urge to sit beside Jamie and the obligation to rush to the lab. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between compassion and duty."}
