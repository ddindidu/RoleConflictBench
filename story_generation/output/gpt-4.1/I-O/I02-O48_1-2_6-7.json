Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your shift?\u201d I can sense her disappointment, the tension simmering from our last conversation. I want to call her, to explain, to smooth things over before it grows into something bigger. That\u2019s what she expects from me\u2014someone who listens, who resolves things quickly, who makes her feel secure.\n\nBut just as I\u2019m about to step into the hallway for a call, I hear Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice tremble from her hospital bed. She\u2019s clutching her blanket, eyes wide, asking if I can sit with her for a while. She\u2019s just out of surgery, and I know how much she needs reassurance right now. My job is to be present, to offer comfort, to make her feel safe.\n\nI stand frozen, phone in hand, torn between the two worlds. Both need me, both expect me to be there, and I can feel the weight of their needs pressing in from both sides."}
