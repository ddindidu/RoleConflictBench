I\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d I\u2019d noticed her struggling with deadlines, and as her mentor, I felt responsible to guide her, to help her find balance and confidence. I wanted to call her right away, to listen and offer advice, to be the support she needed. But as I pulled up the taxi app, another notification flashed\u2014my next passenger was already waiting, sending anxious messages: \u201cAre you close? I really need to get to my meeting on time.\u201d The map showed heavy traffic ahead. My job as a taxi driver demanded punctuality and calm professionalism, no matter how stressed the passenger.
