I miss you.\u201d My heart fluttered. We\u2019d both been so busy, but finally, we had a few free evenings. I wanted nothing more than to spend time with him, to laugh and talk and just be together. But as I set my phone down, my eyes landed on the blueprints spread across my worktable. The cabinetry project was at a critical stage, and the other contractors had just confirmed their availability for late-night work sessions this week. If I didn\u2019t coordinate with them now, the whole timeline could fall apart. My boss was counting on me, and so was the client. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Alex deserved my attention, but so did my team and the project. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of a night out and the responsibility of my craft. I stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
