The deadline was tomorrow, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t wrap up my part, Sarah wouldn\u2019t be able to start hers. She\u2019d already messaged me twice, politely reminding me how our tasks were linked. But my phone kept ringing\u2014another lead, another call. As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle every objection, every question, and lately, prospects were grilling me about the new service. The script barely scratched the surface, and I was supposed to sound confident, knowledgeable, and patient, even as I fumbled for answers. My manager wanted higher conversion rates, and I could almost feel his eyes on my call stats. I felt pulled in two directions: the guilt of letting my team down, the pressure of not meeting my call targets. My mind raced, torn between the spreadsheet and the ringing phone, knowing that whichever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
