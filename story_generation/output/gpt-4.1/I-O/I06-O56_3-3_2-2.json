I\u2019d promised to have it done, and I knew how much my mentor was counting on me. But just as I was about to sneak away to the back room for a few minutes to work on it, the salon door swung open. The bride-to-be and her entourage bustled in, all nerves and excitement, an hour earlier than expected. Their anxious chatter filled the air, and I could see the tension in the bride\u2019s eyes. As a hairdresser, I was supposed to greet them warmly, put them at ease, and make this day special. But my mind kept drifting to the unfinished report, the looming evaluation, and my mentor\u2019s trust. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I tried to smile and welcome the bridal party, all the while feeling the weight of my other promise pressing down on me."}
