It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my client expected a thorough review. Still, the deadline was weeks away. Just as I started reading, my mentee, Sarah, poked her head in. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d she asked, holding a notepad. She\u2019d been struggling with a tricky clause in a different contract, and I\u2019d promised to help her whenever I could. \n\nI wanted to be the mentor who always made time, who shared not just answers but the reasoning behind them. But as she sat down, I felt the weight of my other role. Should I focus on my client\u2019s contract, ensuring every detail was perfect, or pause to guide Sarah, knowing these moments shaped her growth? My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my client and the commitment I\u2019d made to my mentee. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself frozen, caught between the demands of being a diligent lawyer and a supportive mentor."}
