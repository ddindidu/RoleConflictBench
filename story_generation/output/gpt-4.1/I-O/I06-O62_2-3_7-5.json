My mentor had finally carved out a twenty-minute window for me\u2014a rare chance in her packed schedule. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation. But as I hurried through the pool deck, the low hum of the filtration system caught my ear. Something was off. I checked the gauges\u2014pressure was spiking, and the water clarity was already dropping. If I didn\u2019t act now, the pool could become unsafe for everyone. My mind raced: as a lifeguard, I was responsible for the safety of every swimmer, and ignoring this could have serious consequences. But if I missed this meeting, I might not get another chance for weeks, and I didn\u2019t want to let my mentor down. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of duty and the rare opportunity to learn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
