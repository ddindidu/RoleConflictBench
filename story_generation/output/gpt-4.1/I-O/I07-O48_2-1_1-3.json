The team meeting was about to start in five minutes, and I knew this one was important\u2014project updates that wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I was part of the team. But as I looked down the hallway, I saw Mrs. Evans waiting in her room, her chart clipped to the end of her bed. As a nursing assistant, it was my job to take her vital signs right now\u2014her blood pressure, her temperature, her pulse. The morning rounds couldn\u2019t wait; her health depended on it. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the expectations of my team. My phone buzzed with a meeting reminder just as I reached for the blood pressure cuff, and I hesitated, caught in the middle of two worlds, unsure which one I could let down."}
