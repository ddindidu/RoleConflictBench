The scheduling order for the new case is due by Friday, and my mind should be focused on the legal details\u2014deadlines, discovery, clarity. But my phone buzzes again. It\u2019s another message from Alex, my boyfriend. We\u2019ve argued about money three times this week, and he wants to talk it out tonight. He says we can\u2019t keep ignoring it, that we need to resolve things before the weekend. I know he\u2019s right, and I want to be there for him, to listen and work through it together. But the court expects my order to be thorough and precise, and I can\u2019t afford to be distracted. My chest tightens as I try to split my attention, guilt gnawing at me for not being fully present in either role. I want to be a good partner, to fix what\u2019s wrong between us, but I also have a duty to the law and the people who rely on my decisions. The cursor blinks, my phone vibrates, and I feel pulled in two directions, unsure which demand to answer first."}
