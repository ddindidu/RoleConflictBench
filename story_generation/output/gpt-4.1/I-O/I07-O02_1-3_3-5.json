As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish the documentation for our project by the end of the week. The deadline was generous, and honestly, the others could keep moving without my part for a bit. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let them down or seem unreliable.\n\nBut as an engineer, my mind kept drifting to the inspector\u2019s report from this morning. The safety concerns he raised weren\u2019t minor\u2014if we didn\u2019t address them immediately, the whole operation could be shut down. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. I knew I should drop everything and focus on resolving the compliance issues, but I could already imagine the disappointment in my teammates\u2019 eyes if I missed my deadline.\n\nMy hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the quiet expectations of my colleagues and the urgent demands of my profession. The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension knotting in my stomach, unsure which role to serve first."}
