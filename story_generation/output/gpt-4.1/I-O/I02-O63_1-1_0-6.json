I hear the front door open, and my girlfriend walks in, dropping her bag with a sigh. She doesn\u2019t say much, just gives me a tired smile and heads to the kitchen. I know that look; she\u2019s had a rough day, and I want to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort. But I\u2019m still technically on the clock, and I\u2019m supposed to stick to my break schedule, even if it\u2019s a bit flexible. If I take my break early, I risk setting a bad example or getting called out if the call volume suddenly spikes. If I wait, I\u2019ll miss the chance to be there for her when she needs me most. My headset feels heavier as I weigh my options, torn between being the supportive boyfriend she deserves and the reliable employee my job expects."}
