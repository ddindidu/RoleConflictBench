The code was mine\u2014functions I\u2019d merged just yesterday, now threatening to bring down a critical system. My inbox pinged with a message from my mentee, anxious about their own high-stakes project review. They needed guidance, reassurance, maybe even a pep talk to steady their nerves before the big meeting.

Every minute I spent away from the terminal risked more downtime, more angry users, more questions from management.
