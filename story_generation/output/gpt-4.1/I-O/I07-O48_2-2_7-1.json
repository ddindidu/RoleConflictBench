I knew it was my team\u2019s group chat\u2014waiting for my response so they could move forward with the project. The email notification blinked at me, a reminder that I was expected to be present and responsive as a colleague. But just then, Mrs. Carter, fresh from surgery, called out softly from her room. She needed help getting dressed, her movements slow and uncertain. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be attentive, gentle, and patient, especially with someone so vulnerable. My mind raced: if I paused to answer my colleagues, I\u2019d leave Mrs. Carter waiting, possibly uncomfortable or even at risk. But if I focused on her, the team would be stalled, maybe frustrated with my silence. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention at the same moment. I hesitated in the doorway, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the expectations of my team, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which responsibility to answer first."}
