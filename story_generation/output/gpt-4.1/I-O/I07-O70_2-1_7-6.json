I glanced at the screen\u2014my team was waiting for my clarification before they could move forward with the project. As a colleague, I knew how important it was to respond quickly; everyone was counting on me to keep things moving. But as I stepped out of the van, package in hand, I saw the customer waiting at the door. I was expected to greet them with a smile, confirm their details, and hand over the parcel with the utmost professionalism. My mind raced. If I paused to type out a quick reply, the customer might think I was rude or inattentive. If I focused on the delivery, my team would be left hanging, possibly delaying the whole project. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each role demanding my immediate attention, and I stood there, torn between the two, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
