It\u2019s Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. My flight\u2019s in two hours. Can you check and bring it to me? Please, I\u2019m at Terminal 3.\u201d I glance at the meter ticking on my dashboard, the next fare already waiting in the back seat, but Sam\u2019s desperation tugs at me. I promise to check, heart pounding. \n\nAs I race back toward Sam\u2019s apartment, the rain intensifies, and cars weave unpredictably around me. My instincts as a taxi driver scream at me to slow down, keep my distance, obey every rule\u2014especially in this weather. But the image of Sam stranded at the airport, missing his flight, gnaws at me. Every second counts for him, but every reckless move could put me and others in danger. My hands grip the wheel tighter, torn between the urge to rush for my friend and the responsibility to drive safely. The pressure mounts with every passing block, and I can feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding different things from me."}
