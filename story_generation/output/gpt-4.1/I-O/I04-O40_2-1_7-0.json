It was a message from Sam, my oldest friend. I\u2019d sent a quick text last night, but reading their reply now, I could tell they\u2019d taken it the wrong way. The words were clipped, the hurt obvious. I knew I should call right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let things fester.\n\nBut the clock on the wall glared at me: 7:55. I was due on site in five minutes. As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t be late, not with the new safety protocols in place. The foreman had made it clear\u2014everyone had to be present for the morning briefing, or risk being sent home. Safety wasn\u2019t just a rule, it was a responsibility. If I missed it, I\u2019d be letting the whole crew down, maybe even putting someone at risk.\n\nI stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, hard hat in the other, my heart pounding. I could hear Sam\u2019s voice in my head, needing reassurance. I could also hear the foreman\u2019s warning, sharp and uncompromising. I was torn, caught between being the friend Sam needed and the carpenter my team depended on."}
