Tonight was the only evening my boyfriend and I had free before he left for a week-long business trip. He\u2019d been hinting all week about how much he was looking forward to a quiet dinner, just the two of us. I wanted that too\u2014time to reconnect, to laugh, to hold his hand and forget about everything else.\n\nBut just as I was about to close up the workshop, a woman rushed in, her little boy clutching a broken wooden train. She looked desperate. \u201cHe\u2019s been crying all day. Can you please fix it? I need a quote tonight so I can tell him it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d I saw the hope in her eyes, the trust that I could make things right.\n\nI felt torn in two. My boyfriend\u2019s face flashed in my mind, waiting for me, expecting me to show him he mattered. But the little boy\u2019s trembling lip tugged at my heart, and I knew my skills could bring him comfort. I stood there, keys in hand, caught between the pull of love and the call of responsibility, unsure which part of me to honor first."}
