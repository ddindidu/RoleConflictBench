My mentee, Sarah, pings me: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m stuck on the project plan.\u201d As her mentor, I know she needs guidance now, not later. She\u2019s been struggling, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, especially during crunch time. But as a telemarketer, my breaks are strictly timed. Management\u2019s been clear: no extra minutes, no exceptions. The phone queue is relentless, and every second I\u2019m away, calls pile up. I feel the pressure from both sides\u2014Sarah\u2019s anxious message tugs at my sense of responsibility, while the looming threat of a reprimand from my supervisor makes my stomach knot.
