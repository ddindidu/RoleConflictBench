It was Sam, my old friend, sounding frazzled. He\u2019d just moved into his new apartment and was knee-deep in flat-pack chaos. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? These instructions make no sense,\u201d he texted. I could almost hear the frustration in his words. As a friend, I knew he counted on me, especially since he didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to help.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my foreman walked by, pinning up a notice about an optional training session next week. \u201cWe need more guys certified for the new equipment,\u201d he said, glancing at me. I knew what that meant\u2014if I wanted to keep up with the team and maybe get more hours, I should be there. My mind spun. Sam needed me now, but the crew expected me to step up, too. I stared at my phone, torn between being the friend Sam could rely on and the worker my team needed. My thumb hovered over the screen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
