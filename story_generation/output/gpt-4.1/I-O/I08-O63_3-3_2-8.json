As I hurried to the break room, I saw Jamie, someone I knew from another department, sitting alone and crying quietly. My instinct as an acquaintance was to stop, offer comfort, and just be there for them. I could see they needed someone to talk to, and I felt the weight of expectation to be kind and supportive. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my break was almost over. If I didn\u2019t return to my desk on time, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d have to explain myself to my supervisor again. I felt torn, caught between being a decent person and protecting my job. My heart ached for Jamie, but my mind raced with anxiety about the consequences of even a few unscheduled minutes away from my calls. I stood there, frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
