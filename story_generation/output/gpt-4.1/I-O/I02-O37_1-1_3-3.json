It was Mia, asking if we could finally have that date night we\u2019d been talking about. She sounded excited\u2014after all, we both had a few free evenings this week, a rare thing lately. I could almost hear her smile through the text, and I knew she was hoping for a night just for us, no distractions.\n\nBut as I glanced at the nearly empty shelf of disinfectant and the dwindling stack of trash bags, my heart sank. The supply order was overdue, and if I didn\u2019t get it sorted tonight, tomorrow\u2019s cleaning schedule would be a disaster. My boss had made it clear: no slip-ups, no excuses. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mia\u2019s hopeful anticipation, the silent demand of my job. I wanted to be the boyfriend she deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t let my work slide. My mind raced, torn between the promise of laughter and warmth, and the cold, practical reality of my responsibilities."}
