As an acquaintance, I always tried to steer clear of gossip, believing it only bred negativity. But the conversation was magnetic, and I could feel their eyes flick to me, expecting me to chime in with my own opinion. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: a customer was waiting for their grocery delivery, and the window was closing fast. I knew how important it was to deliver on time\u2014especially when dinner plans depended on it. My mind raced, torn between the unspoken pressure to join the group and the professional responsibility pulling me toward the door. If I left abruptly, would they think I was rude or hiding something? If I stayed, I risked being late and letting down a customer who was counting on me. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I hesitated, caught between the demands of friendship and duty."}
