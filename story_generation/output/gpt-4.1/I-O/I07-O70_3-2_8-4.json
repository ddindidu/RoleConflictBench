I glanced at the screen\u2014leadership needed a prompt reply to confirm details for an external partner, and the subject line was marked \u201curgent.\u201d As a colleague, I knew the expectation: respond quickly, keep the project moving, don\u2019t let the team down. But as a delivery person, I had my own standards to uphold. The packages needed to be secured, and I had to get a signature for each one\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. I could see the client\u2019s receptionist through the glass doors, waiting for me. My mind raced. If I paused to answer the email, I\u2019d risk being late and possibly missing the recipient, which could mean rescheduling the delivery and breaking protocol.
