The building manager waved me over, her smile tight. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for you to start,\u201d she said. I knew what this was about\u2014the noise complaint that had everyone on edge. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, to listen, to help smooth things over. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: urgent Slack messages from my team. The production outage was still unresolved, and the root cause was a bug I\u2019d introduced. Users were locked out, and the pressure to fix it was mounting by the minute. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the expectation to be present and polite with my neighbors and the desperate need to get back upstairs and troubleshoot. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I tried to figure out how I could possibly meet both demands."}
