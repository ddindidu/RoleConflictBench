My mentee, Sarah, hovered nearby, her eyes wide with anxiety as she struggled with the quarterly reconciliation\u2014a task I knew could make or break her confidence. She needed my guidance, and I could see the spreadsheet on her screen was riddled with errors. As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to walk her through each step, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned from years of experience, especially since a single mistake could have serious consequences for the company.\n\nBut just as I was about to pull up a chair beside her, my phone buzzed. The external auditor was on the line, requesting immediate access to our latest financial statements. As the accountant, it was my duty to ensure every record was accurate and ready for scrutiny. The expectation was clear: no delays, no errors.\n\nI glanced between Sarah\u2019s anxious face and the urgent email from the auditor. My mind raced, torn between the need to mentor and the pressing demand to fulfill my accounting responsibilities. The pressure built inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I felt utterly paralyzed, caught in the middle of incompatible expectations."}
