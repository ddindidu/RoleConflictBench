The line snakes past the candy racks, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I answer quietly, hoping for a quick hello, but her voice trembles. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now. It\u2019s about Jamie. We had a huge fight.\u201d I glance at the growing line, the next customer already unloading their basket, eyes darting between me and their watch.
