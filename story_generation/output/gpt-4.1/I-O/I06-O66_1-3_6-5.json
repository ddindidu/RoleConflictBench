I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time, not after she\u2019d made herself so available for us. But the fare in my backseat was anxious, tapping his foot, and the route was crawling. Up ahead, orange cones funneled traffic into a single lane, and just beyond, a cluster of children waited at the curb, their backpacks bright against the gray morning. The school zone sign flashed, demanding I slow to a crawl. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentor office hours end soon.\u201d I gripped the wheel tighter, feeling the weight of two worlds. If I sped up, I might make it in time to show my mentor I respected her commitment. But the children, the law, the responsibility of every life in my cab\u2014they pressed on me just as hard. My passenger sighed, impatient. My heart thudded, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my mentor and the duty I owed to the road."}
