My mentee, Alex, hovered nearby, eyes bright with curiosity. He\u2019d been waiting for this moment all morning, eager to ask about the best way to reinforce a load-bearing beam. As his mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to share what I\u2019d learned over the years, to nurture his growth. But the foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014safety meeting at the work area, sharp at ten. No exceptions. If I was late, I\u2019d be setting a poor example for the crew, risking not just my own safety but theirs too.\n\nAlex\u2019s question tumbled out, and I saw the hope in his face. I wanted to give him a thoughtful answer, to be the mentor he needed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: five minutes until the safety briefing. My heart pounded as I stood between the break room and the work area, torn between the urge to guide Alex and the duty to uphold safety protocols.
