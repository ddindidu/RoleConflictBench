I hadn\u2019t meant my text to sound harsh, but clearly, something had gone wrong. I knew I should call right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014talk things out, make sure no one\u2019s left hurting. But in the rearview mirror, my passenger was humming along to the radio, relaxed, expecting a smooth, safe ride to their meeting. I was on the clock, responsible for their safety, and I couldn\u2019t just pull over or get distracted. My phone buzzed again, my friend\u2019s name lighting up the screen. My hands tightened on the wheel. I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me, but so did my passenger. The urge to fix things with my friend battled with my duty to drive responsibly. I could feel the pressure building, caught between being the friend who\u2019s always there and the driver who never lets anyone down."}
