My boyfriend\u2019s angry texts flashed on the screen, each one sharper than the last. We\u2019d argued last night\u2014really argued\u2014and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. I knew I should call him, try to resolve things before they got worse. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do: face the conflict, talk it out, fight for us.\n\nBut as a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, even the little things like those pool chairs. My supervisor was a stickler for details, and I could already hear her voice in my head, reminding me that safety and order started with the small stuff. If I left the chairs as they were, I\u2019d be letting my team down. If I ignored my boyfriend, I might lose him. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each pulling me in a different direction. I stood frozen, torn between the pool deck and my phone, not sure which responsibility to answer first."}
