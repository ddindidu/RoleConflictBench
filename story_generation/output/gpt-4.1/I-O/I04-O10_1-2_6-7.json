I glanced down to see a message from my friend, Sarah: \u201cHey, are we meeting at the caf\u00e9 or the park? I\u2019m already on my way!\u201d At the same moment, an email notification popped up from a client, Mr. Lee, with the subject line: \u201cUrgent: Invoice Clarification Needed.\u201d My heart rate picked up. Sarah and I had a misunderstanding last week, and I promised I\u2019d be clearer this time. She was probably already anxious, and I knew a quick reply would help us avoid another awkward situation. But Mr. Lee\u2019s email was marked urgent, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to respond to client queries immediately, especially about invoices. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice reminding me how important client communication is for our reputation. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a reassuring message to my friend and drafting a professional response to the client. The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside\u2014friend or accountant, which role do I answer first?"}
