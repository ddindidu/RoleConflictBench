He\u2019s in obvious pain, and I know he needs my full attention to get through lunch. But the message is from Maya\u2014my best friend. She\u2019s already texted twice, sounding confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet after my shift. We\u2019ve had a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be clear this time, to avoid another misunderstanding. I can feel the weight of her expectation: to be the friend who communicates, who doesn\u2019t leave her hanging. But right now, Mr. Lee is looking at me, waiting for help, and I know my job as a nursing assistant is to be present, to make sure he\u2019s safe and cared for. My fingers itch to grab my phone, just for a second, to reassure Maya. But I can\u2019t leave Mr. Lee struggling. The pressure builds in my chest as I stand between the two worlds, both needing me, both expecting something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
