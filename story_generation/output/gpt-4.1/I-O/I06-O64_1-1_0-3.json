My mentor had suggested some extra reading\u2014nothing urgent, just something to help me grow. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get to it, but the days kept slipping by. Now, as I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy. It wasn\u2019t much, just a few coins off, and it didn\u2019t affect the total sales. Still, store policy was clear: report any irregularities, no matter how minor.\n\nI glanced at the clock, thinking about the reading I still hadn\u2019t started. My mentor would probably ask about it soon, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them. But here I was, faced with a choice\u2014do I take the time to fill out the tedious discrepancy report, knowing it would eat into the little free time I had left for my assignment? Or do I let it slide, just this once, so I can finally focus on my growth as a mentee? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
