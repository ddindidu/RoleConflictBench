It was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short, but I could sense the frustration: \u201cI thought we were spending Saturday together. Why did you make plans with your friends?\u201d I sighed, feeling the familiar tug of guilt. As her boyfriend, I knew she expected me to resolve these little misunderstandings, to reassure her that she mattered most. But as a police officer, I also had to keep myself in top shape\u2014physical fitness wasn\u2019t just a personal goal, it was a professional necessity. The gym wasn\u2019t just about me; it was about being ready to protect others. I stared at my phone, torn. If I called Mia now, I\u2019d be late for my workout, risking my own standards and maybe even my readiness for the job. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting her down, letting a small rift grow. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my heart\u2014pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and love."}
