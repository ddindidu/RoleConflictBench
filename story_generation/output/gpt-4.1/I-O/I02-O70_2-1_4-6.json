My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only time we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long delivery route. She\u2019d planned a cozy dinner, and I promised her my undivided attention. But just as I was about to leave for her place, my phone buzzed\u2014a last-minute delivery request from my boss, marked urgent. The customer was waiting nearby, and I was the only driver available. I could feel my heart pounding as I weighed my options. If I ignored the delivery, I\u2019d risk my job and disappoint a customer who expected prompt, professional service. But if I accepted, I\u2019d be late for our precious evening, letting down the person I love most. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I made to her. I stared at my phone, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
