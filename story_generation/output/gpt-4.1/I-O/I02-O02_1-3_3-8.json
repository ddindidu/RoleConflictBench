We finally have time.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d both been waiting for a week like this, free evenings stretching ahead of us. She deserved my full attention, a real night out, not just takeout and tired conversation. But as I started to reply, my work email pinged. The project manager\u2019s subject line was urgent: \u201cNeed your estimates by tomorrow\u2014client contract depends on it.\u201d I knew the team was waiting on me, and any delay would push the whole project back. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of Mia\u2019s anticipation and the pressure of my team\u2019s expectations. I wanted to be the boyfriend who made her feel special, but I was also the engineer everyone was counting on. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how to be both at once."}
