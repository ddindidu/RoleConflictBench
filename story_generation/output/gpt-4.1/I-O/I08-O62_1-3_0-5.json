The air was still, and my mind raced with worry\u2014earlier, I\u2019d noticed the filter making a strange noise, and I knew it could be dangerous if left unchecked. Just as I rounded the corner, I spotted Jamie, someone I\u2019d met at a few staff events. Jamie smiled and slowed, clearly expecting a friendly chat. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to stop, exchange pleasantries, and be approachable\u2014after all, that\u2019s what people expect from me. But as a lifeguard, I knew every second counted; the malfunctioning filter could put swimmers at risk, and it was my responsibility to act fast. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014should I pause and be the friendly face Jamie expected, or rush past and risk seeming rude, all for the sake of safety? The hallway felt even quieter as I hesitated, caught between two roles, unsure which demand to answer first."}
