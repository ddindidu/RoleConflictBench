I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend, Jamie, had sent a long message about how awful and exhausting her day had been. She always counted on me to listen, to be the one who replied right away with empathy and encouragement. I could almost hear her voice, hoping for a quick response, needing someone to care.\n\nBut the register was open, bills and coins stacked in neat piles, and the store\u2019s policy was clear: no distractions, no mistakes, every cent accounted for. The manager had warned us that even a small error could trigger a tedious audit. I felt the pressure of the store\u2019s expectations, the weight of responsibility in my hands.\n\nMy thumb hovered over my phone, torn between the urge to comfort Jamie and the need to focus on the deposit.
