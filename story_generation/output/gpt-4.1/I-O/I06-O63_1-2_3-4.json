It\u2019s not urgent, but I know I\u2019m supposed to communicate openly, even about minor things. I glance at the clock. Only an hour left in my shift, and I\u2019m still three sales short of my weekly target. Management\u2019s reminders echo in my head: \u201cEvery call counts. Don\u2019t let up at the end.\u201d \n\nI stare at my phone, thumb hovering over the message icon.
