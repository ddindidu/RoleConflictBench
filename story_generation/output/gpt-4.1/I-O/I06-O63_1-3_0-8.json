My mentor had emailed me that morning, suggesting a few articles to read\u2014nothing urgent, just \u201cwhenever you have time.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to show I was eager and committed, even if the deadline was weeks away. But as I opened the first article on my phone, the compliance system\u2019s timer blinked at me from the corner of my screen. Every minute I wasn\u2019t on a call was logged, and I\u2019d already been warned about unscheduled breaks. If I got flagged again, it could mean a formal warning or worse.\n\nI tried to focus on the article, but my eyes kept darting to the timer. I could hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding us that every second counted. But I also imagined my mentor\u2019s disappointment if I showed up unprepared at our next meeting. My stomach twisted as I weighed the risk of reading now against the fear of letting her down. The cursor blinked, the phone lines buzzed, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that seemed impossible to reconcile."}
