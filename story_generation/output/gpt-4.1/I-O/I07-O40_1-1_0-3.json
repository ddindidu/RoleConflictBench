As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show my engagement, even though this was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded for anyone who missed it. I knew my manager valued visible participation, and skipping out\u2014even with a recording\u2014might be seen as slacking.\n\nBut just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed with a new order for a custom bookshelf. As the carpenter, it was on me to estimate the materials and place the supply order immediately, or risk delaying the whole project. The supplier\u2019s cutoff was in an hour, and if I missed it, the client\u2019s timeline would be shot.\n\nI stared at my screen, feeling the pressure build in my chest. Both roles demanded my attention at the same time, and I could already imagine the disappointment from my team if I skipped the meeting, or the frustration from the client if their order was delayed. My mind raced, torn between being a reliable colleague and a responsible carpenter, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
