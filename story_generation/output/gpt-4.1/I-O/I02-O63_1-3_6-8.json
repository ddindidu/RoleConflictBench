Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I can almost hear the disappointment in her words. As her boyfriend, I know I should call her right now, talk it through, and clear up the misunderstanding before it festers. That\u2019s what she expects\u2014what I expect of myself, too. But I\u2019m sitting at my telemarketing cubicle, headset on, the clock ticking. My break isn\u2019t for another twenty minutes, and the compliance system is ruthless. If I\u2019m away from my desk for even a minute, it\u2019ll flag me, and I can\u2019t afford another warning. My supervisor\u2019s already made it clear: one more infraction, and I\u2019m out. I stare at the screen, torn. Mia needs me, but so does my job. My thumb hovers over the phone, my mind racing, caught between the urge to be the boyfriend she deserves and the employee my job demands."}
