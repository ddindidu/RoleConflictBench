We\u2019re all waiting.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past noon. As a colleague, I knew everyone was stuck until I replied, and the team expected me to be responsive, especially when a shared task was on hold. But my inbox was overflowing, and I hadn\u2019t even started reviewing the requirements for the new client project. As the lead engineer, I was supposed to join the project planning call in ten minutes and provide accurate time estimates. The client\u2019s contract depended on my numbers, and any mistake could cost us. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to be a reliable teammate and the responsibility to deliver precise engineering input. If I rushed my reply to the team, I might miss a crucial detail. If I focused on the estimates, I\u2019d leave my colleagues hanging, slowing everyone down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
