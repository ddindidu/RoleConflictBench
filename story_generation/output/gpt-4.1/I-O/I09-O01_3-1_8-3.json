The lines had to be precise\u2014every inch mattered in such a small space. My mind was deep in the flow of design, thinking about how to maximize light and storage, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Kim, my neighbor. She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially since the building was scheduled for a power interruption. She sounded worried about her fridge and a delivery of medication.\n\nI stared at my half-finished sketch, feeling the pressure build. As an architect, I was trained to focus, to solve problems with undivided attention. But as a neighbor, I was expected to be present, helpful, and reliable. I knew Mrs. Kim counted on me, but I also knew that if I lost my momentum now, the design would suffer.

I sat there, pencil hovering, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
