Can you talk?\u201d I knew Jamie needed me\u2014he\u2019d been having a hard time lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to listen, to help him feel less alone. But at that exact moment, my clerk hurried over, eyes wide, and handed me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent my entire jury instruction was based on. I felt my heart race. As a judge, I was expected to be up-to-the-minute on the law, to ensure justice was served, and now I had to halt everything, review the new ruling, and possibly rewrite my instructions on the spot.

I stared at my phone, then at the anxious faces in the jury box, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
