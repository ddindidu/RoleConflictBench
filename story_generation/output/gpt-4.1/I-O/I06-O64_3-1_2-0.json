My mind kept drifting to the assignment my mentor had given me\u2014an analysis that needed to be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice, reminding me how important it was to meet deadlines and show initiative. But here I was, hands moving automatically over barcodes, trying to focus on each transaction. The expectation was clear: every item scanned correctly, every total accurate, no mistakes. \n\nYet, with each beep, anxiety gnawed at me. I wanted to prove myself as a dedicated mentee, but I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post as a cashier. My manager expected reliability, and customers expected quick, error-free service. I glanced at the clock, calculating how much time I\u2019d have left for the assignment after my shift. My heart pounded as I wondered if I could meet both sets of expectations. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt trapped, torn between my responsibilities as a mentee and as a cashier, unsure which demand I should prioritize."}
