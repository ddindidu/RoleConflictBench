It was Mark, an old acquaintance, asking if I could help him move a few boxes to his new apartment. He sounded a bit desperate, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call. I wanted to say yes\u2014after all, that\u2019s what friends, or even just decent acquaintances, do. But as I was about to reply, two travelers approached my cab, each dragging heavy suitcases. They looked tired and relieved to see me, and immediately asked if I could help them load their bags and take them to the train station, mentioning they\u2019d split the fare.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting. Mark was counting on me for support, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. At the same time, as a taxi driver, I was expected to provide prompt, professional service to my customers, and these travelers clearly needed help. My mind raced, torn between the pull of personal loyalty and the demands of my job. I stood there, phone in hand, glancing between the message from Mark and the hopeful faces of the travelers, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
