She\u2019d just gotten some harsh feedback at work, and her words were heavy with disappointment. I could almost hear her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed comfort, reassurance, someone to tell her she was more than her boss\u2019s opinion. But just as I started to type a reply, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager was strict, and I\u2019d seen coworkers get written up for less. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Mia\u2019s pain on one side, the store\u2019s rules on the other. My fingers hovered over the keys, torn between sending a quick, supportive message and focusing on the register to avoid trouble. My heart ached for her, but my mind raced with the fear of making a mistake at work. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding my attention, and I didn\u2019t know which to choose."}
