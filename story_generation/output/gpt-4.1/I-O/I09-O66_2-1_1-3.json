I wrapped it carefully, hoping to make a good impression and maybe spark a friendly conversation. As I was heading out, my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request popped up. I hesitated, but work was work, and I needed the fare. I grabbed my keys and the cake, thinking maybe I\u2019d run into someone on my way to the car.\n\nAs I pulled out of the parking lot, I spotted Mrs. Kim, the neighbor from across the hall, walking her dog. She smiled and waved, and I felt the urge to stop, introduce myself, and offer her the cake. But my passenger was already waiting, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be late. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be punctual and follow all the traffic rules, especially with the roads so clear today. My heart pounded as I slowed near Mrs. Kim, torn between rolling down the window to greet her and the pressure to keep moving, stay on schedule, and drive safely."}
