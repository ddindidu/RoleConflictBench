My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our weekly check-in, her project at a critical stage. She relied on my guidance, and I knew she\u2019d be anxious for feedback. But just as I was about to call her, my next client arrived\u2014fresh from the gym, hair damp and sticking to her forehead. She looked embarrassed, apologizing for not having time to shower. As a hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition her hair before starting, making her feel comfortable and cared for. But if I delayed Sarah, she might lose momentum or feel unsupported. If I rushed the client, I\u2019d compromise the quality of my service and her comfort. My phone buzzed with Sarah\u2019s message: \u201cReady when you are!\u201d My hands hovered between the phone and the shampoo bottle, my mind torn by the demands of being both a mentor and a hairdresser, each expecting my full attention, each deserving it. The pressure built in my chest as I tried to decide who needed me more in that moment."}
