I could see he was uncomfortable, so I tried to be warm and easygoing, asking gentle questions and offering a reassuring smile. I wanted him to feel welcome, to see me as just another friendly face in the group. But as we talked, the noise from the protest nearby grew louder. Shouts echoed, and I saw people pushing, the mood shifting from passionate to volatile. My radio crackled at my hip, a reminder of my duty as a police officer. I was off-duty, but I knew the law, knew the risks if things got out of hand. My instincts screamed at me to step in, to help restore order, but Ben\u2019s anxious eyes were on me, searching for comfort, not authority. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding calm and connection, the other demanding action and control. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to answer."}
