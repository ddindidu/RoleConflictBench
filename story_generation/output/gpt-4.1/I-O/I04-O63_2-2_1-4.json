It was Jamie, my best friend, and her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. My heart twisted\u2014I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But I glanced at the clock: only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager had already warned me about my numbers, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind again. The headset felt heavy on my head, the script open in front of me, but Jamie\u2019s pain was so real on the other end of the line. I wanted to be the friend she needed, but the pressure to keep my job and meet my quota pressed in on me. My mind raced, torn between the comfort I owed my friend and the responsibility I owed my job, as Jamie waited for my answer."}
