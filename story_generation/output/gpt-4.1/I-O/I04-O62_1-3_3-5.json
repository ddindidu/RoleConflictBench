It was Sam, my best friend, looking frazzled on a video call. \u201cHey, can you help me? I\u2019m totally lost with this furniture. The instructions make no sense.\u201d I could see the half-built bookshelf behind him, pieces scattered everywhere. I knew he\u2019d been having a rough week, and I wanted to be there for him\u2014he\u2019d do the same for me.\n\nBut as I glanced over at the pool, I noticed the water looked cloudy. I checked the filtration system and realized it wasn\u2019t working right. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, someone could get hurt, and it was my responsibility to keep everyone safe. My supervisor always emphasized that equipment maintenance was non-negotiable.\n\nSam\u2019s call kept ringing. I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me, but so did the swimmers. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable friend or the vigilant lifeguard. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
