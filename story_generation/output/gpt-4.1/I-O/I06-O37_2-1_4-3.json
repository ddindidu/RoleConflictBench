The code just wouldn\u2019t run, and I knew I was supposed to let my mentor know about any roadblocks right away. That was the expectation\u2014open communication, no matter how small the issue. But just as I was about to draft an email, I glanced at the cleaning cart beside me. I was halfway through my shift as a housekeeping cleaner, and the checklist was clear: supplies had to be counted and restocked before the next room. If I didn\u2019t finish on time, the supervisor would notice, and I\u2019d risk a warning. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my mentor, asking for a progress update. I felt the pressure building\u2014should I pause my cleaning duties to reach out, or finish the inventory first and risk delaying my communication? Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pulling me in opposite directions. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which responsibility to put first."}
