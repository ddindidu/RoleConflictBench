We\u2019d been at each other\u2019s throats all week about money\u2014who pays for what, how much we should save, whether we can afford that trip he wants. As his girlfriend, I know I should be the one to reach out, to smooth things over before the resentment festers. But just as I was about to text him, Mrs. Patel walked in, her usual bright scarf trailing behind her. She smiled, expecting the warm greeting I always give, the one that makes her feel at home here. The receptionist was chatting idly, leaving it to me. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down: the girlfriend who needs to fix things, the hairdresser who needs to be welcoming and attentive. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014Mark, again. My heart pounded as I forced a smile for Mrs. Patel, torn between the urge to step away and call him, and the duty to make my client feel special. The two worlds collided, and I stood frozen, caught between what I owe to love and what I owe to my work."}
