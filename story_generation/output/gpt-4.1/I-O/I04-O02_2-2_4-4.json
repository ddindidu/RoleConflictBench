The new safety standard was going into effect tomorrow, and I was the lead engineer responsible for ensuring every box was ticked before the release. My manager had made it clear: any slip-up could mean a costly delay and a hit to our reputation. As I scrolled through the requirements, my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was Sam, my oldest friend. He sounded frantic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport. Can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it back in time to finish the compliance report. But Sam had always been there for me, and missing his flight would ruin his long-awaited trip. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my job and the desperate plea of a friend who counted on me."}
