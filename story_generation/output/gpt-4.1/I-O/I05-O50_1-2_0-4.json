I knew she\u2019d been struggling to find her footing, and I wanted to help. I started to give her some advice, sharing what had worked for me when I was in her shoes. But as I spoke, my phone buzzed\u2014an alert from the maintenance system. Three of the older machines were running hotter than normal, and I realized they\u2019d missed their last service window. I was supposed to be on the floor, cleaning and checking them, making sure nothing failed. My supervisor had made it clear: machine downtime was unacceptable. Yet here I was, caught between being the mentor Jamie needed and the repairer the machines\u2014and the company\u2014depended on. I could see the expectation in Jamie\u2019s face, waiting for my guidance, while the machines\u2019 warning lights flashed in my mind. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out which role I should answer first."}
