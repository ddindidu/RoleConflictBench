My heart pounds as I try to soothe her, apologizing and promising to fix the issue. In the midst of this, my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from a colleague. I know the expectation: respond to emails and messages within a reasonable time, even if it\u2019s just to acknowledge receipt. The message preview says, \u201cNo immediate action needed, just FYI,\u201d but I can\u2019t help but feel the tug of responsibility. I want to be a reliable teammate, but right now, my hands are full\u2014literally\u2014with groceries and receipts. The customer\u2019s frustration grows, and I force myself to focus on her, but my mind keeps drifting to the unread message, the silent pressure to reply. I feel torn, caught between being the attentive cashier my manager expects and the responsive colleague my team relies on, unsure which role to prioritize as the demands of both press in on me."}
