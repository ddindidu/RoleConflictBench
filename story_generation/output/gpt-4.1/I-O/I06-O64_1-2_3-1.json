The line stretches past the candy racks, and customers shift impatiently, glancing at their watches. My mind keeps drifting to the email draft open on my phone in the break room. My mentor asked me to reach out if I had any questions, no matter how small. There\u2019s a term in the training manual I don\u2019t quite understand. It\u2019s not stopping my work, but I know she expects me to communicate openly. \n\nBut right now, every beep of the scanner feels like a countdown. The store manager expects me to keep the line moving, double-check prices, and handle cash without mistakes. If I pause to send a message, even for a minute, the line will grow, and customers will get frustrated. My mentor\u2019s words echo in my head\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to ask questions\u201d\u2014but so does my manager\u2019s warning about keeping the checkout efficient. I grip the register tighter, feeling the pressure from both sides, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
