As her doctor, I knew she needed my full attention\u2014she was anxious, and I wanted to reassure her, answer her questions thoroughly, and make sure she left feeling heard. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I knew it was the leadership team; they\u2019d been waiting for my confirmation on the details for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our external partner. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, especially when the team was counting on me to keep things moving. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I ignored the message, I\u2019d be letting my colleagues down and possibly delaying an important project. But if I checked my phone now, I\u2019d be breaking the trust I\u2019d built with Mrs. Lee, making her feel like just another appointment. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my team and the immediate needs of my patient, both expecting my undivided attention."}
