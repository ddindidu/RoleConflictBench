As I waited for her to answer the door, I remembered the conversation I\u2019d overheard in the lobby just minutes before. Someone had mentioned Mrs. Lee\u2019s name, whispering about a rumor that could seriously damage her reputation. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t spread gossip or speak ill of others, but the information was burning in my mind.\n\nWhen Mrs. Lee opened the door, she greeted me warmly, recognizing me from the neighborhood. As a delivery person, I was expected to be polite and professional, focusing only on the package. But as an acquaintance, I felt a strange urge to warn her, to let her know what was being said. My mind raced\u2014should I keep the conversation strictly professional, or should I break the silence and risk crossing a line? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I stood there, package outstretched, caught between what I should say and what I shouldn\u2019t."}
