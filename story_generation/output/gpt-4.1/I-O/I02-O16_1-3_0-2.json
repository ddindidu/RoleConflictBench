Can we talk?\u201d I knew she needed me, and as her boyfriend, I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. But just as I was about to reply, my pager buzzed urgently. A patient had just been rushed into the ER\u2014unconscious, feverish, and with symptoms I couldn\u2019t immediately identify. The nurses looked to me for answers, expecting the calm, decisive doctor who could unravel medical mysteries and save lives.\n\nMy mind raced. Mia\u2019s voice echoed in my head, the way she\u2019d said last week, \u201cSometimes I just need you to be present.\u201d But the patient\u2019s life might depend on my focus, my expertise. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mia\u2019s need for comfort, the hospital\u2019s need for my undivided attention. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person I loved and the oath I\u2019d taken. I stared at my phone, then at the ER doors, feeling the impossible pull of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
