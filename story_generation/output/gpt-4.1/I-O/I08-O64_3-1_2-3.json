She was next in line, her eyes red and puffy, cheeks streaked with tears. As an acquaintance, I felt a tug to reach out, to ask if she was okay, to offer comfort. But as the cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving, stick to the script, and follow store policies. \n\nJust as Maya handed me her items, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014a coupon hadn\u2019t scanned properly. Store policy said I should call a manager, but that would mean holding up the line and drawing attention to Maya, who already looked like she wanted to disappear. My mind raced. Should I quietly fix it and risk breaking procedure, or follow the rules and risk embarrassing her further?
