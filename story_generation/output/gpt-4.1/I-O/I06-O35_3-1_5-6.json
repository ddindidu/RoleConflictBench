My mentor had always emphasized, \u201cIf you hit a roadblock, let me know right away.\u201d Now, my project team was falling apart\u2014arguments, missed deadlines, and I could feel the deliverable slipping through my fingers. I needed to email my mentor, explain everything, ask for advice before things got worse.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, a notification popped up: the transit authority\u2019s professional development seminar. Optional, but everyone knew that those who responded quickly were seen as proactive. I was expected to be alert, focused, and never distracted while operating the train. The rules were clear\u2014no personal devices, no multitasking. My hands hovered, torn. If I waited, I\u2019d miss the chance to show initiative. If I acted now, I\u2019d be breaking protocol and risking passenger safety. My heart pounded as the train sped through the tunnel, caught between the urgent needs of my team and the unyielding standards of my job."}
