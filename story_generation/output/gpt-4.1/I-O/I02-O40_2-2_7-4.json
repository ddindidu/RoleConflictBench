We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014her frustration simmering just beneath every word. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, try to smooth things over, listen to her worries, and show her I cared enough to work through this together. But the sawdust in my hair and the ache in my hands reminded me of the cabinetry project waiting for me at the site. The deadline was tight, and the electrician and plumber were both waiting for my framework before they could finish their parts. If I didn\u2019t get back soon, the whole schedule would slip, and my boss would be on my case. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014Mia needed me to be present and attentive, but my crew needed me to be reliable and focused. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
