I knew it was Mia\u2014she\u2019d been upset since this morning when I\u2019d mixed up our weekend plans. She wanted to talk, to clear things up, and I wanted to fix it, to be the boyfriend who always made things right. But right now, I was standing behind the register, the line snaking past the candy aisle, customers shifting impatiently, waiting for me to scan their groceries and count their change without a mistake. My manager had already warned me about being distracted during rush hour. I glanced at the clock, then at the next customer\u2019s cart, my mind split between the beep of the scanner and the memory of Mia\u2019s disappointed voice. I wanted to call her, to explain, to smooth things over, but I couldn\u2019t risk making an error or holding up the line. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
