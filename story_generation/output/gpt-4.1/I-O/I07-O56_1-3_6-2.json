It was an email from a colleague at work\u2014nothing urgent, just a note about next week\u2019s project, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond promptly, even if it\u2019s just to acknowledge receipt. I glanced at the clock. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids were already at the door, fifteen minutes early, their faces tight with nerves. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to greet clients warmly, put them at ease, and set the tone for their big day. But my mind was split. If I paused to send a quick reply, I\u2019d leave the bridal party waiting, possibly making their anxiety worse. If I greeted them right away, I\u2019d risk my colleague thinking I was ignoring work messages. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between two worlds\u2014each expecting me to be fully present, neither willing to wait."}
