The line of customers had finally dwindled, but my mind was racing. As a cashier, I knew I had to follow every step of the deposit procedure\u2014double-checking totals, logging serial numbers, filling out forms. The store manager had drilled into us how important it was for audits. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the technical hurdle I\u2019d hit on my project for my mentor. She\u2019d told me to reach out immediately if I ran into trouble, and I could already imagine her disappointment if I stayed silent. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I paused the deposit to message her, I\u2019d be breaking store policy. If I waited until after, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations, torn between the rules of my job and the trust of someone guiding my future."}
