My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a long flight. I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second. But as I logged into the video call, my work phone buzzed with a reminder: my break was over in two minutes. If I didn\u2019t return to my telemarketing station, the compliance system would flag me. Too many flags, and I could lose my job. I tried to focus on my mentor\u2019s advice, but my mind kept darting to the ticking clock and the threat of disciplinary action. I wanted to show my mentor respect, to be present and grateful, but the pressure from work was suffocating. I felt torn in two, caught between honoring my mentor\u2019s rare availability and obeying the rigid demands of my job. My hands trembled as I hovered over the \u201cjoin meeting\u201d button, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
