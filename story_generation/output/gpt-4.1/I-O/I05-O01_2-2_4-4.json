As an architect, I was expected to finalize the floor plan for the new office by tomorrow. The client wanted innovative, functional spaces that would boost productivity, and I could already imagine the flow of light and movement through the rooms. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the mentoring session I\u2019d promised my junior colleagues. They were counting on me to guide them through the basics of project management, and I\u2019d spent hours preparing a structured session to help them avoid the mistakes I\u2019d made early in my career. \n\nI glanced between the unfinished plans and my notes for the session. If I focused on the floor plan, I might miss the chance to share knowledge that could shape someone\u2019s future. But if I led the session, I risked delivering a rushed design that didn\u2019t meet the client\u2019s needs. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the demands of my profession, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
