Jamie smiled and waved, clearly expecting a friendly chat. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to stop, exchange pleasantries, and be approachable\u2014after all, that\u2019s what friends, even casual ones, do. But as a lifeguard, my mind was already back at the pool, picturing the swimmers I\u2019d left under the watch of my co-guard. I knew I was supposed to monitor them continuously, especially since a couple of them had a habit of drifting toward the deep end. There was no immediate danger, but I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of responsibility. I felt torn\u2014should I pause and be the friendly face Jamie expected, or rush back to the pool, fulfilling my duty to keep a vigilant eye on the swimmers? The hallway felt longer, my steps slower, as I wrestled with the conflicting demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
