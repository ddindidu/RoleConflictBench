The snow was coming down harder now, swirling in thick sheets across the windshield. He\u2019d just asked me, in a shaky voice, if he should take the new job offer in another country\u2014something about a better salary but leaving his family behind. As a mentor, I felt the familiar tug to offer thoughtful guidance, to help him weigh his options with care. But as a taxi driver, my focus had to be on the road, on keeping us safe and getting him to the airport before his flight left. Every minute I spent thinking about his dilemma was a minute I wasn\u2019t fully focused on the icy streets. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help him make a life-changing decision and the responsibility to navigate the treacherous roads. The pressure from both roles pressed in on me, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter, feeling the weight of his expectations and my own."}
