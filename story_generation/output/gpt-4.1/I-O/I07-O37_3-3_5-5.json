As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finalize the report by noon. The client\u2019s delivery depended on it, and any delay would throw the whole project off track. My phone buzzed with reminders, and I could almost feel my manager\u2019s anxious eyes on the clock. But as I stood up to stretch, I noticed the empty bottle of specialized cleaner in the supply closet. As the housekeeping cleaner, it was my responsibility to keep these supplies stocked, and the next cleaning task absolutely required that product. If I didn\u2019t run out to buy it now, the job would be delayed, and the client would be dissatisfied. My mind raced, torn between the urgent spreadsheet and the empty bottle. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
