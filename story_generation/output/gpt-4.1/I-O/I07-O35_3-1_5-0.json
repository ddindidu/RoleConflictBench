My inbox is full of reminders from my team\u2014our client is waiting, and my part of the project is the last piece before delivery. I promised I\u2019d have it done by noon, and I know everyone is counting on me. But right now, I\u2019m standing in the subway cab, checklist in hand, about to start the pre-departure inspection. The train isn\u2019t leaving for another ten minutes, and the systems I need to check aren\u2019t critical, but the rules are clear: every check, every time, no exceptions. My supervisor has drilled it into us\u2014safety and punctuality come first. I can feel my laptop in my bag, the unfinished report gnawing at my conscience. If I just take a few minutes to send the file, I could keep my promise to my colleagues. But if I get distracted and miss something, even something minor, I\u2019d be letting down my passengers and risking my job. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the urgent needs of my team and the unyielding responsibility of the train."}
