This was the last weekend before Alex left for his new job overseas, and we\u2019d promised to make every moment count. He wanted to go hiking, have brunch at our favorite caf\u00e9, and just be together\u2014no distractions. But as I reached for my phone, I saw a string of urgent emails from work. Our biggest supplier was threatening to stop all shipments unless I resolved a past-due invoice immediately. My manager\u2019s message was clear: I needed to call the supplier and sort things out today, or risk jeopardizing our company\u2019s operations.\n\nAlex was already making coffee, smiling at me, talking about our plans. I tried to focus on him, but my mind kept drifting to spreadsheets and payment deadlines. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my heart aching to be present with Alex, my mind racing with numbers and consequences. I wanted to be the supportive girlfriend he deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility of being the accountant my team relied on. The phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, torn, not knowing which role to choose."}
