My mentee, Sarah, was due in ten minutes for our session\u2014she was anxious about her upcoming interview for a supervisor role, and I\u2019d promised to help her prepare. I wanted to be the mentor she needed, someone who could encourage her to step up, to believe in her own judgment.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the production line: \u201cMachine 4 down again. Operator keeps changing settings. Material waste is piling up.\u201d As the machine repairer, I was expected to not only fix the breakdown but also guide the operator, who never seemed to listen, on proper usage. Management was clear\u2014waste had to be minimized, and it was my job to make sure everyone followed protocol.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I\u2019d let Sarah down at a crucial moment. If I stayed, the waste would keep growing, and I\u2019d be blamed for not addressing the operator\u2019s mistakes. My mind raced, torn between nurturing someone\u2019s growth and fulfilling my duty to the machines and the company. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
