As a construction laborer, I know how dangerous even a little spill can be\u2014one wrong step and someone could get hurt. I grabbed my cleaning supplies, ready to tackle it right away. But then I remembered the HOA inspection scheduled for today. They\u2019re strict about keeping the corridors clear, and I\u2019d already seen the warning about leaving personal items in shared spaces. If I left my mop and bucket out, even for a few minutes, I could get cited for blocking the emergency exit. I stood there, cleaning supplies in hand, heart pounding. My neighborly duty was to keep the corridor clear and tidy, but my worker\u2019s instinct screamed at me to clean up the hazard before someone slipped. I could almost hear the inspector\u2019s footsteps echoing down the hall, and I felt torn between doing what was safe and what was expected."}
