As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to keep to the schedule\u2014patients depended on me for their morning routines, and any delay could throw off the whole day. Just as I reached Mrs. Lee\u2019s door, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Sam, an old acquaintance from college, texting, \u201cHey! I\u2019m in town for a few hours. Can you recommend a good place to eat nearby?\u201d I paused, thumb hovering over the screen. Sam had always been friendly, and I knew he\u2019d expect a quick, thoughtful reply. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, and I could already hear her calling for help with her bath. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014on one hand, the urge to be a helpful friend, on the other, the responsibility to my patient who needed me right now. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between answering Sam and stepping into Mrs. Lee\u2019s room, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
