Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers, or we\u2019ll have to talk about your future here.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, heart pounding, knowing every minute counted.\n\nThen, a calendar notification popped up on my screen: \u201cMentor Office Hours\u2014Drop in anytime this week.\u201d My mentor had been clear\u2014these hours were for me, a chance to ask questions and get guidance, but only if I respected her time and didn\u2019t wait until the last minute. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go today, but now, with the sales target looming, I hesitated. If I left my desk, I\u2019d lose precious calling time. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the chance to connect with my mentor, who\u2019d set aside this time just for me.\n\nMy fingers hovered over the mouse, torn between dialing the next number and logging off to meet my mentor, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
