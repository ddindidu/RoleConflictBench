Mrs. Patel from next door waved, her arms full of recycling. \u201cWould you mind if I put some of my overflow in your bin?\u201d she asked, her voice hopeful. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate\u2014sharing space, helping out, keeping things friendly. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was my project manager, reminding me that the client was waiting for my effort estimates before signing the contract. The team was counting on me to deliver numbers tonight, and I knew I\u2019d need every minute to review the specs and avoid costly mistakes. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: the expectation to be a good neighbor, and the responsibility to my team and client. My mind raced, torn between stepping inside to focus on the project and staying outside to help Mrs. Patel. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
