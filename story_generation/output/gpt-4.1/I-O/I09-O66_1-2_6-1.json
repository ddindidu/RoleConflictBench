I keep missing deliveries, and it\u2019s important.\u201d I nodded, knowing how much she relied on me for these small favors. Just as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. The passenger\u2019s message was urgent: \u201cMy train leaves in 40 minutes. Please hurry!\u201d The station was across town, and traffic would be heavy. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d get the passenger there on time, but I\u2019d miss the delivery for Mrs. Kim. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a customer who was counting on me to get them to their train. My mind raced, torn between being the dependable neighbor and the reliable taxi driver. Both roles expected me to be there, to help, to not let them down. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I weighed the disappointment on both sides."}
