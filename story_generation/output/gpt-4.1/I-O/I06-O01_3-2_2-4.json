As an architect, I was deep into designing a floor plan for the new office, trying to ensure every workspace would be both functional and comfortable. My mind raced with questions\u2014should the break room be closer to the open work area, or would that create too much noise? I knew my team was counting on me to get this right; the entire project hinged on my design.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my mentor. The assignment she\u2019d given me last week, a detailed report on sustainable materials, was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation with upper management. She\u2019d made it clear: this was a test of my commitment and reliability as her mentee. I could almost hear her voice, urging me not to let her down.\n\nMy hands trembled as I glanced between the unfinished floor plan and the blank report document. Both roles demanded my full attention, both with deadlines I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. The pressure built inside me, a knot of anxiety tightening in my chest as I tried to figure out how to be both the diligent mentee and the responsible architect\u2014knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly give my best to both at once."}
