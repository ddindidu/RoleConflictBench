It was a message from a colleague\u2014just an update about next week\u2019s project, nothing urgent, but I knew our team valued quick responses. I glanced at the screen, feeling the familiar tug of obligation. At the same moment, a piercing alarm blared from the control panel: brake system malfunction. My training kicked in\u2014safety first, report immediately, stop the train. But my mind raced. If I didn\u2019t reply to the message soon, I\u2019d seem unresponsive, maybe even careless to my team. Yet, every second I hesitated could put passengers at risk. My hands hovered between the phone and the emergency protocol, heart pounding as I wrestled with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
