My mentor had always emphasized, \u201cIf you hit a roadblock, let me know right away.\u201d But here I was, stuck behind the register, forced smiles and polite chatter masking the anxiety twisting in my stomach. My teammates\u2019 argument this morning had exploded into a full-blown standoff, and our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. I knew I should text my mentor, explain everything, but the next customer was already unloading their basket, and the manager was watching from the end of the aisle. Each beep of the scanner felt like a countdown. I tried to focus on the customer in front of me, but my mind kept drifting to the group chat, the unread messages piling up. I was supposed to be present, friendly, helpful\u2014yet all I wanted was a moment to step away, to reach out for help. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught between the expectations of two worlds, unsure which one I was about to let down."}
