As a colleague, I knew I was supposed to finish the project summary for our team by the end of the day. The deadline wasn\u2019t tight, and honestly, the others could keep working without my part for a bit. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let them down or seem unreliable. But then, as the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019d just received an urgent email from the external auditor. They needed last quarter\u2019s financial statements\u2014immediately. My heart raced. The records were complex, and accuracy was non-negotiable. If I delayed, it could cause problems for the audit and reflect poorly on me professionally. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my shoulders. My team expected me to be dependable, but the auditor\u2019s request was critical and time-sensitive. I stared at my screen, feeling the tension build as I tried to decide which responsibility to tackle first."}
