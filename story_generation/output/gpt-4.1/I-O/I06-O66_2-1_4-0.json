The code still wouldn\u2019t compile, and I knew I should tell her about the technical hurdle. She always said, \u201cLet me know early if you\u2019re stuck.\u201d But right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat humming to a tune, relaxed, heading to a meeting with time to spare. I was expected to drive safely, keep my eyes on the road, and make sure he arrived on time. My mind raced\u2014should I pull over and message my mentor, risking the passenger\u2019s schedule and my rating? Or should I wait, risking my mentor\u2019s trust and the project\u2019s timeline? My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the urge to be a responsible mentee and the duty to be a reliable driver. The city lights blurred past as I wrestled with the weight of both roles, feeling the pressure build with every passing block."}
