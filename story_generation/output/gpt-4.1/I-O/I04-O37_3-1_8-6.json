My offhand joke had clearly stung, and now she was upset, waiting for an explanation. I knew I should call her right away, talk it through, and fix things before the misunderstanding grew. But I was in the middle of my shift at the hotel, scrubbing a bathroom floor, gloves on, bleach in hand. The supervisor had just reminded us\u2014no phones out, gloves on at all times, especially with chemicals. If I took off my gloves to use my phone, I\u2019d be breaking protocol and risking a warning. But if I waited until my break, my friend might think I didn\u2019t care, and the rift could widen. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to reach out and the strict rules of my job. I could almost hear my friend\u2019s voice, hurt and confused, while the supervisor\u2019s footsteps echoed down the hall. I stood frozen, phone buzzing in my pocket, gloves tight on my hands, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
