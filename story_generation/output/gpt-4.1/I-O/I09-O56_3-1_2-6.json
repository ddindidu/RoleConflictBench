She smiled, but I could sense tension\u2014everyone\u2019s been whispering about the late-night noise, and I know she suspects it\u2019s me. I want to be friendly, to smooth things over, but I also feel defensive. I nod politely, trying to keep things light, but my mind is racing with what I should say if she brings up the complaint.\n\nLater, at the salon, Mrs. Kim sits in my chair. She\u2019s booked for a cut, and as always, the expectation is to wash and condition her hair first. But today, she tells me she just washed it at home, and it feels perfectly clean. I hesitate. The salon expects me to follow protocol, but I don\u2019t want to offend her by insisting on another wash, especially after our awkward lobby encounter. I can feel the pressure from both sides\u2014be the accommodating neighbor, the professional hairdresser. My hands hover over the sink, and I wonder which expectation I should meet."}
