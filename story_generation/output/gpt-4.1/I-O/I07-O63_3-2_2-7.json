The team meeting was about to start\u2014our final chance to weigh in before the new project plan was set in stone. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to speak up and show I cared about the direction we were heading. But my break was scheduled for exactly this time, and as a telemarketer, I was under strict orders to log out only during my assigned slot. Management had been clear: any deviation would be flagged, and with the phone queue always full, every minute away from my desk was scrutinized.\n\nMy inbox pinged with a reminder from my team lead: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, your input is crucial today.\u201d At the same time, a supervisor\u2019s message flashed: \u201cBreaks must be taken as scheduled\u2014no exceptions.\u201d My stomach twisted. If I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d let my team down and miss my chance to shape our work. If I missed my break, I\u2019d risk a warning and throw off the call schedule. I hovered over the \u201cJoin Meeting\u201d button, my finger trembling, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
