As a cashier, I knew the deposit procedure was strict\u2014every bill counted, every form double-checked, no shortcuts. The store manager had drilled it into us: mistakes could mean audits, or worse. My hands moved automatically, sorting the cash, but my thoughts kept drifting to the email from my mentor. As a mentee, I was supposed to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. I had stumbled over a term in the training materials earlier, and I knew I should ask for clarification. But the deposit couldn\u2019t wait, and my phone buzzed with a reminder from my mentor, \u201cLet me know if you need anything!\u201d I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I paused to email my mentor, I\u2019d risk rushing the deposit and making a mistake. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting down my mentor\u2019s expectations for open communication. My chest tightened as I stared at the cash and my phone, torn between two roles, each demanding my full attention."}
