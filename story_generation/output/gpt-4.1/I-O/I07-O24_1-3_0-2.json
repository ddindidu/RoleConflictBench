As a colleague, I was expected to join our weekly team meeting, contribute ideas, and show support for my coworkers. The meeting was routine, and I knew it would be recorded, but I also knew my absence would be noticed. At the same time, my phone buzzed with an urgent notification: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk. As a judge, I was expected to drop everything, review the case files with care, and make a ruling within the hour\u2014someone\u2019s safety could depend on my decision.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations. If I skipped the meeting, I risked letting down my team and appearing disengaged. If I delayed the case review, I could fail in my duty to uphold justice swiftly. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each insisting on immediate attention. I stared at my calendar, torn, feeling the stress rise as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
