The code isn\u2019t urgent, not really\u2014my team agreed we could refactor the module later, and the deadline is weeks away. But my mind keeps drifting to the living room, where my girlfriend sits, arms crossed, eyes red from arguing. Our fight spiraled out of control, and now she\u2019s questioning if we should even be together. I know I should go to her, try to resolve things, show her I care more about us than any line of code. But part of me clings to the comfort of my work, the logic and order of it, the sense that here, at least, I can do something right. I feel torn\u2014if I leave the code now, I\u2019ll lose my train of thought, but if I stay, I risk losing her. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the fear that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
