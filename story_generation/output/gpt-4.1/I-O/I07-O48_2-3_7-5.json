They needed my input to clarify a detail before moving forward with our shared project, and I knew they were waiting. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep things moving and not hold anyone back. But at that moment, I was standing at the bedside of Mr. Lee, a patient whose blood pressure had been dropping all morning. As a nursing assistant, my responsibility was clear: I had to monitor his vital signs every few minutes, watching for any sudden changes. My hands shook slightly as I juggled the blood pressure cuff and thermometer, my mind racing with the knowledge that every second counted for him. The pressure from my team\u2019s messages pressed in on me, but so did the urgency of Mr. Lee\u2019s condition. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the expectations of my roles, unsure which demand I could afford to let wait."}
