My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, has already asked if I could receive her package too, since she\u2019s working late and her deliveries often get missed. I agreed, knowing how much she relies on me for these little favors. But just as I\u2019m settling in, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my supervisor at the construction site. He wants me to come in and move a stack of unused materials to a different storage area before the end of the day. It\u2019s not urgent, but he made it clear he\u2019s counting on me to get it done today. I feel the pressure building inside me. If I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the deliveries and let Mrs. Lee down. If I stay, I risk disappointing my supervisor and maybe even jeopardizing my reliability at work. I pace the living room, torn between being a good neighbor and a dependable worker, wishing I could split myself in two."}
