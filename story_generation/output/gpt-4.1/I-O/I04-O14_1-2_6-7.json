My friend\u2019s last message is a jumble of confusion about where we\u2019re supposed to meet tonight. I know if I don\u2019t reply now, she\u2019ll be left waiting, maybe even hurt, thinking I\u2019m ignoring her. But as I type, the sharp scent of ethanol reminds me where I am\u2014the lab, surrounded by beeping monitors and delicate glassware. The safety audit is in less than an hour, and I still haven\u2019t fixed the loose tubing on the centrifuge or checked the emergency shower. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cEverything must be perfect. No exceptions.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My friend expects honesty and clarity, a quick message to clear things up. My role as a scientist demands my full attention, precision, and responsibility for everyone\u2019s safety. My thumb hovers over the send button, but my eyes dart to the checklist on the lab bench. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure to choose is almost unbearable."}
