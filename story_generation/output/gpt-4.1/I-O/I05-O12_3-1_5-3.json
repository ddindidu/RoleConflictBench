As a mentor, I knew how crucial it was to guide Priya through the deployment process\u2014one misstep, and the client\u2019s data could be at risk. She relied on me to walk her through every detail, and I could almost hear her anxious questions already. But as a software developer, I was expected to show up for the cross-team brainstorming. Product had called it \u201coptional,\u201d but I knew that missing it meant losing my voice in shaping the next release. My team lead had nudged me twice about the importance of developer input. I felt the pressure mounting, my mind tugged in two directions: the responsibility to share my experience and protect the project through mentoring, and the need to collaborate and influence the product\u2019s future. My stomach tightened as I weighed the consequences of letting someone down, no matter which path I chose."}
