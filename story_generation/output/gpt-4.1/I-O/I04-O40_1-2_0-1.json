I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Jamie: \u201cHad the worst day. Everything feels pointless.\u201d I knew what that meant\u2014Jamie needed me to listen, to be there, to offer the kind of support only a close friend could give. But as I reached for my phone, I noticed a pile of wood scraps dangerously close to the edge of the workbench. I remembered the foreman\u2019s warning just this morning: \u201cKeep your area clean, or someone\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d My hands itched to text Jamie back, to let them know I cared, but I could almost hear the clatter of falling boards and the sharp reprimand if I let my guard down. I stood there, phone in one hand, broom in the other, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the responsible carpenter I was expected to be. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
