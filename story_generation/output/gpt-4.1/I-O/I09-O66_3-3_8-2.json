She was already on her trip, and she\u2019d asked me to keep an eye out for any packages, especially with the planned power outage in our building. She trusted me, and I\u2019d promised to help. But now, as I sat behind the wheel of my taxi, the city was blanketed in snow, and traffic crawled. My passenger, a nervous man clutching his passport, kept checking the time. He had to catch an international flight, and every minute counted. I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014he needed me to get him to the airport safely and quickly, despite the storm. My mind raced: if I took a detour to check on Mrs. Kim\u2019s apartment, I\u2019d risk making my passenger late. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d break my promise to my neighbor, who was counting on me during the outage. The storm outside seemed to mirror the turmoil inside me, as I wrestled with the demands of being both a good neighbor and a responsible taxi driver."}
