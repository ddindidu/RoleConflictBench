Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, lives alone just down the hall. I know she gets anxious during storms, and last time, she asked if I could check in if the power went out. I promised I would. But as I hang up my coat, my work phone buzzes\u2014urgent: thunderstorm cells are forcing multiple flights to reroute, and I\u2019m needed on shift early. The radar is a mess, and every controller is scrambling to coordinate handoffs and keep the airspace safe. My supervisor\u2019s message is clear: tonight, every second counts. I glance at Mrs. Kim\u2019s door, remembering her frail voice, then at my headset, already lighting up with alerts. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my duty to the skies, and my promise to a neighbor who might need me most tonight. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I feel I can give."}
