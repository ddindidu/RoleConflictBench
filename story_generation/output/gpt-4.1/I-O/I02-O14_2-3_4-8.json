The screen lights up with a message from my lab: \u201cWarning\u2014possible hazardous leak detected. Immediate attention required.\u201d My girlfriend sits across from me at our favorite little restaurant, her eyes bright, her hand reaching for mine. We\u2019ve been looking forward to this night all week\u2014our only evening together before I leave for a conference. She\u2019s been patient with my long hours, and I promised her tonight would be just us, no distractions.\n\nBut the lab\u2019s alert gnaws at me. If I ignore it, the equipment could fail, risking not just research but safety. My team depends on me to keep things running smoothly, to be vigilant. Yet here, in this moment, she depends on me too\u2014to be present, to show her she matters more than my work. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my phone heavy in my pocket, her fingers warm in my hand. My mind races, torn between duty and love, as I try to steady my breath and decide what to do next."}
