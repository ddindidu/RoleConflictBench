I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of these rare windows\u2014my mentor was busy, and I knew how much it mattered to show up, prepared and on time. But as I steered the subway through the next station, a call crackled through my radio: an unattended bag had been spotted in car three. My heart thudded. Protocol demanded I act immediately\u2014passenger safety was non-negotiable. I pictured the faces in the car, the trust they placed in me every day. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my mentor, waiting, perhaps already disappointed. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in.
