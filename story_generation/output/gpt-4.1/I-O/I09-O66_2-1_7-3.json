My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, lives alone just down the hall. She\u2019s always been kind, and I know she relies on me for little things\u2014picking up her mail, checking in when the weather turns bad. I could already imagine her anxious face, probably hoping I\u2019d stop by before the storm hit.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a ride request. As a taxi driver, I can\u2019t afford to turn down fares, especially on quiet nights like this. The roads are clear, and I\u2019m expected to be out there, driving safely, following every rule, and making sure my passengers get home without a hitch. My boss is strict about punctuality and defensive driving, and I need the money.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between knocking on Mrs. Kim\u2019s door to check on her or heading straight to my car. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
