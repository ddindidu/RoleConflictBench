He greeted me with his usual warm smile, and I returned it, exchanging a quick hello as we passed in the corridor. Just as I reached the stairwell, I heard a loud crash from Mr. Lee\u2019s apartment. My instincts as a police officer kicked in\u2014protecting citizens and property was my duty, even off the clock. But as a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, not intrusive, and I worried about overstepping boundaries or making Mr. Lee uncomfortable. My mind raced with questions: Was it just an accident, or something more serious? Should I intervene as an officer, or respect his privacy as a neighbor?
