I have to run out for an appointment,\u201d she asked. As her neighbor, I\u2019ve always tried to help\u2014last winter, I shoveled her walkway, and she\u2019s watered my plants when I was away. I nodded, knowing how much she relies on me for these little things.\n\nBut as a housekeeping cleaner, my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions\u2014gloves, mask, sanitize after every contact.\u201d The package would arrive soon, and I\u2019d be in the middle of cleaning, hands gloved and covered in disinfectant. If I took off my gloves to sign for the package, I\u2019d break protocol. If I kept them on, I\u2019d risk contaminating the box. I could almost feel the tension knotting in my stomach\u2014Mrs. Kim\u2019s trust on one side, my job\u2019s strict rules on the other. I stood by the window, watching for the delivery truck, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible cleaner, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
