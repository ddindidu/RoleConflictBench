I had a question about a term in the training manual\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew I was supposed to communicate any confusion right away. My mentor always emphasized that no concern was too small, and I wanted to show I was engaged and proactive. But as I started typing, the radio crackled, and my heart jumped. I was on standby, ready to respond to any emergency at a moment\u2019s notice. Every second counted in this job, and I couldn\u2019t risk being distracted or delayed if a call came in. I felt torn\u2014should I send the message now, fulfilling my responsibility as a good mentee, or wait, staying laser-focused on my duty as an ambulance driver? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, phone in hand, caught between the expectations of two worlds."}
