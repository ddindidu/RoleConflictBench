My mentor had finally carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me\u2014a rare window in her packed schedule. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time, not after all she\u2019d invested in me. I was already rehearsing my questions as I sat in the ambulance, waiting for the clock to tick closer to our meeting.\n\nThen the radio crackled. Dispatch: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall, possible fracture, elderly female, severe pain.\u201d My partner looked at me, already reaching for the keys. I felt the weight of my uniform, the responsibility to be there for someone in pain, to offer calm and care when they needed it most. But my mind kept drifting to my mentor, waiting for me, expecting me to show up, prepared and respectful of her time.\n\nI stared at my phone, then at the flashing lights above me. My hands trembled as I tried to balance the duty to my patient with the commitment I\u2019d made to my mentor. Both needed me, right now, and I could feel the pressure building, pulling me in two directions at once."}
