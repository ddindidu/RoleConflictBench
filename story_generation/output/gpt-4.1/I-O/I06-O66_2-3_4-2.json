The winter storm had turned the city into a maze of crawling cars and flashing hazard lights. My passenger kept checking his watch, his voice tight as he reminded me his flight was international\u2014he couldn\u2019t afford to miss it. I wanted to reassure him, to push the cab a little faster, but the roads were treacherous. Every turn felt like a gamble.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. I\u2019d hit a technical wall days ago, but I hadn\u2019t told her yet. She expected me to communicate challenges right away, to be proactive and honest. But how could I explain my delay when I was stuck behind the wheel, responsible for someone else\u2019s urgent timeline? The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust, my passenger\u2019s hope. I felt torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
