The end-of-shift pressure always made my hands sweat\u2014one mistake, and I\u2019d be stuck here for hours, explaining the shortfall. Just as I was double-checking the totals, I saw Mrs. Patel from down the hall walk into the store. She was the neighbor everyone liked, but today her smile was tight. I remembered the noise complaint that had been circulating on our floor, and the building manager had asked us to be extra courteous in the lobby, to keep things neighborly. Now, here she was, right in front of me, ready to check out. I knew she\u2019d want to talk, maybe clear the air, maybe just be friendly. But I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus on the register, not with so much money at stake. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectation to be a good neighbor\u2014warm, attentive, polite\u2014with the demand to be a precise, efficient cashier. I could feel both roles pulling at me, and I didn\u2019t know which one to answer first."}
