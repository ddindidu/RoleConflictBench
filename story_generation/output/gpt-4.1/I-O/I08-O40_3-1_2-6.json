Turning around, I saw Lisa from down the street, her eyes red and cheeks streaked with tears. She clutched a small, broken wooden train in her hands. As her acquaintance, I felt the urge to comfort her, to ask what was wrong and offer a listening ear. But as a carpenter, I knew she was here for a reason\u2014she needed a repair quote, and I was expected to be professional, focused, and efficient.\n\nLisa tried to explain through her sobs, her voice trembling as she described how the toy had broken. I wanted to step out from behind the counter, offer her a cup of tea, and reassure her that everything would be okay. But I also felt the pressure to assess the damage, calculate the cost, and give her a straightforward answer. My mind raced, torn between being the supportive friend she needed and the reliable craftsman she expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which part of myself to show her first."}
