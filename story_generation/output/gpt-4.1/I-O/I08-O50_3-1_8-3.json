They didn\u2019t notice me, focused as they were on the latest rumor about our supervisor. I tried to tune them out, but then I caught a detail\u2014something I\u2019d learned myself just yesterday, purely by accident, about the supervisor\u2019s health. It was private, and I knew it could easily be twisted into something ugly. As an acquaintance, I\u2019ve always believed in keeping people\u2019s secrets safe, never fueling gossip. But now, as the machine repairer, I\u2019m expected to work closely with these same coworkers during next week\u2019s shutdown. We\u2019ll be side by side for hours, and I know how these maintenance sessions go\u2014idle hands, idle talk. They\u2019ll expect me to join in, maybe even share what I know. My mind races with the pressure: do I protect someone\u2019s dignity, or do I risk alienating the team I need to work with? The hum of the machines is suddenly drowned out by the noise in my own head, torn between loyalty and belonging."}
