The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to join in, share updates, and show support. Even though it was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the production floor\u2014one of the operators was again adjusting the machine settings without proper guidance, and the material waste was piling up. As the machine repairer, I was supposed to step in, provide clear instructions, and prevent further loss. My mind raced, torn between the camaraderie of my team and the urgent responsibility to the client. I could almost hear the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I skipped the meeting, but I also pictured the frustration of the operator and the mounting costs if I didn\u2019t act fast. My heart pounded as I hovered between the meeting link and the door to the shop floor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
