The spreadsheet for the client delivery blinked at me, a reminder of the deadline looming in just a few hours. My phone buzzed with messages from my team\u2014\u201cIs the report ready?\u201d \u201cWe need your numbers to finish.\u201d I knew the whole project hinged on my part, and the client was already anxious. But as I glanced up, the beach was a sea of color and movement. High tide had brought in more swimmers than usual, and the waves were rougher, unpredictable. Every few seconds, I scanned the water, heart pounding, knowing that even a brief distraction could mean missing someone in trouble. My mind raced between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the silent, ever-present responsibility to keep these strangers safe. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the expectation to deliver for my team and the duty to watch every swimmer. My hands hovered over the keyboard, but my eyes kept darting back to the surf, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds."}
