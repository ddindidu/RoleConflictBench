My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles white, as I navigated the ambulance through the storm. The patient in the back was barely conscious, the paramedic\u2019s voice tense as she called out vitals. My phone buzzed in the cupholder. Glancing down, I saw it was a message from Jamie: \u201cRough day. Just need someone to talk to.\u201d I knew what he wanted\u2014someone to listen, to care, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what friends do. But right now, every ounce of my focus had to be on the road, on the lives depending on me to get us safely to the hospital. The urge to grab the phone, to send a quick reply, gnawed at me. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s voice, tired and hopeful. But the siren wailed, the rain hammered, and the world outside blurred into streaks of red and blue. My heart twisted, caught between the friend who needed me and the patient whose life was in my hands."}
