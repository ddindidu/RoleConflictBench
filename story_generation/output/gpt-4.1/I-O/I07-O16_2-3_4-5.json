As a colleague, I knew my part of the project was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish on time, the next person couldn\u2019t start, and the whole team would be set back. My phone buzzed. It was the nurse: the family of Mr. Lee was waiting, anxious and desperate for answers. As his doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, and the time to explain his diagnosis with care. I could picture their faces, the hope and fear mingling in their eyes. But my inbox pinged again\u2014my teammate asking if I\u2019d be done soon. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the urgent needs of my team and the emotional needs of my patient\u2019s family. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, heart heavy with the weight of both responsibilities."}
