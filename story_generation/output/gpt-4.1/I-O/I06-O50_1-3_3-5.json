My heart jumped. If I didn\u2019t get to it now, the whole line could grind to a halt, and I\u2019d be the one responsible. I grabbed my toolkit, but as I hurried down the aisle, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to reach out if you have any questions.\u201d I did have a question, a small one about the difference between two technical terms in the manual. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d promised to communicate every challenge, no matter how minor. I could picture my mentor\u2019s disappointed face if I let it slide, but the shriek of the bearing was growing louder, echoing through the workshop. My hands tightened around the wrench. Should I stop and send a quick message, or rush to the machine before it failed? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between being the diligent mentee and the responsible repairer."}
