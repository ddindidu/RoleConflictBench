The radio crackled with the dispatcher\u2019s urgent voice: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, possible fatalities, every second counting. My heart pounded as I flicked on the siren, but the phone kept vibrating\u2014messages from my team at work. They needed my input to clarify a key point before moving forward with our project. I knew they were waiting, probably staring at their screens, expecting a quick reply. I could almost hear the frustration in their silence, the pressure to keep the workflow moving. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to focus solely on the road, to get to the scene as fast and safely as possible. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my colleagues and the lives that might depend on my speed and attention. The phone buzzed again, and I gripped the wheel tighter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
