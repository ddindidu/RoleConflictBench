I glanced at it between radio calls. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. I thought you understood me.\u201d My heart dropped. I reread my earlier text\u2014meant as a joke, but I could see how it sounded harsh. Jamie needed to hear my voice, to know I cared, to clear this up before it festered. I reached for my phone, thumb hovering over the call button.\n\nBut the radar screen blinked urgently. \u201cTower, this is Delta 214, requesting climb instructions. Cloud tops are building fast.\u201d Three other pilots echoed similar requests. My headset crackled with their voices, each one depending on me to keep them safe, to give clear, immediate directions. My job demanded my full attention, no distractions, not even for a minute.\n\nI stared at my phone, Jamie\u2019s hurt message glowing on the screen, while the radio filled with pilots\u2019 anxious voices. My chest tightened. My friend needed me now, but so did the pilots in the sky. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and I had to choose which voice to answer first."}
