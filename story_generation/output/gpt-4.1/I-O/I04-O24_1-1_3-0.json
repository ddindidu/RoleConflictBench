It was Sam, my oldest friend, his message popping up: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in these furniture instructions.\u201d I glanced at the thick stack of papers on my desk. The hearing wasn\u2019t for another two weeks, but I knew the expectation\u2014judges are supposed to be meticulous, to review every detail well in advance. Still, Sam rarely asked for help, and I remembered all the times he\u2019d been there for me in a pinch. My mind raced: if I paused now, I\u2019d lose my focus and risk missing something important in the file. But if I ignored Sam, I\u2019d be letting down a friend who needed me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with its own consequences. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
