My break was scheduled in ten minutes, but the phone queue was relentless, and management had sent another reminder about sticking to our allotted times. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Kim next door: \u201cCould you please receive my package this afternoon? I\u2019ll be at work and it\u2019s important.\u201d I looked out the window and saw the delivery van already pulling up. I knew how much she relied on me for these little favors\u2014last month, I\u2019d saved her birthday gift from being sent back. But if I stepped away from my desk now, I\u2019d be off my scheduled break, and my supervisor would definitely notice. My neighbor counted on me, but so did my team. My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of disappointing Mrs. Kim against the certainty of a reprimand at work. The doorbell rang, and I froze, torn between two worlds that both expected me to be there, right now."}
