As an acquaintance, I felt a gentle responsibility to make her feel welcome, to be warm and approachable. I walked over, introduced myself, and saw her shoulders relax a little. We chatted about the weather, the music, and I could sense her opening up, grateful for the company.\n\nBut as we talked, my mind kept drifting to my other role\u2014telemarketer.
