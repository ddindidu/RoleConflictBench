I glance at the clock. The team is waiting, and I know they can\u2019t move forward until I respond. As a colleague, I\u2019m expected to be responsive, to keep the workflow smooth. But my IDE is open, and I\u2019m deep in the final stretch of coding a new feature. The code review just came back with performance warnings, and I can see exactly where the bottleneck is. If I don\u2019t fix it now, the codebase will get messy, and I\u2019ll be letting down my responsibility as a developer to deliver clean, efficient work. My inbox pings again. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I stop to answer, I\u2019ll lose my train of thought and risk introducing bugs. If I ignore the messages, I\u2019m holding up the team. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the urge to dive back into the code and the guilt of leaving my colleagues waiting."}
