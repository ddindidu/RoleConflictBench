It was Jamie, an old classmate who\u2019d recently moved to town. \u201cHey! Any good restaurant recommendations nearby?\u201d the message read. I knew Jamie didn\u2019t know many people here yet, and I felt a tug of responsibility to help, to be friendly and welcoming. But as I started typing a reply, the headset crackled in my ear. \u201cCenter, this is Delta 452, request current altimeter setting.\u201d My eyes darted to the radar screen. I was on shift, and every second counted. The pilots depended on me for precise, immediate information. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending Jamie a thoughtful reply and keying in the altimeter setting for Delta 452. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014on one side, the simple but important expectation to be a helpful acquaintance; on the other, the critical, time-sensitive demands of my job. My heart thudded as I hesitated, caught between two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either down."}
