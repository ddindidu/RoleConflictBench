The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and I was supposed to be there\u2014virtually, at least. My manager had stressed how today\u2019s updates were crucial, and missing them meant being out of the loop for the rest of the project. I could already imagine the disappointed looks from my colleagues, the subtle shift in trust if I didn\u2019t show up or contribute.\n\nBut as I settled into the operator\u2019s seat, the cabin door slid open. The transit authority supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cUnannounced audit,\u201d he said, voice clipped. My training kicked in: focus, precision, no distractions. Every action, every announcement, every stop had to be flawless. There was no room for error, no time to glance at my phone or sneak in a comment on the meeting chat.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my team expecting my presence and input, the supervisor expecting unwavering professionalism. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my colleagues and the immediate scrutiny of my job. I gripped the controls, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
