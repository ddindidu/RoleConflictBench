As a colleague, I knew how important it was to be present\u2014today\u2019s agenda included key project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. My teammates counted on my input, and missing the meeting would mean letting them down. Just as I was about to join, an urgent email from the tax authority landed in my inbox. As the company\u2019s accountant, I was responsible for ensuring compliance, and the notice flagged a discrepancy that demanded an immediate response. Ignoring it, even for an hour, could mean penalties or a deeper audit. My heart pounded as I weighed my options. If I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d be seen as unreliable by my peers. If I delayed the tax response, I\u2019d risk the company\u2019s financial standing. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own non-negotiable demands, and I sat frozen at my desk, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and my duty as an accountant."}
