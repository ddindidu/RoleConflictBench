My mentor, who rarely had a free moment, had just squeezed in a thirty-minute meeting for me this afternoon. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But at the same hour, a seminar on upcoming tax law changes was being held\u2014one that could impact my work as an accountant for years to come. My manager had emphasized the importance of staying ahead of regulatory shifts, and I felt the weight of responsibility to keep our firm compliant. I could almost hear both voices in my head: my mentor\u2019s gentle encouragement to seize every learning moment with her, and my manager\u2019s stern reminder that missing the seminar could mean missing crucial updates. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how to honor both commitments, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
