As an architect, I knew every detail mattered\u2014especially when it came to safety and compliance. I\u2019d already spotted a few minor inconsistencies in the plans, nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to make me uneasy. I was about to call the contractor when my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was my friend, panicked and breathless. She was on her way to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it to me? I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise,\u201d she pleaded.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the airport in time, but I\u2019d have to postpone my call to the contractor. The plans needed my attention, but my friend needed me too. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to ensure the building\u2019s safety and the urge to help someone I cared about in a moment of crisis. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between duty and loyalty, unable to ignore either call."}
