My mentor\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cFinish the code sample before our next meeting.\u201d I had three days, but my shifts as a cashier left me little time. As I rang up a customer, another approached, holding a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said. I knew the store\u2019s policy\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce it strictly, but the customer\u2019s pleading eyes made me hesitate.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder to review the code sample. I felt the weight of my mentor\u2019s trust and the pressure to prove myself. But here, in this moment, I was the cashier, expected to uphold the rules. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my mentor and my job. I could feel the stress building, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
