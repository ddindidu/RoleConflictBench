She had more questions, and I knew she valued these conversations\u2014she always left reassured when I took the time to listen. But my mind kept drifting to the storm advisory flashing on my phone. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, lived alone just down the hall. She\u2019d mentioned her anxiety about storms last week, and I\u2019d promised to check in if anything severe happened. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: my patient expected my full attention and empathy, while Mrs. Lee might be waiting for a knock on her door, hoping someone would remember her. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the duty to my patient in front of me and the quiet responsibility I felt toward my neighbor next door."}
