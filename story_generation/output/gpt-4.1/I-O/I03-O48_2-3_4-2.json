Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the only evening we have together before I leave for a week-long training, and he\u2019s been looking forward to it for days. I promised him I\u2019d be there, no distractions, just the two of us. As I finish my shift at the nursing home, I hear Mrs. Carter\u2019s weak voice calling for help. She\u2019s in pain again, barely able to lift her spoon. The other aides are busy, and I know she needs someone to sit with her, help her eat, and maybe just hold her hand for a while. My heart aches\u2014she depends on me, and I can\u2019t bear the thought of her suffering alone. But I also see my boyfriend\u2019s hopeful face in my mind, remembering how much this night means to him, to us. I stand in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need is greater or how to choose between them."}
