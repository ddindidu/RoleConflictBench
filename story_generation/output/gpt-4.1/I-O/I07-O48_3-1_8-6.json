Her eyes sparkled, but I could sense the loneliness behind her smile. As a nursing assistant, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014just being present, listening, offering comfort. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a sharp reminder of my other role. I glanced at the screen: an urgent message from leadership, asking me to confirm details for an external partner. They expected a prompt reply, and I knew the team was waiting on me. My mind raced. If I responded now, I\u2019d break the connection with Mrs. Lee, making her feel even more isolated. But if I waited, I\u2019d let my colleagues down and risk delaying an important project. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust and the professional responsibility tugging at me from my inbox. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, caught in the middle of two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
