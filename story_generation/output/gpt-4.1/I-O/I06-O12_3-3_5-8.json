My inbox was flooded with urgent messages from QA and users\u2014our main service was down, and the root cause was a bug in my code. As a developer, I knew I had to drop everything and fix it immediately. But just as I was about to dive in, my phone buzzed with another message from my project team. The conflict with my teammates had escalated, and now our deliverable was at risk. As a mentee, I was supposed to keep my mentor in the loop about any major issues, but I hadn\u2019t told her about the team conflict yet. I could almost hear her voice reminding me to communicate early and often. My mind raced: if I focused on the outage, I\u2019d be letting my team down and hiding a problem from my mentor. If I reached out to my mentor now, I\u2019d be delaying the urgent fix and leaving customers stranded. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two roles, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt the pressure mounting with every passing second."}
