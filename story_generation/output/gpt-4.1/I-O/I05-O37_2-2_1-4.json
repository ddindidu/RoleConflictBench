She\u2019d been struggling with the new software, and I promised her I\u2019d walk her through the next steps today. I wanted to be the mentor she needed\u2014reliable, present, and encouraging. But as I finished wiping down the kitchen counters in my client\u2019s house, I noticed the floor cleaner bottle was nearly empty. My client expected me to keep track of supplies, and she\u2019d be upset if I didn\u2019t let her know in time for the next cleaning. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I call her now, risking being late for my mentee, or wait and possibly forget, letting my client down? Both roles demanded my attention, both expected me to be responsible and proactive. My heart pounded as I stared at the nearly empty bottle, torn between the two worlds I was supposed to manage seamlessly."}
