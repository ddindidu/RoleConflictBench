I read it and my heart sinks\u2014he\u2019s clearly upset, thinking I was annoyed with him in my last text. I know I should call him right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding festers. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, fix things before they get worse. But as I reach for my phone, my eyes catch the spreadsheet on my laptop. The numbers blur together, but the deadline for closing the books is tomorrow morning. My manager has already reminded me twice today how crucial it is to get everything perfect this month. I can\u2019t afford mistakes, not with the audit coming up. My chest tightens as I stare at the phone, then the laptop, then back again. Sam needs me, but so does my job. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the friend who\u2019s always there and the accountant who never lets the team down."}
