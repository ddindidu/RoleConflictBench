It was Jamie, my best friend, and her voice trembled as she asked, \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that meant she was barely holding it together. As her friend, I wanted nothing more than to listen, to be the shoulder she needed, to reassure her that everything would be okay. But the beach was packed, the tide was high, and every instinct as a lifeguard screamed at me to keep my focus on the water. One distracted moment could mean missing a struggling swimmer, a child swept too far, a life in danger. My heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two\u2014one half aching to comfort Jamie, the other tethered to the responsibility of every life in the surf. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the friend Jamie needed and the lifeguard everyone else depended on."}
