My mentor had squeezed in our session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious this hour was. I wanted to show respect, to be fully present, to ask thoughtful questions and listen carefully. But as I sat in the quiet conference room, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my scheduled break as a telemarketer was about to start. Normally, with the call volume so light, supervisors let us take breaks flexibly, but I\u2019d already shifted mine twice today. If I missed it now, I\u2019d be out of sync with the team, and I worried about setting a bad example.\n\nI tried to focus on my mentor\u2019s advice, but my mind kept drifting. Was I being disrespectful by not taking my break as scheduled? Or would it be worse to cut the session short, knowing how hard my mentor had worked to fit me in? My hands fidgeted under the table, torn between the urge to honor my mentor\u2019s time and the responsibility to follow my workplace\u2019s expectations. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
