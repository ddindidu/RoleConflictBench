My colleague, Priya, was waiting for my numbers to finalize her report, and I knew any delay on my part would throw off the whole team\u2019s schedule. The pressure was mounting; everyone was counting on me to deliver, and I could feel the weight of their expectations.\n\nJust then, my police radio crackled to life. \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and 5th. Immediate response required.\u201d My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was sworn to protect the public, and this was exactly the kind of emergency where every second counted. Lives could be at stake.\n\nI stared at my half-finished work, then at my badge on the desk. If I left now, I\u2019d let my team down and disrupt the workflow. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring my duty to respond to a dangerous crime. The conflicting demands pulled at me, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
