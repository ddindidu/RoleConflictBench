As a judge, I knew how crucial it was to review every argument, every citation, with unwavering focus. The parties had worked for months, and my decision would shape their futures. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from a colleague in the office. \u201cJust FYI, no action needed right now,\u201d it read. Still, as a colleague, I was expected to respond promptly, to show I was engaged and supportive, even if just with a quick acknowledgment. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the case files and the silent pressure of my inbox. If I paused to reply, I\u2019d break my concentration, risk missing a nuance in the briefs. But if I ignored the message, I\u2019d seem distant, uncooperative. My mind tugged in two directions, each role demanding something different, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of justice and camaraderie."}
