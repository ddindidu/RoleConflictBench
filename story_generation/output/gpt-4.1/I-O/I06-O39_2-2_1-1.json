The carpenter waved, impatience clear in his stance\u2014he needed the next load now, and I was already behind. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to finish the code sample before our meeting.\u201d I pictured the half-written lines of code waiting for me at home, the logic bug I still hadn\u2019t solved. My mentor expected me to be prepared, to show progress and initiative. But here, on the site, the foreman and the crew needed me to keep pace, to keep the workflow moving. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my mind racing with algorithms while my body strained under the weight of lumber. Each role demanded my full attention, and I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
