It was Sam, my closest friend, sobbing so hard I could barely make out the words. \u201cIt\u2019s Dad\u2026 he\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My heart clenched. I wanted nothing more than to listen, to be the friend Sam needed\u2014someone to hold space for his pain, to offer comfort in the darkness.\n\nBut just as I opened my mouth to speak, my radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 12, we have a Code Red. Possible major heart attack, Maple and 5th. Immediate response required.\u201d My training kicked in, adrenaline surging. Someone\u2019s life depended on me getting there fast, providing care only I could give in those first critical minutes.\n\nSam\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, desperate for support.

My hands shook as I stared at the phone, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
