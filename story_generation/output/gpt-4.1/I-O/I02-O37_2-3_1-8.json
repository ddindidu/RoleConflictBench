It was a message from Mia: \u201cCan you call? Had a rough day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my supervisor\u2019s next inspection. I knew the rules: no phone use, gloves on at all times, and never touch your face or personal items while cleaning. But Mia\u2019s words tugged at me. She\u2019d been waiting for feedback on her project all week, and now she was crushed. I could picture her sitting at her desk, eyes red, needing me to listen, to reassure her. But if I broke protocol, even for a minute, I risked a warning or worse. My hands hovered over the sink, torn between peeling off my gloves to call her and sticking to the rules. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between being the boyfriend she needed and the employee I was supposed to be."}
