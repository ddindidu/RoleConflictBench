I knew the equipment needed attention\u2014last week\u2019s flagged issues still weren\u2019t resolved, and the audit was only hours away. My heart thudded with anxiety, replaying the checklist in my head, when I nearly collided with Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, in the corridor. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly hello and a few polite words. I could see she wanted to chat, maybe about her new cat or the weather. But every second I spent here was a second lost from prepping the lab, checking the autoclave, and double-checking the chemical storage. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014on one side, the expectation to be a good neighbor, friendly and present; on the other, the responsibility to ensure the lab\u2019s safety and my own professional integrity. My mouth went dry as I stood there, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
