My girlfriend sits on the couch, her shoulders tense, eyes fixed on the TV but not really watching. I know that look\u2014she\u2019s had a rough day. I want to sit beside her, listen, and offer comfort, like a good boyfriend should. But my phone vibrates again: another prospect, another chance to hit my quota. I remember the last call, the customer\u2019s barrage of technical questions that left me fumbling, the script useless in my hands. My manager expects me to handle every objection, to sound confident and knowledgeable, even when I\u2019m not. I glance at my girlfriend, then at my phone. She needs me to be present, to care. My job needs me to be sharp, responsive, and available. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, the fear of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
