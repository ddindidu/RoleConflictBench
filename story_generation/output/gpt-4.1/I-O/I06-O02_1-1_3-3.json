Today, while reviewing some documentation, I stumbled over a term I wasn\u2019t familiar with. It\u2019s not stopping my progress, but I know my mentor expects me to communicate even minor uncertainties. At the same time, as an engineer, I\u2019m responsible for making sure all our documentation is up to date for the upcoming safety audit. The audit isn\u2019t for weeks, so there\u2019s no immediate rush, but I feel the weight of that responsibility pressing on me. If I pause now to email my mentor about this small terminology question, I\u2019ll lose my focus and slow down the documentation updates. But if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not meeting the expectations set for me as a mentee. I sit at my desk, cursor blinking, torn between sending a quick message and pushing forward with my engineering tasks, feeling the tension between being a diligent learner and a responsible professional."}
