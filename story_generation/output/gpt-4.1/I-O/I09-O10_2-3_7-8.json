Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, and I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I check in, maybe offer to bring her some candles or just reassure her? But my phone buzzed again, this time with an urgent email from our major supplier. They threatened to halt all shipments unless I resolved a past-due invoice by tonight. My boss expected immediate action, and I knew the company\u2019s operations depended on my response. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, torn between the neighborly duty to look after Mrs. Kim and the professional obligation to save my company from a supply crisis. Both roles demanded my attention, both felt urgent, and I could feel the stress mounting as I weighed who needed me more in this moment."}
