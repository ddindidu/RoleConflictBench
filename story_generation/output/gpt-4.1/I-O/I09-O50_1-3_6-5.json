I have to be out, and it\u2019s important.\u201d I nodded, knowing she often missed deliveries and counted on me. I promised to keep an ear out. Just as she left, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from work: the main conveyor\u2019s bearing was screeching, and if I didn\u2019t get there soon, the whole line could grind to a halt. My supervisor\u2019s text was clear\u2014this was a top priority, and I was the only one who knew the machine inside out.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I left for the plant, I\u2019d risk missing the delivery and letting Mrs. Lee down. But if I stayed, the machine could fail, costing hours of downtime and putting my reliability at work in question. My mind raced, torn between being the dependable neighbor and the responsible repairer, both expecting me to be present, both needing me at the same time. My heart pounded as I weighed the consequences, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between two worlds."}
