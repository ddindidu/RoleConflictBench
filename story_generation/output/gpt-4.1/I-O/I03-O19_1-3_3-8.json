I\u2019m free any evening!\u201d My heart fluttered. We\u2019d both been so busy, and finally, we had a stretch of evenings to ourselves. I wanted to pick the perfect night, to make it special, to show him how much I cared. But as I opened my calendar, my stomach tightened. The national continuing education program for pharmacists was running all week, with live webinars every evening\u2014sessions I needed to attend to keep my license and stay sharp for my patients. My manager had stressed how important it was to keep up, and I knew missing them would mean falling behind. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: Alex\u2019s hopeful anticipation, the professional responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. I wanted to be the girlfriend who made time, who was present and loving. I also needed to be the pharmacist who never let her knowledge slip. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of a dinner date and the cold necessity of professional growth, unsure which part of me should come first."}
