We need to talk now.\u201d My heart pounded, knowing our argument had spiraled out of control. She expected me to fix this, to show her I cared enough to fight for us, to drop everything and be there. But just as I was about to call her, my radio crackled\u2014dispatch needed me. A woman had fallen, broken her arm, and was in pain, waiting for help only I could give. My hands shook as I grabbed my keys. I was supposed to be the calm, steady boyfriend who could resolve our mess, but I was also the ambulance driver, the one who couldn\u2019t let someone down in their moment of need. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding I choose them first. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn, the siren silent for now, my phone buzzing again."}
