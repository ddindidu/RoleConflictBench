My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a long flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I was determined not to waste a single minute, to show her the respect she deserved. But as I pulled up to the curb, a passenger from my last ride stepped out, leaving behind a spilled coffee cup and a sticky mess on the back seat. My next fare was already waiting, peering impatiently at the cab from the sidewalk. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my mentor was expecting me online in ten minutes, but my next passenger expected a clean, professional ride. My mind raced, torn between dashing upstairs to log into the session and staying to scrub the seat, knowing either choice would mean letting someone down. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, caught between two worlds, both asking for my best."}
