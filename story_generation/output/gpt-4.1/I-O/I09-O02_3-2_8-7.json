She was already at the airport, asking if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries this week, especially with the planned power outage in our building. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014checking in during storms, watering plants, and now, apparently, intercepting parcels before they sat in a dark hallway. At the same time, my laptop pinged with a reminder: the project planning meeting was in ten minutes. Management was pushing hard for accurate time estimates for the new software rollout, and I was the lead engineer. They needed my input to finalize the quarterly roadmap, and I knew how much depended on my numbers being right. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a reliable neighbor and the pressure to deliver at work. I could feel the tension building in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
