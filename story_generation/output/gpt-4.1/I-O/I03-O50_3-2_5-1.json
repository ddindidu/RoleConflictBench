This was our last weekend together before he left for Singapore, and I\u2019d promised him my undivided attention. He reached for my hand, his eyes searching mine for reassurance, but my phone buzzed again\u2014another urgent message from the plant. The main production unit was down, and the team couldn\u2019t get past the sensor errors. I was the only one who knew the system inside out.
