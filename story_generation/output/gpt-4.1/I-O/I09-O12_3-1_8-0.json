She was leaving for a week, and with the planned power outage, she wanted me to keep an eye out for any deliveries\u2014maybe even store her frozen groceries if the outage lasted longer than expected. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor, and she\u2019d done the same for me, watering my plants when I was away. But as I glanced at my IDE, I remembered the promise I\u2019d made to myself: this time, I\u2019d write the module right, not just make it work. The deadline was generous, but I knew if I let myself get distracted, I\u2019d end up rushing and patching things later, just like always. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mrs. Patel, reminding me about the key. I felt the tug of responsibility from both sides, the urge to help and the urge to finally do my job the way I wanted. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations, caught between being the neighbor everyone could count on and the developer I aspired to be."}
