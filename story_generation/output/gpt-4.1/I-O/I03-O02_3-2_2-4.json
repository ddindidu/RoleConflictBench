The new safety standard was rolling out tomorrow, and I was responsible for making sure our project met every requirement. My mind raced through checklists and documentation, but my heart was somewhere else. In the next room, my boyfriend was curled up on the couch, silent and hollow after the news of his brother\u2019s passing. He needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my words. I could hear his quiet sobs, and guilt twisted in my chest. I wanted to hold him, to be the anchor he could lean on, but the clock was ticking on my deadline. My manager\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind: no mistakes, no delays, everything by the book. I felt split in two, torn between the person I loved and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands hovered over the keyboard, but my heart pulled me toward the living room. I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
