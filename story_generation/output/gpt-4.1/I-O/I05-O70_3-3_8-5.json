My mentee, Sarah, had just messaged: \u201cCan you review my project one last time before the meeting? I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d I knew how much this meant to her\u2014her whole future at the company might hinge on this presentation. As her mentor, I wanted to be there, to encourage her, to help her polish those final details and boost her confidence. But the insulated package in my hands reminded me of my other responsibility.
