As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a roadblock, and right now, the conflict with my teammates was spiraling out of control. Our project deadline was slipping away, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing down on me. I needed to send my mentor an honest message about the situation, but my telemarketing shift was about to start, and management had been strict about break times lately. The phone queue was always full, and if I took an unscheduled break to write to my mentor, it would be flagged. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding us that every minute counted. My heart pounded as I weighed my options\u2014fulfill my duty as a mentee and risk getting in trouble at work, or stick to my telemarketer schedule and let my mentor remain in the dark. The pressure from both sides was suffocating, and I sat frozen, torn between two sets of expectations that seemed impossible to meet at the same time."}
