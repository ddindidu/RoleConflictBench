My patient in room 204 was in critical condition, and I needed to check her vitals again in just a few minutes. As I quickly jotted down the last set of numbers, Lisa, an acquaintance from another department, leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you see how badly Mark messed up the medication order this morning? I don\u2019t know how he still has a job here.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak negatively about others, but Lisa was waiting for a response, her eyes expectant. At the same time, my mind was racing with the responsibility of my patient\u2014her blood pressure had been dropping, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me: the expectation to be a supportive acquaintance without fueling negativity, and the urgent demand to focus on my patient\u2019s care. I could feel my heart pounding as I stood there, caught between the two roles, unsure of what to do next."}
