As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish the analysis by noon\u2014without it, the whole project would stall, and the client was already anxious. But as a telemarketer, my headset buzzed with another incoming call. I was expected to answer promptly, handle objections, and keep prospects engaged, even when their technical questions went far beyond the script. My manager had reminded me just this morning: \u201cDon\u2019t let any calls go to voicemail, and make sure you address every concern.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting as I glanced at the clock. Every minute spent on the phone meant less time for the spreadsheet, but if I ignored the calls, I\u2019d be letting down my sales team. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the relentless expectations of my telemarketing role. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, knowing I had to choose which to prioritize next."}
