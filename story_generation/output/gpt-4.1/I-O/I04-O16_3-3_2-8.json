I saw my friend\u2019s name flashing on the screen, and when I answered, her voice was raw with tears. She could barely speak, choking out that something terrible had happened to her family. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be the friend she needed\u2014someone who would stay on the line, offer comfort, and just be there. But as I murmured soothing words, my hospital pager blared. An emergency: a patient in the ER with a rapidly spreading infection, needing immediate intervention. I was the only doctor on call. My mind raced. My friend\u2019s pain was real and urgent, but so was the life in my care. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My friend needed me to listen, to stay, to care. My patient needed me to act, to decide, to save. I stared at the phone, the pager, my own trembling hands, caught between the impossible expectations of being a good friend and a responsible doctor."}
