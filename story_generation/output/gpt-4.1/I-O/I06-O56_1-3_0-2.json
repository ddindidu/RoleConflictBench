I glanced up to see the bride-to-be and her bridesmaids, all dressed in matching robes, bustling in earlier than expected. Their nervous laughter filled the room, but I could see the tension in the bride\u2019s eyes. I knew how important it was to greet them warmly, to set the tone for their big day, but my mind was still tangled in the reading\u2014my mentor\u2019s words echoing about the importance of preparation and initiative. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the mentee who wanted to impress with diligence, and the hairdresser who needed to be present, calm, and welcoming. My heart raced as I tried to decide whether to quickly finish the paragraph or set everything aside and greet the bridal party with the attention they deserved."}
