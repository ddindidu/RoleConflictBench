It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d I glanced at the clock; there was still a mountain of materials to move before the end of my shift, and the supervisor had made it clear it had to be done today. My hands were already raw, my back aching, but Sam had always been there for me, especially when things got rough. I could hear the desperation in his voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. But if I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my crew, maybe even risking my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do, torn between loyalty to my friend and responsibility to my work."}
