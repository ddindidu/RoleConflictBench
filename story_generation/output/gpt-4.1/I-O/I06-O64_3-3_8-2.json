My mentor had squeezed in a session for me\u2014just one hour before her flight. She\u2019d made it clear: this was the only time she could meet before leaving the country for weeks. I owed her my respect, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But as the end of my cashier shift approached, the line at my register grew longer, and the transactions became larger\u2014hundred-dollar bills, credit cards, and checks. My manager always reminded me: accuracy is everything, especially at closing. One mistake could throw off the entire day\u2019s balance, and I\u2019d be responsible. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. If I left early, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s effort and risk missing the session. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk making a costly error or being late for the meeting. My hands trembled as I counted change, my mind torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
