Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, had mentioned she had extra bags this week and hoped I\u2019d leave some space for her. I wanted to be considerate\u2014after all, we shared the curb and a friendly rapport. But my phone buzzed with an urgent alert: the holiday travel surge was peaking, and I was due on shift in less than an hour. The approach fixes were already stacked with holding patterns, and I knew every second of my focus would be needed to keep the airspace safe and efficient. My mind raced\u2014should I wheel out my bin now, filling it up and possibly leaving Mrs. Patel with nowhere to put her trash, or wait and risk being late for my shift, letting down my team and the pilots counting on me? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising as I stood between the curb and my car, torn by the demands of being a good neighbor and a vigilant air traffic controller."}
