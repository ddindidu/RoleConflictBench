The store was quiet, just a few customers waiting, and the hum of the fluorescent lights filled the silence. As I handed Mrs. Lee her receipt, my friend Mark, who I\u2019d known since high school, stepped up with a basket. He leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you hear about Tom? I heard something wild.\u201d I knew exactly what he was talking about\u2014earlier, I\u2019d overheard a manager discussing Tom\u2019s sudden leave, something personal and sensitive. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or spread rumors, especially something that could hurt Tom\u2019s reputation. But as a cashier, I was expected to be friendly, chatty, and keep the line moving smoothly. Mark\u2019s expectant look made my heart race. I could feel the pressure to respond, to be the friendly cashier who shares a laugh, but also the loyal acquaintance who keeps confidences. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the next item, caught between the urge to protect Tom and the pull to fit in with Mark\u2019s expectations."}
