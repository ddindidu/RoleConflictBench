As a neighbor, I know how important it is to keep the hallway peaceful\u2014everyone expects me to keep my dog quiet, especially after last week\u2019s complaints. But as a nursing assistant, I can\u2019t ignore my responsibility to Mrs. Lee. She\u2019s recovering from surgery, and her last set of vital signs were a bit high. I need to check on her soon, but if I leave now, my dog will bark even more, disturbing everyone. If I stay to calm him down, I\u2019ll be late with Mrs. Lee\u2019s vitals, and that could mean missing something important in her recovery. I stand in the doorway, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
