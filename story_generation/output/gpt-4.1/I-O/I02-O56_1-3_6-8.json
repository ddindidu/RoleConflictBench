She sounded upset, and I knew I should call her right away, talk it through, and smooth things over before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does\u2014he listens, resolves, reassures. But right now, Mrs. Patel was in my chair, her hair thick with product, the tangles stubborn and tight. I could already feel the resistance my scissors would meet if I didn\u2019t take the time to wash and condition her hair properly. She expected me to be thorough, gentle, and professional. I could see her watching me in the mirror, waiting for me to start. My phone buzzed again. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Mia needed me, but so did Mrs. Patel. I stood there, comb in hand, torn between the person I loved and the job I took pride in, wishing I could split myself in two."}
