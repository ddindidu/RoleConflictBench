The technical hurdle I\u2019d hit this morning had left me stuck, and I knew I was supposed to communicate challenges right away. But the pool was busy, and my eyes kept darting to the deep end, where kids splashed and shouted. Suddenly, I noticed a small child drifting past the rope into the restricted area, their strokes growing frantic. My training screamed at me to act\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. But my mentor\u2019s words echoed in my head, the expectation to be open and proactive pressing down on me. I gripped my whistle, torn between sending a quick message about my project setback and leaping into action to help the struggling child. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt frozen, caught between two worlds that refused to wait."}
