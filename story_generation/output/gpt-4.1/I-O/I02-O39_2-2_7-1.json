We\u2019ve argued about money all week, and she\u2019s expecting me to call during my break to talk things out. She wants me to be present, to listen, to help us find a way forward. I know she\u2019s hurting, and I want to fix things between us. But right now, sweat drips down my back as I haul lumber across the site. The carpenter waves impatiently, waiting for the next load so he can keep working. The foreman\u2019s already warned me once about slowing down the crew. If I stop now, even for a few minutes, I\u2019ll hold everyone up and risk getting chewed out\u2014or worse. My heart pounds with the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the boyfriend Mia needs, but I can\u2019t let the team down either. My hands grip the rough wood, torn between the call in my pocket and the job in my arms, not sure which demand I can afford to ignore."}
