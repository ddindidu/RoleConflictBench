She\u2019d suggested a few articles\u2014optional, she said, but I knew she expected me to read them before our next meeting. The deadline was weeks away, but I felt the weight of her trust in my growth. I wanted to prove I was diligent, that I took her guidance seriously. \n\nBut just outside my door, a family waited. Their son\u2019s test results had come in, and I had to tell them the news no one wants to hear. My mind raced with the right words, the right tone, the empathy they deserved. I could hear their anxious whispers, feel the pressure to be present, compassionate, and clear. \n\nI glanced at the articles again, guilt prickling at my conscience. Was I letting my mentor down by not diving into the readings right away? Was I letting my patient\u2019s family down by not giving them my full attention? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat frozen, torn between the person I wanted to be for my mentor and the doctor I needed to be for my patients."}
