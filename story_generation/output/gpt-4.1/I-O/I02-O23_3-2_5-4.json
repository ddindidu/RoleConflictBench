Let\u2019s make it special?\u201d My heart aches. I want nothing more than to hold her hand, laugh over coffee, and memorize every detail of her face before she boards that plane. But my laptop pings with another email\u2014my client\u2019s case, the one I\u2019ve been building for weeks, is set for a crucial hearing on Saturday. The judge won\u2019t reschedule, and my client\u2019s future hinges on my arguments. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My partner expects my undivided attention, to feel cherished before months apart. My client expects unwavering commitment, to trust that I\u2019ll fight for them when it matters most. I pace the room, torn between love and duty, knowing that no matter what I choose, someone I care about will be let down."}
