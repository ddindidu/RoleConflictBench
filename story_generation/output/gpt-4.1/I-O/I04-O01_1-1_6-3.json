The client wanted something simple but functional, and I could already see the challenge in fitting everything into such a tight area. My mind was deep in the process, mapping out where the desk would go, how the light would fall, and how to make every inch count. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sam, my friend. He sounded confused about where we were supposed to meet later. I knew he hated feeling left out or uncertain, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be a better communicator after our last misunderstanding. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, and the design deadline was looming. My hand hovered over my phone, torn between sending a quick clarifying message to Sam and pushing through to finish the sketch while the ideas were fresh. The pressure of being a good friend and a competent architect pressed in on me, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in my chest."}
