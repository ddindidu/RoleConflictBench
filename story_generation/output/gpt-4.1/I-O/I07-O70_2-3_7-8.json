I glanced at the screen\u2014my team was waiting for my clarification on a project detail before they could move forward. I knew they expected a quick response, especially since we were on a tight deadline. At the same time, I saw a text from the customer asking about their package. I felt a knot in my stomach; the package had been delayed at the depot, and I needed to explain the situation politely and professionally. My mind raced, torn between crafting a clear, helpful reply to my colleagues and composing a calm, apologetic message to the customer. Both were waiting, both deserved my attention, but I only had a few minutes before my next stop. The pressure mounted as I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
