It was a message from Jamie, my best friend. I could tell right away from the reply\u2014short, clipped, and cold\u2014that they\u2019d taken my earlier text the wrong way. My stomach twisted. Jamie always expects me to be upfront and fix things quickly when there\u2019s a misunderstanding. I knew I should call them right now, explain what I meant, and make sure they weren\u2019t upset.\n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I noticed the broken lane rope floating in the water. Swim lessons were about to start, and as the lifeguard, it was my job to make sure everything was safe and ready. If I didn\u2019t fix the rope immediately, the lessons could be disrupted, and the kids might be at risk. My supervisor always stressed that equipment maintenance was non-negotiable.\n\nI stood at the edge of the pool, phone in hand, heart pounding. Jamie needed me, but so did the swimmers. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my attention right now."}
