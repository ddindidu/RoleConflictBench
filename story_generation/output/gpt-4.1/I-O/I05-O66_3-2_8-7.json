The project\u2019s falling apart. I need your advice.\u201d My heart clenched. I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide them through this make-or-break moment. But just then, two travelers flagged me down, waving frantically beside a mountain of suitcases. \u201cAirport, please! We\u2019re running late\u2014can you help us load these?\u201d one called out, already opening the trunk. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable, never turning away a fare, always offering a hand. Their anxious faces reminded me of the trust people place in me, expecting swift, professional service.\n\nBut my mentee\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, desperate for support. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. If I took the call, I\u2019d delay the travelers, risking their flight and my reputation. If I focused on the ride, I\u2019d let my mentee down at a critical moment. My hands hovered over the steering wheel, my phone buzzing again, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between being the mentor I promised to be and the driver my passengers needed right now."}
