As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish my part of the project by the end of the day, but there was still plenty of buffer time. My teammates could keep working without my section for now, and I could always stay a bit late tomorrow if needed. But as the end of my shift approached, my other role tugged at me\u2014cashier. The store manager had just reminded us about the new corporate policy: every large cash deposit had to be counted, double-checked, and logged with no shortcuts, no matter how late it was or how tired we felt. The process was tedious and time-consuming, but skipping a step could mean trouble for everyone. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my colleagues counting on me to keep the project moving, and the company relying on me to follow every rule to the letter. My mind raced, torn between the easy flexibility of my office work and the rigid demands of the register, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
