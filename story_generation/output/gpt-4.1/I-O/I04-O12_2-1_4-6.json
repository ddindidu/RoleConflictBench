It\u2019s Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. Can you check and bring it to the airport if it\u2019s here? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014rush hour traffic is about to start. I promise to check, but as I hang up, a Slack notification pops up: QA has flagged that annoying UI glitch again. My manager\u2019s message is clear: \u201cCan you fix this ASAP? Users are getting frustrated.\u201d\n\nI stare at my screen, heart pounding. Sam\u2019s always been there for me, and I know how much this trip means to him. But the bug, though minor, is starting to pile up in user complaints, and I\u2019m the only one who knows the code well enough to patch it quickly. My mind races, torn between the loyalty I owe my friend and the responsibility I feel toward my team and our users. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
