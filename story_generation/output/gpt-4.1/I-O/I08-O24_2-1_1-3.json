The deadline for the scheduling order loomed, and I knew I needed to focus, to craft a clear and thorough legal opinion. But just as I started typing, I noticed Sarah, a friend of a friend, standing awkwardly by the entrance. She looked lost, her eyes darting around the room. I remembered how I\u2019d promised to introduce her to the group, to help her feel welcome. \n\nI waved her over, forcing a smile, but my mind was still tangled in legal jargon and procedural deadlines. She sat down, her voice barely above a whisper, and I could sense her anxiety. I wanted to be warm and attentive, to put her at ease, but the pressure of the unfinished order gnawed at me. Every minute spent chatting felt like time stolen from my work, yet every moment I glanced at my screen, I felt I was failing her as a friendly acquaintance. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the demands of both worlds, feeling the weight of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
