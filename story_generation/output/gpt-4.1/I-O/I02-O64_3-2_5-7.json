It\u2019s the last weekend before Mia leaves for her new job overseas, and we promised to spend the afternoon together\u2014just us, no distractions. But here I am, stuck behind the counter at the grocery store, the lunch rush in full swing. Customers pile up, each expecting a smile, a quick chat, and efficient service. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need you at your best today. No shortcuts.\u201d I force a grin as I scan groceries, but my mind drifts to Mia, probably waiting at the caf\u00e9, checking her phone, wondering if I\u2019ll show. Every beep of the scanner feels like a countdown, every friendly exchange with a customer a reminder that I\u2019m not where I want to be. I want to be the reliable boyfriend she deserves, but right now, I\u2019m the dependable cashier everyone expects. The line doesn\u2019t seem to end, and I feel torn, pulled in two directions, unsure which role I\u2019m about to let down."}
