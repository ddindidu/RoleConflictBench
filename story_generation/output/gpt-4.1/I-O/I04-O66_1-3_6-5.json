My friend, Sam, had texted three times already, each message more frantic than the last. We were supposed to meet up after my shift, but now he was at the wrong spot, confused and waiting for my reply. I knew if I didn\u2019t clear things up right now, he\u2019d think I was blowing him off again. But as I glanced at my phone, the road ahead narrowed\u2014orange cones funneled traffic into a single lane, and a cluster of kids in bright backpacks waited at the crosswalk. The urge to grab my phone and text Sam was overwhelming; I didn\u2019t want another misunderstanding between us. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for every life around me, especially in a school zone. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to be a good friend and the duty to be a safe driver, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
