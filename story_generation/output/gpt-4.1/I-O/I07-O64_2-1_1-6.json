As a colleague, I was expected to join, to listen and contribute, especially since today\u2019s agenda included project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. But as a cashier, I was the only one on shift, and even though the store was quiet, a few customers had just walked in. I smiled and greeted them, scanning their items and making small talk, trying to keep the line moving smoothly. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder for the meeting. I felt the pressure mounting. If I left the register to join the meeting, I\u2019d be letting down the customers and my manager, who counted on me for friendly, reliable service. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss out on crucial information and risk falling behind at work. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my team needed me, but so did the people right in front of me. I looked from the register to the door, torn between two worlds, unsure which one I could afford to disappoint."}
