The court\u2019s deadline for the scheduling order loomed, and I knew I needed to focus, to be precise and thorough. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia. Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. I could hear her words echoing in my mind, the pain in her voice, the expectation that I would step up, resolve things, show her I cared enough to fight for us. But the judge in me knew the law didn\u2019t wait for personal crises. The court expected clarity, detail, and timeliness. I felt torn, my heart pounding with anxiety. If I turned away from my work, I risked missing the deadline and letting down the court. If I ignored Mia, I risked losing her. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait for the other."}
