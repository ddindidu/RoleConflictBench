As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate\u2014no one likes a noisy dog disturbing the peace, especially in our building where sound travels easily. I felt a pang of guilt, knowing Mrs. Lee next door had mentioned her migraines last week. At the same moment, the bell above the salon door jingled, and a new client stepped in, looking anxious and lost. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to greet clients warmly, put them at ease, and make them feel welcome from the moment they arrive. But Max\u2019s barking was growing louder, echoing through the hallway, and I could imagine my neighbors\u2019 irritation rising. I stood frozen, torn between rushing out to calm Max and fulfill my duty as a good neighbor, or staying to greet the client and uphold my professional role. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every second that passed."}
