The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to be there\u2014this was the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for months. My input mattered, and I knew my absence would be noticed. But just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. It was the nurse: my patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis. She was scared, overwhelmed, and waiting for me to explain what this meant for her life. As her doctor, I owed her my time, my clarity, and my empathy. I could picture her sitting there, searching my face for reassurance. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my team and the vulnerable patient who needed me now. I felt my chest tighten, caught between the expectations of being a reliable colleague and a compassionate doctor, knowing that whichever door I walked through, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
