My colleagues were dissecting the latest decisions made by Mark, our mutual coworker. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking ill of others, but the group\u2019s questions soon turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019re the architect on his project, right? What do you think about his changes?\u201d All eyes were on me, expecting insight.\n\nInside, I felt the pressure mount. As the architect, I was responsible for managing the project efficiently, and Mark\u2019s last-minute changes had caused delays and tension among the teams. I needed to resolve these issues quickly to keep us on track for the looming deadline. The group wanted honesty, maybe even a little venting, but I knew that criticizing Mark could fuel negativity and damage trust.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the urge to defend my team\u2019s hard work and the desire to avoid gossip. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, searching for the right words as the room grew quiet, waiting for my response."}
