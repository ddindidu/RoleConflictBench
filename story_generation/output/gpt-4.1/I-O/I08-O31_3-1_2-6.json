She was sitting on the curb, tears streaming down her face, next to her car parked in a clearly marked no-parking zone. As I approached, she looked up, recognizing me, and tried to compose herself. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she stammered, \u201cI just got some terrible news and I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d \n\nAs an acquaintance, I wanted to comfort her, maybe even let her off with a warning. She needed kindness, not another problem. But as a police officer, I was expected to treat everyone equally, to uphold the law with integrity. If I let her go, was I being unfair to others who\u2019d gotten tickets here? My badge felt heavier than usual, and I could feel the tension between wanting to be a friend and needing to be fair. I stood there, ticket book in hand, heart pounding, torn between compassion and duty, unsure which role should guide my next move."}
