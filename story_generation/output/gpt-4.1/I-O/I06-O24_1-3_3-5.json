As a judge, I know the defendant waits in a holding cell, his fate hanging on the order I must draft\u2014every detail must be precise, every condition clear. The pressure to be thorough and swift is immense; any delay could mean unnecessary hours in custody. Yet, as I open my laptop, I notice an email from my mentor, reminding me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. I do have a question\u2014a minor point about legal terminology that\u2019s been nagging at me. I promised to communicate openly, to show initiative and honesty as a mentee. But now, the weight of my judicial responsibility presses down. Do I pause to send a quick message, risking a delay for the defendant? Or do I push aside my mentee obligations, focusing solely on my duty as a judge? My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the expectations of two roles, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
