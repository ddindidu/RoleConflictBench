Earlier, during our coffee break, Jamie had confided in me about feeling overwhelmed and falling behind on tasks. As a mentor, I wanted to encourage Jamie to take initiative and learn from real situations, so I suggested shadowing me during a busy shift. Now, a customer approached, holding a blender and no receipt, insisting on a return. Store policy was clear\u2014no receipt, no return. Jamie watched, wide-eyed, waiting to see how I\u2019d handle it. I felt the weight of two worlds: the store expected me to enforce the rules without exception, but Jamie needed to see compassion and creative problem-solving. My mind raced, torn between being the strict cashier and the supportive mentor. I could feel Jamie\u2019s hope for a learning moment, and the customer\u2019s growing impatience, as I hesitated, caught between the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
