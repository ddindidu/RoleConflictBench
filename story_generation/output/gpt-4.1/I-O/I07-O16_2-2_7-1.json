They were waiting for my input on the project plan, and I knew the task couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified a key point. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the workflow smooth and show respect for everyone\u2019s time. But at that moment, I was sitting across from a patient whose symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern. She looked at me, anxious and hopeful, as I reviewed her test results for the third time. As a doctor, I was expected to give her my full attention, to piece together the puzzle of her illness and not miss a single detail. My mind raced between the urgent ping of my inbox and the responsibility I felt to this patient. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the team\u2019s need for efficiency and my patient\u2019s need for answers. My hands hovered over my phone, my thoughts tangled in the impossible choice between being a reliable colleague and a thorough doctor."}
