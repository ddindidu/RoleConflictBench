One of them, a quiet guy named Ben, looked especially uneasy, fidgeting with his sleeves and barely making eye contact. I remembered my role as an acquaintance\u2014to be friendly, to help him feel comfortable. I smiled, tried to draw him into the conversation, and asked gentle questions. Just as he started to open up, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: I needed to check the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit before my shift started in half an hour. As an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t risk missing expired supplies or missing items; lives could depend on it. But if I left now, Ben might feel abandoned or rejected, reinforcing his anxiety. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding compassion and presence, the other demanding responsibility and precision. My mind raced, torn between staying to support Ben and leaving to fulfill my duty as an ambulance driver."}
