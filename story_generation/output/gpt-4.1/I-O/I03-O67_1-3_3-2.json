My boyfriend and I finally had a stretch of free evenings, a rare chance to unwind together. He\u2019d been hinting at a special dinner, maybe even a movie night, and I could see how much it meant to him. I promised I\u2019d be there, that nothing would get in the way this time. But as I was getting ready, my radio crackled to life\u2014a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported. My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me: to drop everything, get behind the wheel, and race to the scene. Lives depended on my speed and focus. But I could already picture the disappointment in his eyes, the letdown in his voice if I canceled again. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the quiet promise of a night together."}
