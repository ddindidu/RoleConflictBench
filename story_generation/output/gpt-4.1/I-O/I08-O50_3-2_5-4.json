The whirring from the factory floor was louder than usual, and I could feel the heat radiating from the machines\u2014definitely not a good sign. I knew if I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we could be looking at a costly breakdown. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from Mark, an old acquaintance. His car had broken down on a deserted road, and he sounded desperate for help. I could almost hear the anxiety in his text, and I knew he didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to call. As a friend, I felt I should go to him right away, but as the repairer, I was responsible for keeping these machines running safely. My supervisor had already warned me about the risks of skipping maintenance. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the urgent needs of a friend and the pressing demands of my job, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
