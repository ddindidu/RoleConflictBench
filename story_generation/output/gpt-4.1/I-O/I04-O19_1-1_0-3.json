Glancing down, I saw it was Jamie, my closest friend, texting: \u201cUgh, today\u2019s been endless. Can you talk?\u201d I knew from the string of messages that followed that Jamie needed me to listen, to be the friend who always made time, who offered comfort and a sympathetic ear. But in front of me stood Mrs. Patel, looking tired and anxious, asking about which pain reliever would be safest for her arthritis. As a pharmacist, I was expected to give her my full attention, to explain the differences and make sure she felt confident in her choice. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014Jamie\u2019s need for support, Mrs. Patel\u2019s need for guidance. My mind raced, torn between the urge to step away and call Jamie, and the responsibility to my patient. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I should meet first."}
