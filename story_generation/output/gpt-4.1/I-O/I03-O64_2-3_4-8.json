My boyfriend and I had circled this one evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only time we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long work trip. He\u2019d planned dinner, even picked out a movie he knew I\u2019d love. But as I was about to clock out from my shift at the grocery store, my manager asked if I could stay late. The holiday rush had brought in a flood of customers, and one woman at my register was already raising her voice, frustrated about a coupon. I could feel my phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014probably my boyfriend, waiting for me. I forced a smile, trying to calm the customer, but my mind was racing. I wanted to be the patient, friendly cashier my boss expected, but all I could think about was disappointing the person I loved. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
