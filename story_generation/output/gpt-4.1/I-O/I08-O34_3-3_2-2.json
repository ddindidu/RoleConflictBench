As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to go over, offer a kind word, maybe just listen. She looked up, eyes red, and I could see she needed someone\u2014anyone\u2014to show they cared. But just as I stood, my radio crackled urgently. The supervisor\u2019s voice came through: \u201cAll controllers, we\u2019ve got a major route closure\u2014flights are stacking up, we need everyone on deck now.\u201d My heart pounded. As an air traffic controller, I knew the chaos that could unfold if I wasn\u2019t at my station, focused and alert. The expectation was clear: lives depended on my attention. Yet, Jenna\u2019s pain was right in front of me, raw and immediate. I hovered between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both demands pressing in, torn by the need to be present for someone in distress and the responsibility to keep the skies safe."}
