Why do you keep changing plans?\u201d My heart sank. I knew he hated uncertainty, and I could already sense the tension building. I wanted to call him, to talk it out, to resolve this before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do\u2014be present, listen, smooth things over.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a new email from the compliance team. The subject line: \u201cURGENT: Documentation Needed for Updated Standard.\u201d My mind snapped back to the project. The new safety regulation was non-negotiable, and the release was days away. If I didn\u2019t pull together the evidence tonight, we\u2019d risk a delay, or worse, a compliance violation. My team was counting on me to get this right.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014Alex\u2019s disappointment, my team\u2019s expectations. I sat frozen, phone in one hand, mouse in the other, torn between the person I loved and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
