She was away for the week and had asked me to keep an eye out for her package, especially since the building\u2019s power was scheduled to go out that afternoon. I promised I\u2019d help, but just then, a new client in my chair frowned at her reflection. The color wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for, and I could see her disappointment growing. She expected me to fix it, to listen and reassure her, to make her feel beautiful and heard. At the same time, I felt the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust\u2014if I missed the delivery, her medication might spoil in the heat. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the client\u2019s concerns, but my mind kept drifting to the lobby, the package, and the looming power cut. I felt torn, pulled between being the reliable neighbor and the attentive hairdresser, both expecting my full attention at the same moment."}
