My mentee, Sarah, had just texted, desperate for last-minute advice before her big interview tomorrow. As her mentor, I knew how much this opportunity meant to her\u2014she counted on me to help her grow, to be present and encouraging, especially now. But the end-of-shift rush had just begun, and as the cashier responsible for closing, I had to process a string of high-value transactions with absolute precision. One slip could mean a costly error, and my manager expected nothing less than perfection.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, Sarah\u2019s anxious words lighting up the screen. I could almost hear her voice, hoping for reassurance. At the same time, a customer approached with a complicated return, and the line behind him grew longer. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the register, but my mind kept drifting to Sarah\u2019s message. I felt torn\u2014pulled between the duty to guide her and the responsibility to my job.
