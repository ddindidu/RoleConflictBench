The purchase agreement needed my full attention\u2014there was barely enough time to review it before the filing deadline. As I hurried down the corridor, I nearly collided with Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly exchange. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she chirped, pausing as if ready for a chat. I felt the weight of my neighborly role pressing on me\u2014be polite, be present, don\u2019t rush off. But the lawyer in me screamed about the urgency of the contract, the risk of missing something crucial.
