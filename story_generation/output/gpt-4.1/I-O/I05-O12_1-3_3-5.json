My inbox pinged with another message from the architects\u2014\u201cNeed your input on the API structure ASAP.\u201d The launch date had been moved up, and now every minute counted. I knew the other teams were waiting on me, their progress stalled until I could make some tough calls. My mind raced through possible solutions, weighing trade-offs, but before I could type a response, I heard a hesitant voice behind me.\n\n\u201cHey, do you have a sec?\u201d It was Jamie, my mentee, clutching a notebook.

She looked hopeful, expecting the guidance I\u2019d always tried to give, even if it was just during coffee breaks.

My heart pounded as I glanced between my blinking screen and Jamie\u2019s expectant face, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I could give at once."}
