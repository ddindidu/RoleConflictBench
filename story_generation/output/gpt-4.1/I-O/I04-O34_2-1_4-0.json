My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. \u201cI think I left my passport at home,\u201d she said, her voice tight with panic. \u201cCan you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the radar\u2014no holding patterns, no congestion, just a handful of blips moving steadily across the screen.
