They looked to me for reassurance, expecting guidance and encouragement, and I knew how much this moment meant to them. I wanted to be fully present, to offer the right words, to help them believe in themselves. But as I glanced at the water, I noticed the filtration system\u2019s warning light blinking red\u2014a sign I couldn\u2019t ignore. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and a malfunction could put swimmers at risk. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the mentor who should be at my mentee\u2019s side, and the lifeguard who must act quickly to prevent danger. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the pressure of choosing between nurturing a future and protecting the present."}
