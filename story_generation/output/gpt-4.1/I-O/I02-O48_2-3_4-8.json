My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on the calendar weeks ago, knowing it was the only one we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long training. She\u2019d been dropping hints all day\u2014her favorite movie queued up, dinner plans made, a bottle of wine chilling. I could feel her excitement, and I wanted to be there, fully present, to make her feel loved and important.\n\nBut as my shift was ending, I heard sobbing from down the hall. Mrs. Carter, one of my regular patients, had just been told her cancer had returned. She clung to my hand, her eyes searching mine for comfort, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer?\u201d I knew she had no family nearby, and the other nurses were swamped. My heart twisted\u2014she needed me, too.\n\nI stood in the hallway, phone buzzing with a sweet \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d text, while Mrs. Carter\u2019s cries echoed behind me. I felt torn in two, the weight of both their needs pressing down, unsure which door I should walk through."}
