The siren wailed, echoing the urgency in my chest. In the back, a paramedic worked frantically to stabilize our patient\u2014her life hanging by a thread. My mind raced with every slick turn, every flash of headlights in the storm. I had to get us to the hospital safely, no matter what.\n\nBut my phone buzzed on the dashboard, a reminder of the mentoring session I\u2019d scheduled for my new trainees. They were counting on me to guide them through the skills they needed for tomorrow\u2019s big project. I\u2019d spent hours preparing a lesson, determined to give them the confidence I wished I\u2019d had at their stage. I imagined them waiting, anxious and uncertain, hoping I\u2019d show up and share what I knew.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. My trainees needed my guidance; my patient needed my focus. I felt torn, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between being the mentor they expected and the ambulance driver my patient desperately needed."}
