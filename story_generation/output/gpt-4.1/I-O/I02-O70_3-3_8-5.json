Our argument from last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was threatening to end things if we didn\u2019t talk it out immediately. My chest tightened\u2014I knew I had to fix this, to be the boyfriend who could resolve conflicts, who wouldn\u2019t let things fall apart. But as I pulled up to the next address, the pressure of my other role pressed in. The package in my hands was marked \u201cconfidential\u2014recipient only,\u201d and my supervisor\u2019s warning echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Confirm identity. No mistakes.\u201d I could see the recipient waiting at the door, checking their watch, clearly impatient. My phone buzzed again\u2014her name flashing, another message. I felt torn in two, the weight of both expectations crushing me. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded.
