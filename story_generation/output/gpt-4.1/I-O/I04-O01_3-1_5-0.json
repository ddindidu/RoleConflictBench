It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me to pick him up right away. I glanced at the clock: nearly midnight. My mind raced. As a friend, I knew I should be there for Sam, especially now, when he was stranded and scared. But as an architect, I was responsible for ensuring every detail in the building plan was correct. I\u2019d just noticed a few minor inconsistencies\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to nag at me. If I left now, I\u2019d lose my only quiet hours to double-check the plans before the morning deadline. If I stayed, Sam would be alone in the dark, waiting for help. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. My hand hovered over the car keys, heart pounding, torn between the friend who needed me and the architect who couldn\u2019t afford to let anything slip."}
