She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I promised I\u2019d keep an eye out. But as I walked into the care facility, my mind shifted to Mr. Carter, my first patient. He relies on me to help him bathe and dress, and he gets anxious if I\u2019m late. My phone buzzed\u2014a delivery notification for Mrs. Lee. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I could run home and grab her package, but that would mean leaving Mr. Carter waiting, possibly confused and upset. If I stayed, Mrs. Lee\u2019s package might be stolen or returned, and I\u2019d break my promise. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the dependable nursing assistant, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
