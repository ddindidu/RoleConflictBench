My lunch break just started, and the office is unusually quiet\u2014supervisors said we could take our breaks whenever we wanted today. I know I should use this time to clear my head, maybe grab a coffee, but my mind keeps drifting back to the argument I had with Alex last night. We\u2019ve been fighting about money all week, and I promised I\u2019d call during my break to talk things through. As his girlfriend, I want to fix this, to show him I care enough to reach out first. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to stick to my scheduled break and return on time, ready to hit my call quota. If I call Alex now, I might run over my break, and my supervisor could notice. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll spend the rest of the shift distracted, replaying our argument in my head. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014resolve things with Alex or keep my work record spotless. I can\u2019t seem to do both."}
