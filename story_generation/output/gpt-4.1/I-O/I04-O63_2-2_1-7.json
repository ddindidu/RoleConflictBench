It was Jamie, my best friend, and her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. My heart twisted\u2014I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her, like I always promised I would be. But I was staring at the break timer on my screen, knowing management was watching every second. The phone queue was packed, and if I went over my allotted time, I\u2019d get another warning. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that every minute counted. Jamie\u2019s words blurred with the ticking of the clock, and I felt torn in two\u2014one part desperate to comfort my friend, the other weighed down by the pressure to keep my job. I gripped the phone tighter, caught between the expectations of being a good friend and a reliable employee, not sure which role I could afford to let down."}
