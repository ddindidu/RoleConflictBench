I really need you.\u201d My heart sinks. He had his big performance review today, and from the tone of his message, it didn\u2019t go well. I want nothing more than to step away, call him, and be the supportive girlfriend he needs\u2014listen, reassure him, remind him of his worth. But just then, Mrs. Patel arrives for her appointment. She\u2019s on a complicated regimen\u2014warfarin, amiodarone, and a new antibiotic. I know how critical it is to counsel her thoroughly, to catch any dangerous interactions, to answer her questions with patience and care.
