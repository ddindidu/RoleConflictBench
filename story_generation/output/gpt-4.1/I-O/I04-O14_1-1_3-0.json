The hum of the centrifuge was oddly soothing, and I was finally in the zone. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, my oldest friend, was calling. I hesitated, but answered. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in screws and these instructions make no sense,\u201d Sam pleaded, sounding genuinely frazzled. I glanced at the clock. The experiment could technically wait; there were other slots available, and missing this one wouldn\u2019t derail my research. But I\u2019d carved out this time, and I knew how easily momentum could slip away. Still, Sam rarely asked for help, and I could hear the frustration in their voice.
