She smiled and greeted me warmly, expecting the usual friendly chat. I managed a quick hello and a forced smile, my mind already racing ahead to the day\u2019s work. Minutes later, as I pulled up to the taxi stand, two travelers flagged me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. They asked if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare to the airport. As a professional, I knew I should assist them efficiently and courteously, but my thoughts kept drifting back to Mrs. Kim. Had I seemed rude? Was I failing as a neighbor by not stopping to talk? Now, standing by the trunk, I felt torn\u2014should I focus on being the helpful, professional driver my passengers expected, or was I letting down the friendly neighbor I wanted to be? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the demands of my uniform and the expectations waiting just across the hall."}
