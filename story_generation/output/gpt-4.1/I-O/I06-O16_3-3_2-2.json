I knew how much this meant\u2014not just for my own progress, but for my mentor\u2019s reputation. I had promised to deliver, and I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I failed. \n\nBut just as I opened the assignment, my pager shrieked. \u201cER\u2014stat!\u201d I rushed down the hall, white coat flapping, to find a patient gasping for breath, skin mottled, eyes wild with fear.
