My girlfriend\u2019s text from this morning replays in my head\u2014her voice trembling, her world shattered by the loss of her father. I want nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her, to listen, to let her grief spill out. But here I am, in my green apron, forced to smile and say, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d as each customer approaches. \n\nA woman sets her basket down, and I catch myself almost sighing. I force a polite smile, but my heart isn\u2019t in it. She asks about a sale, and I answer, my voice steady, but inside I\u2019m screaming to leave, to run to my girlfriend, to be the support she needs. The store is quiet, but every beep of the scanner feels like a countdown, each customer a barrier between me and the person I love. I know my manager expects me to be cheerful, attentive, but all I want is to be somewhere else, someone else\u2014someone who doesn\u2019t have to choose between being a good boyfriend and a good employee."}
