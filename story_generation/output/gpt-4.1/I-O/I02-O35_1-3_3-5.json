She\u2019d been dropping hints about a cozy dinner, just the two of us, no distractions. I promised her I\u2019d make time, that I\u2019d be present, not just physically but really there, listening and laughing like we used to. But as I guided the train through the tunnel, my radio crackled with urgency. The passenger emergency alarm blared, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through: \u201cMedical emergency in car three. Operator assistance needed immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me\u2014calm, quick action, ensuring everyone\u2019s safety, being the steady hand in chaos. But my mind flashed to Mia, waiting for my call to confirm our plans, her hope for a night that was just ours. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. I gripped the controls, caught between the promise I made to her and the duty I owed to the people on my train, not knowing which demand I could meet without letting someone down."}
