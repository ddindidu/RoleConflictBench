The deadline was in three days, but I knew if I didn\u2019t make progress now, I\u2019d be too exhausted after my shift. My mentor expected me to be prepared, to show initiative and responsibility. Suddenly, the shrill site-wide evacuation alarm blared through the building. My heart jumped. As a construction laborer, I knew the rules\u2014drop everything, evacuate, and head to the muster point with the rest of the crew. No exceptions. My supervisor would notice if I lagged behind, and the team counted on everyone to follow protocol for safety. I stared at my unfinished code, the pressure from my mentor\u2019s expectations weighing on me, while the urgent demands of the site pulled me in the opposite direction. My hands trembled as I hesitated, caught between two worlds, both demanding my full attention."}
