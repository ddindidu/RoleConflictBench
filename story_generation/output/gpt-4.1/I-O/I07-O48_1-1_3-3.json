As a colleague, I knew I was supposed to finish the report by noon, but with the generous buffer time, I could afford to let it wait a little. My team could move forward without it for now, but I still felt the silent expectation to keep up. At the same time, my nursing assistant duties called me down the hall. Mrs. Lee was waiting for her morning vitals check, and I knew how anxious she got if I was late. The routine mattered to her, and it was my job to make sure she felt cared for and safe. I stood in the hallway, torn. Should I quickly finish the report, risking being late for Mrs. Lee, or should I go to her now and let the report sit a bit longer? The pressure of wanting to be reliable for my team and compassionate for my patient twisted inside me, and I hesitated, caught between the two roles, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
