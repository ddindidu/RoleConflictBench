As her mentor, I knew this was a perfect teaching moment\u2014she needed to learn how to handle routine cases with confidence, and I wanted to guide her through every step, sharing the nuances of diagnosis and treatment. But as the doctor responsible for the patient, I also felt the weight of expectation to act swiftly and prescribe the right medication for the woman waiting outside, her throat raw and voice barely a whisper. The clock ticked, and I could sense the intern\u2019s anxiety growing as she hesitated over the antibiotic options. Should I step in and take over, ensuring the patient gets immediate care, or should I let my intern work through the process, risking a delay but giving her the chance to learn? My mind raced, torn between my duty to teach and my obligation to heal, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
