It\u2019s important, and I always seem to miss the delivery.\u201d I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of neighborly duty. I promised her I\u2019d be home, but as soon as I arrived at the site, the foreman barked orders\u2014today, I\u2019d be helping guide a massive steel beam into place. The crane was already humming, the beam dangling precariously, and every second counted. My hands shook as I grabbed my gloves, knowing the team was counting on me to be quick and precise. But my mind kept drifting back to Mrs. Lee\u2019s package, imagining it left out in the rain or stolen from her porch. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention at the exact same time."}
