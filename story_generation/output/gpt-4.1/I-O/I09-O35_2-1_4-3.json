Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, was coming home late again, and my dog always got anxious when someone passed our shared door. I knew the building expected us to keep the noise down, and Mrs. Kim had already hinted that the barking was disturbing her. I tried to calm my dog, but my phone buzzed\u2014my shift was starting, and I had to get to the control room.\n\nAs soon as I settled into the operator\u2019s seat, the intercom crackled. A passenger was asking for directions, sounding confused and a little panicked. I was supposed to be attentive and helpful, making sure everyone felt safe and informed. But my mind kept drifting back to my apartment, picturing my dog barking and Mrs. Kim getting more frustrated. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on the passenger\u2019s needs, or should I rush home during my break to check on my dog and smooth things over with my neighbor? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
