As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to be warm and approachable, especially now that a noise complaint has everyone on edge. I know Mrs. Kim from 4C will be there, and she always expects a smile and a kind word. But as the building\u2019s housekeeping cleaner, my supervisor has made it clear: every room must be spotless, every surface sanitized, no exceptions. Today\u2019s checklist is longer than usual, and I\u2019m already behind. If I leave my cleaning to attend the meeting, I risk falling short of my duties and facing my supervisor\u2019s disappointment. But if I skip the meeting, I\u2019ll seem aloof or unfriendly to my neighbors, maybe even suspicious given the complaint. My stomach knots as I picture both groups expecting the best from me, each in their own way, and I feel pulled in two directions, unsure which role I should honor first."}
