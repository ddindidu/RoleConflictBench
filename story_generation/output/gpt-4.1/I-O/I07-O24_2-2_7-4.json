My team\u2019s messages stacked up, each one more urgent than the last. They needed my input to move forward on the project, and I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t leave your colleagues hanging. But my mind kept drifting back to the thick file on my desk\u2014the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded. As a judge, I was expected to craft a thorough, reasoned judgment, laying out every finding and legal conclusion with precision. The deadline loomed, and I could already feel the weight of the court\u2019s expectations pressing down on me.\n\nEvery time I started to draft the judgment, another ping from my team would break my concentration. I felt torn, knowing that if I delayed my response, I\u2019d be letting my colleagues down, stalling their progress. But if I let myself get distracted, the clarity and detail required for my legal opinion would suffer. My stomach twisted with anxiety as I hovered between the two worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
