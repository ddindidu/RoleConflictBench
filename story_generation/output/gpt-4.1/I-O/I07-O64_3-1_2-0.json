The team meeting was about to start in the break room, and this was the final discussion before we locked in decisions for the new store layout. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to share my thoughts and help shape the plan. But here I was, standing behind the counter, my cashier apron tied tight, scanning groceries for the handful of customers who trickled in during this slow afternoon. My manager expected me to process every transaction accurately, no mistakes, no delays. I could hear the muffled voices of my teammates gathering in the back, and I felt torn. If I left the register, I\u2019d let down my manager and the customers. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to contribute to the team\u2019s big decision. My hands shook slightly as I handed a receipt to a customer, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice between being a reliable cashier and a committed colleague."}
