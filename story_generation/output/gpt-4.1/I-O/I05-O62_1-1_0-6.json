He waved, then wandered over to the shallow end with a few friends, laughing as they splashed each other. Just this morning, he\u2019d asked me whether he should take on extra shifts or focus on his studies, and I\u2019d given him some casual advice, trying to be supportive without pushing too hard. Now, as a lifeguard, I noticed the group edging into the shallow area, unsupervised, ignoring the posted rules. My supervisor expected me to enforce safety strictly, no exceptions, but Jamie looked over, clearly hoping for a friendly nod. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014should I call them out and risk embarrassing Jamie, possibly undermining the trust I\u2019d built as his mentor, or let it slide and compromise my responsibility as a lifeguard? My heart pounded as I gripped the whistle, torn between the expectations of guidance and authority, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
