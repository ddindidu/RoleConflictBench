She smiled, but I could sense tension\u2014everyone had heard about the noise complaint, and I knew she wanted to talk. As her neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, polite, and maybe even reassuring, especially now. But as she stepped closer, I noticed her hair was damp and greasy, probably from her gym session. She was also my next client at the salon, and I knew I\u2019d have to wash and condition her hair thoroughly before I could start her cut. \n\nStanding there, I felt the pressure of both roles. As her neighbor, I should be warm and understanding, smoothing over any awkwardness about the complaint. As her hairdresser, I needed to be professional, maybe even a bit direct about her hair\u2019s condition. My mind raced, torn between the urge to comfort her as a neighbor and the need to address her hair as a stylist. I could feel my smile falter as I tried to figure out which role to lean into first."}
