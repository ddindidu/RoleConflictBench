My mentee, Sarah, hovered nearby, her notebook open, eyes wide with anticipation. She was about to take on the end-of-day reconciliation for the first time\u2014a task where a single error could throw off the entire store\u2019s accounting. I knew I needed to walk her through every step, explain the process, and answer her questions thoroughly. But as I started to guide her, another customer approached, smiling and waiting for me to ring up their items. I forced a friendly greeting, trying to keep my tone warm, but my mind was split. The customer expected quick, cheerful service, but Sarah needed my undivided attention to avoid a costly mistake. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both, feeling the weight of responsibility from both sides. I could sense Sarah\u2019s anxiety growing, and the customer\u2019s patience thinning. I was torn, caught between the need to mentor carefully and the demand to serve customers efficiently, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
