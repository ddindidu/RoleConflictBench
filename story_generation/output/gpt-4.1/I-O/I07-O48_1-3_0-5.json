The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to join in, share updates, and show my engagement. Even though it was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed. At the same time, I stood outside Mr. Lee\u2019s room, my nursing assistant badge heavy on my chest. He was in critical condition, and I was responsible for checking his vital signs every few minutes\u2014his life could depend on my vigilance. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, and I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t log in. But if I left Mr. Lee, even for a short while, I\u2019d be risking his safety. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my team and the urgent needs of my patient, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
