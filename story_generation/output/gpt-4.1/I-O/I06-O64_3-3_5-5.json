The store was finally empty, and I was about to start the end-of-shift cash deposit. The procedure was strict\u2014count, verify, log, and lock away every bill, no shortcuts. My manager had drilled it into me: no mistakes, no distractions. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my mentor. \u201cAny updates on the project?\u201d I hesitated. The conflict with my teammates had exploded today, and our deliverable was at risk. As a mentee, I was supposed to communicate problems right away, but the cash deposit demanded my full attention. If I delayed the deposit, I\u2019d break store policy and risk my job. If I ignored my mentor, I\u2019d fail in my commitment to transparency and risk the project. My hands shook as I stared at the cash drawer, torn between two worlds, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
