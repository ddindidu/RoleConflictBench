The line was long, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every so often, making sure I didn\u2019t slip up. Each bill felt heavier than usual, the numbers blurring together. In the back of my mind, the argument with my project teammates replayed\u2014voices raised, accusations flying, and the deadline looming closer. My mentor had always told me to reach out if things got tough, to never let problems fester. But I couldn\u2019t just step away from the register now, not with so much cash in my drawer and customers waiting. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014probably my mentor, or maybe another angry message from the group chat. I felt torn, the pressure building in my chest. If I didn\u2019t tell my mentor soon, the project could fall apart. But if I lost focus here, even a small mistake could cost me my job. I gripped the edge of the counter, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
