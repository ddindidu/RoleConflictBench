Pilots\u2019 voices crackle through my headset, each one waiting for my revised climb instructions. I know every second counts; a delay could mean turbulence or worse. But the phone keeps vibrating. I glance down\u2014it's Jamie, someone I know but not well, someone I\u2019d chatted with at a few gatherings. The message flashes: \u201cCar broke down, stuck on Old Mill Road. Can you help?\u201d I can almost hear the anxiety in their words. I know what\u2019s expected of me as an acquaintance: to offer help, to not leave someone stranded. But my other role presses in, the weight of responsibility for the lives in the sky. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, headset still on, pilots still waiting, Jamie still stranded. I feel split in two, torn between the urgent needs of a friend and the critical demands of the job. My hand hovers over the phone, mind racing, caught in the impossible space between earth and sky."}
