As the rain drummed harder on the windshield, she leaned forward, her voice hopeful. \u201cHey, you know this area, right? Can you recommend a good restaurant nearby? I\u2019m meeting someone after this.\u201d I felt the familiar tug of wanting to be helpful, to offer a suggestion that would make her evening better. But the wipers struggled to keep up, and the cars around us darted unpredictably, brake lights flaring in the gray. My training as a taxi driver echoed in my mind: keep both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, especially in weather like this. I could sense her expectation, waiting for a friendly tip, but my focus was split\u2014should I risk a quick glance at my phone for a recommendation, or keep my attention locked on the slick, crowded street? The pressure built inside me, torn between being the helpful acquaintance she hoped for and the responsible driver I needed to be."}
