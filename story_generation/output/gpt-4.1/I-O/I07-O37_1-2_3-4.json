The deadline was generous, and my teammates could keep working without my part for now. Still, I knew my manager expected me to stay on top of things and not let tasks pile up. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the cleaning app. I remembered the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner at Mrs. Lee\u2019s apartment. Her next cleaning was in three days, and she always expected the place spotless, with her preferred products. If I didn\u2019t restock soon, I\u2019d risk disappointing her and possibly losing a client. But if I left work early to buy supplies, I\u2019d fall behind on my office tasks, and my colleagues might notice. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, each role pulling at me with its own set of expectations. I stared at the clock, torn between my responsibilities, unsure which demand to answer first."}
