It was almost time for Dr. Lee\u2019s office hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d show up early\u2014she always said mentees should respect her time, not just drop in at the last minute. But the cleaning cart in front of me was loaded with supplies, and the checklist for the science building\u2019s restrooms was only half done. I glanced at my hands, still bare. The gloves were in the supply closet down the hall, but I\u2019d skipped them for the last few sinks, rushing to finish. I knew the rules: always wear gloves, no exceptions, especially with the new hygiene protocols. My supervisor had warned me last week\u2014one more slip, and there\u2019d be consequences. But if I left now to get the gloves, I\u2019d be late for Dr. Lee. If I kept cleaning without them, I\u2019d be breaking protocol. I felt the pressure from both sides, the weight of expectations pressing in. I stood frozen, torn between the responsibility to my mentor and the rules of my job, unsure which demand I could afford to disappoint."}
