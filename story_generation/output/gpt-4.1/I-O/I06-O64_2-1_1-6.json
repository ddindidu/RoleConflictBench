My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTry to finish the code sample before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. That\u2019s all I had. I could feel the weight of the assignment pressing on me, the expectation to impress and not let my mentor down. But here, as a cashier, I was expected to be present, friendly, and attentive to every customer. \n\nA woman approached, her cart full. I greeted her, but my mind drifted to the unfinished lines of code waiting for me at home. Each beep of the scanner was a reminder of the time slipping away. I wanted to focus on the customer, to be the helpful cashier my manager praised, but anxiety gnawed at me. What if I couldn\u2019t finish the assignment? What if my mentor thought I wasn\u2019t committed? \n\nI forced another smile, feeling the tension between wanting to be a good mentee and a good cashier. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I could feel myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to prioritize as the next customer stepped forward."}
