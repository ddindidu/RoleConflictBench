The launch date had been moved up\u2014again\u2014and now everyone was waiting on me to make decisions about the new features. My inbox was a mess of red exclamation marks and \u201cASAP\u201d subject lines. But just as I started typing a response, my girlfriend\u2019s voice cut through the haze. We\u2019d been arguing for hours, voices rising, words sharper than I intended. Now, she was sitting across from me, eyes red, asking if we were even right for each other anymore. I could see the pain in her face, the expectation that I\u2019d drop everything and help us find a way through this. But the pressure from work was crushing; people were literally blocked until I responded. My heart pounded as I looked between her and my laptop, feeling like I was being torn in two. I wanted to be the boyfriend who could fix things, who could make her feel secure. But I was also the developer everyone was counting on. I didn\u2019t know which crisis to face first."}
