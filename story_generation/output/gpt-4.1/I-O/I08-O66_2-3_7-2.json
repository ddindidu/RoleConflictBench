The snow was coming down hard, and the roads were slick, but he kept glancing at the time, anxious about missing his international flight. I gripped the wheel, trying to focus on the road, but he broke the silence with a sigh. \u201cDid you hear about Mark at the office? Completely botched that project. I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d \n\nAs an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak ill of Mark, who I\u2019d met a few times and seemed decent enough. But as a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to keep my passenger comfortable and distracted from the stress of the storm and his tight schedule. The expectation was to be friendly, maybe even chatty, to ease his nerves. My mind raced\u2014should I agree with him to keep the ride pleasant, or change the subject and risk making things awkward?
