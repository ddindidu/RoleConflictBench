My phone buzzed with a message from my client, reminding me of the deadline. I knew I had to review every clause tonight\u2014missing something could cost the company millions. Just then, my girlfriend walked in, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She dropped her bag and sat beside me, barely holding back tears.
