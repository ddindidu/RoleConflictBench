My neighbor, Mrs. Patel, had just texted the group chat, reminding everyone to be mindful of space and not to put out half-empty bins. She\u2019d mentioned how the city was cracking down on waste, and I knew she expected me to wait until next week. But my own bin was already out, only half-full, and I felt a twinge of guilt. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cNeed your time estimates for the new project by noon.\u201d I stared at the spreadsheet, my mind racing with dependencies and unknowns. The team was waiting on me, and management needed solid numbers to plan the quarter. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I focused on the trash, I\u2019d lose precious time for work; if I ignored the neighborly request, I\u2019d risk tension on the block. My roles as a considerate neighbor and a responsible engineer were pulling me in opposite directions, and I could feel the stress knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
