Our casual check-ins had become a space for her to open up, and today she admitted she was overwhelmed, struggling to juggle her project deadlines and personal commitments. As her mentor, I wanted to encourage her to take time for herself, to find a balance that would help her grow both personally and professionally. I could see she needed reassurance, maybe even a gentle nudge to step back and breathe.\n\nBut as an engineer, I knew the routine safety audit was coming up. The documentation needed updating, and while the audit was still weeks away, the expectation was clear: everything had to be perfect, compliant, and ready well in advance. I was supposed to set the standard, to show my team\u2014Maya included\u2014that we never cut corners, not even when time seemed abundant.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I encourage Maya to take a break, risking a delay in our documentation updates? Or should I push her to prioritize the audit, knowing it might add to her stress? The conflicting demands circled in my mind, and I hesitated, unsure which path to take."}
