She\u2019d suggested it last week, saying it would help me grow, but with no strict deadline, I kept pushing it aside. Today, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d start, but now I was staring at a car parked illegally outside a busy caf\u00e9. The driver, a frazzled young woman, pleaded with me\u2014she was late for a job interview, her first in months. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to enforce the law without bias. But I also knew discretion was part of the job, and sometimes compassion mattered. My mentor always said to think critically, to weigh the human side of every situation. I could hear her voice in my head, urging me to consider all angles, just as the department expected me to uphold the rules. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, the unread book a silent reminder of my promise to learn, the ticket book heavy in my hand. I hesitated, caught between the expectations of my mentor and my badge, unsure which path to take."}
