My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for my call\u2014she\u2019d just been offered a job that could change her life, and she needed my guidance. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d help her weigh the pros and cons, walk her through the decision, and be the mentor she counted on. But just as I reached for the phone, my other line rang. It was Mrs. Carter, her voice tight with worry. The storm last night had splintered her deck, and she needed it fixed today\u2014her family reunion was tomorrow, and the deck was the centerpiece. She was counting on me, the carpenter she trusted, to make it right.\n\nI stared at my hands, rough from years of woodworking, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Sarah\u2019s future, Mrs. Carter\u2019s gathering\u2014both urgent, both important. I could hear the clock ticking, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, how to meet the expectations of those who needed me most."}
