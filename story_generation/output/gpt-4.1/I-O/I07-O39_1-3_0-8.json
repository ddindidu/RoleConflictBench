I was supposed to log in, share updates, and show I was engaged, even though the meeting would be recorded. At the same moment, the piercing site alarm blared, echoing across the construction yard. Instinctively, I knew what that meant: drop everything, leave my tools, and head straight to the muster point with the rest of the crew. Site safety protocols were strict, and any delay could put me and others at risk.\n\nBut as I reached for my hard hat, I hesitated. My manager at the office had already commented on my lack of participation in meetings, and I worried about seeming unreliable. Yet, if I stayed behind to join the call, I\u2019d be breaking site rules and letting down my team here. My heart pounded as I stood between the scaffolding and the path to the muster point, torn between the expectations of two worlds that didn\u2019t seem to understand each other."}
