It\u2019s Mark, my oldest friend, his name flashing on the screen. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m about to lose my mind with these instructions,\u201d his message reads. I know he\u2019s been struggling since moving into his new place, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, especially after his rough week. But as I glance up, the radio crackles\u2014\u201cTower, this is Delta 204, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart pounds. The expectation is clear: I must focus, guide the pilot safely, every second counts. Yet, Mark\u2019s message tugs at me, a silent plea for help, and I can almost hear his frustration through the text. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing down. My friend needs me, but so does the pilot, and both expect my undivided attention. My hands hover, one over the radio, the other over my phone, caught in the impossible space between two urgent calls for help."}
