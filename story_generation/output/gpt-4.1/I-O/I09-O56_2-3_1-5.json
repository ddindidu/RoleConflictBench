I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I bumped into anyone on my way out. As I left for work, I rehearsed a friendly greeting in my head, determined to be the kind of neighbor people liked. But at the salon, things took a turn. Just as we were about to close, a client stormed in, furious about her haircut from earlier in the week. She raised her voice, demanding a fix, and I could see my coworkers glancing at the clock, eager to leave. I felt the pressure to handle her complaint with patience and professionalism, even as my mind wandered to the cake in my bag and the hope of catching a neighbor on my way home. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014torn between wanting to be the welcoming new neighbor and the dedicated hairdresser who never lets a client leave unhappy."}
