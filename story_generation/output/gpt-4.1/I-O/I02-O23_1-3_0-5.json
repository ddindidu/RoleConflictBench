She looked up and tried to smile, but I could tell something was off. I wanted to drop everything, sit beside her, and ask about her day, to be the boyfriend she needed\u2014someone who listened, who cared, who made her feel safe. But my phone buzzed with another email from the office: final trial prep, witness lists, last-minute motions. The trial tomorrow was huge\u2014my client\u2019s future depended on me being sharp, focused, and ready. There was no room for distraction, no way to reschedule. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, her silent plea for comfort on one side, my duty to my client on the other. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person I loved and the profession I\u2019d worked so hard for, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
