My phone buzzes with a message from Mia: \u201cCan we talk tonight? I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve fought about money every night this week, and I know she expects me to finally listen, to help us find a way through this mess. But right now, there\u2019s a passenger in my back seat, nervously checking his watch. \u201cPlease, can you go any faster? My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleads. I see the worry in his eyes, and I know what\u2019s expected of me\u2014get him there safely and on time. The traffic light ahead turns yellow. My mind races: if I rush, I might make it, but I can\u2019t risk an accident. If I don\u2019t, he\u2019ll miss his train. Meanwhile, Mia\u2019s words echo in my head, and I feel the weight of her disappointment if I don\u2019t call her back soon. I\u2019m torn, pulled in two directions, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
