My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had texted me earlier, asking if I could keep an eye out for her package. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these small favors. I promised her I\u2019d be home, ready to answer the doorbell. But just as I was about to settle in, my phone buzzed with a call from the nursing home. One of my patients, Mr. Carter, had just received devastating news about his health. The nurse on duty said he was inconsolable, asking for me by name. I could hear his sobs in the background, and my heart twisted. I knew how much he depended on my presence, my words, my hand to hold. But if I left, Mrs. Lee\u2019s package would almost certainly be missed again, and she\u2019d be disappointed, maybe even upset. I stood in my hallway, torn between the neighborly promise I\u2019d made and the deep responsibility I felt for my patient, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
