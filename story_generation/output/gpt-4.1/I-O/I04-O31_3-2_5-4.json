My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an urgent call from Sam, my oldest friend. \u201cMy car\u2019s dead on the highway. I\u2019m scared. Can you come get me?\u201d Her voice trembled, and I could picture her stranded, headlights whizzing by. As a friend, I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and rush to her side, to be the person she could always count on.

My heart pounded as I stared at the accident scene, Sam\u2019s voice echoing in my mind, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between the friend who needed me and the strangers who depended on me to do my job."}
