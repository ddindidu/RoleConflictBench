Just us.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and finally, we had a few evenings free. I could almost hear his hopeful tone, and I wanted nothing more than to say yes, to spend a quiet evening together, just talking and laughing like we used to.\n\nBut as my break ended, I remembered the manager\u2019s reminder from this morning: tonight was my turn to handle the large cash deposit. The procedure was strict\u2014counting, double-checking, logging every bill, and making sure everything matched the register. It always took longer than expected, especially after a busy shift like today. Corporate had been cracking down lately, and any mistake could mean trouble for the whole team.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me, torn between wanting to be the girlfriend he deserved and the responsible cashier my job demanded.
