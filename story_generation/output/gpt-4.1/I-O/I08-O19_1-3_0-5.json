My mind was focused, every word chosen to ensure she understood the importance of timing and possible side effects. Suddenly, I noticed Mark, an old college friend, walking down the quiet hallway outside the consultation room. He caught my eye and gave a small wave, his face lighting up with recognition. I felt the urge to smile back, maybe even step out for a quick hello\u2014after all, I hadn\u2019t seen him in years, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or unfriendly. But Mrs. Lee was watching me expectantly, waiting for my next instruction. I could sense her anxiety, and I knew how critical it was to keep her attention on the counseling. My heart tugged in two directions: the friendly acquaintance wanting to reconnect, and the responsible pharmacist determined to protect a patient\u2019s health. I hesitated, torn between the warmth of an old friendship and the gravity of my professional duty."}
