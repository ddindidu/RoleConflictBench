My mentor\u2019s office hours were precious\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that her time was limited, and I was lucky to have a slot today. But just as I was about to leave the salon, a client walked in, her hair still damp and smelling faintly of shampoo. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cCan we skip the wash and get straight to the cut?\u201d \n\nSalon policy, and my own training, told me I should always wash and condition before cutting. It was about consistency, hygiene, and the client experience. But she looked at me expectantly, and I could see she was in a hurry too. My mind raced: if I insisted on washing her hair, I\u2019d be late for my mentor, disrespecting her time and maybe missing my chance to ask important questions. If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be breaking protocol and risking my reputation as a professional hairdresser. My hands trembled as I reached for the scissors, torn between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
