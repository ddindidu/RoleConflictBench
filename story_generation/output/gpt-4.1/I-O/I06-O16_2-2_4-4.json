As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor, let her know I was stuck, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: Mrs. Patel\u2019s family was waiting in the consultation room. As her doctor, I owed them my full attention, to explain her new diagnosis with patience and empathy, to answer every question and ease their fears. But my mind kept drifting back to the project, the expectation that I communicate challenges promptly. If I delayed, I might fall behind, disappoint my mentor, or miss a learning opportunity. Yet, if I rushed through my conversation with Mrs. Patel, I\u2019d fail her and her family, betraying the trust they placed in me. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two rooms, two roles, and the weight of two sets of expectations pressing down on me."}
