I glanced at the screen: it was Sam, my best friend. The message was frantic\u2014her car had broken down on the highway, and she was scared, stranded in the dark, begging me to come get her right away. My heart pounded. I could hear the crane\u2019s engine humming, the crew waiting for me to grab my gloves and step up. If I left now, the whole team would be stuck, the beam swaying dangerously, the schedule thrown off. But if I stayed, Sam would be alone, maybe in danger, counting on me like she always had.
