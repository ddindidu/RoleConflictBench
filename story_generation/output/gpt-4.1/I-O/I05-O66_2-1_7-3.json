She had asked for a ride to her big interview, hoping for last-minute advice. As her mentor, I wanted to reassure her, to help her believe in herself, to offer those final words that might tip the scales in her favor. But as a taxi driver, my focus had to be on the road\u2014following every traffic law, keeping both of us safe, and driving defensively, even though the roads were clear and the speed limits normal. Sarah\u2019s anxious eyes met mine, silently pleading for guidance, but my hands gripped the wheel, my attention split. I felt the weight of her expectations pressing against the rules of my job. Should I risk a quick glance and a few encouraging words, or keep my eyes forward, prioritizing safety above all? The tension between my roles tightened in my chest, and I wrestled with the impossible choice as we approached the next intersection."}
