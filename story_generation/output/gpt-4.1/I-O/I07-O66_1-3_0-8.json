As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was part of the team\u2014even if today\u2019s meeting was just a routine catch-up, and they\u2019d record it for anyone who missed it. But right now, I was behind the wheel, my other job as a taxi driver demanding my full attention. The app pinged again\u2014a passenger, already waiting, sent another urgent message: \u201cPlease hurry, I can\u2019t be late!\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. If I joined the meeting, I\u2019d have to pull over, making my passenger wait even longer, risking a bad review and possibly losing future fares. But if I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d miss out on team discussions and might seem disengaged to my colleagues. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, my mind racing between the expectations of being a reliable teammate and a professional driver, both pulling me in opposite directions."}
