My manager\u2019s voice crackled through the speaker, \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s input before we finalize the plans.\u201d I knew how important this was\u2014missing my chance to speak up could mean my ideas wouldn\u2019t be considered. But outside the window, I caught sight of the crane operator swinging a heavy load across the site. My heart skipped. One of the guys, distracted, was about to walk right under it. My job as a laborer meant I was responsible for safety, for keeping everyone alert and the site accident-free. I could feel the eyes of my colleagues on the screen, waiting for my response, while outside, a split second could mean disaster. My mind raced, torn between shouting a warning and staying silent to keep my place in the meeting. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest\u2014I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demanded I act, right now."}
