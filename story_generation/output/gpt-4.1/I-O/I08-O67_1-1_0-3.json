Gauze, bandages, epinephrine\u2014each item had to be accounted for, nothing could be missing or expired. My mind was focused, running through the checklist, when I heard footsteps echoing down the quiet hallway. I glanced up and saw Mark, someone I knew from the building, walking toward me. He smiled, expecting the usual friendly nod or a quick chat. As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be approachable, to exchange a few words, maybe even a joke. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t afford distractions; every second spent away from the kit could mean missing a crucial detail, something that might matter in an emergency. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014should I pause my work and greet him, risking a lapse in my responsibilities, or keep my head down and seem cold, betraying the friendliness expected of me? Mark\u2019s footsteps slowed, and I could feel his eyes on me, waiting for my response."}
