She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning dinner and a movie at home, just the two of us. I promised her my full attention, no distractions. But as I\u2019m about to leave the shop, my phone buzzes\u2014another message from the plant. The new operator is at it again, adjusting the press settings without understanding the specs. The last time this happened, we lost a whole batch of material. My supervisor expects me to guide the team, even after hours, to prevent costly mistakes. I can already picture Mia\u2019s disappointed face if I\u2019m late or distracted, but I also know the operator is waiting for my call, and the company is counting on me. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the person I love and the job I take pride in."}
