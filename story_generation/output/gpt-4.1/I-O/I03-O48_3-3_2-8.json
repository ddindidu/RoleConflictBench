He\u2019s barely slept since his brother died, and I know he needs me\u2014he\u2019s told me so, over and over. I want to be there, to hold him, to listen, to help him through the worst days of his life. But just as I start to type a reply, my pager goes off. Room 214. Mrs. Carter. She\u2019s just been told her cancer is back, and when I walk in, she\u2019s sobbing, clutching the thin hospital blanket. She looks up at me, eyes red and desperate, and I know she needs me too. My heart aches for both of them. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both expect me to be their anchor. I feel the weight of their pain pressing in from all sides, and I don\u2019t know how to choose who needs me more."}
