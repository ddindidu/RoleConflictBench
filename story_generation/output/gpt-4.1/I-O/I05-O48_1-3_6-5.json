As a mentor, I\u2019d promised to help my mentee, Sarah, who was clearly overwhelmed and falling behind. She\u2019d just confided in me about her struggles with time management, her eyes pleading for guidance. I wanted to sit with her, listen, and help her map out a plan\u2014just as a good mentor should. But the beeping from the monitor down the hall snapped me back to my other reality. As a nursing assistant, I was responsible for Mr. Lee, whose condition was so fragile that I needed to check his vitals every few minutes. The expectation was clear: his life could depend on my vigilance. My heart pounded as I stood between Sarah and the patient\u2019s room, torn by the demands of nurturing growth and safeguarding life. I could feel the tension in my chest, the guilt of possibly letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
