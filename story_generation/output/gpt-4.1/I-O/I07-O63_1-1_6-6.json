But as I hovered over the reply button, my telemarketer side tugged at me. My break was scheduled now, and the call volume was light, so technically, I could take it whenever. Supervisors encouraged us to use this flexibility, to step away and recharge. Yet, I felt the pressure to be present for my team, to not let messages linger and risk seeming unresponsive. My mind raced: Should I quickly reply and risk eating into my break, or step away and answer later, trusting that \u201cno immediate action\u201d really meant I could wait? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, caught between being the reliable colleague and respecting my own boundaries as a telemarketer."}
