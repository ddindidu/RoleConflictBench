My girlfriend\u2019s messages flashed on the screen\u2014angry, hurt, desperate. Our argument from last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. I knew she expected me to call, to resolve things, to show her that I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I reached for my phone, a nurse knocked and ushered in my next patient\u2014a teenager with a sore throat, fever, and worried mother in tow. As a doctor, I was expected to focus, to listen carefully, to prescribe the right treatment. My mind raced between the exam room and my relationship, torn by the demands of both roles. I felt the weight of my girlfriend\u2019s pain and the responsibility for my patient\u2019s health pressing down on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my voice, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
