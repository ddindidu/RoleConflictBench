As I waited for the recipient to sign, I overheard an acquaintance, Mark, making a snide remark about our colleague, Sarah, criticizing her recent project. Mark turned to me, expecting me to join in or at least nod in agreement. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or speak negatively about others, but Mark\u2019s expectant look made it hard to stay neutral. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: a customer was anxiously tracking their grocery delivery, messaging that they needed it for dinner and couldn\u2019t afford a delay. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I stayed to handle the awkward conversation with Mark, I risked being late and letting down the customer. But if I left abruptly, I might seem rude or complicit in the gossip. My mind raced, torn between the demands of being a considerate acquaintance and a reliable delivery person, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
