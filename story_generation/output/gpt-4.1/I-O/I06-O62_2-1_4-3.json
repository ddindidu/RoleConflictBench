The technical hurdle was beyond my current skills, and I knew my mentor expected me to reach out if I hit a wall. But as I typed out a message, the whistle around my neck reminded me of my other responsibility. Glancing up, I noticed a few pool chairs out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but the facility manager had been clear: lifeguards were to keep everything orderly, no exceptions. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I left my post to fix the chairs, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and delay asking for help. If I ignored the chairs, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as a lifeguard. My mentor expected transparency and initiative; the pool expected vigilance and order. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between sending the message or tending to the chairs, feeling the stress of being pulled in two directions at once."}
