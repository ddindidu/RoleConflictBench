As an acquaintance, I always try to keep things light and avoid gossip, but Mark suddenly leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you see how badly Sarah messed up the schedule this week? She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt uncomfortable, knowing I shouldn\u2019t encourage this kind of talk, but before I could respond, I noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system making a strange noise. As a lifeguard, I\u2019m responsible for maintaining the equipment, and I knew that if the filtration system failed, it could put swimmers at risk. I felt a wave of stress\u2014Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting me to join in or at least listen, but my duty as a lifeguard demanded my immediate attention elsewhere. I stood there, torn between not wanting to seem rude or judgmental to Mark, and the urgent need to address the malfunctioning system before it became a safety hazard. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of being a supportive acquaintance and a vigilant lifeguard, unsure which role to prioritize in that moment."}
