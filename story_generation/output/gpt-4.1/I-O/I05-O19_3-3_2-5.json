My mentee, Sarah, was waiting in the break room, anxious about her residency applications. She\u2019d asked for my advice, hoping I could help her weigh the pros and cons of two very different career paths. I knew how much this meant to her\u2014she trusted me to provide the structured, thoughtful guidance she needed to make a life-changing decision. But just as I was about to join her, the pharmacy phone rang. Mrs. Patel, one of my regular patients, was at the counter. She\u2019d just been prescribed a new anticoagulant, on top of her usual cocktail of medications. I could see the worry in her eyes. She needed a thorough, careful consultation to ensure her safety\u2014anything less could put her at serious risk. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between my responsibility to guide Sarah and my duty to protect Mrs. Patel\u2019s health. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unable to let either down."}
