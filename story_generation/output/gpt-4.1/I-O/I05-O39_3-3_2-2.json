She was on the verge of accepting a job offer, desperate for my guidance. I could hear the hope in her words, the trust she placed in me to help her make this pivotal decision. I wanted to give her my full attention, to walk her through every pro and con, to be the mentor she needed at this crossroads.\n\nBut the foreman\u2019s shout cut through the air, urgent and sharp. The crane was swinging a massive steel beam into place, and I was needed\u2014now. My gloves were already on, sweat prickling at my brow. If I didn\u2019t help guide the beam, the whole crew would be delayed, and safety could be compromised.
