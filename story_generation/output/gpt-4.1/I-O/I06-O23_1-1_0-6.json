The deadline was weeks away, and she\u2019d called it \u201coptional,\u201d but I knew she expected me to be prepared for our next meeting. I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed, but the day had been long, and my mind was already stretched thin from work.\n\nAs I sipped my drink, a fellow lawyer leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re working on that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d His tone was casual, but I felt the weight of his curiosity. I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable. Still, I could sense the expectation to share just enough to seem open, to build rapport in this tight-knit circle.\n\nInside, I felt the tension coil tighter. If I brushed him off, would I seem unfriendly, missing a chance to network? If I shared even a hint, would I betray my client\u2019s trust? And all the while, the unread articles nagged at me, a silent reminder of another expectation I was struggling to meet."}
