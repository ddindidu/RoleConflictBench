He leaned in, lowering his voice, and made a snide remark about how poorly one of our colleagues had handled a recent case. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak ill of others, but Mark clearly expected me to join in, maybe even add my own opinion. Before I could respond, my radio crackled to life\u2014an urgent call: a patient with severe chest pain, likely a heart attack. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to drop everything and provide immediate care, my mind focused solely on saving a life. But Mark was still waiting for my reaction, his eyes searching my face for agreement or at least a sympathetic nod. I felt torn, caught between the pressure to maintain a respectful, positive relationship and the overwhelming responsibility to respond to a medical emergency. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
