I knew it was Mia\u2014her texts always came in quick bursts when she was upset. We\u2019d argued about money again last night, and I promised we\u2019d talk more today, but now I was stuck behind the register, the line snaking past the candy racks. The woman in front of me was red-faced, waving a receipt and demanding a refund for a toy her son broke. I forced a smile, trying to keep my voice calm and friendly, even as my mind replayed Mia\u2019s words: \u201cWe need to figure this out, or what\u2019s the point?\u201d The customer\u2019s frustration grew, and I could feel my own patience thinning, but I knew I had to stay professional. At the same time, I felt guilty for not responding to Mia, for not being the boyfriend she needed right now. My hands shook as I scanned the next item, torn between the expectation to be the perfect cashier and the pressure to fix things with Mia. I glanced at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
