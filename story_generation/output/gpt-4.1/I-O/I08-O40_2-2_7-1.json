He leaned against the workbench, glancing around before lowering his voice. \u201cDid you hear about Lisa\u2019s latest project? Total disaster. She\u2019s really slipping up lately.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I always try to avoid gossip or speaking badly about others, but Mark was waiting for a reaction, expecting me to join in. At the same time, I noticed a pile of scrap wood and nails scattered dangerously close to the walkway\u2014definitely not up to safety standards. As the carpenter on site, it\u2019s my responsibility to keep the area clean and safe, but if I started tidying up now, I\u2019d be ignoring Mark, possibly offending him or making it obvious I didn\u2019t want to engage in his conversation. I stood there, broom in hand, torn between the urge to maintain a safe workspace and the pressure to respond to Mark without betraying my values. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
