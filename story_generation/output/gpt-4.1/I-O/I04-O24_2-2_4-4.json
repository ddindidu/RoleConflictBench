The judgment was due soon, and I knew the attorneys and parties were anxiously awaiting my written decision. Every word had to be precise, every finding supported, and I could not afford to rush or be distracted. Just as I was outlining my conclusions, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my oldest friend, in a panic. He was on his way to the airport and thought he\u2019d left his passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it to me? My flight\u2019s in two hours,\u201d he pleaded. I could hear the desperation in his voice. As a friend, I wanted to drop everything and help him, just like he\u2019d done for me so many times before. But as a judge, I was expected to devote my full attention to the judgment, to be impartial and thorough, and not let personal matters interfere. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the solemn duty of my office, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
