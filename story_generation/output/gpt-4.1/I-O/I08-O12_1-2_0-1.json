The new feature was so close to being done, but the performance warnings kept popping up, and I knew my team expected nothing less than clean, efficient code. As I rounded the corner, I spotted Jamie, someone I\u2019d met at last week\u2019s office mixer. Jamie smiled, clearly expecting a friendly hello, maybe even a quick chat. I felt the weight of my other role pressing in\u2014my team was waiting, the code needed fixing, and every minute counted. But Jamie\u2019s eyes lingered, searching for that approachable, easygoing person I\u2019d been before. My mind raced, torn between the urge to keep walking, head down, and the expectation to be warm and present. The hallway felt narrower, the silence heavier, as I wrestled with the demands of being both a good acquaintance and a responsible developer, unsure which role to let down."}
