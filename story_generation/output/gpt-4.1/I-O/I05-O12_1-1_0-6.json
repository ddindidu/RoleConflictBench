She looked uncertain, holding her laptop. \u201cDo you think I should take the lead on the new module, or is it too soon?\u201d she asked. As her mentor, I knew she needed encouragement and thoughtful guidance, even for these small career steps. I wanted to give her my full attention, to help her weigh the pros and cons, to reassure her that she was ready.\n\nBut just then, a Slack notification popped up\u2014QA had flagged the minor UI glitch again. It was the same one that users could easily work around, but the expectation was clear: as a developer, I was supposed to fix bugs promptly, no matter how trivial. My mind split in two directions. Should I pause and give Sarah the guidance she sought, or should I jump on the bug and show my reliability as a developer? I could feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between being the mentor she needed and the developer my team expected."}
