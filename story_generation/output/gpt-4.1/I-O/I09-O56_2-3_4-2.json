I peeked out and saw Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, wincing as she passed by my door. I know she values peace and expects everyone to keep the shared spaces quiet, especially since her husband works night shifts. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014my dog\u2019s barking must be a real nuisance. But before I could calm him down, the bell chimed. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids had arrived, all nerves and excitement, even earlier than expected. As their hairdresser, I\u2019m supposed to greet them warmly, put them at ease, and start their appointments right away. But I could still hear my dog\u2019s anxious yelps echoing in the hallway, and I imagined Mrs. Kim\u2019s patience wearing thin. I stood frozen, torn between rushing to soothe my neighbor\u2019s frustration and fulfilling my duty to welcome my clients with a smile. My heart pounded as I weighed whose expectations I should meet first."}
