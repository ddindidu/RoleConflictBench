The crane operator\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my signal, and the whole crew was poised, ready to secure the load. But I knew that buzz meant another email from my office team\u2014they\u2019d been waiting all morning for my clarification on the project plan, and without my response, the whole workflow was stalled. I could almost picture my colleagues glancing at their screens, growing impatient, maybe even frustrated, as the minutes ticked by. My hands were already gloved, slick with sweat and dust, and the beam above me swayed slightly, demanding my full attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urgent, physical demand to keep my crew safe and the silent, digital expectation to keep my team moving. My heart pounded as I stood between the steel and the screen, torn by the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
