It\u2019s Saturday afternoon, the last weekend before my girlfriend leaves for her new job in London. She\u2019s been talking about how much she\u2019ll miss me, how she wants to make every moment count before she goes. I promised her a special evening\u2014just us, no distractions. But as I\u2019m about to leave the salon, my last client walks in, hair damp and sticking to her forehead from a workout. She\u2019s in a rush, asking if I can skip the wash and just trim her ends. I know the rules: every client gets a wash, especially when their hair is sweaty. It\u2019s about hygiene, professionalism, and the reputation of the salon. But if I insist on the wash, I\u2019ll be late for my girlfriend, who\u2019s waiting for me with dinner and candles. If I skip it, I risk my job and my standards. My phone buzzes with a message from her: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I stare at the client, my hands trembling, torn between the man she needs and the professional I\u2019m supposed to be."}
