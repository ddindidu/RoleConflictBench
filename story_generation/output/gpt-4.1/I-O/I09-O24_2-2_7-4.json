The trial I just concluded was complex, and my judgment must be thorough\u2014every fact, every nuance weighed and articulated. The court expects clarity and precision, and I know the attorneys are waiting for my decision. Yet, as the storm advisory flashes on my phone, I remember Mrs. Kim down the hall. She\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and last winter, she lost power for two days. I know she relies on neighbors for small things\u2014receiving packages, checking in when the weather turns bad.

My mind races with arguments and legal standards, but my heart aches with worry for Mrs. Kim. I sit, torn, the storm clouds gathering outside and inside, unsure which expectation I can afford to let down."}
