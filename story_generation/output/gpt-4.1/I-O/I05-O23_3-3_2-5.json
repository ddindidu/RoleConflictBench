As a mentor, I knew my mentee was waiting anxiously for my guidance\u2014she was on the verge of accepting a job offer that could define her career. She needed me to walk her through the pros and cons, to help her see beyond the salary and title, to consider the long-term impact. She trusted me to be present, thoughtful, and thorough.\n\nBut as a lawyer, my phone buzzed with reminders: the jury trial was starting tomorrow. Months of preparation had led to this moment, and my client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014hung in the balance. There was no room for error, no possibility of rescheduling. My client expected my undivided attention, my sharpest arguments, my full commitment in the courtroom.\n\nI stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the mentee who needed my wisdom and the client who needed my advocacy. Both counted on me, both deserved my best. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give everything to both."}
