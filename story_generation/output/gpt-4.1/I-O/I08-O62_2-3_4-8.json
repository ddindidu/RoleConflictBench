She\u2019d asked if I could help carry a few boxes up the stairs, and I\u2019d agreed, knowing how stressful moving can be. As we hauled a heavy box together, I heard a commotion from the pool area below. Glancing over the railing, I spotted a child flailing in the deep end\u2014right where swimming was strictly off-limits. As a lifeguard, I knew I was responsible for enforcing the rules and ensuring everyone\u2019s safety, even when I wasn\u2019t officially on duty. Jamie, sweating and anxious, looked at me expectantly, clearly needing my help to finish before her moving truck arrived. My mind raced, torn between the obligation to support Jamie as a friend and the urgent duty to intervene at the pool. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment Jamie might feel if I abandoned her mid-move against the risk to the child\u2019s safety if I didn\u2019t act immediately."}
