She\u2019d suggested a few articles to read\u2014nothing urgent, just \u201cwhenever you have time.\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get to them, wanting to show her I was committed and eager to learn. But now, the blinking light on my phone signaled another call. I took a breath and answered, only to be met with a barrage of frustration from a long-time customer. He questioned every detail of the offer, his voice rising with each objection. My manager expected me to stay calm, provide thorough explanations, and not let a single customer slip away. As I tried to soothe him, my mind drifted guiltily to the unread articles. I wanted to impress my mentor, to be the kind of mentee who went above and beyond. But right now, all my energy was spent handling objections, my patience stretched thin. I felt torn, pulled between the desire to grow and the immediate demand to perform, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
