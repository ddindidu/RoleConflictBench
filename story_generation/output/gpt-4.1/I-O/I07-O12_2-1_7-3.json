But at the same time, a calendar invite from Product blinked at me\u2014a brainstorming session for next sprint\u2019s features. Attendance was marked as optional, but I knew from experience that my input as a developer was valued, and skipping it might mean missing a chance to shape the project\u2019s direction.\n\nI stared at the two windows on my screen, feeling the tension coil in my chest. If I dove into the emails now, I\u2019d have to miss the start of the brainstorming, maybe lose my chance to influence the new features. But if I joined the session, the team would be left waiting, frustrated, maybe even stalled for the rest of the afternoon.
