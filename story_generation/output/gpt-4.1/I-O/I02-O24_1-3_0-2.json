She offers a small smile, but I can tell something\u2019s off. As her boyfriend, I want to sit beside her, listen, and help her unwind from whatever weighed on her at work. I start to ask, \u201cRough day?\u201d but my phone buzzes\u2014an urgent message from the court clerk. An emergency motion for a restraining order has just landed on my desk. I\u2019m expected, as a judge, to review the case files immediately and make a ruling within the hour. The law demands my full attention; someone\u2019s safety could depend on my decision. But Maya\u2019s eyes meet mine, silently asking for comfort. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the duty to the court and the need to be present for the woman I love. I can\u2019t be both at once, and the weight of both expectations presses down on me, leaving me frozen, unable to move in either direction."}
