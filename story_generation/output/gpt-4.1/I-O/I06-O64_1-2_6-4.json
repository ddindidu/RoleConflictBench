My mentor\u2019s office hours were almost over, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make it this week. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to show up, to respect her time, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down again. But just as I was about to call for my break, a customer approached, clutching a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she said, but when I asked for a receipt, she shook her head. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had drilled it into us: no exceptions. The customer\u2019s voice grew louder, drawing the attention of people in line. I could feel my phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my mentor\u2019s office hours. I was torn, caught between the expectation to uphold store rules and the pressure to respect my mentor\u2019s time. My hands trembled as I weighed the consequences, feeling the stress of being pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both demands at once."}
