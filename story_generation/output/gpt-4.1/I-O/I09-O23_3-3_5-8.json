The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be understanding\u2014she\u2019s elderly, and her son is away. I should gently remind her, maybe even help her move the boxes. But as I\u2019m about to knock, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s an email from opposing counsel, pressing me for details about my client\u2019s finances\u2014details I can\u2019t ethically share. The pressure is intense; if I don\u2019t respond soon, my client\u2019s case could be jeopardized. I feel torn, standing in the hallway, phone in hand. On one side, I\u2019m expected to be a considerate neighbor, looking out for everyone\u2019s safety and Mrs. Patel\u2019s feelings. On the other, I\u2019m a lawyer, bound by confidentiality and the weight of my client\u2019s trust. My heart pounds as I weigh which role to answer first, feeling the demands of both worlds closing in."}
