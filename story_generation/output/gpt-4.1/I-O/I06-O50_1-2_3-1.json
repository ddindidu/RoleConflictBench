It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she expected me to reach out, to show engagement and initiative. At the same time, the plant manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need that unit back up, now.\u201d The main production line had been down for half an hour, and the sensor errors kept coming back no matter what I tried. Every minute the machine sat idle, the pressure mounted. I could almost feel the weight of lost production time pressing on my shoulders. My mind raced\u2014should I pause to send my mentor a quick message, fulfilling her expectation, or focus every second on the stubborn machine, as the team needed? I felt torn, caught between wanting to be the attentive mentee and the reliable repairer, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
