The deadline for my part of the project was looming, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t finish by noon, the next person in the chain would be stuck waiting, their own work delayed. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCheck pool area for safety.\u201d As the designated lifeguard for the morning, I was also responsible for making sure everything around the pool was in order. I glanced out the window and noticed a few pool chairs were out of line\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to standard either.\n\nMy colleague\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hold us up, I need your numbers to finish my section.\u201d At the same time, I remembered the supervisor\u2019s words: \u201cWe expect the pool area to be tidy and safe at all times.\u201d I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the urgent need to finish my work and the responsibility to maintain the pool. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which role to prioritize."}
