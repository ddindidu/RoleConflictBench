Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke at lunch, and now I\u2019d learned from a mutual friend that it had really hurt Jamie. As a friend, I knew I should call Jamie immediately, apologize, and try to fix things before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, my eyes landed on the thick new issue of the Law Review on my desk. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay current, and this issue was packed with articles on emerging legal theories\u2014exactly the kind of material I needed to read before tomorrow\u2019s hearing. My mind raced: Jamie deserved my attention, but so did my duty to the law and the people who rely on my judgments. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, as I weighed the demands of friendship against the unyielding expectations of my profession."}
