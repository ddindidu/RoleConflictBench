My colleague had already messaged twice, reminding me that my part was the linchpin for the next phase. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I missed the deadline, the whole project would stall, and I\u2019d let everyone down. Just as I was about to hit send, a sudden commotion caught my eye. In the deep end, where swimming was strictly off-limits for kids, a small child flailed, barely keeping their head above water. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every life in that pool, and I knew the rules were there for a reason. But if I left my post to intervene, I\u2019d miss the deadline and disrupt my team\u2019s workflow. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job as a colleague and my duty as a lifeguard, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions."}
