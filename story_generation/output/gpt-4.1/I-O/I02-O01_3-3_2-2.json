My partner lay curled up beside me, her eyes red and swollen from crying. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. But the hospital project was at a critical stage. The city inspector was arriving in two hours, and I was the only one who could walk the team through the final safety checks. If I missed something, lives could be at risk. If I left her now, I\u2019d be abandoning her in her darkest moment. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: the expectation to be her anchor, and the responsibility to ensure the hospital was safe for thousands. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the person I loved and the duty I owed to strangers I\u2019d never meet."}
