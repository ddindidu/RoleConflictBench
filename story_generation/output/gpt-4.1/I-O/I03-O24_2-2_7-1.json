Tomorrow\u2019s trial is complicated, and the final briefs are dense, demanding my full attention. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019ve argued all week about money, and I know he\u2019s waiting for me to reach out, to try and fix things. As his girlfriend, I\u2019m supposed to help us resolve conflicts, not let them fester. But as a judge, I can\u2019t afford distractions; I\u2019m expected to be impartial, prepared, and thorough. My mind keeps drifting from legal arguments to the memory of Alex\u2019s frustrated voice. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give. I stare at the unread message, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my relationship and the responsibility to my courtroom."}
