My partner\u2019s voice trembled through the line, grief raw and heavy. He needed me\u2014needed my arms, my words, my presence. I wanted nothing more than to rush to him, to hold him and let him cry. But I was still in my cleaning uniform, the scent of bleach clinging to my skin. My supervisor had just reminded us about the new hygiene protocols: gloves on, hands washed, no exceptions. I\u2019d slipped up earlier, forgetting gloves while scrubbing a bathroom. Now, guilt gnawed at me. What if I carried something home? What if, in comforting him, I put him at risk? My heart ached to be the girlfriend he needed, but my mind replayed the rules drilled into me at work. I stared at my gloved hands, torn between the urge to run to him and the fear of bringing harm. The weight of both roles pressed down, and I stood frozen, caught between love and responsibility."}
