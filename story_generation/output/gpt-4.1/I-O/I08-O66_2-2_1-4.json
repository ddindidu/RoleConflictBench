She was a friend of a friend, someone I\u2019d just met at the gathering tonight. She looked nervous, her hands twisting in her lap, eyes darting to the window as rain streaked down the glass. I wanted to put her at ease, maybe crack a joke or ask about her interests, just as any friendly acquaintance would. But the rain was coming down harder now, and the city traffic was a mess\u2014cars weaving unpredictably, brake lights flaring. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to keep my focus sharp, hands steady on the wheel, eyes scanning for sudden stops or reckless drivers. I felt the pressure mounting: the urge to be warm and welcoming, to help her relax, clashed with the demand to stay vigilant and silent, every nerve tuned to the road. My mind raced, torn between the comfort I wanted to offer and the safety I needed to ensure, caught in the tension of two roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
