I wrapped it carefully, hoping to make a good impression. As I stepped out, I saw Mrs. Kim from next door heading to her car. I smiled, cake in hand, ready to introduce myself and offer a slice. But my phone buzzed\u2014my taxi app had matched me with a passenger, and I was already running late. The rain was coming down hard, and I knew the roads would be slick, with impatient drivers weaving between lanes. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be on time, drive safely, and follow every traffic rule, especially in weather like this.
