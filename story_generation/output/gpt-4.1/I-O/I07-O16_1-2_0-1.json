My team\u2019s weekly meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show my support. The agenda was light, mostly routine check-ins, and I knew the meeting would be recorded for anyone who missed it. Still, I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t show up, the unspoken expectation that I be present and engaged.\n\nBut just as I was about to log in, a nurse knocked on my office door. A patient had arrived with a puzzling set of symptoms\u2014nothing fit neatly into a diagnosis. As a doctor, I was expected to give my full attention, to listen, examine, and piece together the clues. The stakes were high; a missed detail could mean a missed diagnosis.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two sets of eyes\u2014my colleagues and my patient\u2014each expecting me to be fully present for them. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of routine and the urgency of the unknown, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
