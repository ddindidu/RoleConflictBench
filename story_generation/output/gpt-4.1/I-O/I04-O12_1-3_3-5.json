The launch date for our new feature was moved up, and everyone\u2019s waiting on me to finalize the API specs. I can already picture the Slack messages piling up, the anxious faces in the meeting, the pressure to keep things moving. But the text on my screen isn\u2019t from work\u2014it\u2019s from Jamie. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I know Jamie\u2019s been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there if they needed anything. I glance at the clock. If I help Jamie now, I\u2019ll keep the whole project team waiting, maybe even delay the launch. But if I ignore Jamie, I\u2019ll be letting down a friend who\u2019s counting on me. My stomach knots as I stare at the two notifications, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding I choose them first."}
