It was Sam, my oldest friend, his name flashing with a desperate \u201cCan you call me? Furniture emergency!\u201d I glanced at the contract on my screen. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014plenty of time before the deadline\u2014but I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get ahead on work today. Still, I could picture Sam surrounded by a jumble of boards and screws, frustration mounting. He\u2019d helped me move last year, no questions asked. As a friend, I wanted to be there for him, to offer the quick support he needed. But as a lawyer, I felt the weight of my professional standards, the need to stay disciplined and focused, to not let personal matters chip away at my work ethic.
