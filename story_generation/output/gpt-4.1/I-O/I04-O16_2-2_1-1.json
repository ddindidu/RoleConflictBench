The symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern, and I was determined to find the answer. But when I glanced at the screen, I saw it was my friend, Sarah. Her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment\u2014she needed to talk about a fight with her partner. I could hear the tears she was holding back, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her, to offer comfort and understanding. At the same time, I felt the weight of my white coat\u2014the responsibility to focus, to piece together the clues for my patient who was waiting anxiously for answers. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed my empathy and the patient who needed my expertise. I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
