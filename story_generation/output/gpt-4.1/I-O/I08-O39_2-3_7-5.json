He leaned in, lowering his voice, and said, \u201cDid you see how sloppy Dave\u2019s work was on the scaffolding this morning? Guy\u2019s going to get someone hurt.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort; I never liked talking behind someone\u2019s back, and I knew the right thing was to steer the conversation away from gossip. But before I could respond, I caught sight of Dave himself, distracted and heading straight toward a crane lifting a heavy load overhead. My training as a construction laborer kicked in\u2014safety always comes first, and I\u2019m expected to act immediately to prevent accidents. But if I shouted now, I\u2019d draw attention to Dave, possibly embarrassing him in front of Mark, who already had a negative opinion. My mind raced, torn between not fueling gossip and my duty to keep the site safe. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between the expectations of being a considerate acquaintance and a responsible laborer."}
