I baked a small cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. As I stepped into the hallway, cake in hand, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly, and I felt the pressure to be friendly and polite, just as a good neighbor should. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. I was still in my taxi uniform, and I knew I had to keep my cab spotless for the next passenger. The thought of carrying a cake, possibly getting crumbs or frosting on my uniform or in the car, made me anxious. I wanted to be the welcoming neighbor, but I also couldn\u2019t risk compromising the cleanliness and professionalism expected of me as a taxi driver. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between knocking on Mrs. Kim\u2019s door with the cake or rushing to my cab to meet the next client, wrestling with the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
