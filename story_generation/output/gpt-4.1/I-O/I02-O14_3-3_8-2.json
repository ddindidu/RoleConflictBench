The rare atmospheric window I\u2019d been waiting months for had finally arrived\u2014if I missed this chance, my entire research project could collapse, and with it, my shot at the next round of funding. But across from me, my girlfriend\u2019s eyes were red, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cAre we even working anymore?\u201d Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. I knew she needed me to be present, to help us talk through the pain and confusion, to show her that I cared enough to fight for us.
