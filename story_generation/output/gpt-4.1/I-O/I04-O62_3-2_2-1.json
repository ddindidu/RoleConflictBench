I answered, whispering, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Her voice was shaky, barely holding together. \u201cCan you talk? I just\u2026 I really need you right now.\u201d She was crying, and I could hear the pain in every word. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and comfort her like I always did. But as I tried to focus on her, my eyes kept darting back to the pool. The late-night swim was busy, and I spotted a swimmer in the middle, their strokes growing uneven. My training screamed at me to watch every move, to be ready to jump in at any second. My friend\u2019s sobs pulled at my heart, but the pool demanded my full attention. I gripped the phone tighter, torn between being the friend she needed and the lifeguard everyone depended on. My mind raced, caught between the desperate voice in my ear and the struggling swimmer in the water, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me at the same time."}
