As a mentee, I know I\u2019m supposed to reach out to Dr. Lee whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in a research article\u2014nothing urgent, but the expectation is clear: communicate promptly. I draft a quick message, but before I can hit send, my pager vibrates. Room 312. Mrs. Patel, newly diagnosed with diabetes, is waiting with her daughter. I step in, and their anxious eyes meet mine. As a doctor, I\u2019m expected to explain everything with patience and empathy, to answer every question, to be fully present. But my mind keeps drifting back to the unfinished message to my mentor. If I wait, am I failing as a mentee? If I send it now, am I shortchanging my patient? The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
