Can we talk?\u201d I\u2019d noticed her slipping deadlines, her voice tight with stress during our last check-in. As her mentor, I wanted to help her untangle her schedule, to encourage her to find balance and confidence. But right now, I was behind the wheel, snow swirling outside, the city crawling under a heavy winter storm. My passenger in the back seat kept checking his watch, anxiety radiating from him. \u201cI can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he said, voice urgent. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him to the airport safely and on time, despite the treacherous roads. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one part wanting to pull over and call my mentee, to be the support she needed, the other focused on navigating icy streets and tense traffic, responsible for my passenger\u2019s journey. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
