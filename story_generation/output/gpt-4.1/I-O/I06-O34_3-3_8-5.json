My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a long flight. I knew how precious her time was, and I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her effort. My phone buzzed with the meeting link, and I took a deep breath, ready to focus.\n\nBut then, my radio crackled. \u201cTower, this is Delta 482, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart lurched. As an air traffic controller, I knew every second counted. The pilot\u2019s voice was tense, and I could picture the aircraft, circling, burning what little fuel remained. My training screamed at me to respond, to guide them safely in.\n\nI stared at the screen, my mentor\u2019s face appearing, expectant and kind. I felt the weight of her time, her willingness to help me grow. But the radio was alive with urgency, demanding my full attention. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my mentor and the responsibility I owed to the pilot in distress. My hands hovered, uncertain, as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
