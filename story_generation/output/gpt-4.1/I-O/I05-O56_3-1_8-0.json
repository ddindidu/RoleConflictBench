Can you talk?\u201d I knew how much this project meant to her\u2014her whole future seemed to hinge on it. As her mentor, I wanted to be there, to offer the right words, to help her believe in herself. But just as I was about to step into the back room for a quick call, the bell above the salon door jingled. Mrs. Carter, my regular, walked in, her face lighting up when she saw me. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here!\u201d she exclaimed, settling into the waiting area. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Carter always expected a warm, personal greeting from me. I could feel her eyes on me, waiting for that familiar welcome.
