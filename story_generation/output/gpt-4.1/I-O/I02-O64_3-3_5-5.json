It\u2019s the last weekend before Mia leaves for her internship in London, and we promised to spend every minute together. She\u2019s waiting at our favorite caf\u00e9, texting me updates about the sunset, her excitement tinged with sadness. But the store is packed, and as the shift ends, my manager reminds me of the new policy: every large cash deposit must be double-checked, logged, and signed off before anyone leaves. No shortcuts, no exceptions. I know if I rush, I could make a mistake and risk my job. But if I stay, I\u2019ll miss the last hours with Mia before she\u2019s gone for months. My phone buzzes again\u2014her name lighting up the screen. I feel torn in two, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. I want to be the reliable employee my boss expects, but I also want to be the boyfriend Mia needs right now. My hands tremble as I count the bills, my mind racing, caught between duty and love, not knowing which role to let down."}
