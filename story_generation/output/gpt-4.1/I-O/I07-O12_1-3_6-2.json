That\u2019s what good colleagues do\u2014stay responsive, keep the team looped in. But my IDE is open on the other screen, and the profiler\u2019s red flags are screaming at me. The service is buckling under load, and the traces point straight to the functions I merged yesterday. My mind races with possible fixes, refactoring strategies, and the pressure to deliver code that won\u2019t let the team down. Every second I spend not coding feels like a betrayal of my responsibility as a developer. Yet, ignoring Sarah\u2019s message nags at me, too\u2014what if she thinks I\u2019m unreliable or unapproachable? My fingers hover between the email tab and the code editor, heart pounding, torn between being the responsive colleague and the diligent developer."}
