I need it before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation.\u201d My heart thudded. I\u2019d promised to be a reliable mentee, always meeting deadlines and showing initiative. But my IDE blinked with lines of code from the new module I\u2019d started this morning. As a developer, I prided myself on writing clean, maintainable code, and with the generous deadline, I\u2019d planned to refactor and polish this module while my ideas were fresh.\n\nNow, the mentor\u2019s urgent task loomed over me. If I dropped everything to finish the documentation, I\u2019d lose my momentum and risk forgetting the elegant solution I\u2019d just mapped out. But if I kept coding, I\u2019d let my mentor down, maybe even jeopardize tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. My mind raced, torn between the immediate responsibility to my mentor and my commitment to quality in my development work. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed the expectations, feeling the tug of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at once."}
