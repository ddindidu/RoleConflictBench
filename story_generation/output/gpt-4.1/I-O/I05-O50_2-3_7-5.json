She looked at me, eyes wide with hope, hanging on my every word. I could see her confidence growing, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as her mentor\u2014to help her realize her potential, to be present and supportive. Just as she began rehearsing her pitch, a piercing screech echoed from the production floor. My heart sank. That sound meant the main conveyor\u2019s bearing was about to seize. If I didn\u2019t act fast, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours of downtime and thousands in lost output. I glanced at Maya, who was waiting for my next suggestion, and then at the door, where the plant manager was already waving frantically for me. I felt torn in two\u2014my mentee needed my undivided attention, but the machines demanded my immediate expertise. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, caught between nurturing a career and preventing a disaster."}
