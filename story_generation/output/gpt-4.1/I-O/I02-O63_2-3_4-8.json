She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning our favorite takeout and a movie. I promised her my undivided attention, no distractions. But as I set my phone to silent, a notification pops up: a reminder from work. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m required to log every break, every minute accounted for. The compliance system is ruthless\u2014one unscheduled absence, even for a few minutes, and I risk a warning or worse. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions, not even for emergencies.\u201d I glance at Mia, her eyes bright with anticipation, and then at my phone, the pressure mounting. I want to be present for her, to make this night special, but the fear of disciplinary action gnaws at me. My heart pounds as I weigh the risk of stepping away from work protocols against the promise I made to Mia. The clock ticks, and I feel trapped between the demands of my job and the expectations of someone I love, unsure which role to honor as the evening unfolds."}
