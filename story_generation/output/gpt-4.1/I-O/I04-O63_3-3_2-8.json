It was Mia, my best friend, her name glowing on the screen. I answered, and her sobs filled my ear\u2014her father had just been rushed to the hospital. She needed me to listen, to be there, to help her hold together the pieces. I sat up, heart pounding, whispering comfort, trying to be the friend she needed.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, dread crept in. My telemarketing shift started at 2:30 a.m. sharp. The compliance system at work was ruthless; even a minute late or an unscheduled break meant a red flag, a possible write-up, maybe even losing my job. I was expected to log in, headset on, ready to pitch insurance to strangers, no excuses.\n\nMia\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cPlease, just stay with me a little longer.\u201d My laptop blinked, reminding me of the looming start time.
