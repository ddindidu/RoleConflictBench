The line stretches back to the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s Jamie. We were supposed to meet after my shift, but she\u2019s been texting, clearly confused about where we\u2019re meeting. She\u2019s my best friend, and we promised to be honest and clear with each other, especially after last week\u2019s misunderstanding. I want to grab my phone, send a quick message, and clear things up before she gets upset or lost. But the next customer is already unloading their cart, looking at me expectantly. I can\u2019t just stop and text; I\u2019m supposed to be friendly, focused, and efficient. My heart pounds as I try to keep my smile steady, torn between being the reliable friend Jamie needs and the attentive cashier my customers expect. The phone vibrates again, and I feel the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
