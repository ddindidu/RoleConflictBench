The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I knew the lobby meeting would be tense. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, to help ease the tension, maybe even mediate if things got heated. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the hospital. Mrs. Lee, my patient, was anxious after her surgery and needed someone to sit with her. As a nursing assistant, I was supposed to be there, offering comfort and reassurance, not just medical care. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. My neighbors expected me to be present, calm, and courteous, but Mrs. Lee needed me too, in a way that felt more urgent and personal. My heart raced as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of community and compassion, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
