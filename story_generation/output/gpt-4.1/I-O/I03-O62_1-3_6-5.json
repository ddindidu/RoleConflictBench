He was upset that I\u2019d forgotten our brunch plans for Saturday, and I could feel the tension rising between us. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him right away, talk it through, and smooth things over before the misunderstanding grew into something bigger. But just as I was about to dial, I noticed the pool\u2019s water looked cloudy\u2014too cloudy. My heart sank. As a lifeguard, I\u2019m responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and a malfunctioning filtration system could put swimmers at risk. I checked the control panel and confirmed my fear: the system was down. I needed to act fast, report it, and start the maintenance protocol. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from him, more frustrated this time. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I put my relationship first and resolve things with him, or focus on the urgent safety issue at work? My hands shook as I stood there, caught between the demands of being a good girlfriend and a responsible lifeguard, not sure which to choose."}
