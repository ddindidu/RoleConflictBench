On the other end was my closest friend, her voice trembling, words tumbling out between sobs about her father\u2019s sudden collapse. She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to hold her together as her world fell apart. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to offer comfort, but my mind was already tangled in another crisis. Just hours earlier, I\u2019d left the hospital after seeing a patient whose symptoms defied every diagnosis I could think of. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d review their chart again tonight, desperate to find the missing link before morning rounds. Now, as my friend\u2019s pain poured through the phone, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. She expected me to be present, to listen, to care. My patient depended on my focus, my expertise, my undivided attention. I could feel myself splitting, torn between the friend she needed and the doctor I was supposed to be. My hands shook as I tried to decide which part of me to give, knowing that either way, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
