In ten minutes, our weekly team meeting would start\u2014a routine catch-up where my manager expected everyone to show up and contribute. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged to my colleagues. At the same time, I had registered for a national continuing education webinar, scheduled at exactly the same time. As a pharmacist, staying updated is not just a personal goal but a professional necessity; missing this session meant falling behind on the latest treatment protocols and risking my licensure requirements. My inbox pinged with a reminder from HR about the importance of team participation, while another notification popped up from the pharmacy board about the critical nature of this education program. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations\u2014my team counting on my presence, my profession demanding my growth. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which demand to honor."}
