My mentor had squeezed in a ten-minute meeting for me\u2014just ten minutes in her packed schedule. I\u2019d promised to be there, to respect her time, to show I valued her guidance. But here I was, behind the counter, scanning groceries for the handful of customers who\u2019d trickled in during this slow afternoon. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, the line inching forward at a pace that mocked my anxiety. I knew the store manager expected every transaction to be perfect\u2014no mistakes, no shortcuts. My hands trembled as I bagged a loaf of bread, my mind split between the register and the meeting I was about to miss. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the mentee desperate not to disappoint, the cashier determined not to slip up. The minutes ticked by, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
