She was counting on me to keep an eye on her apartment while she was away, especially with the planned power outage. She\u2019d asked if I could receive a package for her today\u2014one she said was important and would arrive \u201csometime in the afternoon.\u201d I promised I\u2019d help, as neighbors do. But now, as I sat behind the wheel of my taxi, a passenger slid into the back seat, breathless and anxious. \u201cPlease, I have to catch the 3:15 train. Can you get me to the station in time?\u201d he pleaded. I checked the time: 2:30. The station was across town, traffic unpredictable. My mind raced. If I left now, I might miss the delivery for Mrs. Lee. If I waited, my passenger would miss his train. Both were counting on me, both expecting reliability. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between being the dependable neighbor and the trustworthy driver, feeling the weight of both promises pressing in on me."}
