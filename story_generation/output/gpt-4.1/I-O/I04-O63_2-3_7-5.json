His reply was curt, almost cold\u2014he\u2019d clearly misread my last text. My stomach twisted. I knew I had to call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: talk things out, make sure nothing festers. But as I reached for my phone, my manager\u2019s voice echoed from the morning meeting\u2014today was the last day of the quarter, and we were just shy of our sales target. Every call counted. If I didn\u2019t keep dialing, I\u2019d let my team down, maybe lose my bonus, maybe even face a penalty. My headset felt heavier than usual. I stared at Sam\u2019s name on my screen, thumb hovering over \u201ccall,\u201d while the auto-dialer blinked on my computer, ready for the next sales pitch. My heart pounded, torn between the friend who needed me and the job that demanded everything I had."}
