My headset feels heavier with every call, the manager\u2019s reminders echoing in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers, don\u2019t let us down.\u201d I dial the next number, rehearsing my pitch, when a flash of lightning illuminates the window. The storm advisory had warned of possible power outages tonight. My thoughts drift to Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lives alone down the hall. She\u2019d asked me once to check in if anything happened during bad weather. I know she relies on neighbors for small things\u2014receiving packages, a quick hello, or just knowing someone\u2019s nearby. But if I leave my desk now, I\u2019ll miss precious minutes, maybe lose my chance to hit my target and keep my job secure. My phone rings again, but my eyes linger on the hallway, torn between the pressure to perform at work and the quiet responsibility I feel toward Mrs. Lee. The storm outside grows louder, matching the turmoil inside me as I weigh which role I can afford to let down."}
