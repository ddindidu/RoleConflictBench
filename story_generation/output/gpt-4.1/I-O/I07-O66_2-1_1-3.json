As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to hear the project updates that wouldn\u2019t be repeated. Missing it meant missing out, maybe even letting the team down. But right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the back seat, watching the meter tick. As a taxi driver, I owed it to my passenger to get them to their destination safely, following every traffic law, driving defensively, no matter how empty the roads looked. My mind raced with the pressure\u2014should I try to make the meeting on my phone while driving, risking distraction? Or do I focus on the road, knowing I\u2019ll miss crucial information? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I approached the next green light, torn between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
