The spreadsheet for work was due next week, but I liked to stay ahead, and my manager always praised my reliability. The pool was quiet, just a few regulars doing slow laps. I glanced up every few seconds, scanning the water, but my mind kept drifting back to the numbers on the screen.

As a lifeguard, I was supposed to watch the water without distraction, ready to act in an instant. But the spreadsheet deadline echoed in my mind\u2014my team counted on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.
