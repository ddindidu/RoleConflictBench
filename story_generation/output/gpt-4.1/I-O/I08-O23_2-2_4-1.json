I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d say yes, just like I had when we were younger. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to be supportive, to show up and lend a hand, especially since he didn\u2019t have many friends in the city.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a reminder: the purchase agreement for a client needed my review before Monday\u2019s filing deadline. As a lawyer, I knew the stakes\u2014missing a detail or a deadline could cost my client dearly, and my reputation was on the line. The document was dense, and I\u2019d need hours of focused analysis.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I helped Mark, I\u2019d be pressed for time, risking mistakes in my legal work. If I declined, I\u2019d let down someone who counted on me. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding more than I felt able to give. I sat there, torn, unable to decide which expectation to meet."}
