We\u2019ve been fighting all week about money\u2014she wants us to start saving for a trip, but I barely make enough as a lifeguard to cover my share of the rent. I know she expects me to talk things through, to fix this tension between us, but every time I try, I just end up making it worse.\n\nA group of kids giggles as they slip into the shallow end, no adult in sight. I\u2019m supposed to be strict about the rules\u2014no unsupervised swimmers, ever. My supervisor made it clear: one slip-up, and I\u2019m out. But my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s Emily, probably wanting to talk, to resolve things before her shift starts. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014her need for reassurance, my duty to keep these kids safe. My heart pounds as I look from the phone to the pool, torn between the person I love and the job I can\u2019t afford to lose."}
