It was 2:13 a.m. I squinted at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name glowed. I answered, and immediately heard sobs. She could barely speak, but I caught enough: her father had collapsed, and she was terrified. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to find the right words, to be the steady presence she needed. But as I listened, my work phone rang. I\u2019d forgotten about the late shift, covering for a sick coworker. The caller ID flashed: Mr. Jenkins, a notoriously difficult customer. I hesitated, torn. If I ignored him, I\u2019d risk a formal complaint and maybe my job. If I answered, I\u2019d have to switch gears, mask my worry, and handle his barrage of questions about our latest offer\u2014he\u2019d want details, reassurances, patience. My friend\u2019s sobs grew louder in my ear. I felt split in two, the weight of her pain and his demands pressing on me, each expecting my full attention, my empathy, my professionalism. My hands shook as I stared at both phones, caught between being the friend she needed and the employee my boss expected."}
