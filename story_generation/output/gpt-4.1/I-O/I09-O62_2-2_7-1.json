I glanced at Mrs. Lee\u2019s door across the hall, remembering how she\u2019d mentioned her son was out of town. As her neighbor, I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I check in, make sure she had candles and water, maybe offer to stay nearby in case the power went out? But at that moment, a sharp whistle cut through the humid air of the pool. My eyes snapped back to the water, where a teenager was flailing, clearly struggling to stay afloat. As a lifeguard, I knew I couldn\u2019t look away, not even for a second. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou\u2019re the line between safety and disaster.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014Mrs. Lee\u2019s vulnerability in the storm, the swimmer\u2019s immediate danger. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
