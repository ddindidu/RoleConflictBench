She\u2019d carved out just fifteen minutes for me today, a rare window in her packed schedule. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that respecting her time was part of being a good mentee. I\u2019d rehearsed my questions, determined not to waste a second.\n\nJust as I was about to leave my workshop, a customer rushed in, her little boy clutching a splintered wooden train. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d she asked, her eyes hopeful. The boy\u2019s lip trembled as he held out the broken toy. I knew I should examine the damage, estimate the cost, and reassure them\u2014my reputation as a reliable carpenter depended on it.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk being late for my mentor, maybe even missing the meeting altogether. If I left, I\u2019d disappoint a child and possibly lose a customer. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of two worlds, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
