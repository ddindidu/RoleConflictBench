My passenger, a young woman with anxious eyes, clutched her phone, checking the time every few seconds. She was my mentee, and today, she was flying out for a final interview that could launch her career. I\u2019d spent weeks helping her prepare, guiding her through every scenario, every question, every doubt. Now, as her taxi driver, I was expected to get her to the airport safely and on time. But the roads were slick, traffic crawling, and the radio warned of worsening conditions. She looked at me, desperate for reassurance, for the mentor who always had answers. But as a driver, I knew the risks of rushing. My mind raced\u2014should I push the limits to get her there, risking our safety, or drive cautiously and risk her missing the opportunity of a lifetime? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I might not be able to give."}
