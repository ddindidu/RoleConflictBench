Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just across the hall. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, maybe even need help if the power went out. As her neighbor, I felt responsible\u2014she always trusted me to check in, and I\u2019d promised to help if she ever needed anything. But my headset buzzed, and the sales dashboard on my laptop showed I was close to smashing my weekly quota. Management had been clear: keep calling, keep selling, don\u2019t let up, especially when you\u2019re on a roll. Every minute away from my desk could mean lost commissions and disappointed supervisors. I glanced at the clock, torn. Should I knock on Mrs. Lee\u2019s door and make sure she\u2019s okay, risking my momentum and maybe my numbers? Or do I keep dialing, telling myself she\u2019ll be fine, even as guilt gnaws at me? The storm outside seemed to echo the one inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction."}
