My boyfriend and I had circled this evening on the calendar weeks ago, the only open slot before I\u2019d be gone driving late shifts and he\u2019d be on the road for work. He wanted to cook dinner together, maybe watch that movie we keep putting off. I could see the hope in his eyes as he texted, \u201cCan\u2019t wait for tonight.\u201d But as I was about to clock out, two travelers flagged me down, their arms full of suitcases, faces anxious. \u201cPlease, can you help us? Our ride canceled, and we have a flight to catch. We\u2019ll split the fare, just help us with the bags.\u201d I looked at the time, then at their pleading faces. My job expects me to be reliable, to help people when they need it most. But my heart ached, knowing every minute I spent here was a minute stolen from the only night I had with him. I stood there, keys in hand, torn between the promise I made to my boyfriend and the duty I felt as a driver, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
