I was focused, jotting down notes, when I noticed Sarah, an old acquaintance, slip into the seat beside me. During the break, she leaned in, her voice low. \u201cDid you hear about Dr. Lee? I heard he\u2019s under investigation for misprescribing.\u201d My heart skipped. I\u2019d just learned, through a confidential pharmacy update, that Dr. Lee was indeed being reviewed, but the details were sensitive and not public. As a pharmacist, I was expected to stay informed and discreet, never fueling rumors or breaching confidentiality. But as an acquaintance, Sarah expected me to share what I knew, to be open and trustworthy. I could feel her eyes searching my face for confirmation, her trust in me hanging in the balance. My mind raced, torn between my professional duty to protect patient and colleague privacy, and the social expectation to confide in a friend. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught in the tension of what I should say next."}
