It was Mark, someone I knew from my running group. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m moving to a new place and could really use an extra hand.\u201d I glanced at my calendar, feeling the familiar tug of obligation. As an acquaintance, I knew the right thing was to say yes, to be supportive and helpful, especially since Mark rarely asked for favors.\n\nBut my mind was already racing with the day\u2019s real challenge. As the lead architect on the new high-rise hospital, I was scheduled to review the final safety compliance documents that afternoon. The inspection was tomorrow, and any oversight could mean catastrophic consequences. My team and the hospital board were counting on me to catch every detail, to ensure that every regulation was met and every life protected.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014Mark\u2019s hopeful request and the weight of professional responsibility. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how to be both the helpful friend and the vigilant architect, knowing that I couldn\u2019t fully be both at the same time."}
