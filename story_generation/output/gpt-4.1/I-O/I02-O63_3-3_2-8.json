My phone buzzed with a message from Mia: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d I knew she was barely holding it together after her brother\u2019s accident. As her boyfriend, I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to listen, to comfort her through her grief. But my break wasn\u2019t for another hour, and the compliance system tracked every second I wasn\u2019t on a call. If I stepped away now, even for a few minutes, I risked getting flagged\u2014maybe even written up. My supervisor had already warned me about my adherence last week. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, my heart pounding. Mia needed me, but so did my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt trapped, torn between being the partner she deserved and the employee my company demanded."}
