My mentor had set aside this hour just for me, a rare chance to ask questions and learn from her experience. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to respect her time, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I\u2019d prepared a list of questions, determined to make the most of it. Just as I was about to head to her office, my radio crackled to life: \u201cAll available units, multi-vehicle collision, Highway 17, possible critical injuries.\u201d My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. The expectation was clear\u2014drop everything and respond. But if I left now, I\u2019d be disrespecting my mentor\u2019s time, maybe even missing my only chance this week. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of duty and the commitment I\u2019d made to my mentor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
