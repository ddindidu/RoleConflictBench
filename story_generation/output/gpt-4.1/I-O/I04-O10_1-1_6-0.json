My friend had just messaged, clearly confused about where we were supposed to meet tonight. I could almost hear the frustration in their words, and I knew if I didn\u2019t clear things up now, the evening would be a mess. But right in front of me, my laptop blinked with reminders\u2014quarterly filing was due in less than an hour. The spreadsheets were open, numbers waiting to be checked and double-checked. As an accountant, accuracy was everything; one mistake could mean hours of extra work or worse, a reprimand from my boss. My friend expected me to be there for them, to communicate and fix this misunderstanding before it spiraled. My job demanded my full attention, precision, and timeliness. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in. I couldn\u2019t ignore either responsibility, but I only had a few minutes to act."}
