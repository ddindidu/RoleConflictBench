As a colleague, I was expected to be present\u2014this was the final discussion before our project\u2019s direction was set. My team counted on my input, and I knew missing it would let them down. But just as I was about to log in, my delivery app pinged. A package, delayed but still within the day, had finally arrived at the depot. As the delivery person, I was responsible for getting it to the customer before the end of my shift. If I waited until after the meeting, I risked missing the delivery window and disappointing a customer who\u2019d already been patient. My mind raced, torn between the team\u2019s expectations and my duty to deliver. I could feel the pressure mounting, the weight of two roles pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I glanced between my laptop and the delivery manifest, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
