I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of friendly, approachable neighbor people remembered. As I stepped into the hallway, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door fumbling with her groceries. I smiled, cake in hand, and started toward her, rehearsing my greeting in my head.\n\nBut just then, my headset crackled. I was on call, working remotely as an air traffic controller. A pilot\u2019s voice came through, requesting the routine altimeter setting. My job demanded immediate, precise communication\u2014lives depended on it. I froze, torn between the expectation to be a warm, welcoming neighbor and the urgent responsibility to respond to the pilot. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, cake in one hand, headset in the other, caught between two worlds and unable to move."}
