The hum of the control room was familiar, almost comforting. My mentee, Sarah, hovered nearby, notebook in hand, waiting for my thoughts on her upcoming job interview. She\u2019d just asked if she should mention her side project\u2014a minor thing, but she looked anxious for my input. I wanted to give her the thoughtful guidance she deserved, maybe share how I\u2019d navigated similar moments early in my career.\n\nJust then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through my headset, requesting the routine altimeter setting. It was a simple request, one I could answer in seconds, but protocol demanded my full attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: Sarah\u2019s hopeful eyes on me, the pilot\u2019s expectation of prompt, precise communication. My mind raced, torn between offering Sarah the mentorship she sought and fulfilling my duty to the aircraft overhead. The seconds stretched, my heart thumping as I wrestled with which responsibility to honor first."}
