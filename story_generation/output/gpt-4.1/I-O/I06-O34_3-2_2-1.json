Pilots\u2019 voices crackle in, requesting updates, and I juggle their altitudes and vectors, trying to keep the airspace safe and flowing. My mind, though, keeps drifting to the assignment my mentor gave me\u2014an analysis that must be finished before upper management\u2019s evaluation tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d have it done, and I know how much my mentor is counting on me to deliver. But every time I reach for my notes, another aircraft calls in, another blip demands my attention. The pressure mounts from both sides: the responsibility to keep hundreds of passengers safe in the sky, and the obligation not to let my mentor down. My hands tremble slightly as I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give."}
