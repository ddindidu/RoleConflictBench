We\u2019d just stumbled into a misunderstanding about our weekend plans\u2014she thought I\u2019d promised to visit her parents, but I\u2019d agreed to cover a shift at the station. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a call for immediate backup, violent assault in progress, multiple bystanders at risk. Mia\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cCan\u2019t you just talk to me for five minutes? We need to sort this out.\u201d I could see how much it meant to her, the expectation that I\u2019d be present, resolve things, show her she mattered. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, the urgency of my duty as a police officer\u2014lives could be at stake. My heart pounded, torn between the woman I loved and the oath I\u2019d sworn. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, and for a moment, I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
