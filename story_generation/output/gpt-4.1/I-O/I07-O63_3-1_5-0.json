As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish the data analysis by noon\u2014without it, the client\u2019s delivery would be delayed, and everyone\u2019s work would be held up. But as a telemarketer, I was scheduled for a two-hour call block, and my supervisor expected me to handle every customer question with patience and precision, even if most calls were routine. My phone rang, and I hesitated. If I focused on the calls, the spreadsheet would sit untouched, risking the project. If I worked on the analysis, I\u2019d miss calls and let my telemarketing team down. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure from both sides. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 disappointment and my supervisor\u2019s reprimand, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
