That\u2019s what\u2019s expected, after all. I pride myself on being responsive, the kind of colleague who never leaves anyone hanging. But my laptop chimed with another notification: a client had sent over a standard contract for review. It wasn\u2019t urgent, the deadline was weeks away, and I\u2019d seen dozens like it before. Yet, as a lawyer, I know the importance of thoroughness, of not letting things pile up. I could knock out the contract review now, stay ahead, and avoid a last-minute rush. But if I do that, I\u2019ll be ignoring my colleague\u2019s message, even if it doesn\u2019t require action. If I respond to the message first, I\u2019ll be putting off the contract, risking a backlog. I sat at my desk, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each expectation quietly demanding my attention, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to be the perfect colleague and the diligent lawyer."}
