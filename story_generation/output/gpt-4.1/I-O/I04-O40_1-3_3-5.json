Tomorrow\u2019s project was the biggest I\u2019d ever landed\u2014a custom library for a wealthy client, and I needed to be sure I understood every measurement and detail. My phone buzzed. It was Sam, my oldest friend, his name lighting up the screen. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf. The instructions make no sense.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew he\u2019d never ask unless he was really stuck. As a friend, I wanted to be there for him, to help him through this small crisis. But as a carpenter, I felt the weight of tomorrow\u2019s job pressing on me. If I didn\u2019t finish reviewing these plans, I risked making a costly mistake. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I owed Sam and the responsibility I owed my craft. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
