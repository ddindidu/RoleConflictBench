We finally have time.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d talked for weeks about carving out an evening just for us. She wanted to try that new Italian place, maybe walk by the river after. I wanted that too\u2014just us, no distractions.\n\nBut as I set my phone down, a customer walked into the workshop, holding a small, splintered wooden train. \u201cMy son\u2019s favorite,\u201d she said, her eyes hopeful. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d I examined the toy, already picturing the work it would take\u2014delicate sanding, matching the paint, making it safe for little hands. She needed a quote soon; her son\u2019s birthday was coming up.\n\nI felt the tug in both directions. My girlfriend deserved my time, my attention. But this mother was counting on me too, and I knew how much a favorite toy could mean to a child. My mind raced, weighing the promise of laughter and closeness against the responsibility in my hands. I stared at the train, my phone buzzing again, and felt the pressure mounting, unsure which role to answer first."}
