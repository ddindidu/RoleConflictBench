She had left a couple of large boxes outside her door, right in the corridor. I remembered the HOA inspection notice\u2014anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited, and I knew how strict the rules were. As her neighbor, I felt I should remind her, maybe even help her move the boxes, to avoid trouble for both of us. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. A customer was calling, asking about the status of their urgent package. As a delivery person, I was expected to answer promptly and professionally, keeping my tone polite and helpful. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I address the neighborly issue right away, risking a delay in my response to the customer, or should I focus on my job and let the corridor situation slide for now? My mind raced, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible delivery person, both roles demanding my immediate attention."}
