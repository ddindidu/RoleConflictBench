The production floor was quiet, giving me a rare chance to focus, but the issue was maddeningly intermittent. Every time I thought I\u2019d found the cause, the machine would run smoothly again, only to stutter when I turned my back. My phone buzzed with a message from my neighbor, reminding me that the HOA inspection was today. I\u2019d left my toolbox and a couple of spare parts in the shared corridor last night, too tired to haul them inside after my shift. Now, with the inspection looming, I knew those items could get us both cited for blocking the emergency exit. As a neighbor, I was expected to keep shared spaces clear and respect everyone\u2019s safety. As a repairer, I was expected to stay until the machine was fixed, no matter how long it took. I stared at the blinking lights on the control panel, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my immediate attention, and realized I couldn\u2019t possibly satisfy both at once."}
