It was Sam, my closest friend. His voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now. Jess and I had a huge fight.\u201d I could hear the pain in his words, the kind that only a friend could help soothe. I wanted to listen, to be there for him, to offer the comfort he expected from me. But at that exact moment, the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through my radio: \u201cCode Red, possible heart attack, Maple and 5th. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted for the patient waiting for me. They needed my skills, my focus, my care. But Sam needed me too, in a different way. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the desperate call of a friend and the urgent duty of saving a life, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
