The store was quiet, but my mind was anything but. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mia. She\u2019d lost her brother just two days ago, and every word she sent was heavy with grief. I wanted to be there, to hold her, to listen, to say something\u2014anything\u2014that might help. But here I was, stuck at work, staring at a small discrepancy in the register. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expected me to report it immediately, even if it was just a few coins. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. Mia needed me, but so did my job. My heart ached as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the pull of both roles tearing me in opposite directions."}
