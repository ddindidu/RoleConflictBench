My heart ached to hold her, to say something\u2014anything\u2014that might ease her pain. She needed me now, needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. But my phone buzzed again, the third time in ten minutes. The new client was waiting for an estimate on the custom bookshelf, and the supplier needed my order by noon if I wanted the materials this week. I glanced at my notebook, sketches and measurements half-finished, numbers blurring together. I knew if I missed this window, the whole project would be delayed, and my reputation as a reliable carpenter would take a hit. But how could I leave her side, even for a moment? The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014her grief, my work\u2014each demanding more than I felt I could give. My hands trembled as I reached for my phone, torn between the love she needed and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
