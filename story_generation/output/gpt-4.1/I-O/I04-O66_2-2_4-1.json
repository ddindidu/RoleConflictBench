It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. Can you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours\u2014I\u2019ll miss it otherwise.\u201d I glanced at the rearview mirror; my passenger\u2019s eyes darted between his watch and the traffic, his suitcase clutched tight. He\u2019d told me his train left in less than thirty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a friend, I wanted to drop everything and help Sam\u2014he\u2019d do the same for me.
