As an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to steer the conversation away from gossip, to avoid saying anything negative. But as a judge, my mind kept drifting to the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded. The case involved Mark, and I was expected to write a clear, detailed judgment\u2014one that would inevitably include my critical findings about his actions. The group\u2019s chatter grew louder, and someone turned to me, asking for my opinion. I felt the weight of their expectation to join in, to share what I knew. At the same time, the judge in me recoiled, knowing that my words could compromise both my impartiality and my professional duty. My stomach tightened as I realized that whatever I said\u2014or didn\u2019t say\u2014would be scrutinized. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
