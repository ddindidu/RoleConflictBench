The line of customers stretched past the bakery display, each person expecting a smile and quick service. As I handed change to a regular, I spotted my mentee, Jamie, hovering near the end of the line, eyes darting between their phone and the clock. I remembered our last check-in, when Jamie admitted to feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and unsure how to prioritize tasks. As their mentor, I wanted to pull them aside, offer guidance, and help them map out a plan. But as a cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving, greet each customer warmly, and not hold up the flow. My manager\u2019s watchful gaze reminded me of the importance of efficiency. I felt torn\u2014should I step away to support Jamie, risking the frustration of waiting customers and my manager\u2019s disapproval, or should I stay at my post, leaving Jamie to struggle alone? The competing demands pressed in on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I weighed my next move."}
