Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, lives alone just down the hall. I know she relies on me for small things\u2014picking up her mail, checking in when the weather turns bad. I should knock on her door, make sure she has candles, water, and her phone charged. But as I stand, my eyes fall on the thick manila envelope on my desk: the new case file, just delivered. The hearing is in two weeks, but the expectation is clear\u2014thorough, early review. I pride myself on diligence; my colleagues and the parties involved count on my careful attention. Yet, the storm is coming tonight, not in two weeks. My mind tugs in two directions: the duty to my neighbor, the duty to my court. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my time, each justified, each urgent in its own way. I hesitate, heart pounding, caught between the quiet hallway and the silent, waiting file."}
