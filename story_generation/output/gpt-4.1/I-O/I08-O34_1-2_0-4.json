The radio in my hand crackled with static, pilots\u2019 voices overlapping as they waited for my next instructions. The cloud tops were rising faster than forecasted, and I needed to issue revised climb clearances before anyone got too close to the turbulence. Just then, I spotted Mark, an old acquaintance from college, coming toward me. He smiled, expecting a friendly hello, maybe even a quick chat. I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014be warm, approachable, not the cold, distracted person I sometimes become under stress. But my headset buzzed again, a pilot\u2019s voice tense, waiting for my guidance. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the friendly nod Mark deserved with the urgent, focused attention the pilots needed. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between the simple social grace of a hallway greeting and the critical responsibility of keeping people safe in the sky."}
