There\u2019s a message from Alex: \u201cRough morning. Can we talk?\u201d I know he\u2019s been under pressure at work lately, and as his girlfriend, I want to be there for him, to listen and reassure him. But right now, I\u2019m in my scrubs, stethoscope around my neck, and my cart is loaded with charts and equipment. My patients rely on me to be focused, precise, and timely. If I pause to call Alex, I\u2019ll fall behind, and my supervisor has already reminded me about the importance of punctuality. Yet, if I ignore him, I worry he\u2019ll feel alone, maybe even hurt. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the man I love and the patients who need my care. I stand in the hallway, phone in hand, pulse racing, torn between the urge to comfort Alex and the duty to my patients, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
