She\u2019d misunderstood my joke, and now she sounded genuinely hurt. I knew I should call her right away, explain, and clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, fix things before they fester. But as I reached for my phone, my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery room spotless, no shortcuts. We\u2019re being inspected today.\u201d The mop in my hand felt heavier. I glanced at the clock\u2014only two hours left to finish deep cleaning the entire house. If I stopped now, I\u2019d fall behind, and I couldn\u2019t risk my job. But if I waited, Mia might think I didn\u2019t care. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, torn between the duty to my friend and the demands of my work, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
