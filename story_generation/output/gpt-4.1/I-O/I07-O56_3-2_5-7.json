The spreadsheet for the client\u2019s delivery was still missing a few key figures, and the deadline was in two hours. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my next hair appointment was in five minutes. I hurried to the salon area, where my client, Sarah, was already waiting. She smiled, but I couldn\u2019t help noticing her hair was damp and oily from her gym session. As a hairdresser, I knew I should wash and condition her hair before starting, but that would take at least twenty minutes\u2014time I didn\u2019t have if I wanted to finish my work task on time. My mind raced: if I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be compromising my standards as a hairdresser and possibly disappointing Sarah. But if I did the wash, I\u2019d risk missing the deadline and letting my team down, jeopardizing the client delivery. My heart pounded as I stood between the salon chair and my laptop, torn by the impossible expectations pressing in from both sides."}
