My girlfriend sat on the couch, her shoulders tense, eyes fixed on the TV but not really watching. I could tell she\u2019d had one of those days\u2014nothing dramatic, just the slow grind of work wearing her down. I wanted to sit beside her, ask about her day, and just listen, like she always says helps. But my break was almost over. Management had sent another reminder about break times this morning; the call queue was overflowing, and they were tracking every minute. If I stayed out here too long, I\u2019d get flagged, maybe even written up. But if I went back now, I\u2019d leave her alone with her stress, and I knew she counted on me to be there, especially on days like this. My phone buzzed with a reminder: two minutes left. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet."}
