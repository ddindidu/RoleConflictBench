The outage alert had come in just as I was about to take my dog for a quick walk. Now, customers were locked out of the service, and my manager\u2019s messages kept pinging: \u201cAny update? ETA?\u201d My fingers flew over the keyboard, searching for the bug that had brought everything down. Suddenly, a sharp bark echoed from the hallway\u2014my dog, again, reacting to footsteps near the shared door. I winced, remembering the last complaint from Mrs. Lee next door about the noise. I could almost hear her sigh through the wall. I knew I should go out, calm my dog, and show I cared about our shared space. But the outage was urgent, and every second counted. My mind spun between the angry emails piling up and the neighborly expectations I was failing. I felt trapped, torn between the code demanding my attention and the neighborly decency I owed to those living just a few feet away."}
