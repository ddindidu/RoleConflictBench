Can you help?\u201d I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be available for guidance, especially today, with her deadline looming. But right now, I was behind the register, the line of customers snaking past the candy racks, each one shifting impatiently. My manager had already reminded me twice to keep the line moving. I scanned groceries, smiled, counted change, but my mind kept drifting to Maya\u2019s anxious text. She depended on my feedback, and I\u2019d told her I\u2019d always be there when she hit a wall. The beep of the scanner and the clatter of coins felt louder with every passing minute. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014one demanding my undivided attention to every transaction, the other expecting me to be a steady guide. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, and I felt my heart race, torn between the needs of the customers in front of me and the promise I\u2019d made to Maya."}
