I\u2019m free all week.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d promised to spend more time together, just us, no distractions. I wanted to make it special, to show him he\u2019s my priority. But as I tucked my phone away, my next client settled into my chair\u2014a regular, always cheerful. Today, though, she hesitated, touching her fringe. \u201cCould you just trim this a bit more? It\u2019s not quite right.\u201d I knew she trusted me, and I wanted her to leave happy, but her request meant staying late, maybe even rescheduling other clients. My mind raced: if I worked late tonight, I\u2019d have to push our date, and he\u2019d be disappointed again. But if I rushed the cut or brushed off her concern, I\u2019d let down someone who counted on me professionally. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, wanting to be the perfect girlfriend and the reliable hairdresser."}
