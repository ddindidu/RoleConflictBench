This is the final discussion before we lock in the new project plan, and my input is expected. My manager has already messaged me twice, reminding me how important my participation is. But my phone blinks with another reminder: I\u2019m still three sales short of my weekly target, and there\u2019s only an hour left in my shift. Management has made it clear\u2014targets must be met, no excuses. My headset feels heavier than usual as I weigh my options. If I join the meeting, I\u2019ll miss the prime calling window and risk falling short. If I keep dialing, I\u2019ll let my team down and possibly miss my chance to influence the project. My stomach knots as I hover between the meeting link and the call list, feeling the pressure from both sides, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
