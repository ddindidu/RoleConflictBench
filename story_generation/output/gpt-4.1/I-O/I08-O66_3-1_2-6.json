She spotted me and rushed over, asking if I could take her home. As her acquaintance, I felt the urge to comfort her, to offer tissues, maybe even a hug, and let her talk about whatever had happened. But as soon as she slid into the back seat, I noticed her mascara and tears staining her hands, threatening to drip onto the clean upholstery I\u2019d just scrubbed that morning. My mind raced: as a taxi driver, I was expected to keep my cab spotless for the next passenger, to maintain a professional distance, and not get too involved. Yet, as someone she recognized, I couldn\u2019t just ignore her pain. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between reaching back to offer comfort and keeping my focus on the road and the rules of my job. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
