She\u2019s upset about a coupon not working, her voice rising, and I force a smile, trying to keep my tone calm and friendly. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s my team at the office, waiting for my reply about the project. They can\u2019t move forward until I clarify a detail, and I promised to be responsive, even on my lunch break. But right now, I\u2019m the only cashier on duty, and the holiday crowd is relentless. The customer glares, expecting my full attention, while my colleagues expect a quick answer. My heart pounds as I juggle the register, the customer\u2019s frustration, and the insistent vibration of my phone. I feel pulled in two directions, each role demanding something I can\u2019t give at the same time."}
