My mentor had been clear: finish it before our next meeting in three days. I wanted to impress her, to prove I was dedicated and capable. But the pharmacy was busy today, and as I glanced at the prescription in my hand, my heart pounded. The patient waiting at the counter depended on me to get every detail right\u2014one mistake could mean a dangerous drug interaction. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My mentor\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind, but so did the trust my patients placed in me. I tried to focus, but my thoughts kept drifting to the code I hadn\u2019t finished, the logic errors I hadn\u2019t solved. At the same time, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford a single slip with these medications. My hands trembled as I reached for the next bottle, torn between the demands of my mentor and the responsibility I owed my patient."}
