As her mentor, I knew she valued my opinion, and I wanted to give her thoughtful advice, even if it was just about a minor career step. I started to answer, but then I noticed the water in the deep end looked cloudy\u2014too cloudy. My lifeguard instincts kicked in. I checked the filtration system and realized it wasn\u2019t working properly. If I didn\u2019t act fast, the pool could become unsafe for everyone. But Jamie was still waiting, her question hanging in the air, her trust in me palpable. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down: the expectation to be present and supportive as a mentor, and the urgent responsibility to ensure everyone\u2019s safety as a lifeguard. My mind raced, torn between offering Jamie the guidance she needed and rushing to fix the filtration system before anyone got hurt."}
