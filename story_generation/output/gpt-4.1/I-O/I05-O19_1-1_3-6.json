It\u2019s my way of staying sharp, making sure I\u2019m providing the best care to my patients. Today, as I flipped through an article about a promising new anticoagulant, my mentee, Sarah, slid into the seat across from me. She had that eager look, notebook in hand, ready to ask about medication counseling tips. I could see she was hoping for a thoughtful answer, maybe even a story from my own experience. But the newsletter\u2019s headline tugged at me\u2014if I didn\u2019t read it now, I might miss something crucial for my practice. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: Sarah deserved my attention and guidance, but my patients depended on my up-to-date knowledge. My mind raced, torn between sharing my experience with her and diving into the article that could impact my work. I hesitated, newsletter in one hand, Sarah\u2019s expectant gaze in the other, caught in the tension of wanting to do right by both."}
