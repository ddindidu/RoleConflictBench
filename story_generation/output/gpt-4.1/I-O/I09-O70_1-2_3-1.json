As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate\u2014our building has limited space, and we\u2019re supposed to avoid putting out half-full bins to keep the sidewalk clear. But today, my delivery schedule is packed, and one of my stops is for Mrs. Kim, who called earlier, desperate for her groceries before dinner. If I wait until the bins are full, I\u2019ll miss my delivery window and let her down. If I leave now, the bins might not get picked up, and my neighbors will be annoyed at the mess and wasted space. I can already hear Mr. Patel\u2019s complaints about blocking the walkway. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cDeliver by 5:30 PM.\u201d I stand there, keys in hand, torn between being the reliable neighbor who respects our shared space and the delivery person who never misses a deadline. The pressure from both sides tightens in my chest as I weigh what to do next."}
