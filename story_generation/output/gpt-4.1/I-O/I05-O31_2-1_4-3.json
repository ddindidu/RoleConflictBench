As a mentor, I had promised my team a structured session this afternoon, determined to share the skills they needed before the looming project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing materials, eager to see them grow. But as a police officer, I also knew the importance of staying fit\u2014my shift sergeant had reminded me just this morning that our physical readiness was non-negotiable, especially with recent upticks in street incidents. The gym was calling, and skipping another session would mean falling short of the department\u2019s expectations. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentoring session in 30 minutes.\u201d At the same time, my gym bag sat by the door, a silent accusation. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down\u2014either my eager mentees or my fellow officers who counted on me to be at my best. The clock ticked on, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible demands of both roles."}
