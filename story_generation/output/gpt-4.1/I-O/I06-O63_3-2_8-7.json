My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious that hour was. I wanted to show respect, to be present and prepared, to make the most of the time she\u2019d carved out. But my break was scheduled to start in five minutes, and management had been strict lately\u2014every second over was flagged, every deviation questioned. The phone queue was relentless, and I could almost feel the supervisor\u2019s eyes on the break log, waiting for someone to slip up. My heart pounded as I weighed the options: log out for my break and risk missing the mentor\u2019s call, or stay on and risk a reprimand at work. I felt pulled in two directions, the pressure mounting as the minutes ticked by, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
