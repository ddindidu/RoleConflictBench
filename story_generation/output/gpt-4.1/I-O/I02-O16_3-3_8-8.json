I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My heart pounded. Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning everything\u2014us, our future. I knew I had to call her, to fix this before it was too late. She needed me to be present, to listen, to fight for us.\n\nBut just as I reached for the phone, the ER doors burst open. A nurse rushed in, wheeling a patient whose skin was mottled and feverish. \u201cSepsis, rapid onset,\u201d she said, urgency in her voice. I was the attending on call. The patient\u2019s life depended on my immediate assessment and the right antibiotic\u2014every second mattered.\n\nI felt torn in two.

My hands shook as I stood between the phone and the patient\u2019s bed, my mind racing, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I cared about would be left waiting."}
