The air crackled with tension\u2014shouts, banners, the press of bodies. Somewhere in the throng, I spotted my mentee, Sarah, her face set with determination. She\u2019d confided in me just yesterday, torn about whether to join the protest or stay neutral for her career\u2019s sake. As her mentor, I\u2019d promised to help her weigh the risks, to guide her through this pivotal choice. Now, as a police officer, I was expected to enforce order, to keep the peace, even if it meant dispersing the crowd or making arrests. My radio crackled with urgent commands. I felt Sarah\u2019s eyes on me, searching for reassurance, for the guidance I\u2019d always given. But the line between mentor and officer blurred, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding different things. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
