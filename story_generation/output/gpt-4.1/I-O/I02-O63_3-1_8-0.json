My chest tightened. I knew I needed to listen, to reassure her, to fight for us\u2014she expected me to resolve this, to prove I was committed. But my other phone buzzed insistently. My shift as a telemarketer had started, and I was expected to answer every call, handle objections, and stick to the script. Most days, it was easy\u2014just routine questions, nothing I couldn\u2019t handle. But now, as my girlfriend\u2019s voice cracked, I saw the call queue growing. My supervisor\u2019s expectations pressed down on me: no missed calls, no personal distractions. I felt split in two, torn between the desperate need to save my relationship and the obligation to keep my job. My heart pounded as I stared at both phones, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
