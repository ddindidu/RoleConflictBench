The clock ticks past seven. My partner walks in, shoulders slumped, and drops his bag with a sigh. I glance up, catching the tired look in his eyes. He doesn\u2019t say much, just mumbles about a rough day at work. I want to get up, wrap my arms around him, ask what happened, and listen\u2014really listen\u2014like he always does for me. But the thick stack of briefs on the table tugs at my attention. The trial tomorrow is complicated, and I need to be sharp, impartial, and prepared. Every detail matters. I feel the weight of my robe even now, the responsibility to be fair and thorough. But I also feel the pull of love, the urge to be present and supportive. My heart aches as I sit, torn between the woman he needs tonight and the judge I must be tomorrow."}
