The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected me to show real progress\u2014she\u2019d even said, \u201cI want to see your best work this time.\u201d My mind raced with logic errors and syntax, but the hum of the salon outside kept pulling me back. Suddenly, the bell chimed. I glanced up to see a new client step inside, her eyes darting nervously around the room. As a hairdresser, I was supposed to greet every client warmly, make them feel at ease, and ensure their first experience was perfect. But my mentor\u2019s words echoed in my head, and the pressure of the unfinished code weighed on me. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I tried to decide whether to close my laptop and greet her with a smile, or steal a few more precious minutes to debug my code before stepping out. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
