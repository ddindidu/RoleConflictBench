Dispatch had just called\u2014a patient with a broken arm, likely in severe pain, waiting for me to provide care. My hands itched to check the supplies, to be ready for the rush of responsibility. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Mark, an old acquaintance from college. He smiled, expecting the usual friendly banter, maybe a quick chat about life or work. I could see the anticipation in his eyes, the silent hope for a moment of connection. But every second I spent here was a second the patient waited, possibly suffering. My role as an ambulance driver demanded urgency, focus, and immediate action. Yet, as an acquaintance, I was expected to be warm, approachable, and present. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my feet rooted to the spot, torn between the need to help and the need to connect. My heart pounded as I struggled to choose which role to honor in that fleeting moment."}
