Tonight was the only evening my girlfriend and I had free before I left for a week-long training. She\u2019d been looking forward to our dinner plans, dropping hints about how much she missed our time together. I promised her I\u2019d be home by seven, no excuses. But just as I was about to close up, Mrs. Lee, my favorite regular, slipped into the salon. She smiled apologetically, brushing her fringe aside. \u201cCould you just trim this a bit more? It\u2019s poking my eyes.\u201d I knew she trusted me, and I prided myself on never rushing a client, always making sure they left happy. But my phone buzzed with a message from my girlfriend: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my commitment to her, and my promise to my clients. My scissors hovered in my hand, torn between the comfort of routine and the pull of love, unsure which expectation I\u2019d have to let down."}
