My mentor had squeezed me into her schedule for a quick check-in, and I knew how rare that was. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time, and I was determined to be prompt and prepared. But as I finished up with my last client\u2014a regular who always left happy\u2014she peered into the mirror and smiled apologetically. \u201cCould you just snip a little more off my fringe? It\u2019s almost perfect, but not quite.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. As a hairdresser, I prided myself on making sure every client left satisfied, no matter how small the request. But the minutes were slipping away, and I couldn\u2019t risk being late for my mentor. My mind raced: if I rushed, I might disappoint my client; if I took my time, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s generosity. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between two promises, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
