I just\u2026 I need you.\u201d His words were raw, heavy with the grief of losing his brother last night. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold him, to listen, to be the steady presence he needed. But as I reached for my keys, my work phone rang. The new team at the plant was about to start the next batch, and I could hear the uncertainty in their voices. They didn\u2019t know the safety protocols\u2014if I didn\u2019t guide them, someone could get hurt. My mind raced. Alex needed me to be his anchor, to help him through the worst night of his life. But my team needed me to keep them safe, to prevent a disaster. I felt torn in two, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest as I stared at both phones, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
