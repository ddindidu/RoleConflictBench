The subject line was \u201cFYI\u2014No Action Needed,\u201d but I knew the unspoken rule: even informational messages deserved a timely acknowledgment. I glanced at the screen, feeling the weight of expectation to reply, to show I was engaged and responsive, even if just with a quick \u201cThanks, got it.\u201d\n\nJust then, the intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop is closest to the museum?\u201d a passenger\u2019s voice asked, polite but uncertain. My training was clear\u2014passenger safety and assistance always came first. I was supposed to be fully present, attentive to the needs of those on board, ready to respond to any situation, no matter how routine.\n\nMy hand hovered between the intercom button and my phone. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between the silent pressure to be a good colleague and the immediate responsibility to my passengers. Both roles demanded my attention, and for a moment, I was suspended between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
