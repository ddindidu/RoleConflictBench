The courtroom was silent now, but the weight of the bench trial lingered. I needed to write the final judgment\u2014thirty days, the law said, and every word had to be precise, every fact carefully weighed. But my phone buzzed again, a message from Alex. He was lost, adrift in grief after his sister\u2019s sudden death. I could hear his voice in my mind, trembling, asking if I could come over, if I could just hold him for a while. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to be there, to offer comfort, to let him lean on me. But as a judge, I owed the parties in my case a timely, thoughtful decision. My mind raced with legal arguments and emotional pleas, my heart torn between the duty to my profession and the person I loved. I stared at the blank document, my hands trembling, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either what they truly needed from me right now."}
