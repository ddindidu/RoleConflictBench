I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of neighbor who is warm and approachable. Just as I was about to knock, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the hospital. My patient\u2019s family was waiting, anxious for news I dreaded to deliver. As a doctor, I knew I had to be clear and compassionate, to help them understand the gravity of the diagnosis and support them through their shock and grief. But here I was, caught between two worlds: the neighbor who should be smiling and welcoming, and the doctor who must bring pain with honesty. My heart pounded as I stared at the door, cake trembling in my hands, torn between the kindness expected in my new community and the duty I owed to a family in crisis."}
