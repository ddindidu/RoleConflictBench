She\u2019d said I was distant, that I cared more about numbers than us. I wanted to fix things, to show her she mattered, but the company\u2019s quarterly tax filing was due next week. As the accountant, everyone expected me to catch every error, to ensure we didn\u2019t miss a single regulation. My phone buzzed\u2014Mia again, probably hoping we could talk, resolve the tension that had built up over our finances. I knew she needed reassurance, a boyfriend who listened and made things right. But the emails kept coming, reminders of the looming deadline and the trust my boss placed in me. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to call Mia and the obligation to double-check the tax forms. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
