The work isn\u2019t urgent, but I like to stay ahead, and my client expects thoroughness. As I\u2019m reading, I remember my neighbor, Mrs. Kim, mentioned she\u2019s expecting a package today. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and last week she asked if I could keep an eye out for her. I promised I would, and now I feel the weight of that promise. \n\nI glance at the clock, torn. If I focus on the contract, I can get a head start and maybe impress my client with my efficiency. But if I don\u2019t listen for the doorbell, Mrs. Kim might miss her delivery again, and I\u2019d feel guilty for letting her down. I can\u2019t shake the sense that both roles\u2014being a reliable neighbor and a diligent lawyer\u2014are pulling me in different directions. My mind races, trying to balance the expectations, feeling the tension rise as I wait for the inevitable ring of the doorbell or the ping of an email."}
