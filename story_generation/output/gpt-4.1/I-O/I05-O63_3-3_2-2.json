My mentee\u2019s message blinked urgently: \u201cCan we talk? I need your advice before I accept the offer.\u201d I knew how much this decision meant to her\u2014she was counting on me to help her weigh every detail, to be the steady guide she needed. But just as I started typing a response, my headset buzzed. A customer\u2019s voice, sharp and frustrated, cut through: \u201cI\u2019ve been with your company for years. Why should I trust this new offer? Explain it to me\u2014now.\u201d\n\nMy mind raced. The company expected me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the customer calm and satisfied, but my mentee needed me to be present, thoughtful, and thorough. I felt my chest tighten as I tried to split my attention, guilt gnawing at me for not giving either the focus they deserved.

I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
