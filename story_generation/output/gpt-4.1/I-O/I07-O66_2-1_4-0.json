My phone buzzed with a reminder: the report for our team project was due in two hours. I knew if I didn\u2019t finish my section, Priya couldn\u2019t start hers, and the whole team would be set back. But right now, I was behind the wheel, driving a passenger across town. He chatted about his weekend plans, unconcerned with time, his meeting still an hour away. I felt the weight of my colleague\u2019s trust pressing on me\u2014everyone was counting on me to deliver, to keep the workflow moving. But as a taxi driver, I couldn\u2019t rush, couldn\u2019t pull over to type a few lines, couldn\u2019t let my focus slip. My passenger expected a safe, smooth ride, and I owed him that. My mind raced with possible shortcuts, with excuses I could give my team, with guilt at letting either side down. The city lights blurred past as I gripped the wheel, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I could give."}
