She\u2019d asked me to keep an eye out, since she always seemed to miss deliveries. I promised I\u2019d help, and I meant it\u2014after all, that\u2019s what good neighbors do. But just as I was about to settle in by the window, my phone buzzed: a call from dispatch. A critical patient needed transport, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. The sky outside was already darkening, rain lashing the windows, thunder rumbling in the distance. I could picture the roads\u2014slick, visibility near zero, every second precious for the patient in the back. My mind raced. If I left now, the package would be missed, and my neighbor would be disappointed, maybe even inconvenienced. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking a life. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the storm outside mirrored by the one inside me."}
