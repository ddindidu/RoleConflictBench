My mentor had squeezed in a session for me just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to show respect, to be fully present, to not waste a single minute. But as I caught my reflection in the salon mirror, my stomach twisted. My hair was limp and greasy from my rushed gym session, and I was due to cut and style it for a demonstration in front of her. As a hairdresser, I would never start a cut without washing and conditioning first\u2014clean hair is essential for a good result, and it\u2019s what my clients expect. But if I asked to wash my hair now, I\u2019d eat into the short time my mentor had carved out for me. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be breaking my own professional standards and risking a poor impression. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, my mind racing as I tried to figure out which expectation I could afford to let down."}
