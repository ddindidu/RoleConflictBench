As a colleague, I was expected to finish the project plan by noon\u2014our client was waiting, and my part was the linchpin. My phone buzzed with reminders from my team, their messages tinged with urgency. But as I switched gears to my other role, donning my judge\u2019s robe, I entered the courtroom, ready to deliver jury instructions. The room was silent, all eyes on me. Suddenly, my clerk rushed over, whispering that the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent my instructions relied on. I froze, torn. My colleagues needed me to meet the deadline, but as a judge, I was bound to uphold the law and immediately adapt to this seismic shift. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of delay. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of my team and the gravity of my judicial duty, knowing I could not satisfy both at once."}
