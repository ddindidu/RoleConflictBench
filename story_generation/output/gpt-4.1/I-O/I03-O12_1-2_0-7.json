The app is throwing intermittent errors, and QA is pinging me for a fix. My laptop sits open on the coffee table, code editor ready, but I hear the front door click. My partner walks in, shoulders slumped, eyes tired. I can tell it\u2019s been a rough day for him, and I know he needs me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to just be there. He gives me a small, hopeful smile, and I feel the weight of his unspoken need for comfort.\n\nBut my mind is split. The team is counting on me to troubleshoot these issues before more users are affected. I can\u2019t ignore the notifications piling up, but I also can\u2019t ignore the person I love, who\u2019s clearly seeking support. My heart aches as I sit between the two worlds, feeling the pressure mount from both sides. I want to be present for him, but I also want to be reliable for my team. The demands pull at me, and I\u2019m left frozen, torn between the code and the comfort I know I should give."}
