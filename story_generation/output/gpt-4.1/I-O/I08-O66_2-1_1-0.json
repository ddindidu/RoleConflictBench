Today, she looked just as nervous, clutching her bag and avoiding my eyes in the rearview mirror. As her acquaintance, I felt a gentle urge to break the ice, maybe ask about her day or offer a reassuring smile, hoping to ease her nerves. But as her taxi driver, I knew my job was to focus on the road, keep the ride smooth, and respect her space, especially since she hadn\u2019t initiated any conversation. The expectation to be friendly tugged at me, but so did the professional distance I was supposed to maintain. I wondered if a simple, \u201cHow are you?\u201d would help or just make her more uncomfortable. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the urge to reach out and the responsibility to remain quietly efficient, unsure which role should take the lead."}
