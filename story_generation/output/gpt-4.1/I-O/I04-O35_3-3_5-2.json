My heart pounds as I reach for the radio, ready to follow protocol and halt the train, knowing dozens of passengers rely on me to keep them safe. Just then, my phone vibrates in my pocket. I glance down and see a desperate message from Jamie: \u201cCar broke down, highway, it\u2019s freezing, please come get me. I\u2019m scared.\u201d I can almost hear her voice trembling. She\u2019s always been there for me, and I know she\u2019s counting on me now, expecting me to drop everything and help. But the passengers in my care expect me to act fast, to keep them safe, to not let anything distract me. My mind races, torn between the friend who needs me and the duty I can\u2019t ignore. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel paralyzed, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
