My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another alert from the maintenance system, warning me that the main conveyor\u2019s bearing was about to fail. I knew what that meant: if I didn\u2019t get to it soon, the whole line could go down, costing hours of production and a mountain of stress for everyone.\n\nBut as I stepped into the break room to grab my tools, I saw him\u2014my boyfriend\u2014slumped at the table, eyes red, shoulders hunched. He\u2019d just gotten that feedback from his boss, the one he\u2019d been dreading all week. He looked up at me, searching for comfort, for the girlfriend who always listened, always made things better.\n\nMy mind raced. I could see the expectation in his eyes, the silent plea for me to sit, to hold his hand, to be there for him. But the factory\u2019s alarms echoed in my ears, reminding me of my duty, the trust everyone placed in me to keep things running. My heart twisted, caught between the person I loved and the job I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
