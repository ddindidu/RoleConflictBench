It was our last weekend together before she left for her new job overseas, and I could see the hope in her eyes\u2014she wanted every moment to count. My phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the networking event starts in an hour.\u201d I\u2019d promised my firm I\u2019d attend, and I knew how important it was to maintain connections, especially with a high-profile case on my desk.\n\nLater, at the event, I tried to focus on small talk, but my mind kept drifting back to Mia. Then, someone leaned in, lowering their voice, \u201cHey, you\u2019re handling that big case, right? What\u2019s really going on with your client?\u201d I felt the weight of my oath as a lawyer pressing down on me\u2014confidentiality was non-negotiable. But I also felt the pull of Mia\u2019s expectation, the guilt of not being fully present with her on our last weekend. Torn between my duty to my client and my commitment to Mia, I felt the tension knotting in my chest, unsure which role I was about to let down."}
