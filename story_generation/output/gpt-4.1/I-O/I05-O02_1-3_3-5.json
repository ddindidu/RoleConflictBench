She had that eager look, notebook in hand, ready to ask about the new design protocols. I\u2019d promised myself to be available, to share what I\u2019d learned over the years, especially during these informal moments. As she started her question, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the plant manager. The external inspector had flagged a critical safety issue on the line. If I didn\u2019t address it immediately, production could be shut down, and the company could face serious penalties.\n\nPriya\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for guidance, while my mind raced through the checklist of compliance steps. I could see the expectation in her face\u2014she trusted me to help her grow. But the weight of responsibility as the lead engineer pressed down harder. The inspector\u2019s concerns couldn\u2019t wait, but neither could Priya\u2019s need for support. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urge to mentor with the duty to protect the operation. I felt torn, caught between two roles that both demanded my full attention, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
