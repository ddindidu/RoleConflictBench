As a doctor, I was immediately called to assess the situation. The patient\u2019s symptoms were severe and puzzling, and I needed every bit of information to make an accurate diagnosis. But as I looked at the patient\u2019s chart, I realized I knew her from a mutual friend. Just yesterday, as an acquaintance, I had learned something deeply personal about her\u2014something that, if revealed, could explain her symptoms but would also expose her to gossip and potentially ruin her reputation.\n\nAs a doctor, I felt the weight of my responsibility to provide the best care, which meant sharing all relevant information with my medical team. But as an acquaintance, I was bound by trust and the unspoken rule not to betray her confidence or speak negatively about her. My mind raced, torn between my duty to save a life and my loyalty to a friend. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the tension rising as I stood outside her room, uncertain of what to do next."}
