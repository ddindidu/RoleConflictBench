My mentee, Sarah, was waiting in the consultation room, her eyes bright with hope and nerves. She was up for a major promotion, and I knew how much my guidance meant to her. She needed reassurance, advice, and a listening ear\u2014everything a good mentor should provide. But as I listened to her anxiously describe her doubts, the pharmacy phone rang. The prescription I\u2019d just received was for Mr. Patel, a regular with a complicated medication regimen. He depended on me to get every detail right; a single error could have serious consequences for his health. I could sense the tension in my shoulders as I tried to split my attention, torn between nurturing Sarah\u2019s growth and ensuring Mr. Patel\u2019s safety. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I only had one of me to give. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I stood at the crossroads of responsibility, knowing that whichever path I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
