As a colleague, I knew I had to finish my part by today\u2014if I didn\u2019t, the next person in line would be stuck, and the whole team\u2019s timeline would unravel. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the new law review journal had just arrived in my inbox. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, to read these articles and understand the latest shifts in legal thinking. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 voices, counting on me to deliver, and at the same time, I felt the weight of my judicial responsibility pressing on my conscience. If I ignored the journal, I risked falling behind in my legal knowledge. If I put off the spreadsheet, I\u2019d let my team down. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the unyielding expectations of my role as a judge. I sat frozen, unable to choose which responsibility to honor first."}
