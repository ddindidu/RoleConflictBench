The line stretched down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently, and I forced a smile as I handed change to the next person. My boyfriend\u2019s name flashed on my screen again\u2014another message, probably about the argument we\u2019d had this morning. We\u2019d been fighting all week about money, and I knew he expected me to text back, to help us work things out. But right now, my manager was watching, and every customer expected me to be quick and accurate. My hands trembled as I counted bills, my mind split between the register and the words I wanted to say to him. I wanted to fix things, to show him I cared, but I couldn\u2019t risk making a mistake at work. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I felt trapped, unable to be the girlfriend he needed or the cashier my job demanded."}
