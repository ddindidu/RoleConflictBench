The tension from the argument with my teammates still pulsed in my chest. We were supposed to deliver our project by Friday, but now, after today\u2019s blow-up, I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d even finish. I knew I should reach out to my mentor, just like she\u2019d asked\u2014\u201cLet me know if anything threatens your progress,\u201d she\u2019d said. But as I glanced up, I saw the operator at the machine again, fiddling with the settings. My other role kicked in: I was supposed to guide clients, prevent mistakes, and right now, he was wasting expensive material with every wrong adjustment. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I didn\u2019t intervene, the waste would be on me. But if I didn\u2019t call my mentor, I\u2019d be letting her down, too. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to support my team and the responsibility to step in as the machine repairer. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I could feel myself being pulled apart by the weight of their expectations."}
