It was Jamie, texting, \u201cUgh, today\u2019s dragging. Wish I could just talk to someone.\u201d I knew he needed me to listen, to be the friend who always replied right away, who made him feel heard. I started typing a quick response, trying to sound supportive, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mike heading straight for the area under the suspended beam. My heart pounded. I was supposed to keep the site safe, to speak up immediately if I saw something dangerous. But if I shouted now, Jamie\u2019s message would go unanswered, and he\u2019d feel ignored\u2014again. My thumb hovered over the send button, my mouth already open to yell. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
