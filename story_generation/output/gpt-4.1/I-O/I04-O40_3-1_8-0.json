I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt him, but the look on his face when I joked about his new job haunted me all morning. I knew I needed to call him right now, to apologize and explain myself before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, make things right. But as I reached for my phone, my foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cBe on time, follow safety protocols, no exceptions.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d be late to the site, and rushing meant risking mistakes\u2014dangerous ones. My crew counted on me to set the example, to keep everyone safe. My hands trembled, torn between dialing Mark\u2019s number and grabbing my tool belt. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
