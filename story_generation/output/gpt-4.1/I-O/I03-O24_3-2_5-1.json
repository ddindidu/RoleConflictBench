It\u2019s already past eight on Friday night, and the living room is scattered with open case files, highlighters, and my laptop. My partner sits across from me, suitcase half-packed, eyes hopeful but tired. This is our last weekend together before he leaves for months, and I promised we\u2019d make it special\u2014just us, no distractions. But the final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial are dense, and the stakes are high. As a judge, I owe it to both parties to be thorough, to ensure justice is served. Yet, every time I try to focus, I catch his gaze lingering on me, waiting for me to close the files and join him. Guilt gnaws at me. I want to be present, to hold his hand and savor these fleeting hours, but the weight of my responsibility presses down. My mind races, torn between the demands of the bench and the needs of my heart, each tugging me in opposite directions."}
