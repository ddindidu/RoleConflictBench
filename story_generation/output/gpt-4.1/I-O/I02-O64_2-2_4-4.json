My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only one we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long work trip. She\u2019d planned a cozy dinner, and I promised I\u2019d be home by seven, no matter what. But as the clock in the store crept toward closing, a customer approached my register, clutching a blender and no receipt. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had drilled it into us: no exceptions, or risk a write-up. The customer pleaded, frustration rising, and I could feel the line behind her growing. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014her name lighting up the screen. I imagined her waiting, the table set, candles flickering. My heart pounded as I weighed the rules I was supposed to uphold against the promise I\u2019d made to her. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood there, caught between the person I wanted to be for her and the employee I was expected to be for my job."}
