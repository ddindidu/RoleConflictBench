I miss you.\u201d My heart fluttered. We\u2019d both been so busy, but finally, our schedules aligned. I wanted to make it special, to show him he mattered. As I started to reply, the pharmacy bell chimed. Mrs. Lee, a regular, approached the counter, clutching a new prescription. Her eyes were anxious. \u201cCan you explain how to take this? I\u2019m worried about the side effects.\u201d I smiled reassuringly, but inside, tension twisted my stomach. I knew she needed time and careful explanation\u2014she trusted me to guide her. But I also knew Alex was waiting, hoping I\u2019d choose him, hoping I\u2019d make us a priority. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of his arms and the responsibility I felt for my patient. Both needed me, both deserved my attention. I stared at my phone, then at Mrs. Lee, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
