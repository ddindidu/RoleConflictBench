The space was personal, a quiet retreat I\u2019d longed to perfect, and I wanted every line to reflect my own needs\u2014simple, functional, nothing extravagant. Just as I began to outline the new window placement, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, anxiously asking for help with a critical project at her firm. She was about to submit plans for a hospital wing, and she needed my guidance to avoid costly errors.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a mentor, I was expected to share every ounce of my knowledge, to walk Maya through the intricacies of safety codes and patient flow, knowing a misstep could have real consequences. But as an architect, I craved this rare moment to focus on my own space, to design without the pressure of others\u2019 expectations. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide Maya and the longing to nurture my own creative vision. The pencil trembled in my hand as I stared at the unfinished sketch, caught between two roles that demanded all of me, right now."}
