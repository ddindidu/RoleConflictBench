As a colleague, I\u2019m expected to be there, to listen and contribute, especially since today\u2019s agenda includes crucial project updates that won\u2019t be shared later. My phone rings, and I recognize the number: Mr. Harris, a long-time customer. I answer, slipping into my telemarketer role, but he\u2019s already upset, his voice sharp as he questions the legitimacy of our latest offer. He demands a detailed explanation, refusing to be brushed off. My heart pounds. I know I can\u2019t rush him; handling objections thoroughly is part of my job, and my supervisor tracks every call. But the meeting is about to start, and my absence will be noticed. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my team counting on my presence, my customer demanding my full attention. I grip the phone tighter, torn between the two roles, each pulling me in a different direction, and I can\u2019t see how to satisfy both."}
