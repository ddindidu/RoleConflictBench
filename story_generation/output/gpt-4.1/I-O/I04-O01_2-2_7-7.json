I read it twice\u2014he thought I was annoyed with him, all because my last text was too blunt. His reply was clipped, and I could feel the hurt behind his words. I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, fix things before they fester.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my work line rang. It was the contractor for the new library project, and I could hear the urgency in his voice. There was a delivery mix-up, and if I didn\u2019t sort it out now, the whole schedule would slip. As the architect, it was my job to keep everything running smoothly, to be available and decisive.\n\nI stared at both phones, feeling the pressure build in my chest. My friend needed reassurance, but my team needed direction. I couldn\u2019t do both at once. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a good friend and a responsible architect, knowing that whichever call I made first, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
