The phone queue is still packed, and I know management is watching every second I\u2019m away. But as I reach for my headset, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Alex: \u201cCan you talk? Had a rough day.\u201d I look over at the closed door to our bedroom, picturing him sitting on the edge of the bed, shoulders slumped, replaying the harsh words from his boss. He needs me to listen, to reassure him, to be present. But if I take my break now and go over the allotted time, I\u2019ll get another warning. My supervisor made it clear\u2014no exceptions, not even for emergencies. My heart aches, torn between the urge to comfort Alex and the pressure to keep my job. I stare at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
