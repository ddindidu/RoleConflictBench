He read the message, his face falling as he slumped beside me. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like my proposal,\u201d he muttered, eyes glassy. I reached for his hand, feeling the weight of his disappointment. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him that he was more than his work. But just then, my own phone vibrated\u2014an urgent alert from the lab. The gas chromatograph was issuing warning signals, and if I didn\u2019t check it soon, there could be a dangerous leak. My mind raced. He needed me, but so did my lab. I could see the expectation in his eyes, silently pleading for comfort, while my training screamed at me to act fast for everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, torn between the person I love and the responsibility I can\u2019t ignore."}
