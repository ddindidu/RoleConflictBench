I smiled warmly, hoping to ease the tension, asking gentle questions about their interests. Just as Jamie started to relax, my phone buzzed. It was work\u2014my supervisor had patched through a call from Mr. Harris, a long-time customer, who was furious about our latest promotion. He demanded answers, his voice sharp and impatient. I could hear the expectation in his tone: I needed to be professional, persuasive, and unflappable, ready to counter every objection. But Jamie was right in front of me, expecting kindness and undivided attention, and I could see them shrinking back as I excused myself to take the call. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both roles, feeling the weight of conflicting demands\u2014one for empathy and presence, the other for assertiveness and control. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet."}
