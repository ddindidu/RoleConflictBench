My heart ached to comfort him, to sit beside him and listen, to reassure him that he was more than his boss\u2019s words. But my phone buzzed insistently on the kitchen counter\u2014a client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I remembered the email from earlier: a question about a confusing line item on their invoice, and they needed clarification before the end of the day. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be the supportive girlfriend Mark needed and the responsibility to respond promptly and professionally as an accountant. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectation to be present for Mark clashing with the demand to maintain my reputation at work. My hands trembled as I picked up my phone, glancing back at Mark, who looked so alone. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I stood frozen, caught between love and duty, unsure which role to answer first."}
