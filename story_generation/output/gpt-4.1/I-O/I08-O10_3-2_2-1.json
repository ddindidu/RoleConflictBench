My desk was covered in spreadsheets and receipts, and my mind was racing through numbers, double-checking every entry. Suddenly, I heard muffled sobs from the break room. I peeked in and saw Jamie, someone I\u2019d chatted with a few times at office gatherings, hunched over the table, tears streaming down her face. My instinct as an acquaintance was to go over, offer comfort, and listen. I knew she\u2019d expect a friendly face, someone to show they cared. But the accountant in me felt the weight of the looming deadline, the expectation to deliver flawless records, and the knowledge that any delay could throw off the entire team. My heart tugged me toward Jamie, but my mind screamed about the unfinished work. I stood frozen in the doorway, torn between being the supportive acquaintance she needed and the diligent accountant my job demanded, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
