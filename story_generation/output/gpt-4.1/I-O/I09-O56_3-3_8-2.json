It was Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, reminding me to keep an eye out for her package deliveries while she was away. She sounded worried about the planned power outage, and I promised to help, picturing her plants wilting in the dark and her mail piling up. Just as I hung up, the bell above the salon door jingled. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids rushed in, faces tense, chattering about the schedule. I was supposed to greet them warmly, offer tea, and ease their nerves, but my mind kept drifting to Mrs. Lee\u2019s apartment. What if the power cut happened while I was with clients? What if her freezer defrosted, or a delivery was left outside too long? I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my neighborly promise and my professional duty. My hands trembled as I reached for the bride\u2019s veil, torn between slipping away to check on Mrs. Lee\u2019s place and staying to calm my anxious clients."}
