As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate, never overfilling or leaving a mess for others. But today, I hesitated, wondering if I should wait until next week to avoid hogging the space. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my first client was due in five minutes. I rushed to the salon, still thinking about the bins. As I set up my station, a nervous woman entered, glancing around uncertainly. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to greet clients warmly, put them at ease, and make them feel welcome. But my mind kept drifting back to the trash bins and whether my neighbors would be annoyed if I filled them up. I forced a smile, trying to focus on the client, but the tug-of-war between being a good neighbor and a good hairdresser gnawed at me, leaving me torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
