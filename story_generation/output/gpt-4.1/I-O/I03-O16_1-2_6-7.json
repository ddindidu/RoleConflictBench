He thought I\u2019d promised to spend the weekend with him, but I remembered mentioning my on-call shift. Now he was upset, and I could feel the tension rising between us. I wanted to call him, to explain and smooth things over, to be the understanding girlfriend who could resolve our misunderstandings before they grew into something bigger.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my pager buzzed. It was the nurse from the ward\u2014my patient with lupus was having a flare, and her chart needed urgent review. She depended on me to adjust her medications, to make sure her treatment was precise and safe. I could hear the expectation in the nurse\u2019s voice: the doctor must act quickly and decisively.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the two worlds. My boyfriend needed reassurance and clarity, my patient needed my expertise and attention. Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
