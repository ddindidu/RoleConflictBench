My mentee\u2019s anxious message blinked at the top: \u201cCan we talk before my interview? I really need your advice.\u201d She was counting on me to help her through this pivotal moment, and I knew how much this opportunity meant to her. But just as I started to type a reassuring reply, the taxi app chimed\u2014my next passenger was already waiting, sending urgent texts: \u201cWhere are you? I need to get to the airport now!\u201d The map showed heavy traffic, and I was still ten minutes away. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. As a mentor, I wanted to be present, to encourage and guide, to help her grow. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt, reliable, and professional.

My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I did next."}
