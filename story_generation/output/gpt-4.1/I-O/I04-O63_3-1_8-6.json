I remember the offhand joke I made at lunch, and the way Sam\u2019s face fell. I know I need to call and apologize, to explain I never meant to hurt him. As his friend, I owe him honesty and care, and I can\u2019t let this misunderstanding fester. But I glance at the clock\u2014my break is scheduled in ten minutes, and as a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to stick to the schedule, even if the call volume is light and supervisors are more relaxed today. If I take my break early, I risk setting a bad example or getting a warning. If I wait, Sam might think I don\u2019t care, and the guilt gnaws at me. My headset feels heavier than usual as I stare at my phone, torn between the rules of my job and the needs of my friend, my heart pounding as I weigh which role I\u2019m about to let down."}
