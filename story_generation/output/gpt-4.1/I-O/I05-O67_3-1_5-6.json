As a mentor, I was supposed to guide Jamie, the new recruit, through every step of the ambulance transfer, explaining protocols and answering questions. Jamie\u2019s eyes were fixed on me, eager and anxious, hanging on my every word as I described the importance of pre-shift vehicle checks. But as the ambulance driver, I was also expected to get us to the satellite station safely and on time, navigating the busy city streets with full attention. My mind raced\u2014should I keep talking, risking distraction, or focus solely on the road, leaving Jamie\u2019s questions unanswered? The radio crackled, adding to the pressure. I could feel Jamie\u2019s expectation for guidance, but the city traffic demanded my undivided focus. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between my duty to teach and my obligation to drive safely, knowing that a single mistake in either role could have serious consequences."}
