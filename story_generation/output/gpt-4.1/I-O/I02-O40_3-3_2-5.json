My phone buzzed again\u2014a message from her, just a simple \u201cCan you come over?\u201d I knew she needed me. Her father\u2019s passing had left her adrift, and I was supposed to be her anchor, the one who listened, who held her when the tears came. But tomorrow, I had to start the biggest project of my career. The plans were complicated, and I hadn\u2019t even finished reading through the technical documents. If I messed up, it would cost the company and my reputation. My heart twisted as I stared at the phone, guilt gnawing at me. I wanted to be there for her, to hold her hand and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But the weight of the blueprints pressed down on me, reminding me of everything at stake. I closed my eyes, torn between the person I loved and the work I\u2019d built my life around, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
