My mentor had emailed me a list of articles to read\u2014optional, she said, but I knew she expected me to be prepared for our next meeting. The deadline was weeks away, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. At the same time, my shift as a telemarketer demanded my full attention. Calls came in steadily, most customers polite, some with questions I could answer in my sleep. Still, I felt the pressure to be alert, to handle every objection smoothly, to keep my numbers up. Between calls, my mind drifted to the unread articles, guilt gnawing at me. Should I sneak in a few paragraphs between calls, risking a slip in my performance? Or focus on the job, knowing I\u2019d fall behind in my mentorship? The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt the tension building, unsure which role to prioritize as the next call lit up my screen."}
