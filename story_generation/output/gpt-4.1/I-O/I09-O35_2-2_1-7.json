I\u2019d just moved in, and I wanted to make a good impression\u2014be the kind of neighbor people smiled at in the elevator.

The new procedures were strict, and missing the briefing could mean a formal warning. I hesitated, torn between the warm, neighborly gesture I\u2019d planned and the rigid professionalism my job demanded.
