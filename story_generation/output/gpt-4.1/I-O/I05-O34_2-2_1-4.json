She\u2019s been struggling with the new project, and I promised her I\u2019d review her latest draft before our call. My inbox pings: \u201cCan we talk before noon? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d I want to be there for her, to offer the guidance she needs, just as my own mentor once did for me. But as I open her file, the radio crackles. \u201cTower, this is Delta 142, requesting climb instructions. Cloud tops are building fast.\u201d I look at the radar\u2014storm cells are rising, and three more pilots are waiting for my direction. My headset feels heavier. I know the pilots depend on me for clear, immediate instructions; their safety is in my hands. But Maya is counting on me, too, and I can\u2019t bear to let her down. My mind races, torn between the urgent demands of the sky and the quiet responsibility of mentorship. I hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both need me\u2014right now."}
