The conversation drifted to the recent decisions made by Mark, our mutual colleague. The group\u2019s tone shifted, voices lowering as they began to dissect his choices, some comments bordering on gossip. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to either join in or at least not disrupt the flow, but I\u2019ve always believed in steering clear of negative talk about others.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the new safety standard update was due for the next product release. As the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail was compliant and that we had the documentation to prove it. The deadline was tight, and I needed Mark\u2019s input to finalize the evidence. But here I was, caught between the urge to defend him and the risk of alienating the group whose cooperation I needed for the project. My mind raced, torn between upholding my values as an acquaintance and fulfilling my duty as an engineer. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet."}
