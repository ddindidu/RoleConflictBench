The text from my friend stings: \u201cDid you really mean what you said earlier?\u201d I replay my careless comment in my mind, realizing how much it must have hurt. As a friend, I know I should call her right now, apologize, and talk it through before the misunderstanding festers. But I\u2019m standing behind my client, hands tangled in her hair, thick with product buildup. She\u2019s waiting for me to work my magic, expecting a relaxing wash and a fresh style. I can\u2019t just leave her mid-appointment\u2014she\u2019s paid for my full attention, and her hair needs serious care before I can even think about cutting. My phone buzzes again. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me. My friend needs me, but so does my client. I grip the comb, my mind racing, caught between the urge to fix my mistake as a friend and my duty as a professional hairdresser."}
