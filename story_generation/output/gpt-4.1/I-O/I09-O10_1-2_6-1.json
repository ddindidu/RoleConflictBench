As an accountant, month-end always meant long hours and laser focus. My spreadsheets were open, numbers blurring together as I double-checked every entry. The deadline was tomorrow, and I couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake. Just as I was about to dive into the final reconciliation, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She was expecting a package this afternoon and asked if I could receive it for her\u2014she\u2019d missed the last two deliveries, and the item was important.\n\nI looked at my laptop, then at the window, picturing the delivery truck pulling up. As a neighbor, I wanted to help; we\u2019d always looked out for each other, and I knew how frustrating missed packages could be.
