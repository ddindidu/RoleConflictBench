My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for me in the staff lounge, anxiously hoping for advice on whether to accept a new position that could change her career. She needed my full attention, my structured guidance, and the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But as I walked down the hallway, I heard Mrs. Thompson\u2019s soft voice calling from her room. She\u2019d been especially lonely today, her family unable to visit, and I knew she looked forward to our daily chats. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer her comfort, to sit by her side and listen, even if just for a few minutes. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014Sarah\u2019s future on one side, Mrs. Thompson\u2019s present loneliness on the other. I stood frozen in the corridor, torn between the urgent need to mentor and the quiet, persistent call to care. The expectations of both roles pressed in, and I felt the ache of not knowing how to be enough for both at once."}
