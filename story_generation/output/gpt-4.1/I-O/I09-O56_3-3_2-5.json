As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to be friendly, polite, and understanding, even when the tension is thick enough to cut with scissors. I tried to smooth things over, offering a smile and a few reassuring words, but I could feel the eyes on me, waiting for me to take a side or apologize for something I hadn\u2019t done.\n\nMinutes later, I was back at the salon, sweeping up hair and glancing at the clock, eager to close. That\u2019s when my last client of the day stormed to the mirror, her voice rising. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for! I can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d As a hairdresser, I\u2019m supposed to stay calm, listen, and fix things, no matter how tired or stressed I am. But my mind kept drifting back to the neighbors, wondering if they\u2019d see me as rude if I rushed out, or if my client would leave a bad review if I didn\u2019t give her more time. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between two worlds."}
