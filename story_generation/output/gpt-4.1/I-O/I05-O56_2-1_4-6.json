My mentee was waiting in the back room, eager for the session I\u2019d promised\u2014an hour to walk her through the techniques she\u2019d need for the big project next week. I\u2019d spent my lunch break preparing notes, determined to give her the guidance I wished I\u2019d had. But just as I was about to start, my next client arrived early, sliding into my chair with a bright smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I washed my hair right before coming,\u201d she said, running her fingers through her damp, clean locks.\n\nSalon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut, no exceptions. My manager expected consistency, and clients expected the full pampering experience. But my mentee was waiting, and I\u2019d promised her my undivided attention. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding I follow protocol and deliver the best service, the other urging me to be present and supportive, to share what I know. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind racing, torn between the rules of my profession and the responsibility I felt as a mentor."}
