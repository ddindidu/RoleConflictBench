My phone vibrates with a message from Alex: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019s been devastated since his brother passed away last week, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, no matter what. My heart aches to hear his voice, to offer comfort, to be the girlfriend he needs right now.\n\nBut the clock on my screen blinks, reminding me that my break isn\u2019t for another hour. The compliance system tracks every second I\u2019m not on a call, and last month, I got a warning for stepping away without logging out. If I leave my station now, even for a few minutes, I risk another flag\u2014maybe even my job.\n\nI stare at the screen, torn. My partner needs me, but so does my job. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I feel trapped between being the support Alex deserves and the employee my boss demands. My finger hovers over the \u201clog out\u201d button, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
