She\u2019d suggested some extra reading, saying it would help me understand patient care more deeply. The deadline wasn\u2019t strict, but I knew she expected me to take initiative and impress her. I wanted to prove I was serious about learning, that I could be the kind of mentee she\u2019d be proud of.\n\nBut my shift as a nursing assistant was relentless. Just now, I\u2019d checked on Mr. Harris, who was recovering from surgery. His blood pressure and temperature were a little high\u2014not alarming, but not quite normal either. I was supposed to record his vitals and keep a close eye on him, maybe even alert the nurse if things didn\u2019t settle. The ward was busy, and I was already behind on rounds.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions: the urge to sneak away for a few minutes to read, to show my mentor I was dedicated, and the responsibility to stay vigilant with my patients, especially Mr. Harris. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart racing as I tried to decide which expectation I should meet first."}
