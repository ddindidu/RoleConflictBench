She was about to accept a job offer, and she needed my guidance\u2014right now. I could hear the weight in her words, the way she clung to every bit of advice I offered. I knew how much this moment mattered for her future, and I wanted to give her the thoughtful, structured guidance she deserved.\n\nBut as I paced, I caught sight of a slick, glistening puddle on the walkway\u2014oil, maybe, or some chemical. It wasn\u2019t big, but it was right where the crew would be hauling materials in a few minutes. My supervisor always drilled into us: safety first, no exceptions. I was expected to grab the mop and warning sign, clean it up immediately, and keep everyone safe.\n\nMy mentee\u2019s voice wavered, waiting for my answer.
