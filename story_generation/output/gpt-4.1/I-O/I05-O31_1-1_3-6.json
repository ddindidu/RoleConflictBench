She\u2019d parked in a spot that was technically restricted, but only for another ten minutes. \u201cIf you were on duty, would you ticket someone for being a little early or late?\u201d she asked, her tone light but her eyes searching. As her mentor, I wanted to be open, to share the nuances of the job\u2014the gray areas, the moments when discretion mattered. But as a police officer, I was expected to uphold the rules with integrity, to treat everyone fairly, no matter how small the infraction. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the urge to guide her honestly, and the duty to model unwavering fairness. My mind raced, caught between the trust she placed in me as a mentor and the example I was supposed to set as an officer. I hesitated, the answer caught in my throat, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
