Upper management will review it tomorrow.\u201d My heart thudded. I owed my mentor so much\u2014she\u2019d vouched for me, and I couldn\u2019t let her down. But my headset buzzed, and the call queue blinked red. As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle every customer with patience, especially now, with the new service launch. The script barely scratched the surface, and prospects kept firing technical questions I couldn\u2019t answer. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed: \u201cDon\u2019t transfer calls.
