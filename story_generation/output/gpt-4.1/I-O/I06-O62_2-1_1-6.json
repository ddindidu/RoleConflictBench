The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected it to be polished and ready for review. Every few minutes, my eyes darted from the blinking cursor to the pool below, where kids splashed and parents chatted on the sidelines. I noticed a group of younger swimmers edging into the shallow area, unsupervised. My training as a lifeguard screamed at me to intervene, to enforce the safety rules and keep everyone in line. But the code wouldn\u2019t write itself, and I could already imagine my mentor\u2019s disappointment if I showed up unprepared. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands\u2014should I close the laptop and patrol the pool, or trust the kids for a few more minutes while I finished this tricky function? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat frozen, torn between duty and ambition."}
