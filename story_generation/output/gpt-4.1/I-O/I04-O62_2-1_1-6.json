It was Jamie, my best friend, and her voice trembled when I answered. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she whispered, barely holding back tears. I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to be the friend I always promised I\u2019d be. But as she started pouring her heart out about her fight with Mark, I caught sight of a group of kids slipping under the rope into the shallow area, unsupervised. My training screamed at me: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, don\u2019t let your guard down. But Jamie\u2019s voice in my ear was desperate, raw, and I could almost feel her pain. I gripped the phone tighter, torn between the duty to my friend and the responsibility to the swimmers. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the pool, caught between two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me in this moment."}
