His car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he sounded scared. \u201cCan you come get me? Please, I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014almost midnight. I was about to grab my keys when my work phone chimed. An assistant from the firm, new and eager, messaged me: \u201cCan you send me the client files for the Miller case? I need to prep for tomorrow.\u201d I knew she didn\u2019t have clearance, and sharing those files would violate every ethical rule I\u2019d sworn to uphold. But she was insistent, and the partners expected me to be a team player, to help the new staff settle in. My heart pounded. Sam needed me, but so did my job. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by loyalty and friendship, the other by duty and professional integrity. I stood in my hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the desperate voice of my friend and the silent, weighty expectations of my profession."}
