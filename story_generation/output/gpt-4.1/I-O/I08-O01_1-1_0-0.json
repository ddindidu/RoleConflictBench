He smiled, and I felt the familiar tug to be friendly, to nod and maybe even stop for a quick chat. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected\u2014be approachable, keep things light. But as I returned his smile, my mind snagged on the building plans I\u2019d just reviewed. There were minor inconsistencies\u2014nothing urgent, but as the architect, I\u2019m supposed to catch everything, ensure every detail is safe and compliant. I could mention it to Mark, who works in the facilities team, but would that make me seem uptight or unfriendly? Would I ruin the easy rapport we\u2019d started to build? My heart thudded with the pressure of both roles: the approachable acquaintance and the vigilant architect. I hesitated, caught between the urge to keep things pleasant and the responsibility to speak up, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in as Mark drew closer."}
