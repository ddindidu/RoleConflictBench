My acquaintance, Mark, had texted: \u201cHey, can you help me move some boxes today? I\u2019m really stuck.\u201d I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to ask, and I\u2019d always tried to be there for him when I could. But right now, I had a passenger in the backseat, nervously checking her watch every few minutes. She had an international flight to catch, and the roads were a mess\u2014slick with ice, traffic crawling. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get her to the airport safely and on time, no matter the weather. But Mark\u2019s message tugged at me. He was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, my mind racing between the responsibility I felt toward my passenger and the loyalty I owed to Mark. The snow kept falling, and I felt trapped between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
