The team meeting was in ten minutes\u2014the last chance to voice concerns before our department\u2019s new policy was finalized. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about the outcome. My manager had already hinted that my input was crucial. But at the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due in court for a procedural hearing. As a lawyer, I was supposed to represent my client, even if today\u2019s matter was minor and could be postponed with a quick call. Still, I knew my client valued my reliability, and the judge expected punctuality. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own consequences if I failed. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my team and duty to my client, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
