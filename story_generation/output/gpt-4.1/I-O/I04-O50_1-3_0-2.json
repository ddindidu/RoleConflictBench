Can you talk?\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to let him vent, maybe even make him laugh. I started typing a reply, but before I could hit send, my work pager shrieked. The ICU\u2019s life-support device was down, flashing urgent red codes. I was the only technician on call. My mind raced: Jamie counted on me to be there, to show I cared, but the hospital needed me to act fast, to keep someone alive. I stared at my phone, thumb hovering over the keyboard, heart pounding. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s voice, tired and hopeful, but the image of the blinking machine and the patient it supported pressed in on me. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t split myself in two. The weight of their expectations pressed down, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between being a good friend and a responsible repairer."}
