We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014this time about money, about how I spend too much, about how he never seems to understand how hard I work. I knew I should call him, try to smooth things over, but my shift as a housekeeping cleaner had just started, and my client\u2019s kitchen was waiting. As I opened the supply cupboard, my heart sank. The specialized cleaner for the marble counters was gone, and I needed it for the next task. My boss expected me to manage supplies, to never let this happen. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I call my boyfriend now, try to fix things before he left for work, or should I rush out to buy the cleaner, risking being late and getting in trouble at my job? Both roles demanded my attention, both felt urgent, and I stood there, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
