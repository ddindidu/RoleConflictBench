They\u2019d been running hot all day, and I knew skipping the last service window was a mistake. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Make sure they\u2019re running smooth by tomorrow.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my boyfriend: \u201cRough day. Can we talk tonight?\u201d I pictured his tired face, the way he\u2019d lean into me for comfort. He never asked for much, but I knew he needed me to listen, to be present, to reassure him. \n\nBut the machines needed me too. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my team down, risking a breakdown that could halt production. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting him down, leaving him alone with his worries. My heart tugged in two directions, the demands of both worlds pressing in, and I stood there, torn, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
