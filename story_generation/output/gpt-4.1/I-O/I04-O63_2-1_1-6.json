It was Jamie, my closest friend, and I could hear the strain in their voice before they even finished saying hello. \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk,\u201d they said, their words trembling. As a friend, I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break now\u2014my only real chance to step away from the headset and breathe before the next round of calls. The call volume was light, and my supervisor had said we could be flexible, but I also knew that if I missed my break, I\u2019d be running on empty for the rest of my shift. My heart twisted as Jamie started to explain the fight with their partner, their voice cracking. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the employee I was supposed to be."}
