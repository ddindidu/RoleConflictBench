She was about to present her findings to the board, a moment that could launch her career. She needed reassurance, guidance\u2014my encouragement to believe in herself. I could hear the tremor in her words, the weight of her expectations pressing on me. Just as I began to offer advice, my radio crackled: a call for an ambulance, a patient with a broken arm, pain management needed immediately. My heart raced. As a mentor, I wanted to stay, to help her through this pivotal moment. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to respond without delay, to provide care and comfort to someone in pain. The clock ticked. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent in its own way. My hands shook as I weighed the voices\u2014one pleading for guidance, the other for help."}
