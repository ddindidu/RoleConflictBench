During a lull between calls, I noticed a text from a mutual friend\u2014she\u2019d shared something sensitive about a colleague, something that could easily spiral into office gossip if it got out. As an acquaintance, I always prided myself on not fueling rumors or speaking ill of others, but the information gnawed at me, tempting me to confide in someone, if only to process the shock.\n\nAt the same time, the call volume was unusually light, and my supervisor had just announced we could take our breaks whenever we wanted. I could step away, clear my head, and maybe even talk to someone about what I\u2019d learned. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my scheduled breaks and not abuse the flexibility. The urge to share the news clashed with my desire to maintain my integrity as an acquaintance, while the freedom at work made it all too easy to act on impulse. I sat there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
