She was new to the force, eager to learn, and I\u2019d promised to guide her through every step. As her mentor, I wanted to share everything I knew\u2014how to handle the paperwork, how to approach drivers with respect, and, most importantly, how to use discretion wisely. But as a police officer, I was expected to act with unwavering integrity and fairness, applying the law equally to everyone.\n\nSarah looked back at me, uncertainty in her eyes. The car belonged to a local shop owner who\u2019d just run inside to help a customer in distress. Technically, a ticket was warranted, but I knew that a little understanding could go a long way in building community trust. My duty as a mentor was to teach Sarah the nuances of the job, but my badge demanded impartiality. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, my mind racing as I tried to reconcile the expectations. I took a deep breath, torn between guiding Sarah with compassion and upholding the strict letter of the law."}
