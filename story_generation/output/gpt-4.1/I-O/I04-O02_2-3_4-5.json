The subject line alone\u2014\u201cImmediate Safety Concerns: Action Required\u201d\u2014made my stomach clench. As the lead engineer, I knew the entire plant\u2019s operations depended on my response. If I didn\u2019t address the flagged issues right now, we could face a shutdown, fines, or worse. I was already drafting a plan when my phone rang again\u2014this time, it was Sam, my oldest friend. His voice was shaky. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport. Can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours. Please, I have to make it.\u201d\n\nI stared at my screen, torn.
