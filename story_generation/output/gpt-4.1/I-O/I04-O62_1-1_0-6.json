Can you talk?\u201d I glanced at the pool, where a group of kids was inching toward the shallow end, giggling and splashing. As a friend, I wanted to be there for Jamie, to listen and offer comfort like I always did. But as a lifeguard, I was responsible for every person in the water, and I\u2019d already warned those kids once about staying in supervised areas. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending Jamie a quick reply and keeping my eyes glued to the pool. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s voice, hoping for a distraction, while the kids\u2019 laughter reminded me of the rules I was supposed to enforce. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my friend needed me, but so did the swimmers. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I hesitated, caught between the pull of friendship and the duty of safety."}
