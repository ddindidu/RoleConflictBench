    "Story": "I was sitting on the lifeguard chair, scanning the pool, when my phone buzzed with a message from Mia. She was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten we were supposed to go hiking this weekend, and she thought I\u2019d made plans with my friends instead. I could feel the tension in her words, and I knew she expected me to call her right away, to talk things through and reassure her. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend would do: resolve the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger.\n\nBut as I glanced up, I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end without an adult nearby. The rules were clear\u2014no unsupervised swimming, especially in the shallow area where accidents could happen in a blink. My supervisor expected me to enforce those rules, to keep everyone safe, no exceptions. I felt my heart pounding, torn between the urgent need to text Mia back and the responsibility to keep my eyes on the pool. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the stress building as I tried to figure out what to do next."
