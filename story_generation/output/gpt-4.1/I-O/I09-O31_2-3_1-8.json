I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the family next door. As I walked over, cake in hand, I saw Mr. Lee, my new neighbor, watering his garden. We exchanged smiles, and I introduced myself. He seemed warm and welcoming, and I felt a sense of relief. But then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the station. I was being called to testify in court about a case involving a burglary. The suspect was Mr. Lee\u2019s son.\n\nSuddenly, the cake felt heavy in my hands. As a neighbor, I wanted to be friendly, to build trust and goodwill. But as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to provide honest testimony, even if it meant hurting my new neighbor\u2019s family. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between kindness and duty, wondering how I could possibly fulfill both roles without betraying one."}
