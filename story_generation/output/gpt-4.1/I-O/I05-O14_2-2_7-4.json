As a mentor, I knew how much this moment meant to Priya, my mentee. She was on the verge of a major career leap, and she\u2019d asked for my guidance on her presentation. She needed my encouragement, my insights, and my time\u2014right now, before her big interview tomorrow. But as a scientist, I was also under pressure. The department meeting was in two hours, and I hadn\u2019t finished summarizing the preliminary data from our latest experiment. The results were promising, but the documentation had to be precise\u2014any error could mislead the team and set us back weeks. My inbox pinged: a reminder from my supervisor about the meeting. At the same time, Priya knocked softly on my door, her eyes hopeful. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My mind raced, torn between nurturing someone\u2019s growth and upholding the integrity of my research.
