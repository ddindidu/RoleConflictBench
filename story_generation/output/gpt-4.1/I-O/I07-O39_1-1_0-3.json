Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence might be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem uninterested or unreliable. But as I looked around the construction site, dust and debris scattered across my section, I felt the weight of my other role. As a laborer, I was responsible for leaving my area spotless and safe before clocking out. If I skipped the sweep-up, someone could get hurt, or I\u2019d be letting my crew down. My supervisor always emphasized safety and teamwork, and I took pride in that. The pressure built inside me\u2014should I rush through the clean-up and risk missing something, or skip the meeting and hope the recording would be enough? I could feel my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations from both sides, torn between being a good colleague and a responsible laborer."}
