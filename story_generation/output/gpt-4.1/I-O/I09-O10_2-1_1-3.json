I wrapped it carefully, rehearsing a friendly greeting in my head, determined to make a good impression. As I was about to step out, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the online seminar about upcoming tax law changes. As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated, especially with rumors of new regulations that could affect my clients. The seminar was starting in ten minutes, and missing it could mean falling behind on important compliance issues. But if I waited until after, I might miss the chance to catch my neighbors at home, and the cake would no longer be fresh. I stood in the hallway, cake in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me\u2014one to be a warm, welcoming neighbor, the other to be a diligent, responsible accountant. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
