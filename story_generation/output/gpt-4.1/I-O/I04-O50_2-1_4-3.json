It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. My flight\u2019s in two hours. Can you check and bring it to the airport if it\u2019s there?\u201d I could hear the desperation in his voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. As a friend, I wanted to drop everything and help. But as I hung up, my supervisor walked by, reminding me that the machines needed to be cleaned and serviced today, ahead of next week\u2019s shutdown. The schedule was tight, and any delay could throw off the whole maintenance plan. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014Sam counting on me in a crisis, and my team relying on me to keep the machines running smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the steady demands of my job, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
