She reminded me that the HOA inspection was happening in an hour, and my bike, which I\u2019d left in the corridor, could get us both cited for blocking the emergency exit. I knew how strict the HOA was\u2014last year, someone got fined for a single pair of shoes. As a neighbor, I felt responsible for keeping the shared space clear and not causing trouble for others. But right then, I noticed a swimmer in the middle lane, their strokes growing uneven, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to stay focused, to never leave my post, especially when someone might be in trouble. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I dash home for two minutes to move the bike and be a good neighbor, or stay glued to my chair, eyes locked on the water, fulfilling my duty as a lifeguard? My heart pounded as I weighed the risks, torn between the expectations of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
