It\u2019s Mia\u2014her message is curt, asking why I didn\u2019t mention my weekend shift when we made plans. I can almost hear the disappointment in her words. As her boyfriend, I know I should call her, clear up the misunderstanding, and reassure her that I care. But the supervisor is already calling us in, reminding us that today\u2019s briefing on new safety protocols is mandatory. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, putting passengers at risk. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the duty to my job and the need to fix things with Mia. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demand my full attention right now. The pressure builds inside me, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
