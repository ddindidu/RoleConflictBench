The reading wasn\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to impress her, show that I was committed and eager to learn. The site was noisy, but I managed to focus, highlighting a few lines that might come up in our next meeting. Just as I was getting into the flow, I glanced up and noticed a thin sheen of liquid spreading across the walkway. It wasn\u2019t much, but I knew from experience how quickly someone could slip and get hurt. My supervisor always emphasized safety first\u2014no exceptions. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I stopped reading now, I\u2019d lose my momentum and maybe not get back to it later. But if I ignored the spill, I\u2019d be failing my team and risking someone\u2019s safety. My mentor\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind, but so did the responsibility of keeping the site safe. I sat there, torn, the article open in one hand and my eyes fixed on the growing puddle."}
