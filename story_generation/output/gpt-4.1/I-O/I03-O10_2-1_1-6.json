My phone buzzed with a new email\u2014an automated payment confirmation from one of our vendors. I knew I needed to send a formal reply, acknowledge receipt, and keep the records straight. It was routine, but important. Just as I started drafting my response, I heard the front door close softly. My boyfriend walked in, shoulders slumped, eyes clouded. He barely managed a weak smile before sinking beside me. I remembered he had a big meeting today, and from his expression, it hadn\u2019t gone well.\n\nHe needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to remind him of his worth. But the email notification blinked insistently on my screen, a reminder of my professional responsibilities. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close the laptop and hold his hand, and the pressure to maintain my reputation as a reliable accountant. I could feel the tension building inside me, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention."}
