My boyfriend smiles at me from across the table, his eyes hopeful. We\u2019ve both been looking forward to this night\u2014our only free evening before I leave for a week-long conference. He wants us to relax, maybe watch a movie, just be together. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the lab safety audit is tomorrow morning. I remember the loose wire on the centrifuge and the half-empty chemical bottles that need labeling. If I don\u2019t fix them tonight, the lab could fail inspection, and my supervisor will be furious. I try to focus on his stories, but my mind keeps drifting to the lab, picturing what could go wrong. He reaches for my hand, and I feel a pang of guilt. I want to be present, to give him the evening he deserves, but the responsibility of the lab tugs at me, relentless. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014his need for closeness, my duty to my work\u2014caught in the impossible space between them."}
