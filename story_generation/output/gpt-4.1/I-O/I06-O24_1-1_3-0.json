As a judge, I know I should at least skim through it now, even if the hearing is two weeks away. Thoroughness is expected, and I pride myself on never being caught unprepared. But my mind keeps drifting to the email draft open on my laptop\u2014a question about a term my mentor used in our last meeting. It\u2019s not urgent, but as a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to communicate any confusion promptly. I hesitate, feeling the weight of both roles. If I pause to email my mentor, I\u2019ll lose the momentum I need to start reviewing the file. But if I ignore the question, I risk falling behind in my mentorship, or worse, appearing disengaged. My chest tightens as I glance between the unopened file and the blinking cursor, torn between the expectations of diligence and openness, both demanding my immediate attention."}
