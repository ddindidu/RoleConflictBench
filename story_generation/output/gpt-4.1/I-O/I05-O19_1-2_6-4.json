My mentee, Sarah, had just confided in me during our coffee break, her voice tight with frustration about falling behind on her assignments. As her mentor, I wanted to sit with her, help her map out a plan, and encourage her to find balance. She needed someone to listen, to guide her through the maze of deadlines and expectations. But just as I was about to offer advice, my pager buzzed urgently\u2014Mrs. Patel was waiting at the pharmacy counter, her new prescription in hand. As a pharmacist, I knew I had to counsel her thoroughly, explain the side effects, and ensure she understood how to take her medication safely. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between nurturing Sarah\u2019s growth and fulfilling my duty to Mrs. Patel. The expectations of being a supportive mentor and a responsible pharmacist collided, leaving me paralyzed, heart pounding, as I stood between the break room and the pharmacy counter, uncertain which need to answer first."}
