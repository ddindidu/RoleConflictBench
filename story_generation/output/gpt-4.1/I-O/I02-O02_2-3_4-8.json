Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the only evening we have before I leave for a week, and I promised her I\u2019d be fully present. But as I close the chat, my inbox pings\u2014my manager\u2019s urgent reminder. The client\u2019s contract is on hold until I submit my project estimates tonight. The team is waiting, and any delay could cost us the deal. My mind races with calculations, dependencies, and risks, but my heart aches at the thought of disappointing her. I picture her setting the table, excited for our rare time together, while I\u2019m torn, laptop open, spreadsheets demanding my attention. The weight of both expectations presses down on me\u2014her hope for connection, my responsibility to the team. I can\u2019t see a way to meet both, and the clock keeps ticking, forcing me to choose which part of myself I\u2019ll let down."}
