As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or saying anything negative, especially since the conversation had turned to the recent decisions of our mutual colleague, Jamie. The group was animated, voices low but insistent, and I could feel their eyes flicking to me, expecting me to join in or at least nod along. At the same time, my lifeguard instincts kicked in\u2014I\u2019d just noticed the lane rope was frayed and dangerously close to snapping. If I didn\u2019t fix it soon, it could disrupt the swim lessons starting in ten minutes, maybe even cause an accident. But if I walked away now, it would look like I was avoiding the group, maybe even judging them. If I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to maintain the pool\u2019s safety. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to be a good colleague and the responsibility to keep everyone safe. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding my attention, and I hesitated, caught in the middle."}
