My partner lay beside me, her eyes red and distant, barely speaking since the call about her brother. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. But the project was at a delicate stage, and my team depended on me to keep things moving, even if it was just a quick check-in or a few emails. I could hear the ping of new messages, the subtle pressure of deadlines creeping closer. My mind raced between the urge to hold her and the responsibility to my team. I wanted to be the boyfriend she deserved, the one who would drop everything to comfort her. But I also felt the weight of my role as an architect, knowing that if I let things slide, the whole project could suffer. My heart ached with the impossibility of being fully present in both worlds at once, torn between the silent plea in her eyes and the relentless demands of my work."}
