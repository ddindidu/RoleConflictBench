We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014this time about our budget, and the words still echoed in my mind. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, try to resolve things before the rift grew wider. He expected me to listen, to help us find common ground, but I barely had the energy to face my own feelings, let alone his.\n\nJust then, my pager went off. Mrs. Patel, my patient, had just learned she\u2019d be living with diabetes. Her daughter was waiting for me in the room, anxious and full of questions. As her doctor, I was expected to be calm, clear, and compassionate, to guide them through the uncertainty with patience and empathy.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My heart ached for Alex, for us, but my mind was already rehearsing how to explain insulin and diet changes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
