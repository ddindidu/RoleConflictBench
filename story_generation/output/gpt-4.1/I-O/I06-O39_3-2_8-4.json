She\u2019d squeezed me in just before her flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I\u2019d prepared questions all week, determined not to waste a second. As I ducked into the break room for a quiet spot, I caught sight of a glistening puddle in the walkway\u2014oil, maybe, or water. It wasn\u2019t big, but it was right where the guys would be hauling materials in a minute. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe don\u2019t cut corners on safety. Ever.\u201d I hesitated, torn. If I stopped to clean it, I\u2019d miss the call, disrespecting my mentor\u2019s effort and maybe losing her trust. But if I ignored the spill, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be failing my crew. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, then at the spill, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
