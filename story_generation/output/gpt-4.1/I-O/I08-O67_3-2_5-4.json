It was Mark, an old friend from college. \u201cHey, my car broke down on the old Mill Road. Can you help? No one else is picking up.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew that stretch of road was deserted at this hour. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to help him, to be the reliable friend he expected me to be. But just as I was about to reply, my radio crackled: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall injury, possible fracture, 14th and Main.\u201d The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to respond immediately, to provide care and comfort to someone in pain, someone depending on me for relief and safety. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, Mark\u2019s message still open, while the ambulance keys weighed heavy in my pocket. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent, each impossible to ignore. My mind raced, torn between the friend stranded and the patient in pain, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
