It\u2019s already past eight. My girlfriend sits across from me, her suitcase half-packed, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. This is our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I promised her we\u2019d make every moment count. But my laptop is open, the final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial glaring at me. As a judge, I know I must review every detail\u2014this case is complicated, and people\u2019s lives are at stake. The court expects me to be prepared, impartial, and thorough.
