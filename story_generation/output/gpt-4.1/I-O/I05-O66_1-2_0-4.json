My passenger, a young intern from the company where I mentored, sat beside me, nervously scrolling through job postings on her phone. \u201cDo you think I should take the marketing position or wait for something in design?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above the hum of the wipers. I knew she looked up to me for guidance, and I wanted to offer thoughtful advice, to be the mentor she expected. But the traffic was a mess\u2014cars weaving unpredictably, brake lights flaring in the mist. Every instinct as a taxi driver screamed at me to focus, to anticipate the next sudden stop, to keep us both safe.

My mind raced, caught between the demands of the road and the expectations of mentorship, unsure which role to prioritize in this moment."}
