The team meeting was about to start\u2014our last chance to weigh in before the project\u2019s direction was set in stone. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I was invested in our shared goals. But just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. The external inspector\u2019s voice was urgent: safety compliance issues had surfaced, and if I didn\u2019t address them now, operations could be shut down. As the engineer, it was my responsibility to drop everything and ensure we met every standard, no matter what. My teammates were counting on me to help shape our future, but the company was counting on me to keep us running safely. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention at the exact same moment. My mind raced, caught between loyalty to my team and duty to my profession, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
