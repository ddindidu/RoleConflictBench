My mentor, who was always in high demand, had managed to squeeze in a session with me just before catching a long flight. I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a single minute of it. But as I prepared for our meeting, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the quarterly financial documents were due today. As the accountant, it was my responsibility to ensure every record was accurate and filed on time. Missing the deadline could mean trouble for the whole department. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my mentor expecting my full attention and respect for her limited time, and my team relying on me to keep our financial records spotless. My mind raced, torn between the urge to honor my mentor\u2019s rare availability and the duty to uphold my professional standards. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding more than I could give at once."}
