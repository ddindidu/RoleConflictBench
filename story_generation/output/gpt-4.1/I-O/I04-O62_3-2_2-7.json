My best friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard her sobbing\u2014her voice cracked as she told me her dad had been rushed to the hospital. She needed me to listen, to be there, to help her hold it together. I pressed the phone to my ear, murmuring comfort, trying to focus on her words. But through the glass, I caught sight of a group of teenagers at the pool, laughing and edging dangerously close to the deep end, ignoring the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My supervisor had drilled it into us: safety first, always intervene. My friend\u2019s pain pulled at me, but so did my duty to keep those kids safe. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the desperate voice in my ear and the reckless laughter outside, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
