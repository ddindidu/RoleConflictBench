He barely spoke, but I could feel the disappointment radiating from him. I wanted to reach out, to hold his hand and tell him it would be okay, that he was more than his job. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling right on schedule for their check-in. I knew they\u2019d need guidance\u2014they\u2019d already emailed twice this week with questions about the machine. If I didn\u2019t answer, they might feel neglected, or worse, misuse the equipment. But if I took the call now, I\u2019d be leaving Alex alone in his moment of need. My heart twisted as I glanced between him and my ringing phone, torn between being the supportive girlfriend he needed and the reliable machine repairer my client expected."}
