As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute my thoughts before the team finalized our project plans. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was at this stage. But as I glanced around the workshop, saw the scattered wood scraps and tools, my other role pressed in. As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping the site clean\u2014one stray nail or misplaced saw could mean a serious accident. The foreman had just reminded us that safety inspections were happening today, and any mess could lead to penalties or worse, someone getting hurt. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the duty to my crew. If I left for the meeting, the site would stay cluttered, risking safety. If I stayed to clean, I\u2019d miss my chance to shape the project\u2019s direction. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
