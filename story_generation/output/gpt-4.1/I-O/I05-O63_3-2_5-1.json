The task was critical\u2014one misstep in the process could cost a client thousands. Jamie\u2019s questions came rapid-fire, each one more detailed than the last, and I felt the weight of responsibility to share everything I knew, to ensure he understood every nuance.\n\nBut the phone lines were lighting up.
