My boyfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was our only chance to be together before he left for his business trip. I\u2019d promised him a quiet dinner, just us, no distractions. But as I was finishing up my last client at the salon, a first-time visitor frowned at her reflection, her voice trembling as she said the colour wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I couldn\u2019t let her leave unhappy; my reputation and her trust were on the line. But every minute I spent fixing her hair was a minute stolen from the precious time I\u2019d promised my boyfriend. I could feel my phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014his name lighting up the screen. My chest tightened as I glanced between the disappointed client and the clock, torn between the woman in my chair and the man waiting for me."}
