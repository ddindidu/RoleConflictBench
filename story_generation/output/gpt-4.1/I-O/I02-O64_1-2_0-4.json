I could tell she\u2019d had a rough day at work, and I wanted nothing more than to step out from behind the counter, wrap her in a hug, and ask what was wrong. But before I could even smile at her, a customer approached, holding a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d he said, but when I asked for a receipt, he shook his head. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had drilled it into us: no exceptions, no matter how sympathetic the story. \n\nMy girlfriend lingered by the door, waiting for me, her gaze flickering between me and the customer. I could feel her need for comfort, for me to be present and supportive. But the customer was growing impatient, and I knew my boss was watching. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the person I loved, and the job I needed to keep."}
