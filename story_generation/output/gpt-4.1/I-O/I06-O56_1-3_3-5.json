She was furious, gesturing at her hair and demanding to know how I could have misunderstood her instructions. My heart pounded\u2014I knew I needed to stay calm, listen, and do everything I could to make her happy, even though the clock was ticking and my coworkers were already sweeping up. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder from my mentor: \u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201d I did have a question, a small one about a term I\u2019d come across in my training, but it wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, I remembered my mentor\u2019s advice to always communicate challenges promptly. I felt torn\u2014should I step away for a moment to send a quick message, or focus entirely on my client, who clearly needed my full attention? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel the stress building as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
