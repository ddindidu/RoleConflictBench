The team\u2019s waiting on my response before they can move forward, and I know they\u2019re all watching the chat, expecting a quick reply. As a colleague, I should answer right away, keep the workflow smooth, and not leave anyone hanging. But my screen is filled with lines of code, and the profiler is screaming at me: the service is lagging, and the traces point straight to the functions I merged yesterday. As a developer, I need to focus, dig into the code, and fix this before it snowballs into a bigger outage. Every interruption risks me losing my mental thread, but every minute I don\u2019t reply, the team stalls. My inbox pings again. I stare at the blinking cursor, feeling the pressure from both sides, torn between being the responsive teammate and the focused coder."}
