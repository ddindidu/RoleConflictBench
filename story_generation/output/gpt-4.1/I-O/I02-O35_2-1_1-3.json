I had a terrible day.\u201d My heart sinks. I know she\u2019s been waiting for feedback on her project, and from her words, it\u2019s clear things didn\u2019t go well. I want nothing more than to call her, to listen, to reassure her that she\u2019s brilliant and that one bad review doesn\u2019t define her. But as the train slows into the next station, the intercom crackles. \u201cOperator, can you tell me which stop connects to the green line?\u201d a passenger asks, their voice uncertain. I see the expectant faces through the security camera, relying on me for guidance and safety. My hand hovers over the intercom button, but my phone vibrates again\u2014Mia needs me, too. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to hundreds of strangers, and the ache to be the partner Mia deserves. My mind races, torn between duty and love, as the seconds tick by and both wait for my answer."}
