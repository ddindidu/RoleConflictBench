It was Mina, an old classmate I\u2019d run into last week. \u201cHey! Can you recommend a good restaurant near the station? I\u2019m meeting someone tonight,\u201d her message read. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or unhelpful, especially since she\u2019d been so friendly.\n\nBut just as I started typing a reply, the control panel flashed a warning: minor signal delay ahead. I had to adjust the train\u2019s speed, keep an eye on the signals, and make sure the ride stayed smooth for the passengers. My job demanded my full attention; any distraction could mean a safety risk or a late arrival.\n\nI stared at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, while my other hand gripped the controls. The pressure built inside me\u2014Mina was waiting for a quick answer, but the train and its hundred passengers needed me, too. I could feel my heart race as I wrestled with the urge to help a friend and the responsibility to keep everyone safe."}
