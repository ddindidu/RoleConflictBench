On one screen, my colleague\u2019s message blinked: \u201cHey, just checking if you\u2019ll have the report ready by noon? I need it to finish my part.\u201d On the other, the accounting software reminded me that the month-end close was due in just a few hours. As a colleague, I knew how much my teammate depended on my timely work\u2014any delay from me would throw off her entire schedule. But as the accountant, I was responsible for ensuring every number in the books was accurate, and the pressure to avoid mistakes was immense. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: help my teammate keep the project on track, or focus on the financial records that couldn\u2019t afford errors.
