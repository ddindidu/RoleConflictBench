I knew she\u2019d mentioned expecting a package today, and she\u2019s always grateful when I help out\u2014last time, she missed a delivery and it was a hassle for her to reschedule. As her neighbor, I feel it\u2019s my duty to step in, maybe just bring the box inside for safekeeping. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I\u2019m supposed to follow strict safety and hygiene protocols, especially now. My gloves and mask are on, and I\u2019m not supposed to touch anything outside my assigned cleaning tasks, let alone bring in outside items that could be contaminated. I stand in the hallway, torn. If I leave the package, she might lose it or have to go through trouble again. If I pick it up, I\u2019m breaking the rules I\u2019m paid to follow, risking my job and maybe even my health. My mind races, weighing the expectations of being a good neighbor against the demands of my work. I hesitate, heart pounding, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
