She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning a quiet dinner and a movie at home. I promised her my full attention, no distractions. But as I\u2019m about to leave the office, my manager calls an emergency meeting: our new service is confusing customers, and we need to stay late to handle calls. The phone rings nonstop, each prospect with questions the script barely covers. My manager expects me to be patient, thorough, and persuasive, even as the clock ticks past six. My phone buzzes with her messages\u2014\u201cAre you on your way?\u201d\u2014and I feel the weight of her disappointment. I want to be the attentive boyfriend she deserves, but I also can\u2019t let my team down. My mind races, torn between the warmth of home and the pressure of work, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
