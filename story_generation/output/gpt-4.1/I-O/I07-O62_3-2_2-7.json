This was the final discussion before we locked in the project\u2019s direction, and my manager had made it clear that everyone\u2019s input was crucial. I was expected to participate, to show I was engaged and committed. But as I listened, my eyes kept darting to the far end of the pool, where a group of teenagers had started gathering. They were laughing, pushing each other, and I saw one of them glance at the no-diving sign before climbing onto the edge. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for enforcing safety rules, and I knew how quickly things could go wrong. I could hear my name being called in the meeting, waiting for my thoughts on the proposal, but I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the kids. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
