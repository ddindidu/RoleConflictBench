My mentor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cIf you hit a wall, let me know right away.\u201d But the technical glitch in my project gnaws at me\u2014I haven\u2019t made progress in days, and I know I should reach out. My phone buzzes with a reminder to check in with my mentor, but just then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cTower, request current altimeter setting.\u201d My training is clear: pilots need timely, accurate information, no exceptions. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I pause to message my mentor, I risk delaying my response to the pilot. If I focus on the pilot, I\u2019m once again putting off the honest communication my mentor expects. My heart pounds as I hover between the two demands, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
