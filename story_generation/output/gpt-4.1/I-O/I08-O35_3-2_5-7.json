It\u2019s Jamie, an old friend I haven\u2019t seen in months. Her voice trembles through the speaker\u2014her car\u2019s broken down on a deserted road, and she\u2019s scared. She asks if I can come help or at least stay on the line until someone arrives. My heart twists; I know how anxious she gets in situations like this. But the clock on the wall is relentless. The new operational procedures are being rolled out today, and attendance at the briefing is non-negotiable.
