It\u2019s a message from Jamie, my best friend. I read it and my stomach drops\u2014she\u2019s clearly upset, thinking I was annoyed with her in my last text. I want to call her right away, to explain that I was just rushed, not angry. That\u2019s what friends do: clear things up before they fester. But just then, Mrs. Patel walks in, her usual bright scarf trailing behind her. She\u2019s one of my regulars, and I know she expects a warm welcome, a few minutes of friendly banter before her appointment. The receptionist is free, but Mrs. Patel always looks for me. I can see her scanning the salon, waiting for my smile. My phone vibrates again in my hand. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my friend needs reassurance, my client expects comfort. I stand there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
