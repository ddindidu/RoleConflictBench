He questioned every detail of the offer, his tone sharp, demanding answers I was expected to provide with patience and clarity. My job as a telemarketer meant I had to stay composed, no matter how difficult the call became. Just as I started to explain the terms again, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. Through the thin apartment walls, I could hear footsteps\u2014my neighbor must be coming home. I knew the barking would annoy her; she\u2019d already mentioned how the noise in shared spaces made it hard for her to relax. As a neighbor, I was supposed to be considerate, to keep the peace and respect our boundaries. But now, I was stuck\u2014torn between soothing my dog and keeping my neighbor happy, or staying on the call and meeting my work\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both, feeling the pressure of two worlds colliding, unsure which demand to answer first."}
