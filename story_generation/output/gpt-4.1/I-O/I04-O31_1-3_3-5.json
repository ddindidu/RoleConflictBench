I\u2019m losing my mind with these instructions.\u201d I could picture him surrounded by planks and screws, frustration written all over his face. As his friend, I wanted to be there for him, to help him through this small but real struggle. But just as I was about to call him, my police radio crackled to life: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress at Main and 5th. Bystanders at risk. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was sworn to protect people, to run toward danger when others ran away. I could hear the urgency in the dispatcher\u2019s voice, the chaos in the background. I stared at my phone, torn between the simple, personal need of a friend and the grave, immediate duty to the public. Both roles demanded my attention, both felt urgent in their own way. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, my loyalty and responsibility pulling me in opposite directions."}
