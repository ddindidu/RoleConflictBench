Can you talk?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20146:15 p.m.\u2014and then at the error logs on my screen. The build was stuck, and everyone was waiting on my module. My inbox was filling with \u201cAny update?\u201d emails from the team. I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I fixed this, but Sam rarely reached out like this. As a friend, I wanted to be there, to listen and help him unwind after his awful day. But as the lead engineer, I was expected to solve this problem, fast. My mind raced, torn between opening a call with Sam and diving deeper into the code. I could almost hear the disappointment in both directions\u2014Sam\u2019s if I ignored him, my team\u2019s if I delayed. My chest tightened as I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
