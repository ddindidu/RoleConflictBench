As a mentee, I know I should reach out to my mentor about this technical hurdle\u2014I promised to communicate any challenges promptly. But as the lead architect, I\u2019m already juggling three teams, each with their own fires to put out. The project deadline looms, and every minute counts. If I pause to draft a message to my mentor, I risk falling behind on urgent coordination tasks. Yet, if I don\u2019t ask for help, this bug could stall my own team\u2019s progress even more. My inbox pings with another request for a decision, and my phone buzzes with a calendar reminder. I feel the pressure from both sides: the expectation to be transparent and teachable, and the demand to be decisive and efficient. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between sending that email and diving back into the chaos."}
