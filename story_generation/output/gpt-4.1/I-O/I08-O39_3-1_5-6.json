I answered, and his voice was tight with worry\u2014his car had broken down on a quiet road outside of town, and he needed someone to come help or at least keep him company until a tow truck arrived. I could hear the expectation in his voice, the unspoken rule that friends, even distant ones, show up when needed.\n\nBut as I hung up, I glanced at the notice board. The foreman had just posted about an optional safety training session next week.
