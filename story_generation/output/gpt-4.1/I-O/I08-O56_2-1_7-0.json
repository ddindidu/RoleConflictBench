She leaned in, her voice low but clear enough for me to catch, \u201cDid you see how badly Mark messed up that last client\u2019s color? I\u2019d never let him touch my hair.\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt a pang of discomfort\u2014gossip like that always made me uneasy, and I\u2019d promised myself never to speak ill of others, especially people I knew. But as a hairdresser, I was expected to greet every client warmly, make them feel at ease, and keep the salon atmosphere light and friendly. Now Lisa was waving at me, expecting a cheerful welcome. My mind raced: should I ignore what I\u2019d heard and greet her as usual, or should I subtly address her comment, risking an awkward moment? The pressure of balancing my personal values with my professional role pressed down on me, and I could feel my smile faltering as I walked toward her."}
