She\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014she even made my favorite pasta. As I sit across from her, I can see the anticipation in her eyes, the way she leans in, hoping for undivided attention. But my phone buzzes with a pharmacy newsletter notification. I remember the new drug releases I promised myself I\u2019d review before the trip. My mind splits: Mia deserves my focus, but my profession demands I stay sharp and informed. I try to listen to her story about her day, but my thoughts drift to the clinical updates I might miss. I feel the weight of her expectation for closeness and my own responsibility to my patients. My heart aches with guilt as I wrestle with the urge to sneak a glance at the newsletter, knowing that either choice means letting someone down."}
