Any issues?\u201d I stared at the screen, my mind racing. The truth was, I\u2019d hit a technical wall days ago, and I knew I should be honest and ask for help. That\u2019s what was expected of me as a mentee\u2014open communication, no matter how uncomfortable. But just as I started typing a reply, my headset crackled. A customer\u2019s voice, sharp and frustrated, cut through: \u201cHow do I know this offer isn\u2019t a scam? I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d \n\nAs a telemarketer, I was supposed to stay calm, answer every question, and never let my own stress show. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t lose a customer, no matter what.\u201d I felt my heart pounding, torn between the urge to confide in my mentor and the immediate demand to salvage this call. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mouth dry, caught between two worlds\u2014one asking for vulnerability, the other for unwavering composure."}
