My partner is curled up beside me, silent tears slipping down their cheeks. I want to reach out, to hold them, to say something that will ease the ache of their loss. But the clock ticks on, and I know I have to be up early, ready to lead the team through the biggest project I\u2019ve ever taken on. The technical documents are dense, and I haven\u2019t even finished the first set of drawings. My mind keeps drifting\u2014should I put the papers away and just be here, present, the way they need me? Or do I keep reading, knowing that if I mess up tomorrow, it could cost me my reputation? I feel torn in two, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turn. My partner\u2019s quiet sobs make my heart ache, but the looming pressure of tomorrow\u2019s job sits heavy on my shoulders. I can\u2019t seem to breathe right, caught between the person I love and the work I\u2019ve worked so hard for."}
