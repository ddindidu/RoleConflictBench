She was already at the airport, reminding me about her package deliveries and the planned power outage. \u201cCould you please keep an eye out? I\u2019m worried about the fridge and any mail that might come,\u201d she wrote. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor, and she\u2019d done the same for me. But as I looked at the stack of tax documents on my kitchen table, my stomach tightened. The quarterly tax filing deadline was looming, and my boss had made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. The regulations this year were stricter, and I needed every spare moment to double-check the numbers. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, the expectation to be a reliable neighbor, on the other, the pressure to be a meticulous accountant. My mind raced with what-ifs: What if I missed a delivery? What if I made an error in the filings? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, unable to decide which responsibility to put first."}
