I remembered being told he was new in town and a bit shy, so I made my way over, determined to be warm and welcoming. As we chatted, I noticed him relax, his shoulders dropping as he laughed at my joke. Just then, another guest, overhearing that I was a pharmacist, approached and asked about the best over-the-counter painkiller for a headache. I knew I should give a thorough answer, ask about allergies, other medications, and health conditions\u2014my professional responsibility. But Jamie\u2019s eyes flickered with uncertainty, and I could sense him withdrawing, the fragile connection we\u2019d built slipping away. I felt torn, caught between the urge to be a supportive acquaintance and the duty to provide proper patient counseling. My mind raced, weighing the expectations of both roles, feeling the pressure mount as both waited for my response."}
