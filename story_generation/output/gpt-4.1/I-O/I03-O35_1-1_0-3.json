Can we talk?\u201d My heart tugs\u2014I know he needs me, and I want to be there, to listen, to reassure him that everything will be okay. But just as I start to type a quick reply, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice comes through, uncertain and anxious, asking for directions to the transfer line. My training kicks in: I need to respond clearly, keep everyone safe, and make sure no one feels lost on my train. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore Alex\u2019s message, his need for comfort. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014my boyfriend\u2019s gentle vulnerability, the faceless passenger\u2019s trust in my guidance. I feel torn, my fingers hovering over the phone, my other hand reaching for the intercom button, caught between being the supportive girlfriend Alex expects and the responsible subway operator my passengers rely on."}
