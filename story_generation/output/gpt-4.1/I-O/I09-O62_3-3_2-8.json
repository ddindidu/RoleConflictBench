She smiled, but I could sense tension\u2014everyone had heard about the noise complaint, and I knew she expected a friendly, neighborly chat to smooth things over. I tried to keep my tone light and polite, just as a good neighbor should, even though I was already running late. As we exchanged pleasantries, I glanced through the glass doors and saw a child flailing in the deep end of the pool\u2014right where swimming was off-limits. My training screamed at me to act immediately, to enforce the rules and ensure safety, but Mrs. Lee was still talking, expecting my full attention and warmth. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the attentive neighbor she needed and the vigilant lifeguard the child desperately required."}
