The winter storm had turned the city into a maze of brake lights and slush, and every minute lost in traffic felt like a personal failure. My passenger kept checking his watch, reminding me that his international flight wouldn\u2019t wait. I wanted to reassure him, to promise I\u2019d get him there on time, but the roads were treacherous and safety had to come first.\n\nAt every red light, my mind drifted to the code sample my mentor had assigned. Three days to finish it, but I\u2019d barely started. The expectation was clear: deliver quality work, show initiative, prove I was worth mentoring. But after these long shifts behind the wheel, exhaustion clung to me like the damp from my boots. I worried I\u2019d let my mentor down, that I\u2019d show up to our next meeting empty-handed.\n\nThe pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my passenger\u2019s urgent need, my mentor\u2019s trust. I felt torn, wishing I could split myself in two, fulfill both roles perfectly. The snow kept falling, and I kept driving, caught between the demands of the road and the silent ticking of my own deadline."}
