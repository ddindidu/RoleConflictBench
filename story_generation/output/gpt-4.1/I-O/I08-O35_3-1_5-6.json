It was Jamie, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. \u201cHey, my car broke down on Maple Road. Can you help me out?\u201d I could hear the anxiety in their voice, and I knew that road was deserted at this hour. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to drop everything and rush to their side, to be the reliable friend they needed.\n\nBut just then, an email notification popped up on my work computer. The transit authority was offering a professional development seminar\u2014optional, but everyone knew management paid attention to who signed up. I was supposed to respond promptly, showing my commitment to the job and my willingness to grow. My supervisor had even mentioned how important these opportunities were for career advancement.\n\nI stared at my phone, Jamie\u2019s message still open, while the email blinked insistently on my screen. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each demanding my immediate attention. My mind raced, torn between being the dependable friend and the dedicated subway operator, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
