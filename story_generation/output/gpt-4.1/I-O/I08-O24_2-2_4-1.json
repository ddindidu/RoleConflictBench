The briefs were dense, the arguments intricate, and I knew I needed every ounce of focus to do justice to the case. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mark, an old acquaintance. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes tonight? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I remembered how Mark had helped me years ago, and I felt the pull of obligation. As an acquaintance, I should be there for him, especially since he rarely asks for favors. But as a judge, I couldn\u2019t afford distractions or fatigue; the parties in tomorrow\u2019s trial deserved my full attention and a fair, well-prepared hearing. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to support a friend and the duty to uphold justice. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
