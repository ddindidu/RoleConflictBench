The passenger in the back kept glancing at his watch, his voice tense, \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight.\u201d I nodded, feeling the pressure mount. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him to the airport safely and on time, but the roads were slick, and traffic crawled. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the assignment my mentor gave me was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. I hadn\u2019t finished it yet. My mentor expected me to be diligent, to prove I was ready for more responsibility. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding my focus on the icy roads and the anxious passenger, the other insisting I find time to finish the task that could shape my future. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my passenger and the looming expectations of my mentor. The storm outside seemed to echo the turmoil inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
