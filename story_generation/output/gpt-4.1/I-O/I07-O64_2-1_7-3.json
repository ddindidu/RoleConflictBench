I knew it was my team\u2019s group chat\u2014they\u2019d been waiting for my clarification on the new project guidelines all morning. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the workflow moving. But as the cashier on duty, I was supposed to keep my phone away and focus on the register, following every store policy to the letter. \n\nJust then, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014ten dollars off, not enough to affect the day\u2019s total, but still something I was supposed to report immediately. My mind raced. If I took out my phone to answer my team, I\u2019d be breaking store policy. If I ignored the register issue, I\u2019d be failing as a cashier. But if I didn\u2019t respond to my colleagues, I\u2019d be holding everyone up. The pressure built inside me, each role demanding my attention, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I stared at the register, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, unsure which to address first."}
