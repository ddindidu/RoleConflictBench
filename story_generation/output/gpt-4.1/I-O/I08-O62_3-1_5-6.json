It was Jamie, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. \u201cMy car broke down on Oak Lane. Can you come help? I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d the message read. I glanced at the swimmers below\u2014kids splashing, parents chatting, and a few teenagers edging toward the shallow end, where supervision was required. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep a constant watch, enforce the rules, and never leave my post unattended. But Jamie sounded desperate, stranded on a quiet road with no one else to turn to. My mind raced. If I left, even for a short while, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty and putting swimmers at risk. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down someone who trusted me for help. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the whistle around my neck and the phone in my hand, unsure which call to answer."}
