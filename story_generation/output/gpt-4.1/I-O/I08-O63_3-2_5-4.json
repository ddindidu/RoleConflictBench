I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, an old friend from college. I hesitated, but answered. His voice was shaky; his car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed someone to come get him. I could hear the worry in his voice, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t have called unless he was desperate. My instinct was to grab my keys and go, to be the friend he needed right now.\n\nBut then I looked at the clock. Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. If I didn\u2019t make it, my manager would be on my case again, and my bonus would slip away. I could almost hear her voice reminding me how important these last calls were. My headset felt heavier, the office air staler. I wanted to help Sam, but I also needed this job. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed me and the numbers I needed to hit."}
