My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI expect you to have this ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show I was reliable and capable. But just as I started typing, my pager shrilled. The ER needed me\u2014stat. A patient had arrived, gasping for breath, skin mottled, eyes wild with fear. The nurses looked to me for answers. I felt the weight of their expectation: I was the doctor, the one who had to make sense of chaos, to diagnose and save a life. My mind raced through possible causes, but I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of the code sample waiting for me, the disappointment I\u2019d see in my mentor\u2019s eyes if I failed. I felt split in two, torn between the promise I\u2019d made as a mentee and the oath I\u2019d sworn as a doctor. My hands trembled as I reached for the patient\u2019s chart, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
