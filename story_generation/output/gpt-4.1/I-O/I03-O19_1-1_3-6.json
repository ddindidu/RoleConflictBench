I miss you.\u201d My heart warms. We finally have a stretch of evenings free, a rare chance to unwind together. I want to say yes to every night, to make up for all the times I\u2019ve been too tired or distracted. But as I tuck my phone away, I remember the pharmacy newsletter I\u2019ve been meaning to read. There\u2019s a new drug release, and my manager expects us to be up to speed before the next shift. I skim the headlines during my break, but the details blur\u2014I need more time to really understand the updates. I feel the pressure mounting: Alex wants my attention, my job demands my diligence. I can\u2019t give both what they deserve at the same time. My mind races, torn between the comfort of his arms and the responsibility of my white coat, knowing I have to choose which expectation to meet first."}
