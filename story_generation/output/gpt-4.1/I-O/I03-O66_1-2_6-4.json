My phone buzzes in the cup holder\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019d just had a spat about our weekend plans, a silly misunderstanding, but I know he expects me to call and smooth things over. That\u2019s what I always do: resolve things before they fester. But right now, the city is a blur of headlights and puddles, and every car seems to swerve unpredictably, forcing me to brake and swerve in turn. As a taxi driver, I can\u2019t afford to lose focus, not with these conditions. Still, guilt gnaws at me. If I wait too long, Alex might think I don\u2019t care. If I pick up the phone, I risk more than just a ticket\u2014I risk everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounds, torn between the urge to be the attentive girlfriend and the responsibility to be the vigilant driver. The phone buzzes again, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
