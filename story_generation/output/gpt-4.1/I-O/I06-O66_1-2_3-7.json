It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she expected me to reach out, to show engagement and initiative. As I considered typing a quick message, two travelers approached my cab, each dragging heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I felt the familiar tug of duty; as a taxi driver, I prided myself on being helpful and professional, never making customers wait. But my mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind, and I hesitated, phone in hand, caught between the expectation to communicate promptly and the immediate demand to serve my passengers. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn, the seconds stretching uncomfortably long."}
