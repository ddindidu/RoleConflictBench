She needed me\u2014my experience, my guidance. I could see the uncertainty in her eyes, the way her hands trembled as she asked, \u201cCan you walk me through the risk assessment again?\u201d I wanted to give her my full attention, to share everything I\u2019d learned about handling high-stakes decisions. But just as I began to explain, my phone buzzed. An emergency motion had landed on my desk: a request for a temporary restraining order, demanding my immediate review and a ruling within the hour. The case file was thick, urgent, and I knew the consequences of a rushed decision could be dire. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014Maya\u2019s need for mentorship, the court\u2019s demand for swift, careful judgment. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide her and the duty to uphold justice. I could feel my heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each expecting everything from me, both unwilling to wait."}
