It was my best friend, her voice trembling as she asked if I could talk. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. She needed me to listen, to be there for her, to offer the comfort only a close friend could give. But just outside my office, a family was waiting, desperate for answers about their loved one\u2019s condition. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, and the clearest explanation I could give. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My friend\u2019s pain was real and immediate, but so was the family\u2019s fear and confusion. I stared at my phone, my mind racing, caught between the urge to support my friend and the duty to my patient\u2019s family, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
