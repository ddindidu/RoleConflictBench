The subject line is low-key, and the body says, \u201cNo action needed, just FYI.\u201d Still, as a colleague, I know there\u2019s an unspoken expectation to acknowledge messages quickly, to show I\u2019m present and engaged. But my mind is already tangled in the technical details of a new feature. The design documents are due tomorrow, and the product and QA teams are waiting for my input before they can move forward. I promised them I\u2019d have my part ready by the end of the day. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between dashing off a polite reply to the email and diving back into the code and diagrams. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I pause to respond, I lose my train of thought on the design; if I ignore the message, I risk seeming unresponsive. The clock ticks, and I sit there, wrestling with which expectation to meet first."}
