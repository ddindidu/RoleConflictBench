My mentor had been clear: \u201cI want to see your approach, not just a working solution. Show me your process.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to prove I was worth her time. But my phone buzzed with another reminder\u2014end of quarter, last day, and my telemarketing team was just shy of our sales target. Management\u2019s emails had grown urgent: \u201cEvery call counts. Bonuses and penalties are on the line.\u201d I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice, tense and expectant, as I weighed the headset in my hand. If I focused on coding, I\u2019d let my team down and risk my own bonus. If I hit the phones, I\u2019d have nothing thoughtful to show my mentor. My stomach twisted as I imagined disappointing both sides, feeling the pressure of their expectations squeezing me from opposite directions.
