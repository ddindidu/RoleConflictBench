I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt them, but my careless words clearly cut deep. I know I should call right now, apologize, and try to fix what I\u2019ve broken. That\u2019s what a good friend would do\u2014communicate, clear the air, not let misunderstandings fester. But my laptop screen glows with the unfinished judgment from today\u2019s bench trial. The parties are waiting, the lawyers expect clarity, and the law demands precision. I have only thirty days to write a detailed opinion, and every hour counts. My mind races between the urgent need to reach out to my friend and the professional duty to deliver justice. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. If I pause to make the call, I risk losing my focus and falling behind on the judgment. If I keep working, I betray my friend\u2019s trust. My hands hover, uncertain, as I wrestle with the impossible expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
