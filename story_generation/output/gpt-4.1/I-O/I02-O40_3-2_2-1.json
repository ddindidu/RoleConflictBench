My girlfriend\u2019s voice trembled through the line, her words heavy with grief. She needed me\u2014needed my arms, my comfort, my presence. I could hear her tears, and every instinct screamed at me to drop everything and rush to her side. But the workbench was cluttered with tools, scraps of wood littered the floor, and the foreman\u2019s warning echoed in my mind: \u201cOne slip, one mess, and someone gets hurt.\u201d As a carpenter, I knew the risks. If I left now, the site would be a hazard, and I\u2019d be letting my crew down. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved, aching for support, and toward the responsibility I owed my team and myself. I stared at the mess, my hands trembling, torn between the urge to be the boyfriend she needed and the carpenter I was supposed to be."}
