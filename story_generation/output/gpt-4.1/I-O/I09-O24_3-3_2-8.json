Just an hour ago, Mrs. Patel from 4B had cornered me by the mailboxes, her voice low but urgent about the late-night music from 5C. As a neighbor, I was expected to be warm, understanding, and diplomatic\u2014especially with tensions running high. I\u2019d smiled, nodded, and promised to \u201clook into it,\u201d all while feeling the weight of everyone\u2019s eyes in the lobby, expecting me to smooth things over.\n\nNow, as I began instructing the jury, my clerk slipped me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of this case. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to be decisive, up-to-date, and impartial, to halt proceedings and adapt instantly. But the echo of neighborly expectations lingered\u2014how could I be both the approachable, steady presence in my building and the unflinching authority in my courtroom? My heart pounded as I looked at the jury, feeling the pull of both worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
