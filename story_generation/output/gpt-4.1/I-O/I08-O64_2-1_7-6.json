The store was quiet, and I made sure to greet each person with a smile, as expected of me. Suddenly, I noticed Lisa, an acquaintance from my book club, join the line. As I rang up her items, she leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you hear about Mark? He totally messed up the inventory last week. I don\u2019t know how he still has a job here.\u201d\n\nMy mind raced. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking badly about others, but as a cashier, I was supposed to be friendly and make customers feel comfortable. Lisa looked at me, clearly expecting me to agree or at least respond. At the same time, another customer approached, waiting for my attention. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach, torn between the urge to maintain a positive, professional atmosphere and the pressure to engage with Lisa\u2019s comment. My hands hesitated over the register, my smile faltering as I wrestled with what to say next."}
