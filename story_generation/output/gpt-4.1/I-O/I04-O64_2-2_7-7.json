The line snakes back to the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I sneak a glance at the screen. It\u2019s a message from my friend, Jamie. Their reply is curt, and I realize they\u2019ve misunderstood my earlier text. My heart sinks\u2014Jamie sounds hurt, and I know I should call right now to clear things up, just like we always promised to do when things got confusing. But the next customer is already unloading their cart, and the manager is watching from the end of the aisle. I\u2019m supposed to be cheerful, attentive, and quick, but all I can think about is Jamie, probably stewing in hurt feelings. My fingers itch to grab my phone, but my hands are busy with barcodes and receipts. I feel torn in two, pulled by the need to be a good friend and the expectation to be a perfect cashier, and I don\u2019t know which role to let down."}
