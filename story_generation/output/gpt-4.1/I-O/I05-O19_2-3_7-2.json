My mentee, Sarah, was waiting in the consultation room, her eyes bright with hope and nerves. She was preparing for her first big interview, and I knew how much my encouragement and guidance meant to her. As her mentor, I wanted to give her my full attention, to help her grow and succeed. But just as I was about to step in, the pharmacy phone rang\u2014an urgent call from the oncology ward. A high-risk chemotherapy prescription had come in, and I was the only pharmacist on duty. The medication required absolute precision; even the smallest error could be catastrophic for the patient. My mind raced with the expectations placed on me: to nurture Sarah\u2019s confidence and future, and to ensure the safety and well-being of someone whose life depended on my accuracy. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I stood between the consultation room and the dispensary, wrestling with the impossible choice of who needed me more in that moment."}
