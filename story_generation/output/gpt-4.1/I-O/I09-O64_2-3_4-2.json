I winced, knowing how much she valued peace and quiet, and how she\u2019d already hinted that my dog\u2019s noise was becoming a problem. I wanted to be a good neighbor, to keep the hallway calm and respect everyone\u2019s space, but my shift at the grocery store was about to start, and I barely had time to calm him down before rushing out.\n\nAt the register, my mind kept drifting back to the hallway. The end of my shift was always the most stressful\u2014counting out the register, handling large bills, making sure every cent was accounted for. My manager expected perfection, especially with the high-value transactions that could make or break the day\u2019s balance. But as I tried to focus on the numbers, I kept picturing Mrs. Patel\u2019s disappointed face and my dog\u2019s anxious barking. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be a responsible neighbor and the pressure to be a flawless cashier, both roles demanding my full attention at the same time."}
