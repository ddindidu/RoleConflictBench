She\u2019d carved out this sliver of time for me, despite her packed schedule, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation. I wanted to show her respect, to prove I was serious about learning from her. But just as I was about to leave my desk, an email from a client popped up\u2014an attached contract for a routine service engagement. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but as a lawyer, I prided myself on being thorough and responsive. My mind raced: should I quickly review the contract now, risking being late or distracted for my mentor, or should I leave it for later, knowing I\u2019d be thinking about it during our meeting? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each representing a different part of who I was trying to become. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the expectations of my mentor and my client, feeling the tension rise as the minutes ticked by."}
