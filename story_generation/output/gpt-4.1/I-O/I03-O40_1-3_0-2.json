He sat on the couch, scrolling his phone, but his jaw was tight, and he barely looked up when I set my bag down. I wanted to sit beside him, ask about his day, and just be there\u2014he always says I\u2019m the one who helps him unwind after work. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: tomorrow\u2019s job site inspection. As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to cut corners, not with safety. I needed to check my tools tonight, make sure everything was sharp, clean, and ready. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d risk not just my own safety, but my crew\u2019s too. I glanced at Mark, then at the clock. If I started now, I\u2019d be in the garage for at least an hour. But if I waited, I\u2019d be distracted, worried about missing something critical. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the man I love, and toward the responsibility I can\u2019t ignore. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the comfort he needed and the duty I owed to my work."}
