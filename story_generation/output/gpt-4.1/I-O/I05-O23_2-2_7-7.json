As a mentor, I was supposed to encourage my mentee, Jamie, who was preparing for a crucial promotion interview. Jamie was eager, asking for advice on handling confidential information and demonstrating trustworthiness\u2014qualities essential for the next step in their career. I wanted to give them every tool to succeed, to share real-life examples and guide them through the ethical gray areas they might face.\n\nBut then, as a lawyer, I faced a dilemma. An internal assistant, new to our team and unfamiliar with the specifics, requested access to sensitive client files. They claimed it would streamline our workflow, but I knew the files contained information protected by strict confidentiality rules. Granting access would be a breach of my professional duty, yet refusing might seem uncooperative or even undermine the trust of my colleagues.\n\nI could feel Jamie\u2019s hopeful eyes on me, waiting for wisdom, while the assistant\u2019s request lingered in my inbox. The expectations clashed inside me\u2014support growth and openness, or uphold the rigid boundaries of legal ethics. My mind raced, torn between nurturing a future leader and protecting the sanctity of my profession."}
