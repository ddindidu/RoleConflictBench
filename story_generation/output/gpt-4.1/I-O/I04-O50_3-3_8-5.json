My hands are already greasy, tools laid out, and the maintenance checklist flashes in my mind\u2014if I don\u2019t act now, the whole line could go down, costing hours of work and a mountain of blame. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and my heart sinks. I see the message from Jamie, short and cold. That offhand joke I made at lunch\u2014meant to lighten the mood\u2014clearly landed wrong. I can\u2019t let this fester; Jamie deserves an immediate, honest apology. I promised myself I\u2019d always be the friend who faces things head-on, who doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings grow. But the machine\u2019s wail grows louder, and the supervisor\u2019s eyes are on me. I feel split in two, torn between the urgent demands of the job and the equally urgent need to make things right with my friend. My hands tremble, caught between wrench and phone, as I wrestle with which part of me to let down."}
