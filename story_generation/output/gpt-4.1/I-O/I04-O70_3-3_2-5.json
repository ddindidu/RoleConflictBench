It was 2:13 a.m. I squinted at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashed, and when I answered, I was met with choked sobs. She could barely get the words out, but I understood enough: her father had just passed away. She needed me, needed someone to listen, to just be there. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to offer comfort, but my work phone vibrated at the same time. Dispatch was calling\u2014an urgent delivery, a high-value package that had to be hand-delivered and signed for by the recipient before sunrise. If I missed this, I risked my job. My friend\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, desperate for support, while my boss\u2019s text glared at me, demanding immediate action. I felt torn in two, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest. How could I possibly choose between being the friend she needed and the reliable delivery person my job demanded?"}
