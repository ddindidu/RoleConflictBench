My headset feels heavier than usual as I scan the list of leads, knowing management will be watching my numbers. The pressure to perform is suffocating, but my phone buzzes with a message from my mentee, Sarah. She\u2019s anxious about her big interview tomorrow and wants to talk through her presentation. As her mentor, I know how much this means to her; I promised to help her grow, to be there when she needs guidance. But every minute I spend with her is a minute I\u2019m not dialing, not selling, not inching closer to that target that determines my bonus\u2014and maybe even my job security. My mind races, torn between the urge to support Sarah and the relentless demand to hit my numbers. I can almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in one ear, Sarah\u2019s hopeful tone in the other. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to make next."}
