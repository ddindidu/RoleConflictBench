As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor about this technical hurdle\u2014I\u2019d been stuck for hours, and the project deadline was looming. My mentor always emphasized open communication, and I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let problems fester. Tell me as soon as you hit a wall.\u201d But as a telemarketer, I was also supposed to take my break now, since the call volume was low and the supervisors encouraged us to use flexible timing. If I messaged my mentor now, I\u2019d have to stay at my desk, possibly missing my only quiet window for a real break all day. My mind spun with the competing demands: be proactive and responsible as a mentee, or respect the work-life boundaries my telemarketing job insisted on. My hand hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending the message and stepping away, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
