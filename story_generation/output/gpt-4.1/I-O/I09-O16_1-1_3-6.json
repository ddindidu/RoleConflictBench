She looked frustrated, muttering about how the bins were only half-full and it was wasteful to put them out so early. I remembered the unspoken agreement among us neighbors: only put the bins out when they\u2019re full, to keep the street tidy and avoid attracting stray animals. I hesitated, feeling the urge to remind her, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about my first patient, a young woman with a sore throat who was anxious for a diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAs I walked to my car, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. As a neighbor, I wanted to maintain harmony and uphold our shared standards. As a doctor, I needed to focus on my patient, listen carefully, and prescribe the right medication. My mind raced with the competing demands: should I stop and talk to Mrs. Lee, risking being late for my patient, or should I drive off, ignoring the neighborly duty I valued? The tension between being a good neighbor and a responsible doctor gnawed at me as I stood at the curb, keys in hand, torn between two worlds."}
