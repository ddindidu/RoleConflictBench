As a mentor, I felt responsible for making sure they understood the safety protocols and the shortcuts that could save them hours. The project deadline was looming, and I knew this session could make a real difference. But the next morning, as I laced up my boots, I saw the notice: an optional training session next week, right in the middle of our busiest shift. As a laborer, I was expected to be on the ground, shoulder to shoulder with the crew, not off in a classroom. The foreman had made it clear\u2014every hand was needed, no exceptions. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I skipped the training, I\u2019d be letting down the new guys who needed guidance. If I left the crew short-handed, I\u2019d be breaking the trust of my team. My mind raced, torn between the urge to teach and the duty to build, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
