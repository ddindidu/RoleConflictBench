I started explaining the process, trying to break it down simply, when my phone buzzed. It was a notification: a high-value package had just arrived, and I was the only one available to deliver it. The protocol was strict\u2014no delays, hand it directly to the recipient, verify their ID, and log the delivery immediately. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions with these packages.\u201d Jamie was still looking at me, waiting for guidance, and I could see the confusion in their eyes as I hesitated. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014one expecting my knowledge, the other demanding my immediate action. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor first, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
