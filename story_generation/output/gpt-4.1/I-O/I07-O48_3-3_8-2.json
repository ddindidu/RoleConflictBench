They needed me to confirm details for an external partner\u2014urgently. I knew the expectation: respond quickly, keep the team moving, don\u2019t be the bottleneck. As I started typing my reply, I heard a call light from down the hall. Mrs. Evans, one of my patients, was struggling again. She\u2019d been having a rough morning, her arthritis flaring up so badly she could barely hold her spoon. I could hear her voice, shaky and frustrated, asking for help with her lunch. My heart twisted. As a nursing assistant, I\u2019m supposed to be there for her, to make sure she\u2019s comfortable and cared for, especially when she\u2019s in pain. But the email from leadership blinked on my screen, a silent demand for my attention. I felt torn, caught between the urgent needs of my patient and the pressing expectations of my colleagues. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
