It was Mark, someone I knew from a few gatherings, asking if I could help him move some boxes to his new apartment that afternoon. He sounded a bit desperate\u2014apparently, his other helpers had bailed. As an acquaintance, I felt that familiar tug: I should help, at least to be decent. But just as I was about to reply, a Slack notification popped up. My project manager wanted to start an informal planning session in an hour. As the team\u2019s engineer, I was expected to join, discuss the new features, and give my best guess at how long things would take. The session wasn\u2019t set in stone, but my input would shape the next few weeks. I stared at my phone, feeling the pressure from both sides. Mark needed a hand, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. But my team was counting on me to be present and thoughtful. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations, caught between being a helpful acquaintance and a responsible engineer, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
