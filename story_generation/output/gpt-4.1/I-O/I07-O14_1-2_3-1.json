As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the project report by Friday. The deadline was generous, and my teammates could move forward without my section for a few days, but I didn\u2019t want to let them down or seem unreliable. At the same time, the scientist in me was acutely aware that the specialized microscope I needed for my experiment was only available for a narrow window this week. If I missed it, I\u2019d have to wait another month, setting my research back significantly. My inbox pinged with a reminder from my supervisor about the experiment, while a teammate messaged me, asking if I\u2019d have my part of the report ready soon. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of both responsibilities. Should I prioritize the team\u2019s expectations or seize the rare opportunity for my research? The tension in my chest grew as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
