It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and desperate. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me\u2014now. I promised I\u2019d figure something out, but as I hung up, my heart pounded for another reason. Tomorrow at dawn, I was supposed to meet the contractors at the new site. The concrete pour was scheduled for 6 a.m., and any delay would throw the whole project off, costing the firm thousands and risking my reputation as a reliable architect.\n\nI sat on the edge of my bed, torn. Sam had always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me to show up. But my team and the contractors were expecting me to lead, to keep everything running smoothly. I could already imagine the disappointed faces, the angry calls from my boss, the ripple effect of a missed deadline. My mind raced, weighing loyalty against responsibility, friendship against professionalism, as the minutes ticked by and I still hadn\u2019t moved."}
