As a colleague, I knew the team was waiting for my response to clarify a key detail in our shared project. The group chat pinged again, and I could almost feel their impatience through the screen. At the same time, as the designated machine repairer, I was supposed to be diagnosing the old laminator in the corner, which had started acting up for the first time in months. The production floor was quiet, but if I didn\u2019t catch the glitch now, it might cause bigger problems later. My inbox kept filling up, and the pressure to reply grew heavier with each passing minute. Yet, the machine\u2019s intermittent fault demanded my full attention and focus. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions, knowing that whichever task I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between my responsibilities."}
