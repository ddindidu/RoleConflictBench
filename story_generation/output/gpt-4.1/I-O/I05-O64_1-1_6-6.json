As a cashier, I kept my smile ready, greeting the next customer with a practiced warmth while scanning their groceries. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Jamie, my mentee from the store\u2019s training program, hovering near the end of the aisle. She looked frazzled, clutching her notepad, her eyes darting between the clock and her unfinished restocking cart. I remembered our last check-in, when she admitted she was struggling to balance her tasks and felt overwhelmed by the pace.\n\nI wanted to step away, to offer her a few words of encouragement, maybe share a tip or two about managing time on the floor. But the line at my register was growing, and I could feel the customers\u2019 impatience simmering. My manager expected me to keep things moving and maintain a cheerful demeanor. I felt torn\u2014my role as a mentor urging me to support Jamie, my duty as a cashier demanding I stay focused on the customers. My heart raced as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
