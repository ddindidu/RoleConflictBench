My mentor had been clear: \u201cHave this ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to prove I was serious about learning. But my phone buzzed, snapping me back to my other reality. The telemarketing dashboard glared red\u2014three sales short of my weekly target, and only an hour left in my shift. Management had sent another reminder: \u201cTargets must be met. No exceptions.\u201d My headset felt heavier than usual as I dialed the next number, my mind split between the script I needed to recite and the lines of code I needed to debug. Each rejection on the call stung sharper, knowing every minute spent here was a minute stolen from my assignment. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations from both sides squeezing me. Should I push through more calls, risking a rushed, sloppy code sample? Or should I log off early, sacrificing my sales numbers and possibly my job? My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, caught in the tug-of-war between who I wanted to become and what I needed to survive."}
