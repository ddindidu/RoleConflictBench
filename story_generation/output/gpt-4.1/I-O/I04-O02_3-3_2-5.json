It was 2:13 a.m. I squinted at the screen\u2014Sam. I answered, and his voice was raw, trembling. He could barely get the words out: his dad had collapsed, and the doctors weren\u2019t hopeful. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort he needed. I knew he had no one else to call at this hour.\n\nBut as I murmured reassurances, my work phone lit up with a string of urgent messages. The external inspector had flagged a critical safety issue on the line I was responsible for. If I didn\u2019t respond immediately, the plant could be shut down by morning, costing the company thousands and putting my team\u2019s jobs at risk. My mind raced\u2014protocol demanded my full attention, but Sam\u2019s pain was so real, so immediate. I felt torn in two, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I leaned. Sam\u2019s sobs filled my ear, while the insistent ping of work notifications reminded me of the consequences if I failed to act. I sat there, paralyzed, caught between being the friend Sam desperately needed and the engineer my team depended on."}
