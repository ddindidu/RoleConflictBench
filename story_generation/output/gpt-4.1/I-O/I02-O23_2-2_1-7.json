Bad day.\u201d I could hear the heaviness in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be present. I wanted to drop everything and be the boyfriend she deserved\u2014someone who could hold her hand and help her through the disappointment she felt at work.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my work phone rang. It was an assistant from my firm, asking for access to confidential client files. She sounded rushed, insisting it would make things easier for everyone. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable, no matter how much pressure I felt from colleagues. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support my partner and the professional obligation to uphold my ethical standards.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing.
