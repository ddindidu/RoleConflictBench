My partner\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I knew why she was calling\u2014her voice had been trembling all day, her grief raw and heavy after her brother\u2019s sudden passing. I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to hold her and let her cry, to be the boyfriend she needed. But just as I was about to answer, a client stormed up to the counter, her voice sharp and accusing. She hated her haircut, she said, and demanded it be fixed immediately, even though we were minutes from closing. My manager shot me a look, expecting me to handle it with patience and professionalism. My heart pounded as I glanced between the ringing phone and the furious client. I felt torn in two\u2014my partner needed my comfort, but my job demanded my attention. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the person I loved and the role I was paid to play."}
