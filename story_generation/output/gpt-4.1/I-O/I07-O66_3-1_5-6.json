My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need your report by noon. The client\u2019s waiting.\u201d I knew the project couldn\u2019t move forward without my part. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the taxi company. My next shift started in thirty minutes, and I\u2019d been warned: \u201cNo more late arrivals. And make sure your cab is spotless. We\u2019ve had complaints.\u201d I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d have just enough time to clean the car before picking up my first passenger. If I stayed, I could finish the report, but I\u2019d risk my taxi job. Both roles demanded my best, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between letting down my team and risking my only steady income. I sat frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unable to move."}
