My mentee, Sarah, had just emailed me, asking for urgent advice about a job offer that could change her career. She needed my guidance\u2014she trusted me to help her weigh the pros and cons, to be thorough and thoughtful. But as I started to type my response, the phone rang. Another customer, another pitch. I launched into the script, my voice steady, but my mind was split. The customer asked a routine question, one I could answer in my sleep, but my thoughts kept drifting to Sarah. She was waiting for me to help her make a life-changing decision, and I felt the weight of her expectations. Yet, my supervisor expected me to stay focused, to handle every call with energy and precision. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding my empathy and insight, the other my efficiency and attention. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding, as I tried to decide which role to serve first."}
