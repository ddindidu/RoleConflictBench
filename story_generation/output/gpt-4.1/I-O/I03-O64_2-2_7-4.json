The line was long, and my manager had already reminded me twice today to stick to the return policy\u2014no exceptions, no matter how sympathetic the customer. As I looked up, my boyfriend stepped forward, holding a blender we\u2019d bought together last month. He looked tired, his eyes searching mine for understanding. \u201cI know I lost the receipt, but can you just help me out this once?\u201d he whispered, glancing nervously at the people behind him.\n\nMy mind raced. We\u2019d argued all week about money, about how we needed to save, about how I never seemed to take his side. He expected me to be supportive, to help him out, to show I cared. But the store\u2019s policy was clear, and my job depended on following it. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014his girlfriend, expected to resolve our conflict and show loyalty; the cashier, expected to enforce the rules without exception. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my voice, caught between the demands of love and responsibility, not knowing which part of me would win."}
