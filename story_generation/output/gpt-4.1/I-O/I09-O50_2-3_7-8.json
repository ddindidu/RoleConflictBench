Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, and I\u2019d promised her son I\u2019d check in if the weather got bad. At the same time, my work phone buzzed insistently\u2014an urgent message from the factory. The new staff were about to run a batch on the press, and from their frantic texts, it was clear they didn\u2019t understand the safety protocols. If I didn\u2019t guide them now, someone could get hurt. My mind raced: Mrs. Lee might need help if the power went out, but the factory needed me to prevent a possible accident. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on my chest. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between being the neighbor Mrs. Lee could count on and the repairer my clients depended on."}
