My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. I knew I should tell her about the argument with my teammates, how it was derailing our progress, but I hesitated. I didn\u2019t want to seem incapable or like I was blaming others. At the same time, a customer approached, holding a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. She pleaded, explaining her situation, but I knew my manager expected me to follow the rules strictly. My mentor expected honesty and openness, but my job demanded adherence to policy, no exceptions. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014should I risk disappointing my mentor by staying silent, or risk my job by bending the rules? My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
