We\u2019d met a few times at mutual friends\u2019 gatherings, so I felt a pang of concern seeing her so upset. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to wash and condition her hair before starting, but she quietly mentioned she\u2019d just washed it at home, her voice trembling. I could still smell the fresh shampoo. \n\nAs an acquaintance, I wanted to comfort her, maybe offer a tissue or ask if she wanted to talk. But as her hairdresser, I was expected to follow the salon\u2019s protocol\u2014every client\u2019s hair must be washed here, no exceptions. My manager was strict about it, and skipping the wash could get me in trouble. I could see Mia\u2019s distress, and I didn\u2019t want to make her feel worse by insisting on something unnecessary. My mind raced, torn between being the understanding friend she might need and the professional I was supposed to be. I hesitated, unsure which role to let guide my next words."}
