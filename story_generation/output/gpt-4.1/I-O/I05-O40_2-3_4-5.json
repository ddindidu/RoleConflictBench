As a mentor, I\u2019d promised my apprentice a structured session tonight\u2014he was eager, waiting for me to share the tricks and lessons I\u2019d gathered over the years. He needed this guidance before we tackled the big project tomorrow. But as a carpenter, I was staring at a stack of blueprints and technical drawings that I hadn\u2019t even begun to interpret. The new project was complex, and if I didn\u2019t study these documents tonight, I\u2019d risk mistakes on the job site. My apprentice\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind, but so did the image of misaligned beams and wasted wood. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my time and wisdom, the other my focus and precision. My hands trembled slightly, torn between the urge to teach and the need to prepare."}
