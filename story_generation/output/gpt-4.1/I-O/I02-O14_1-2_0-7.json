Can we talk?\u201d I was still in the lab, hunched over the centrifuge, double-checking the calibration. The safety audit was in two days, and the last inspection had flagged a few minor issues\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to make my supervisor nervous. I knew I needed to stay late, run through the checklist, and make sure every piece of equipment was spotless and compliant. But Mia\u2019s message tugged at me. She rarely reached out like this, and I could almost hear the fatigue in her words. As her boyfriend, I wanted to be there, to listen and reassure her, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as a scientist, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d be risking the lab\u2019s safety record and my own reputation. My mind spun with guilt and worry, torn between the person I loved and the work I\u2019d committed myself to. I stared at the blinking cursor on my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
