She\u2019s already had a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to clear up any misunderstandings and make sure we\u2019re on the same page. I know if I don\u2019t reply now, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m ignoring her, and things might get worse between us. But as I reach for my phone, the passenger in my back seat leans forward, his voice tense. \u201cCan you go any faster? I\u2019m late for my meeting.\u201d The app\u2019s timer is ticking, and I can feel his impatience growing. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m supposed to focus on the road, keep my passengers safe, and deliver them on time. My hands tighten on the wheel, my phone vibrating again in my pocket. I can\u2019t do both at once\u2014if I text my friend, I risk my passenger\u2019s safety and my job. If I ignore her, I risk our friendship. My mind races, torn between the demands of being a good friend and a responsible driver, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I approach the next intersection."}
