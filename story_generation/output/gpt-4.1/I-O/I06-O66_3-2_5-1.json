The conflict with my teammates had exploded this morning, and now the deliverable was at risk. I knew I should reach out, explain everything before it got worse. But in the rearview mirror, my passenger\u2019s anxious face reminded me of my other responsibility. \u201cCan you go any faster? My train leaves in fifteen minutes,\u201d she pleaded. The city traffic was thick, and every second counted. I gripped the wheel, torn. As a mentee, I owed my mentor honesty and timely communication. As a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, swift ride. My mind raced, weighing the urgency of my team crisis against the immediate pressure of the ticking clock and the trust my passenger placed in me. My phone buzzed again, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
