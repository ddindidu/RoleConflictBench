I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt them, but the look on their face before they left said it all. I knew I needed to call and apologize right away, to explain myself and try to fix what I\u2019d broken. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But as I reached for my phone, the sharp, chemical smell from the pool filter room hit me. I remembered the odd noises I\u2019d heard earlier, and when I checked, the filtration system was sputtering, the pressure gauge in the red. If I didn\u2019t act now, the water could become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. My supervisor always said, \u201cEquipment comes first\u2014lives depend on it.\u201d I felt torn in two, the phone heavy in my hand, the filter\u2019s warning lights blinking at me. My friend needed me, but so did everyone in the pool. I stood there, caught between the urgent call I needed to make and the repairs I needed to do, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
