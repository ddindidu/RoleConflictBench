The email about the noise complaint had circulated earlier, and now a few neighbors gathered, faces tense but polite. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, to smooth things over with a smile and a calm word. But my thoughts kept drifting back to my code\u2014performance warnings had popped up in the last review, and the new feature was so close to being done. My team expected me to deliver clean, efficient code, and I could almost hear the Slack notifications piling up. Standing there, I tried to focus on the conversation, nodding and offering reassurances, but my mind raced with possible solutions to the code issues. I felt pulled in two directions: the need to be present and courteous here, and the pressure to fix my code before the next build. My heart thudded with the stress of trying to meet both expectations, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to either role at this moment."}
