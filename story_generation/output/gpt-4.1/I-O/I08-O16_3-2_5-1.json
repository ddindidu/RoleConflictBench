The patient in room 304 had a baffling mix of symptoms\u2014fever, joint pain, and a rash that didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern. I was determined to find the answer, knowing my patient was counting on me to make sense of it all. But the call was from Mark, an old acquaintance. His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on a deserted road, and he didn\u2019t know who else to call. He needed someone to come get him, and I was the only person he could reach. I could hear the anxiety in his voice, and I knew he expected me to help, just as I would hope for help if our roles were reversed. But my patient was waiting, and every minute I spent away from the case felt like a betrayal of my duty as a doctor. My mind raced, torn between the obligation to a friend in need and the responsibility to a patient whose health might depend on my focus. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
