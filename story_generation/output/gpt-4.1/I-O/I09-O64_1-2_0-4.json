She\u2019s lived next door for years, always quick with a warm hello. I smiled and greeted her, as usual, feeling the comfort of our neighborly routine. Later, at the store, I was behind the register when Mrs. Lee approached, holding a blender. \u201cIt stopped working,\u201d she said, her voice hopeful. \u201cI can\u2019t find the receipt, but I just bought it last week.\u201d My heart sank. Store policy is strict\u2014no returns without a receipt. As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to follow the rules, no exceptions. But as her neighbor, I know how much she values kindness and community. I could see the expectation in her eyes, trusting I\u2019d help. My mind raced, torn between the friendly neighbor she knows and the employee I\u2019m supposed to be. The line behind her grew, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different from me."}
