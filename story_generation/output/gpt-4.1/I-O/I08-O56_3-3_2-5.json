She looked up and tried to smile, but it was clear she\u2019d been crying. My instinct was to go over, offer a hug, and ask what was wrong\u2014just be there for her, like a friend should. But before I could move, Mrs. Jenkins, my final client of the day, stormed out of my chair, glaring at her reflection. \u201cThis is not what I asked for!\u201d she shouted, her voice echoing through the nearly empty salon. I could feel the tension in the room, the other stylists glancing at me, waiting to see how I\u2019d handle it. I knew I had to stay calm, listen to Mrs. Jenkins, and try to fix her cut, even though we were already past closing time. But Sarah was still there, looking so lost, and I felt torn in two\u2014wanting to comfort her, but knowing my professional duty was to the client in front of me. My heart pounded as I stood between them, unsure which role to step into first."}
