My manager\u2019s voice echoed through my earbuds, outlining project updates that I knew wouldn\u2019t be repeated. I was expected to chime in, to show I was engaged and on top of things. But as I tried to focus, laughter and splashing caught my attention. A group of teenagers clustered near the deep end, daring each other to dive despite the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for their safety, expected to intervene immediately and enforce the rules. But if I left the meeting, I\u2019d miss crucial information and risk looking disengaged to my colleagues. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention at the exact same moment."}
