It was Mia, my friend, her name lighting up the screen with a desperate text: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with this bookshelf.\u201d I knew she\u2019d just moved in and was struggling to get settled. As her friend, I wanted to be there, to help her through this little crisis, just like she\u2019d done for me so many times before.\n\nBut as the housekeeping cleaner, I was on the clock, responsible for making sure every bottle and box was accounted for. The manager expected a precise report by noon, and I was already running behind. If I stopped now, I\u2019d risk missing something important or getting in trouble for not finishing on time. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Mia\u2019s anxious face and the rows of supplies I still had to count. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
