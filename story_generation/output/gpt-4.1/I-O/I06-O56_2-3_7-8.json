My mentor had carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me between her meetings, and I knew how much she valued punctuality. I was determined not to waste a second of her time. But right now, my hands were tangled in a client\u2019s hair, thick with product and knots. As a hairdresser, I couldn\u2019t skip the wash and conditioning\u2014if I did, my scissors would snag, and the cut would be a disaster. The client looked anxious, and I could feel her trust in me wavering. I tried to work faster, but the tangles only tightened. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentor meeting in 10 minutes.\u201d My stomach twisted. I owed my mentor respect and promptness, but I also owed my client the care she deserved. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled apart, unable to see how I could possibly meet both demands."}
