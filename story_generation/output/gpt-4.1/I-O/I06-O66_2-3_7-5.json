My mentor had carved out a rare fifteen-minute window for me, and I was determined not to waste a second. I\u2019d promised to be on time, to show respect for her packed schedule. But as I turned the corner in my taxi, a construction detour forced all traffic into a single, crawling lane. Up ahead, a school zone sign flashed, and children clustered near the curb, their laughter and sudden movements unpredictable. The urge to inch forward, to somehow make up lost time, gnawed at me. But the rules were clear: slow down, stay alert, protect the kids. My hands tightened on the wheel. Every second I lost here felt like a failure as a mentee, yet every urge to rush clashed with my duty as a driver. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give without betraying the other."}
