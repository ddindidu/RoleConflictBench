Instinctively, I slowed down, remembering how important it is to be approachable and supportive, especially when someone\u2019s clearly having a rough time. I wanted to sit beside her, offer a listening ear, maybe even a comforting word. But at that exact moment, my phone buzzed with a flurry of Slack notifications\u2014urgent messages from my team. There was a production outage, and the root cause was traced back to a bug in my code. Customers were locked out, and the pressure to fix it was mounting by the second. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a good acquaintance and the professional demand to drop everything and troubleshoot. I could feel my heart pounding, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
