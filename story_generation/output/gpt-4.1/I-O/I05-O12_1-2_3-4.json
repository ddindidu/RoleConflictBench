My inbox pinged with another message from the product team, politely nudging for my technical input. I knew they were waiting, their own timelines hinging on my feedback. Just as I started drafting my section, Maya, my mentee, appeared at my door with a hopeful smile. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I\u2019m stuck on that API integration we talked about.\u201d She\u2019d been making great progress, and I prided myself on being available, sharing what I\u2019d learned over the years. But now, every minute spent mentoring meant another delay for the teams counting on me. I could see the expectation in Maya\u2019s eyes\u2014she trusted me to help her grow. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility to my colleagues, who needed my expertise to move forward. My mind raced, torn between being the mentor I wanted to be and the developer my team needed. I took a breath, feeling the tension coil in my chest, and tried to decide which role to answer first."}
