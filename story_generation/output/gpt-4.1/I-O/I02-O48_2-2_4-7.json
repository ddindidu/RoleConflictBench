She\u2019s been looking forward to it, dropping hints about the new restaurant she wants to try and how much she\u2019ll miss me. I promised her this night would be just for us. But as I\u2019m about to clock out, the charge nurse pulls me aside. One of my patients, Mr. Harris, is recovering from surgery and is visibly anxious, asking if I could stay a little longer. He\u2019s alone, his family lives out of state, and he keeps glancing at the door, hoping someone will come in. I know how much it means for patients to have someone there, especially at night when the ward gets quiet and fears grow louder. My phone buzzes with a text from my girlfriend: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014her hopeful anticipation, his silent plea. My heart aches, torn between being the boyfriend she needs and the caregiver he depends on. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, caught in the pull of two promises I can\u2019t keep at once."}
