The subject line flashed: \u201cURGENT: Need Confirmation for Partner Meeting.\u201d Leadership needed my reply now, and I knew how important it was to keep communication flowing\u2014especially with external partners. But the hospital was only a few blocks away, and the supplies in my hands were marked \u201cTime Sensitive.\u201d If I delayed, patient care could be compromised. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My colleagues expected me to be responsive, to show I was reliable and engaged. At the same time, the hospital staff\u2014and the patients\u2014were counting on me to deliver these supplies without delay. My mind raced, torn between the pinging demands of my inbox and the weight of the package in my arms. I stood frozen on the sidewalk, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the dependable colleague and the responsible delivery person."}
