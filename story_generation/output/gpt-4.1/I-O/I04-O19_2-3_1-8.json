It was my friend, Sarah. Her voice trembled, \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk. I just had a huge fight with Mark.\u201d I could hear the tears she was holding back, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But the webinar was starting, and missing it meant falling behind on the latest treatment updates\u2014something my job as a pharmacist demanded. My license, my patients, my professional pride all depended on staying current. I stared at the screen, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached for Sarah, but my mind raced with the consequences of missing this session. I felt torn, caught between being the friend she needed and the pharmacist I was expected to be."}
