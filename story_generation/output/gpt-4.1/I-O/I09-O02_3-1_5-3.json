The HOA had sent out reminders about the inspection, warning that anything left in shared spaces could be cited for safety violations. As her neighbor, I knew she\u2019d been struggling to move it, and I didn\u2019t want to be the one to complain. But as an engineer, I couldn\u2019t ignore the safety hazard\u2014emergency exits had to be clear, no exceptions. At work, I\u2019d never let something like this slide; I\u2019d already started prepping for our own audit, even though it was months away. But here, in my own building, it felt different. I could hear Mrs. Patel\u2019s television through her door, and I imagined her frustration if she got a violation notice. My mind raced between wanting to be a good neighbor\u2014understanding, patient\u2014and the ingrained responsibility to uphold safety standards. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between knocking on her door to gently remind her, reporting it anonymously, or just letting it go. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between what I should do and what I wanted to do."}
