I know she expects me to step up, to help us find a way through this mess. But right now, I\u2019m behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat humming along to the radio, relaxed, in no rush. My job is to get him to his meeting safely and on time, to be calm and focused. But my mind keeps drifting to her words, the tension in her voice, the way she said, \u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d I grip the steering wheel tighter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to pull over and call her, to show her I care, but I can\u2019t let my passenger down. The city blurs past, and I\u2019m stuck in the space between who I am to her and who I am to the stranger in my backseat, not sure which role to answer first."}
