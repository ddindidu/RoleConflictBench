Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, was moving her potted plants and a small bench into the corridor again. She always said it made the hallway feel homier, but I knew the HOA inspection was scheduled for tomorrow. If those items stayed, we\u2019d all risk a citation for blocking the emergency exit. I felt a tug of responsibility as a neighbor\u2014I didn\u2019t want to upset her or seem unfriendly, but I also didn\u2019t want the whole floor to get in trouble.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. An email from the tax authority flashed on the screen: a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return, requiring an immediate response. My heart pounded. As an accountant, I knew ignoring this could mean penalties for my client and damage to my reputation. I glanced at the corridor, then at my laptop. Both roles demanded my attention, both urgent in their own way. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between stepping into the hallway to talk to Mrs. Patel and sitting down to draft a response to the tax notice."}
