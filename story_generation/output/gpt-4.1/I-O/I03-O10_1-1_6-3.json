He sounded upset\u2014apparently, he thought I\u2019d promised to spend the weekend with him, but I\u2019d only said I\u2019d try. Now he wanted to talk, to clear things up before it festered. I knew how important it was to resolve these little misunderstandings quickly; otherwise, they grew into something bigger. But as I typed out a reply, an email notification popped up from my manager: a last-minute seminar on upcoming tax law changes was being offered this Saturday. Attendance was strongly encouraged, and missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates that would affect my work for months, maybe years. My mind raced. Mark expected me to be present, to listen and reassure him, to show that our relationship mattered. My job demanded I stay ahead, to ensure every client\u2019s compliance and my own professional reputation. I felt the pressure building, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly meet them both at once."}
