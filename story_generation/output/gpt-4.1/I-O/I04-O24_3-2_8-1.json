I remember the offhand comment I made at dinner last night, meant as a joke, but I saw the way her face fell. I know I need to call her, to apologize, to explain myself and listen\u2014really listen\u2014so we can move past this. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, clear the air, make things right. But my desk is covered in case files, the final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial. As a judge, I owe it to both parties to be fully prepared, to read every argument, every piece of evidence, so I can be fair and thorough in court. The clock ticks louder. My friend is waiting, probably hurting, but so are the lawyers and clients who expect my undivided attention. I feel pulled in two, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, and I can\u2019t ignore either. My hand hovers over the phone, heart pounding, as I try to decide which responsibility I can set aside, even for a moment."}
