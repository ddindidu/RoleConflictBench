I can\u2019t keep doing this if we don\u2019t figure things out.\u201d My heart pounded, knowing our argument had spiraled out of control. She expected me to step up, to resolve this, to show her that I cared enough to fight for us. I wanted to call her, to say the right words, to fix what was breaking between us.\n\nBut just as I reached for the phone, it buzzed again\u2014this time, my work line. A new client, cheerful but clueless, wanted to know how to safely start up the machine I\u2019d just serviced. \u201cCould you walk me through the basics?\u201d he asked, his tone light, but I knew he was counting on me to be patient and clear, to guide him so he wouldn\u2019t make a costly mistake.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my mind racing. My girlfriend needed me now, but so did my client. Both expected me to be present, to solve their problems, to be the person they could rely on. My hands shook as I hovered between calls, torn by the weight of what each role demanded from me."}
