My colleague, Priya, had just messaged, \u201cWill you have it by noon? I need it to finish my part.\u201d I knew if I missed the deadline, the whole team\u2019s project would be delayed. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my taxi app. A passenger had booked a ride to the airport, and the winter storm outside was already snarling traffic. The passenger\u2019s note was urgent: \u201cInternational flight, please hurry.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. As a colleague, I owed my team reliability; as a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, timely ride. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d miss the work deadline. If I stayed, my passenger might miss their flight. The snow kept falling, and I sat frozen, torn between two lives, each demanding more than I could give."}
