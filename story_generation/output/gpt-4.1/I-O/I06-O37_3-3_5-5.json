The tension from the argument with my teammates still pulsed in my chest. We were supposed to deliver our project draft tomorrow, but now, after the shouting and accusations, I doubted we\u2019d even have a draft at all. My mentor always said to reach out early if things went wrong, but I hesitated, not wanting to seem incapable.\n\nJust then, I noticed the empty bottle of the specialized cleaner on the shelf. My client expected the kitchen floors to be spotless, and this product was the only thing that worked on the stubborn stains. I was supposed to keep track of supplies, but I\u2019d been so distracted by my other worries that I\u2019d missed the last bottle running out. If I didn\u2019t fix this, I\u2019d let my client down.\n\nMy mind spun between the urge to call my mentor and the need to rush out and buy the cleaner. Both roles demanded immediate action, both expecting me to be responsible and proactive. I felt the pressure building, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
