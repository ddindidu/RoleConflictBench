He\u2019d been clear: \u201cHave it ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show I could handle the pressure and learn quickly. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my gym session. As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t optional; it\u2019s part of the job. If I skipped too many sessions, my supervisor would notice, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. Protecting others meant being at my best, physically and mentally. Yet, the code on my screen felt like a promise I couldn\u2019t break. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to my badge. I could feel the tension in my chest, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I glanced at the clock, knowing I had to choose, but unable to move."}
