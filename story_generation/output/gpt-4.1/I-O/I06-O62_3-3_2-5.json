My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cEvaluation tomorrow\u2014submit all tasks.\u201d I knew how much my mentor was counting on me to deliver, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But as I glanced out the window of the lifeguard office, I noticed the pool water looked cloudy. My gut twisted. I hurried to the filtration system and, after a quick check, realized it was malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the water could become unsafe for swimmers, and I was responsible for maintaining the equipment. The clock ticked louder in my mind. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust and the safety of everyone in the pool. My hands shook as I weighed the urgency of the broken filter against the looming deadline. I could almost hear both voices in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t let me down,\u201d and \u201cKeep everyone safe.\u201d I stood frozen, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
