It was Mina, my mentee from the community center, texting a quick question about her upcoming job interview. She often reached out during my breaks, and I prided myself on being available, sharing advice whenever she needed it. As I started typing a thoughtful response, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases behind them. \u201cCan you help us load these? And we\u2019d like to split the fare,\u201d one said, glancing at his watch. I knew what was expected\u2014professionalism, efficiency, and undivided attention to my passengers. But Mina\u2019s message blinked on my screen, her anxiety almost palpable through her words. I felt the tug of responsibility in both directions: the urge to guide Mina through her nerves, and the duty to provide prompt, courteous service to my customers. My hands hovered, one on my phone, the other reaching for the trunk, my mind caught in the tension between being the mentor Mina counted on and the reliable driver my passengers expected."}
