The store was finally quiet, but my mind was anything but. Just as I was double-checking the totals, Sarah, my mentee, appeared at the counter, her face lit up with curiosity. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I\u2019m struggling with the new inventory system. Can you walk me through it?\u201d she asked, hopeful.\n\nI knew she relied on me for guidance, and I prided myself on being approachable, always willing to share what I\u2019d learned. But the deposit procedure was strict\u2014no distractions, no shortcuts, every step logged and verified. Corporate had drilled it into us: mistakes could mean audits, or worse. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Sarah\u2019s eager eyes reminded me of my responsibility as a mentor, but the stack of cash and the policy manual at my elbow reminded me of the rules I couldn\u2019t bend. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urge to help and the need to comply, caught in the silent tug-of-war between who I wanted to be and what I had to do."}
