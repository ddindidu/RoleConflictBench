My mentor\u2019s email glared at me: \u201cPlease finish the project summary by tonight. Upper management will review it first thing tomorrow.\u201d I knew how important this was for my growth\u2014my mentor had stressed the need to meet deadlines, to show reliability. But just as I started typing, a customer walked in, holding a small, splintered wooden train. Her little boy clung to her leg, eyes wide with hope. \u201cCan you fix it? He won\u2019t sleep without it,\u201d she pleaded. As a carpenter, I prided myself on helping families, on restoring cherished things. She needed a repair quote now, before the shop closed. My mind raced\u2014if I stopped to assess the toy, I\u2019d lose precious time for my assignment. If I ignored her, I\u2019d fail my own standards as a craftsman. My hands hovered between the keyboard and the broken train, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
