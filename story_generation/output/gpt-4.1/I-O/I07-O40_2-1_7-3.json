They were waiting for my input on the project plan, and I knew the whole group was stalled until I clarified a detail in the document. As a colleague, I was expected to be responsive, to keep the workflow moving. But at that moment, I was knee-deep in sawdust, measuring planks for a custom bookshelf a client had just ordered. The order was urgent, and as the carpenter, it was on me to estimate the materials and get the supplies ordered before the hardware store closed. My hands were covered in wood glue, my mind split between the numbers on my tape measure and the pinging notifications from my phone. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I stopped to answer emails, I\u2019d lose my momentum and risk delaying the furniture order. But if I ignored my team, I\u2019d be letting them down, too. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, torn, unable to move forward in either world."}
