The team meeting was in ten minutes, and I knew I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I was invested in our project\u2019s success. These meetings were where the real updates happened\u2014decisions, pivots, the kind of information that never made it into emails. Missing it meant falling behind, letting my colleagues down, maybe even missing my chance to weigh in on something crucial.\n\nBut on my desk, the printout of the new appellate court decision glared up at me. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough, to stay current, to ensure every ruling I made was grounded in the latest law. The attorney\u2019s citation was fresh\u2014just last week\u2014and it could change the entire direction of the case before me. If I didn\u2019t review it before the next session, I risked making a misinformed judgment, undermining my credibility and the fairness of the process.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down. My colleagues needed me. Justice demanded my attention. I sat, paralyzed, as the clock ticked closer to the meeting\u2019s start."}
