The conversation had turned to the recent decisions made by a mutual colleague, and the group was dissecting every detail. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to join in, to nod along or add my own thoughts, but I\u2019ve always believed in steering clear of gossip. My phone buzzed urgently\u2014a notification from the court clerk. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed, and as the judge on call, I was expected to review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. I knew the demands of my judicial role: impartiality, thoroughness, and immediate attention to urgent matters. But here I was, caught between the social expectations of the group and the professional duty that required my undivided focus. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my heart pounding as I tried to decide whether to excuse myself abruptly or stay and risk being distracted from the critical case awaiting my judgment."}
