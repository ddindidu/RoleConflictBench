The conversation had turned sour, with whispers about her recent decisions at work. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to stay neutral, to avoid adding fuel to the gossip. But the group looked at me, expecting me to chime in, maybe even share something they didn\u2019t know. My stomach twisted with discomfort.\n\nJust then, the bell at the front desk rang. My last client of the day, Mrs. Carter, was raising her voice, clearly unhappy with her haircut. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to listen, stay calm, and make sure she left satisfied, even though we were minutes from closing. I could hear her complaints echoing through the salon, and I knew the group in the break room was listening too, waiting to see how I\u2019d handle it. I felt torn\u2014should I stay and maintain my role as a discreet acquaintance, or step out and fulfill my duty as a professional hairdresser, risking becoming the next topic of gossip? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
