The final team meeting was about to start\u2014this was the last chance to voice concerns before our department\u2019s new workflow was set in stone. My colleagues expected me to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about the team\u2019s future. But my phone kept buzzing with reminders: it was also the last day of the quarter, and I was still three sales short of my target. Management had made it clear\u2014if we didn\u2019t hit our numbers, there\u2019d be no bonuses, maybe even penalties. My headset sat on the desk, a silent demand to keep dialing, keep pitching, keep selling. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice: \u201cEvery call counts today.\u201d My stomach twisted as I imagined letting my team down by missing the meeting, or letting my sales team down by missing my quota. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
