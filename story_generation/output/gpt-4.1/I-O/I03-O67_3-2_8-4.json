We\u2019d said things we couldn\u2019t take back, and now he was inside, refusing to answer my calls. I knew I should go back in, try to fix things, show him I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I reached for the door handle, my radio crackled to life\u2014dispatch calling for an ambulance. A woman had fallen, broken her arm, and needed immediate care. My heart pounded. I was the closest unit. I could hear the urgency in the dispatcher\u2019s voice, and I knew someone was counting on me to help, to be calm and professional, to put their pain first. But my mind was still with him, replaying every word, every accusation. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to resolve things with the man I loved, the other bound by duty to a stranger in pain. I gripped the steering wheel, caught between the demands of my heart and the responsibility of my hands, not knowing which way to turn."}
