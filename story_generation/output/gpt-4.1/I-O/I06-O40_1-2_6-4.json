I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of these sessions\u2014after all, she\u2019d carved out time just for us mentees, and I didn\u2019t want to waste her generosity. But my other life tugged at me: the half-finished cabinetry at the site, the blueprints spread across the workbench, and the electrician waiting for my measurements before he could install the outlets. The contractor had already called twice, reminding me that delays would throw off everyone\u2019s schedule. I could almost smell the sawdust and hear the whir of drills, the pressure mounting with every tick of the clock.\n\nYet, I knew how much my mentor valued commitment. She\u2019d told us that showing up was half the battle, that respect for her time was respect for ourselves. I felt torn, my mind split between the quiet, focused conversations in her office and the noisy, urgent demands of the construction site. My hands itched to get back to the wood, but my conscience nagged at me not to let my mentor down. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which door to walk through."}
