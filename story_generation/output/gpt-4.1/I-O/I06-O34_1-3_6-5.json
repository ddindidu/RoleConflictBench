My mentor, Ms. Lee, had just messaged to remind me her office hours were open\u2014she\u2019d cleared her schedule for me, and I\u2019d promised to come by to discuss my progress. I knew how much she valued punctuality and respect for her time; she\u2019d mentioned it more than once. But just as I was about to log off and head to her office, a pilot\u2019s urgent voice crackled through my headset: \u201cTower, this is Delta 452, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors to the nearest runway.\u201d My heart pounded. The expectation was clear\u2014lives depended on my calm, precise instructions. I couldn\u2019t just walk away, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the commitment I\u2019d made to Ms. Lee. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the pressure build as I tried to decide which responsibility I could afford to let down."}
