My sales manager\u2019s emails flashed urgent reminders: we were just shy of our target, and every call mattered. My bonus\u2014and the team\u2019s\u2014hung in the balance. But my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She was panicking about her big project presentation, the one that could land her a promotion or set her back for months. She needed guidance, reassurance, maybe even a pep talk to steady her nerves. I could hear the desperation in her words, and I knew how much this moment meant for her growth. Yet, every minute I spent mentoring was a minute not spent dialing prospects, not closing deals. The pressure from management to perform was suffocating, but so was the responsibility I felt toward Maya\u2019s future. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the ringing phone lines and the blinking message, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
