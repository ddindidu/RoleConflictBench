As a judge, I knew the importance of clarity and precision\u2014every word in my order would shape the course of the case. The deadline loomed, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, a young associate I\u2019d mentored for years. She wanted to talk through a job offer she\u2019d received, hoping for my usual casual advice. As her mentor, I wanted to be present, to listen, to help her navigate her career crossroads. But the order demanded my full attention; any distraction could lead to an oversight, a misstep in the legal process. I stared at the phone, torn between the expectation to guide Maya and the duty to deliver a flawless, timely order. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety tangling together as I weighed the needs of my mentee against the demands of the court."}
