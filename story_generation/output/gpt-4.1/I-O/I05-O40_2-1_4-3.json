My phone buzzed with a reminder: the mentoring session I\u2019d promised my apprentice was in thirty minutes. I\u2019d spent hours preparing a lesson plan, determined to share the tricks I\u2019d learned over years of carpentry\u2014how to read wood, how to coax it into shape, how to avoid the mistakes that cost time and money. But just as I was about to gather my notes, the shop phone rang. A new client needed a custom bookshelf, and they wanted an estimate by the end of the day. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. I needed to measure, calculate materials, and place an order before the supplier closed. My apprentice waited in the next room, expecting guidance and attention. The client expected professionalism and speed. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest, unsure which demand to answer first."}
