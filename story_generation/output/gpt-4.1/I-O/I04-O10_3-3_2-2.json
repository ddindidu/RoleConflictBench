On the other end, my best friend\u2019s voice trembled with tears\u2014her father had just been rushed to the hospital. She needed me to listen, to be present, to help her hold together the pieces of her world. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to offer comfort, but my laptop screen glowed accusingly from across the room. Just an hour earlier, I\u2019d received an urgent email from the external auditor: they needed the quarterly financial statements by sunrise. As an accountant, accuracy and timeliness were non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between the spreadsheet\u2019s demands and my friend\u2019s pain. She sobbed, asking if I could stay on the line, and I could hear the expectation in her voice. At the same time, the clock ticked down, each minute lost making the audit deadline feel more impossible. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my loyalty and professionalism pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which part of me to let down."}
