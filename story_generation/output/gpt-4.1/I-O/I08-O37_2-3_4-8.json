My phone buzzed\u2014an acquaintance, Mark, was moving into a new apartment nearby and needed help carrying some boxes. He sounded desperate, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help, to be supportive and friendly. But my mind raced with the protocols drilled into me at work: always wear gloves, never touch surfaces without sanitizing, and avoid close contact. Mark\u2019s new place was still being unpacked, probably dusty and cluttered, and I doubted he had extra gloves or masks. If I helped, I\u2019d risk breaking the safety rules I\u2019d promised to uphold, possibly bringing germs home or back to work. Yet, if I refused, I\u2019d feel like I was letting him down, not being the helpful person I wanted to be. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation I could afford to break."}
