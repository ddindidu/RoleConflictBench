Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your shift?\u201d I can sense the disappointment behind his words, and I know I should call him, clear up the misunderstanding before it festers. But just then, the nurse knocks and ushers in my next patient\u2014a teenager with a sore throat, fever, and worried mother in tow. I slip on my professional mask, listen to symptoms, and prepare to examine her, all the while my mind tugs back to Alex. He expects me to be present, to resolve our conflict with reassurance and honesty. My patient expects me to focus, to diagnose and prescribe the right treatment. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which part of me I\u2019ll have to let down, even if just for a moment."}
