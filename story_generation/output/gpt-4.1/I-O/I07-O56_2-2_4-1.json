The deadline was in an hour, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t send it on time, the next person wouldn\u2019t be able to start their part. The pressure was mounting; I could almost feel my colleague\u2019s anxious eyes on the clock from across the city. Just then, the bell above the door chimed. A young woman stepped in, clutching her bag, her eyes darting nervously around the salon. I could see her uncertainty, the way she hesitated at the threshold, clearly needing a warm welcome. My heart twisted. I knew how important it was to greet clients, to make them feel at ease from the moment they arrived. But my mind was still tangled in spreadsheets and deadlines, torn between the demands of my team and the needs of this anxious client. I hovered at my station, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
