I have to be out, and it\u2019s important.\u201d I nodded, knowing how often her deliveries get missed. I promised I\u2019d keep an ear out for the doorbell. Just as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the plant. The new operator was at it again, fiddling with the press settings, and the supervisor wanted me to guide him through the process, step by step, over a video call. They needed me right away; the material waste was adding up, and the client was getting impatient. I felt the pressure mounting. If I focused on the call, I might miss the doorbell and let Mrs. Lee down. But if I waited by the door, the operator would keep making costly mistakes. Both sides expected me to be present, attentive, and reliable. My stomach twisted as I stared at the clock, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible repairer, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
