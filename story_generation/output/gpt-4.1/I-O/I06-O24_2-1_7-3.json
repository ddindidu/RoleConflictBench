My mentor had managed to squeeze in a rare fifteen-minute slot for me between her court hearings. As her mentee, I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second. I\u2019d prepared my questions, determined to make the most of this opportunity. But as I gathered my notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the scheduling order for the new case was due by Friday. As a judge, I was expected to draft clear, thorough orders\u2014no shortcuts, no delays. The case was already drawing attention, and I knew the attorneys would scrutinize every word. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. If I focused on my mentor, I risked rushing the order and missing important details. If I prioritized the order, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s rare availability and possibly lose her guidance. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to the court, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
