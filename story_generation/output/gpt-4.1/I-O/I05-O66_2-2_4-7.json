In ten minutes, I was supposed to start a mentoring session with my eager group of interns, all waiting for me to guide them through the final steps before their big project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing a structured lesson, determined to share every bit of knowledge they\u2019d need to succeed. But as I pulled my taxi to the curb, two travelers flagged me down, their arms waving and faces anxious. They had several heavy suitcases and needed help loading them, asking if I could wait while they sorted out how to split the fare. I could see their stress\u2014they were counting on me for a smooth, professional ride to the airport. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentoring session starts now.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My interns needed my guidance, but these travelers needed my service. I gripped the steering wheel, caught between the responsibility to teach and the duty to deliver."}
