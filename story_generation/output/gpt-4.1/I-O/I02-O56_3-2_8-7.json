She wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes, her jaw set, lips pressed tight. Just an hour ago, we\u2019d been in the car, voices raised, words sharp and raw. Now, as her boyfriend, I was supposed to fix things, to say something that would make her believe we could work through this. But as her hairdresser, I had a job to do\u2014her hair was sweaty and greasy from her gym session, and I knew I needed to wash and condition it before I could even think about cutting or styling.\n\nShe expected me to talk, to reach out, to resolve the fight that had left us both questioning everything. But the salon was filling up, and my manager was watching. I was expected to be professional, to treat her like any other client. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do first\u2014address the pain between us, or simply ask her to follow me to the sinks. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between what she needed from me as her boyfriend and what was required of me as her hairdresser."}
