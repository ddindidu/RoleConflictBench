As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was engaged, even though it was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded. But right now, I was behind the wheel, my other role as a taxi driver in full swing. My passenger, a young woman with anxious eyes, had told me she was running late for a job interview. The roads were clear, traffic was light, and the speed limit was generous, but I knew I couldn\u2019t cut corners. As a driver, I was expected to follow every rule, drive safely, and not let distractions\u2014like a work meeting\u2014pull my attention away. My phone buzzed with the meeting reminder, and I felt the pressure mounting. Should I pull over and join the call, risking my passenger\u2019s schedule? Or keep driving, missing the meeting and possibly letting my team down? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
