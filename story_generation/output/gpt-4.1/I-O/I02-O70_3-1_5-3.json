My girlfriend smiles across the table, her hand reaching for mine. It\u2019s our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I promised her this day would be just for us\u2014no distractions, no work. My phone buzzes again. It\u2019s the delivery app: a high-value package needs to be dropped off in the next hour, and the customer isn\u2019t home. The instructions are clear\u2014leave it at the doorstep, take a photo, and make sure it\u2019s safe. If I miss this, I risk a bad review and maybe even my job. But if I leave now, I\u2019ll break my promise to her, shattering these precious hours we have left. She\u2019s looking at me, expecting me to be present, to make memories before she goes. My job expects me to be reliable, to never let a package\u2014or a customer\u2014down. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my chest tight as I try to decide which promise I\u2019m about to break."}
