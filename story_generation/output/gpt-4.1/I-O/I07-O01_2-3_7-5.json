They\u2019re waiting for my input on a technical detail before they can move forward, and I know the expectation: as a good colleague, I should respond quickly, keep the workflow smooth, and not hold anyone up. But my mind is deep in the hospital wing design spread out before me\u2014sketches, floor plans, and codebooks scattered in organized chaos. As the architect, I\u2019m responsible for ensuring every inch of this space works flawlessly, especially the operating rooms and emergency routes. One oversight could mean disaster for future patients. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides: the team\u2019s impatience for a quick reply, and the weight of responsibility to get this design right. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the urgent ping of my colleagues and the silent, critical demands of the blueprint in front of me."}
