We planned everything\u2014dinner at our favorite place, a walk by the river, just us, no distractions. He looked at me with that soft smile, and I felt the weight of how much I\u2019d miss him. My phone buzzed, and I tried to ignore it, but the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress, multiple bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart pounded. I saw the hope in his eyes, the silent plea for just a few more hours together. But I also saw the badge on my chest reflected in the restaurant window, reminding me of the oath I took. I could hear the urgency in the call, the fear in the background. I was torn\u2014between the woman he needed and the officer the city depended on. My hands shook as I gripped my phone, caught between love and duty, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
