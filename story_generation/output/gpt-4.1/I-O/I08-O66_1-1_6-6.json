As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking ill of anyone, especially someone I saw regularly. But the conversation kept circling back to Ravi, and everyone seemed to expect me to join in, nodding or adding my own thoughts. My phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. I excused myself and hurried to my cab, relieved for the escape.\n\nSliding into the driver\u2019s seat, I noticed crumbs on the back seat from my last passenger. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless, always ready for the next customer. I grabbed a cloth, wiping down the seat, but my mind was still with the group outside. Should I have said something to steer the conversation away from Ravi? Was my silence enough, or did it make me complicit? I glanced at the rearview mirror, seeing my own conflicted eyes. The pressure to be a good acquaintance and a professional driver pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in as my next passenger approached."}
