She\u2019d been missing deadlines, and I could see the frustration in her eyes. As her mentor, I wanted to help her find a way to balance her workload, to encourage her to set realistic goals and develop better habits. I started to share some strategies that had helped me, hoping to spark a sense of control and confidence in her.\n\nJust as Jamie began to open up about her struggles, the radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 4, emergency call, possible cardiac arrest, respond immediately.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to drop everything and get behind the wheel, racing against time to save a life. But Jamie\u2019s eyes pleaded for guidance, for just a few more minutes of my attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding I nurture growth, the other demanding I act without delay. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet, persistent need of someone counting on me."}
