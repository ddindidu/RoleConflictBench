I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt them, but the look on their face when I made that offhand comment haunted me. I knew I needed to call and apologize right away, to explain myself and try to fix things before the misunderstanding grew. But just as I reached for my phone, the salon door chimed and Mrs. Lee walked in, her usual bright smile in place. The receptionist was chatting with another stylist, leaving me as the only one available to greet her. As a hairdresser, I was expected to welcome clients warmly, make them feel at ease from the moment they stepped in. I could see Mrs. Lee looking around, waiting for that familiar greeting. My phone buzzed in my hand, my friend\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding immediate honesty and care, the other expecting professional warmth and attention. My mind raced, caught between the urge to fix my friendship and the duty to my client, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
