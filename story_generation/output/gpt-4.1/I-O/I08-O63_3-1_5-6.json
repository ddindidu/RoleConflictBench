It was Jamie, an old friend I hadn\u2019t spoken to in months. Her voice trembled, \u201cMy car broke down on Maple Road. Can you help me?\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to rush to her side, to be the reliable person she could count on. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break now\u2014fifteen minutes, no more, no less. The call volume was light, and my supervisor had said we could be flexible, but I knew if I stretched my break too long, I\u2019d be letting my team down and risking a reprimand. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: Jamie needed me, but so did my job. I stared at the clock, torn between the urge to help a friend in distress and the responsibility to stick to my work schedule."}
