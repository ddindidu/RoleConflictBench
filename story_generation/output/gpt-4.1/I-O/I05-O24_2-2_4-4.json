As a mentor, I had promised my group a well-structured session this afternoon, determined to share the skills they\u2019d need before their big project deadline. I\u2019d spent days preparing materials, eager to see them grow. But as a judge, I had just wrapped up a complex bench trial, and the expectation weighed heavily: I needed to write a clear, detailed judgment, complete with findings of fact and conclusions of law, all within the next thirty days. The case was intricate, the parties anxious for closure, and my legal opinion would shape their futures. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds\u2014mentees asking for guidance, court staff checking on my progress. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. If I focused on my mentees, I risked delaying justice; if I dove into the judgment, I\u2019d let down those counting on my mentorship. The pressure mounted, my heart pounding as I stared at my calendar, wrestling with the impossible choice between nurturing growth and upholding justice."}
