I\u2019m free all week, just want to see you.\u201d My heart warms\u2014he\u2019s been looking forward to this, and honestly, so have I. We haven\u2019t had a real date in weeks, and I know he expects me to pick a night soon so we can plan something special. But just as I start to reply, my headset buzzes. Another call. I slip into my telemarketer voice, only to be met with a furious customer. He\u2019s been with our company for years, and now he\u2019s questioning every detail of the new offer, his voice rising with each objection. My manager expects me to handle this perfectly\u2014no mistakes, no lost sales. I feel my chest tighten. Alex is waiting for an answer, wanting to feel like a priority, but my job demands my full attention right now. I can\u2019t let either down, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between typing a quick reply to Alex or focusing on calming the customer, my mind spinning with the weight of both expectations."}
