As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the project report by Friday. There was plenty of buffer time, and honestly, the team could move forward without my section for a bit. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down or seem unreliable. But as an architect, my mind kept drifting to the hospital wing design sprawled across my drafting table. The plans for the operating rooms and emergency routes needed my full attention\u2014one miscalculation could compromise patient safety. My manager wanted updates on the report, while the hospital board was waiting for my design revisions. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest.
