It was my friend, panicked, saying they were on their way to the airport and thought they\u2019d left their passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it to me? I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise,\u201d they pleaded. I glanced at the clock; the pharmacy was busy, and I was the only pharmacist on duty.
