Just minutes ago, I\u2019d learned that a joke I made at lunch had really hurt my friend, Jamie. The guilt gnawed at me\u2014I needed to call and apologize, to explain myself, to fix things before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, Mrs. Carter, my patient, looked up at me with watery eyes. \u201cCould you stay a little longer?\u201d she asked softly. She\u2019d been especially quiet today, and I knew she needed someone to talk to, someone to just be there. My mind raced. Jamie was probably stewing, waiting for my call, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting her down. But Mrs. Carter was counting on me too, and I\u2019d promised to always be present for my patients. I felt torn in two, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which need was greater, or which role I should answer first."}
