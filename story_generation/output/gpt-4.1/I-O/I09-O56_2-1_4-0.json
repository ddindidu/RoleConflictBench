My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, was coming home with her arms full of groceries. My dog, always eager and a bit too vocal, started barking loudly, his voice bouncing off the walls. I knew Mrs. Lee valued peace and quiet, and I felt a pang of guilt as she shot me a tired smile. I tried to hush my dog, but he only barked louder.\n\nAt that moment, my phone buzzed. The salon receptionist texted: \u201cYour 2 o\u2019clock is here early!\u201d I glanced at the time\u2014my regular client, Mr. Park, always expected a warm greeting and a few minutes of friendly conversation before his appointment. I could picture him now, standing awkwardly at the front, waiting for me to make him feel welcome.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. Should I rush my dog inside to keep the peace with my neighbor, or dash to the salon to greet Mr. Park and uphold my reputation as a caring hairdresser? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds."}
