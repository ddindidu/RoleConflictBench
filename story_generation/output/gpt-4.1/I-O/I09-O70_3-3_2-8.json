As a neighbor, I knew everyone expected me to be friendly, especially today, with the recent noise complaint circulating. Mrs. Kim, who lived across the hall, was waiting by the mailboxes, her expression tense. I greeted her with a polite smile, trying to ease the tension, but she barely nodded, clearly upset about the noise. At the same moment, my phone buzzed\u2014one of my delivery customers was asking about a missing package, their message sharp and impatient. I felt the pressure mounting: as a delivery person, I needed to respond quickly and professionally, but as a neighbor, I couldn\u2019t just brush past Mrs. Kim without addressing her concerns. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure my neighbor and the responsibility to resolve the delivery issue. Both roles demanded my attention, both required courtesy, but I couldn\u2019t give my full self to either. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
