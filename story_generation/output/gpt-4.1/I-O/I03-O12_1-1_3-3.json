My boyfriend and I had finally found a week where our evenings were mostly free\u2014a rare alignment. He\u2019d been dropping hints about wanting to spend more time together, maybe try that new ramen place or just have a quiet night in. I wanted that too, to be present, to show him he mattered.\n\nBut then, an email pinged: the product team scheduled a big brainstorming session for the next sprint. Attendance was optional, but I knew how these things went. If I showed up, I could help shape the new features, maybe even push for ideas I\u2019d been mulling over. It was a chance to collaborate, to be seen as a team player, to grow.\n\nI felt torn. If I picked a date night, would I be letting my team down\u2014or missing a chance to shine? If I went to the session, would I be telling him he wasn\u2019t my priority? My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, caught between wanting to be the girlfriend he deserved and the developer my team needed."}
