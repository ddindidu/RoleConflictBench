My colleagues\u2019 faces flickered onto the monitor, and I knew this was the one meeting I couldn\u2019t miss\u2014project updates that would shape the next month, and no one would recap them later. But as the meeting started, the radio crackled. A cargo flight requested an early approach, and a private jet filed a last-minute flight plan. The airspace was usually quiet at this hour, but now, I could see the beginnings of a bottleneck. My supervisor expected me to keep the skies safe, no matter how light the traffic. My team expected me to contribute, to show I was invested. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the silent expectation of my colleagues and the blinking lights on my radar. My heart pounded as I weighed which voice to answer first, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
