We\u2019d both cleared our schedules, and she\u2019d been looking forward to it, texting me ideas for dinner and movies. But now, as I gripped the steering wheel of the ambulance, rain hammered the windshield, and lightning split the sky. The patient in the back was barely hanging on, and every second counted. Dispatch was urging me to hurry, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. My mind kept flickering back to Mia, to her hopeful smile, to the promise I\u2019d made. But here, in this storm, someone\u2019s life depended on me not just being fast, but careful. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to keep my word to Mia, to be the boyfriend she deserved, the other part knowing that right now, I was the only thing standing between a stranger and disaster. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how to be both things at once."}
