As a colleague, I knew the task I was working on was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it by noon, the whole project would stall, and our client would be left waiting. My team was counting on me, and I could almost hear the tension in their voices from this morning\u2019s meeting: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays.\u201d\n\nBut as a telemarketer, the rules were strict. My break was scheduled for 11:30, and the compliance system tracked every second. If I missed it, or if I kept working through it, the system would flag me. Too many flags, and I\u2019d be called in for a warning\u2014or worse. The pressure was suffocating. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between finishing the task for my team and logging out for my break to avoid disciplinary action. My heart pounded as the minute hand crept forward, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding different things at the exact same moment."}
