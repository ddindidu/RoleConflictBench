She was anxious, and I could see how much she relied on my feedback to keep her on track. My phone buzzed\u2014dispatch was calling. There\u2019d been a traffic accident just a few blocks away, and I was the closest officer on duty. I glanced at Jamie, her eyes searching mine for reassurance, and then at the flashing notification on my phone. As a mentor, I was expected to be present, to provide steady guidance and support. As a police officer, I was sworn to protect the community, to respond quickly when people needed help. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my mentee and the urgent call to duty. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart pounded as I realized I had to choose, knowing that whichever path I took, I would be letting someone down."}
