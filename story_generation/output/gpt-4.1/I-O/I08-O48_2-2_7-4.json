Her temperature was a little high, and her pulse was faster than usual. I knew I needed to record everything accurately and maybe alert the nurse if things didn\u2019t settle. Just then, Mark, someone I\u2019d chatted with a few times, leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you see how slow Jamie was with her rounds today? She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. As an acquaintance, I didn\u2019t want to encourage gossip or say anything negative about Jamie. But as a nursing assistant, I was already distracted, worried about Mrs. Lee\u2019s numbers and whether I should act quickly. Mark waited for my response, expecting me to agree or at least react, while my mind raced with concern for my patient and the pressure to maintain professionalism. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between what I should say and what I needed to do."}
