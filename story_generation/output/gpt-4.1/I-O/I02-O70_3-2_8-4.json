My girlfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, her texts coming in rapid succession\u2014each one sharper than the last. Our argument from last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was threatening to end things if I didn\u2019t call her back and talk it through. My chest tightened. I knew she expected me to drop everything, to be the boyfriend who could fix things, who would listen and make it right.\n\nBut I was on the clock, and the customer was already waiting at the door, arms crossed, eyeing the package. Company policy was clear: I needed to get a signature for anything over fifty dollars, no exceptions. If I left the package unattended or rushed the process, I could get written up\u2014or worse. My girlfriend\u2019s words echoed in my head, but so did my supervisor\u2019s warnings. I stood there, torn, the phone vibrating in my hand, the customer impatient, and my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
