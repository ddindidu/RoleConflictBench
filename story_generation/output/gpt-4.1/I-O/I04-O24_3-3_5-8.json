My mind was focused, every word carefully chosen, when my clerk slipped me a note. Supreme Court ruling\u2014precedent overturned. My heart skipped. I knew I had to stop, review the new ruling, and adjust everything on the spot.

I glanced down\u2014three missed calls from Sam, my oldest friend. A frantic text: \u201cCar broke down, highway, scared, please come.\u201d I could picture Sam, stranded and anxious, counting on me to show up like I always had.

My hands trembled as I weighed the demands of justice against the call of friendship, caught in a moment where I could not be both."}
