I miss you.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d both finally found a few free evenings this week. She\u2019d been looking forward to us spending real, uninterrupted time together\u2014something we hadn\u2019t managed in weeks. But as I tucked my phone away, Mrs. Carter, one of my regular patients, caught my eye from her bed. She looked smaller than usual, her voice barely above a whisper when she asked if I could stay a little longer. She\u2019d been especially lonely lately, and I knew how much she counted on my visits for comfort and conversation. My supervisor always said that emotional support was just as important as physical care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mia\u2019s hopeful anticipation, Mrs. Carter\u2019s quiet need. My heart tugged in two directions, each expectation valid, each demand urgent. I stood in the hallway, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and unsure which promise I should keep."}
