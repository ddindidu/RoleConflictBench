I promised him this time, no distractions, just us. But the headset crackles in my ear, and the radar blips multiply. The weather is shifting fast\u2014cloud tops are rising, and pilots are calling in, waiting for my instructions. My supervisor\u2019s voice is tense: \u201cWe need you focused. Pilots need those climb updates now.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My partner expects my presence, my warmth, my undivided attention. The pilots expect my calm, my precision, my vigilance. I stare at the clock, torn between the love I want to hold onto and the responsibility I can\u2019t abandon. My hands tremble as I hover between the phone and the radio, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
