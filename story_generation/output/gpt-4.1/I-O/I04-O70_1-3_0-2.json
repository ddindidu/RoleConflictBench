It was Mia, my best friend, texting: \u201cUgh, today\u2019s been endless. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her, like I always tried to be. But the hospital was only fifteen minutes away, and traffic was unpredictable. The package in my hands wasn\u2019t just any delivery\u2014it was marked \u201curgent,\u201d and I\u2019d been told it was needed for a patient\u2019s treatment. If I was late, it could mean real trouble for someone I\u2019d never meet. My thumb hovered over my phone, torn between calling Mia to offer comfort and jumping in the van to beat the clock. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my friend needed my ear, but my job demanded my speed. My heart raced as I stood there, caught between the two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
