The final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial demand my full attention\u2014every detail could tip the balance. But my phone buzzes again. It\u2019s Mia. We\u2019ve argued about money all week, and I know she\u2019s waiting for me to reach out, to resolve things before bed. As her boyfriend, I should be there, listening, reassuring her that we\u2019re a team. But as a judge, I can\u2019t afford distraction; the parties in tomorrow\u2019s case expect fairness, diligence, and a mind unclouded by personal drama. My chest tightens as I glance between the unread messages and the dense legal arguments. I want to be the partner Mia needs, but I also can\u2019t let my professional integrity slip. The weight of both roles presses down, each demanding more than I feel I can give tonight."}
