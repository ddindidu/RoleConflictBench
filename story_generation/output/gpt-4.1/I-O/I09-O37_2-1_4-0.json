Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a look as she passed, her lips pressed tight. I knew she expected me, as her neighbor, to keep the noise down and respect the peace in our building. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was also expected to keep the hallway spotless, which meant being out here, vacuuming and tidying up the shoes and mail that always seemed to pile up. My supervisor had already mentioned that the shared spaces needed to look immaculate for the building inspection next week. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I ignored the cleaning, I\u2019d be letting down my boss, but if I kept at it, my dog would keep barking and I\u2019d be the inconsiderate neighbor everyone complained about. My heart pounded as I stood there, vacuum in hand, torn between shutting off the machine and rushing to calm my dog, or finishing the job and risking another icy glare from Mrs. Lee."}
