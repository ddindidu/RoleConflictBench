She clutched a crumpled tissue, barely able to speak. As her acquaintance, I felt the urge to comfort her, to ask what happened, to offer a listening ear. I knew she needed someone to be present, to show warmth and understanding. But as I glanced at the thick file in my hand, the weight of my other role pressed down on me. The bench trial had just ended, and the parties were anxiously awaiting my written judgment. The law required me to deliver a clear, detailed opinion within thirty days, and the case was complex\u2014every word would be scrutinized. I could already feel the pressure mounting, the expectation to be thorough and impartial, to meet the deadline. My mind raced between the demands: Sarah\u2019s pain and my duty to the court. I stood there, torn, my heart aching for her but my thoughts pulled toward the judgment I had to write, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both the friend she needed and the judge the law demanded."}
