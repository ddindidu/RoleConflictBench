The case was intricate, and I needed every minute to prepare. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the impromptu lobby meeting regarding the noise complaint that had everyone on edge. As a neighbor, I was expected to show up, be friendly, and help keep the peace. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I went, I\u2019d lose precious time for my judicial review, risking the thoroughness expected of me as a judge. But if I stayed, I\u2019d seem aloof or uncaring to my neighbors, possibly straining relationships I valued. My mind raced with the competing demands: the duty to justice, the duty to community. I stood in the hallway, case files in one hand, apartment keys in the other, heart pounding as I weighed which role to honor in this moment."}
