She could barely speak, her words tumbling out about her father\u2019s sudden illness. I sat up, heart pounding, listening as she sobbed, desperate for comfort. I wanted to stay on the line, to be the friend she needed\u2014someone who would listen, reassure, and just be there. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety crept in. My first patient\u2019s appointment was at 7:30 a.m., and I knew she\u2019d been anxious about her health for weeks. As her doctor, I was expected to be calm, focused, and empathetic, ready to answer her questions and ease her worries. I felt torn, caught between the urge to support my friend through her heartbreak and the responsibility to be present and attentive for my patient in just a few hours. My mind raced, guilt and worry battling inside me, as I tried to figure out how to be both the friend and the doctor everyone needed me to be."}
