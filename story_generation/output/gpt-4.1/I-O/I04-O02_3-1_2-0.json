It was Sam, my closest friend, his voice trembling as he told me about his father\u2019s sudden illness. He needed me\u2014someone to listen, to help him make sense of the chaos. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to focus on his words, to be present for him. But in the back of my mind, the project I\u2019d been mulling over all week crept in. We were still in the early stages, but I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d sketch out some ideas tonight, before the team meeting tomorrow. I could almost see the blank page on my desk, the pressure to contribute something innovative, to prove my worth as an engineer. Sam\u2019s sobs pulled me back. He was counting on me, but so was my team. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me\u2014how could I be a good friend and a responsible engineer at the same time? My mind raced, caught between the urge to comfort Sam and the responsibility to my work, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
