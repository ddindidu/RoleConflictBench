As I approached to refill my water bottle, I caught a snippet about someone in the office\u2014something personal, something that could easily spiral into damaging gossip. I knew the person they were talking about, and I also knew the truth behind the rumor. As an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to step in, to protect their reputation, or at least not add fuel to the fire by saying anything negative.\n\nBut just as I was weighing my words, my radio crackled. The production line supervisor\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bearing screeching on line three\u2014need you now!\u201d As the machine repairer, I was expected to drop everything and rush to prevent a costly breakdown. My hands itched to grab my toolbox, but my mind was still tangled in the conversation I\u2019d just overheard. Should I intervene and risk being late to the repair, or should I walk away, leaving the gossip unchecked? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, torn between my roles, unsure which demand to answer first."}
