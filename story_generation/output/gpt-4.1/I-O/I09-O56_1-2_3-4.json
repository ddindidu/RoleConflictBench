As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate\u2014never overfilling the bins, making sure there\u2019s space for everyone\u2019s garbage. But today, my mind was elsewhere. At the salon, a first-time client sat in my chair, frowning at her reflection. The color wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for, and I could see her disappointment. My heart raced as I tried to reassure her, knowing how important it was to address her concerns and make her feel heard. But then I remembered my neighbor had asked if she could use some space in my bin for her extra bags. If I said yes, I might be seen as too lenient, risking complaints from others about fairness. If I said no, I\u2019d feel guilty for not helping. Meanwhile, my client\u2019s eyes searched mine for a solution, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014wanting to be a good neighbor, wanting to be a professional hairdresser. I stood there, torn, the demands of both worlds colliding inside me."}
