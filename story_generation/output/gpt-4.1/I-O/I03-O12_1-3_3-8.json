I\u2019m free any evening.\u201d I smile, picturing us laughing over dinner, finally unwinding after our busy days. He\u2019s been hinting that we haven\u2019t had much time together lately, and I know he\u2019s hoping for a night where I\u2019m not distracted by work. I want that too\u2014just us, no laptops, no notifications.\n\nBut then my work chat pings, and my heart sinks. There\u2019s a production outage, and the root cause is a bug in my code. Users are locked out, and the support team is escalating. My manager\u2019s message is clear: \u201cWe need you on this ASAP.\u201d I feel the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. Customers are frustrated, and the team is counting on me to fix it\u2014tonight, if possible.\n\nI glance between my phone and my laptop, torn. I want to be present for him, to show him he matters. But I can\u2019t ignore the crisis at work. My chest tightens as I try to figure out how to be both the girlfriend he deserves and the developer my team needs."}
