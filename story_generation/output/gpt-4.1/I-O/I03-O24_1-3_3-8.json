We\u2019d been talking about trying that new Italian place, maybe catching a movie after. He\u2019d been dropping hints about how much he missed our long, unhurried conversations. I promised him I\u2019d make time, that work wouldn\u2019t get in the way. But today, as I stood in court, reading jury instructions, my clerk slipped me a note. The Supreme Court had just issued a ruling\u2014one that completely upended the precedent I was relying on. My heart pounded. I knew I had to stop, review the new decision, and rewrite my instructions. The legal community would expect me to be on top of this, to set the right example. But all I could think about was the dinner reservation I\u2019d made for tonight, the look on Alex\u2019s face if I canceled again. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
