I can\u2019t keep fighting about money.\u201d My chest tightens. I know I should call him, try to smooth things over, but the headset presses against my ear, grounding me in the tower. The radio crackles. \u201cTower, this is Delta 452, request current altimeter setting.\u201d My training kicks in\u2014I\u2019m supposed to respond immediately, keep the skies safe, no room for distraction. But my mind is split. Alex expects me to be present, to fix what\u2019s broken between us, to show him that our relationship matters more than my stubbornness. At the same time, the pilots expect me to be focused, precise, to keep them safe above the clouds. My finger hovers over the transmit button, but my thoughts are tangled between the words I owe Alex and the instructions I owe the aircraft. The weight of both worlds presses in, and for a moment, I can\u2019t move, caught between the person I love and the job I can\u2019t afford to fail."}
