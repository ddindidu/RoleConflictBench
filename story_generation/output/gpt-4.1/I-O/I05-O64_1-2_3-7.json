The line stretched past the bakery, and I could feel the impatience simmering. In the middle of this, my mentee, Jamie, sidled up during my break, notebook in hand, eyes bright with curiosity. \u201cHey, can you explain how you handle difficult customers?\u201d Jamie asked, voice low but eager. I wanted to give a thoughtful answer, to share the tricks I\u2019d learned over the years, but the next customer was already unloading their cart, glancing at their watch. My manager\u2019s expectation for speedy, friendly service pressed on me, but so did Jamie\u2019s hope for guidance. I felt torn, my mind racing between the need to be present for the customers and the responsibility to nurture Jamie\u2019s growth. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
