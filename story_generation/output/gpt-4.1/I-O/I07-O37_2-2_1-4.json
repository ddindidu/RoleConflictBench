In fifteen minutes, our team meeting would start\u2014one of those rare sessions where the project manager promised to share updates that wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I was invested in the team\u2019s progress. But as I mentally prepared for the meeting, my other role pressed in: the housekeeping cleaner. I\u2019d just finished my morning rounds at Mrs. Lee\u2019s apartment and noticed her floor cleaner was almost gone. If I didn\u2019t let her know today, she wouldn\u2019t have time to buy more before my next visit, and I\u2019d be left unable to do my job properly. I could text her now, but that would mean missing the start of the meeting\u2014or worse, being distracted and missing something important. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations: be a reliable colleague, or a responsible cleaner. Both roles demanded my attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
