He\u2019s sitting beside me, holding my hand, and I can feel how much this time means to him. I want to be present, to laugh and talk and make memories before he goes. But I\u2019m also behind the wheel, working my shift as a taxi driver, because I couldn\u2019t afford to take the night off. My phone buzzes with another ride request, but I ignore it, focusing on the road ahead.\n\nSuddenly, we hit a construction detour, and the lanes squeeze together. Up ahead, a school zone sign flashes, and I spot a group of kids lingering near the curb. Alex glances at the clock, anxious about making our dinner reservation. I know he\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll hurry, just this once, so we don\u2019t lose our only night together. But my training and the law are clear: slow down, be extra cautious, no matter what. My heart pounds as I grip the wheel, torn between the urge to make this night perfect for Alex and the responsibility to keep everyone safe."}
