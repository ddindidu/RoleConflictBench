The text from Jamie is still on the screen: \u201cDid you really mean what you said earlier?\u201d I replay the conversation in my head, realizing too late how my careless joke must have sounded. I know I need to call Jamie right now, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding festers. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, make things right. But as I reach for my phone, the intercom crackles. \u201cOperator, can you tell me which stop is closest to the museum?\u201d a passenger\u2019s voice asks, uncertain and a little anxious. I glance up at the security monitors, seeing the crowded car, the expectant faces. My job is to keep everyone safe, to be present, attentive, helpful. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my friend needs me, but so do these passengers.
