My mentee, Sarah, pings me for a quick chat\u2014her message hints at frustration, and I remember our last check-in when she admitted struggling to juggle her workload. As her mentor, I want to be there, to listen and help her untangle her time management knots. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m shackled to the rigid schedule enforced by the compliance system. If I take even a minute outside my allotted break, the system will flag me, and I could face a warning or worse. My headset feels heavier as I weigh the expectations: Sarah needs support now, but my job demands strict adherence to the clock. I hover over the chat window, torn between the urge to encourage her growth and the fear of disciplinary action. The break timer blinks insistently, and I feel the pressure mounting, caught between being the mentor I aspire to be and the employee I\u2019m required to be."}
