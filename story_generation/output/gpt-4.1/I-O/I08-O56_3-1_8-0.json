As her hairdresser, I was supposed to greet her warmly, make her feel at ease, and chat about whatever was on her mind. But as her acquaintance, I\u2019d just learned something sensitive about her\u2014something that, if it slipped out, could really hurt her reputation. The receptionist was nearby, ready to join in on the conversation, and I knew how quickly salon talk could turn into gossip. My hands felt clammy as I welcomed Marissa, my mind racing with the weight of what I knew. I wanted to be friendly and open, but I also felt a responsibility to protect her privacy. The receptionist glanced at me, expecting me to lead the conversation, and I could sense Marissa waiting for the usual lighthearted banter. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectations of being a good hairdresser and a trustworthy acquaintance, unsure how to keep both roles from colliding."}
