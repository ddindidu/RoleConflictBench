Tonight is the only evening this week I can spend with Alex, and he\u2019s been looking forward to it for days. He\u2019s already set the table, candles flickering, his hopeful smile making me ache with guilt. But my headset crackles, and the calm voice of a pilot cuts through: \u201cTower, we\u2019re low on fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My training kicks in, and I know every second counts. I can\u2019t ignore the pilot, not when lives are at stake. But Alex is watching me, his eyes searching mine, silently pleading for just a few hours of my undivided attention.
