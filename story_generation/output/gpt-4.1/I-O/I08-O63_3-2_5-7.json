I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, an old friend I hadn\u2019t heard from in months. I answered, expecting a quick hello, but his voice was shaky. His car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed someone to pick him up. My heart twisted; I could hear the anxiety in his words. As an acquaintance, I knew I should help, offer support, be there for him. But as a telemarketer, I was painfully aware of the rules. Management had been strict lately\u2014every minute of break time was tracked, and the call queue was relentless. If I left my desk for too long, I\u2019d get flagged, maybe even written up. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in. Sam waited on the line, hoping for reassurance, while my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy.
