The store was quiet, just a few people waiting, but my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I knew it was the leadership team from my other job, needing a quick confirmation for an external partner. They expected me to reply within minutes, and I could already imagine the follow-up messages if I didn\u2019t. But as a cashier, my focus had to be on the customers\u2014making sure every item was scanned correctly, every total accurate. The woman in front of me smiled politely, waiting for her change, while the line behind her grew a little longer. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to be a reliable colleague and the responsibility to do my job here without mistakes. I could feel my heart pounding, my hand hovering over the register, wondering if I could sneak a glance at my phone or if that would be letting everyone down."}
