He\u2019d squeezed in this session just for me, and I could hear the airport announcements in the background as he waited for my questions. I wanted to make the most of his time, to show I respected his effort. But as I listened, my eyes darted to the pile of wood shavings and scattered tools on my workbench. The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cA clean site is a safe site. No exceptions.\u201d I knew I should be sweeping up, making sure nothing tripped anyone up, but if I did, I\u2019d miss the chance to ask my mentor what I needed most. My hands itched to grab the broom, but my mind raced with questions I might never get to ask again. The pressure built in my chest\u2014do I risk safety for this rare opportunity, or do I let my mentor down by cutting the session short?"}
