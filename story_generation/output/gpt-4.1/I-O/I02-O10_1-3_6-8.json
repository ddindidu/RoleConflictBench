My girlfriend\u2019s text glared at me: \u201cI thought we agreed on Saturday, not Sunday. Why don\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her words. I knew I should call her, talk it out, smooth things over before it turned into something bigger. That\u2019s what she expected from me\u2014someone who cared enough to resolve things right away.\n\nBut just as I reached for the phone, my work email pinged. The subject line: \u201cURGENT: Supplier Halting Shipments.\u201d My stomach dropped. The supplier\u2019s message was blunt\u2014no payment, no more deliveries. I was the only one who could negotiate, explain the delay, and try to keep our business afloat. My boss expected me to handle this, and fast.\n\nI sat frozen, phone in one hand, laptop in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My girlfriend needed reassurance and understanding. My company needed immediate action and clear communication. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the person I loved and the job that depended on me."}
