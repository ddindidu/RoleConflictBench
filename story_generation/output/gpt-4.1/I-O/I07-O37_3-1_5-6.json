My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. But then, my other job called. The cleaning supervisor needed me to cover a shift in the office tonight. I knew the drill: gloves on, every surface spotless, no shortcuts. But sometimes, when I was in a rush, I skipped the gloves for quick tasks. Tonight, though, the office had a stomach bug outbreak, and the protocols were strict\u2014no exceptions. I felt torn. If I left my desk now, the team would be stuck, the client disappointed. But if I rushed through cleaning later, I\u2019d risk my own health and break the rules. My mind raced, caught between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the strict safety expectations of my cleaning job, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
