Today was her first day handling returns, and I\u2019d promised to guide her through every step. Just then, a customer approached, holding a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said. I knew the store\u2019s policy was strict\u2014no receipt, no return. But Sarah looked at me, silently asking for help, and I remembered my role as her mentor: to teach her not just the rules, but the reasoning behind them, to help her navigate tough situations with empathy and confidence.\n\nThe customer\u2019s voice grew louder, drawing attention. Sarah glanced nervously at the growing line. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I step in and show Sarah how to enforce the policy, or should I let her handle it, risking a mistake that could cost the store? My mind raced, torn between my duty to the store and my responsibility to Sarah. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both roles perfectly at this moment."}
