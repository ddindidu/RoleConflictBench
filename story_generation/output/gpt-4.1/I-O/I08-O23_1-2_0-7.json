I smiled, remembering our easy banter from years ago, and he grinned back, expecting the same warmth. As we exchanged a few friendly words, I noticed Sarah, an internal assistant, approaching with a stack of papers. She greeted us both and, in a casual tone, asked if I could give her access to the sensitive client files she needed for a report. Mark lingered, waiting for my response, perhaps expecting me to be as accommodating as I always was in our friendship. But as a lawyer, I knew the files contained confidential information, and granting access without proper clearance would breach ethical standards. I felt the tension rise inside me\u2014Sarah\u2019s expectation for cooperation, Mark\u2019s anticipation of my easygoing nature, and my own professional obligation pulling me in opposite directions. My mind raced, caught between the urge to be helpful and friendly, and the unyielding duty to protect my client\u2019s trust."}
