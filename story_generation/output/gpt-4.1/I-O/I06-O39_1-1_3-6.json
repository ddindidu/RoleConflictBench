My mentor had always emphasized, \u201cIf you\u2019re unsure, ask. Don\u2019t let questions pile up.\u201d I had a small question about a term in the safety manual\u2014nothing urgent, but it nagged at me. I knew I should message my mentor, just to keep communication open like he expected. But as a laborer, I was also expected to pull my weight, follow protocols, and not get distracted. The foreman had just posted a notice about an optional training session next week. Some of the guys were already grumbling about how it would cut into their overtime, and I could feel the unspoken pressure to show I was a team player, not someone who needed extra help or time away from the job. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my mentor to check in if I had any concerns. I stared at the notice, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
