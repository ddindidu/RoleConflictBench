Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now he was threatening to end things if we didn\u2019t talk it out today. I knew I should call him, try to fix things before it was too late. But just then, the door chimed and a nervous bride-to-be swept in, her friends trailing behind her, all eyes darting to me for reassurance. I forced a smile, welcoming them, trying to project calm and warmth, but my mind was racing. They needed me to be attentive, to soothe their nerves and make this morning perfect. But Alex needed me too, needed to know I cared enough to fight for us. My hands trembled as I reached for my scissors, torn between the urge to step outside and call him, and the duty to stay and give these women the experience they deserved. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between who I am to him and who I am to them."}
