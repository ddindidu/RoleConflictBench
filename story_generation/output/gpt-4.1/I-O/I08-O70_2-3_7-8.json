Total disaster. I don\u2019t know how she still has her job.\u201d I felt a knot in my stomach. I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, especially at work. I nodded politely, not wanting to encourage him, but also not wanting to seem rude or unfriendly.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from a customer waiting for a package I was supposed to deliver. The system showed a delay; the package had been misplaced at the depot. The customer was already frustrated and wanted an update. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to communicate politely and professionally, even when things go wrong.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. Mark was waiting for a response, expecting me to join in his criticism, while the customer was waiting for reassurance and a solution. I stood there, caught between the demands of being a considerate acquaintance and a responsible delivery person, unsure of how to respond to either."}
