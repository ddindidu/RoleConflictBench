My hands were raw from the day\u2019s work, but my mind was somewhere else\u2014back at my apartment, where my boyfriend sat alone, shattered by the news of his brother\u2019s passing. He\u2019d called me three times in the last hour, his messages growing more desperate, his voice cracking with grief. I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and rush to him, to hold him and let him cry. But the foreman\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cNo one leaves until their area\u2019s spotless. Safety first, always.\u201d If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking a write-up, maybe even someone\u2019s safety tomorrow. My heart ached with the pull in both directions\u2014my partner needed me, but so did my team. I stared at the broom in my hands, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
