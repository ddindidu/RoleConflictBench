The conversation turned to Mark, a mutual colleague, and his recent scheduling decisions. The group\u2019s tone shifted, voices lowering as they began to criticize his choices. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but the expectation to join in and not seem aloof pressed on me. I felt their eyes flick to me, waiting for my input.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled. As a subway operator, I was responsible for passenger safety and assistance. A passenger\u2019s voice came through the intercom, asking for routine directions. I was expected to respond promptly and clearly, ensuring they felt supported and safe. But if I stepped away now, the group might think I was avoiding the conversation or, worse, that I disagreed with them. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to maintain harmony with my coworkers and my duty to the passengers. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my attention, and I felt the tension rise as I hesitated, caught between conflicting expectations."}
