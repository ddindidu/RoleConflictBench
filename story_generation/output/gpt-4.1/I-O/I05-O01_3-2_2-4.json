The new office design was due tomorrow, and every detail mattered\u2014lighting, flow, the subtle ways space shapes productivity. My phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, asking if I had time to talk. She was on the verge of accepting a job offer, and she needed my guidance. I knew how much this decision meant for her future; she trusted me to help her weigh the risks, to offer the kind of structured advice that could change her path.\n\nBut the plans in front of me demanded my full attention. If I missed a flaw, dozens of employees would feel it every day. My firm expected nothing less than perfection. Yet Maya\u2019s voice in my messages was anxious, hopeful. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to shape spaces for others, and my duty to shape a life. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my profession and the quiet, personal trust of mentorship. I stared at the phone, blueprint pencil poised, heart pounding, caught in the impossible pull of both roles."}
