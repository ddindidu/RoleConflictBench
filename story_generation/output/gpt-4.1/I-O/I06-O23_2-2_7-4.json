My mentor, who rarely had time to spare, had just slotted me in for a quick meeting\u2014his only opening for weeks. I knew how much he valued punctuality and preparation, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. But as I reviewed my emails, a notification popped up: the court had scheduled a contested motion for my client, and it was set to begin in less than an hour. My client was anxious, counting on me to defend their interests, and I could not imagine letting them face the judge alone. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust and guidance on one side, my client\u2019s faith and legal rights on the other. My mind raced, torn between the rare chance to learn and the duty to advocate. I could feel the tension in my chest as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that whichever path I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
