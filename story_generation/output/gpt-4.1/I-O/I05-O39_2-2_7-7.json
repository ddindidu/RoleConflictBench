I\u2019m really nervous about the interview.\u201d I knew how much this opportunity meant to her, and as her mentor, I felt responsible for helping her prepare, to encourage her and offer last-minute advice. But as I looked up, the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. Attendance was non-negotiable\u2014missing it could mean disciplinary action, and I didn\u2019t want to let my crew down or risk anyone\u2019s safety. My hard hat felt heavier than usual as I weighed my options. I could step aside for a quick call, but that would mean breaking site protocol and possibly setting a bad example for the team. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my mentee down at a crucial moment. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the site, torn between the two worlds that both needed me, each demanding my full attention right now."}
