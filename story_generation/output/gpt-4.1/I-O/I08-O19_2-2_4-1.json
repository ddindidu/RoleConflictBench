He was moving apartments today and needed help with some heavy boxes. \u201cCould you come by for an hour? I\u2019m really stuck,\u201d he wrote. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to say yes, to be supportive and helpful, especially since he\u2019d done me favors in the past. But as I looked up, I saw Mrs. Patel waiting at the counter. She depended on me to prepare her complex prescription\u2014five different medications, all with specific dosages and timing. Any mistake could seriously affect her health. The pharmacy was short-staffed, and I was the only one on duty. My mind raced between the expectation to be a good friend and the professional responsibility to ensure every pill was correct. I could feel the tension building in my chest, torn between stepping away to help Mark and staying to double-check every detail for Mrs. Patel. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
