As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my job to handle these conversations, to keep things professional and focused on the numbers. But as I hung up, my mind wandered to the reason behind the overdue payment\u2014a sensitive issue involving a colleague\u2019s personal struggles, something I\u2019d learned only because we were acquaintances outside of work. I knew the supplier would push for an explanation, and I could already feel the pressure mounting. As an acquaintance, I was expected to keep what I knew confidential, to avoid gossip or saying anything that could harm someone\u2019s reputation. But as an accountant, I was expected to communicate openly and honestly with our vendors. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding loyalty, and I felt the weight of the decision pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
