She\u2019s describing her sore throat, and I know I need to focus, to ask the right questions and prescribe the right treatment. But the message notification flashes again\u2014my friend, probably confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet for lunch. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I promised I\u2019d clear it up. I can almost feel his anxiety through the screen, waiting for my reply. I want to reassure him, to be the friend who communicates openly and doesn\u2019t leave things hanging. But right now, my patient is looking at me, expecting my full attention and expertise. My mind tugs in two directions: the responsibility to my patient, who trusts me to help her feel better, and the loyalty to my friend, who needs clarity and reassurance. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to reach for my phone, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
