She was stranded on the highway, her voice shaky as she begged me to come get her right away. My heart raced\u2014I knew she\u2019d do the same for me, and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her alone in the dark. But as I glanced down, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. Store policy was clear: any irregularity, no matter how minor, had to be reported and resolved before leaving. My manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions. I felt torn in two. My friend needed me, and I wanted to drop everything and run to her side. But I also knew the responsibility I carried as a cashier, the trust placed in me to follow the rules. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My hands trembled as I stared at the register, my phone still buzzing in my pocket, caught between loyalty and duty."}
