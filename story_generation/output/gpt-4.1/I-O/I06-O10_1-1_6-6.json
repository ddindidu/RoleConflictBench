My mentor\u2019s office hours had just started, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of them this week. She always emphasized the importance of showing up, being present, and respecting her time\u2014especially since she carved out these hours just for us mentees. But as I opened my laptop to draft some questions, an email notification popped up. It was from one of our vendors, a standard payment confirmation, but protocol required a formal reply within the hour. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the importance of timely, professional communication. My supervisor had reminded me last week that even small delays could damage our reputation. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I rush a reply to the vendor and risk being late to my mentor\u2019s office hours, or should I prioritize my growth as a mentee and potentially neglect my accounting duties? My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind torn between two worlds, each demanding my immediate attention."}
