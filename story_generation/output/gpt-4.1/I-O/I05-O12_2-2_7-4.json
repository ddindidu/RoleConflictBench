My mentee, Sarah, had just messaged me, anxious about her upcoming interview for a team lead position. She needed guidance, reassurance, and a mock interview\u2014ideally today, before her nerves got the best of her. As her mentor, I felt responsible for her growth, for helping her seize this opportunity that could change her career. But my inbox was also filling with reminders from the product and QA teams. The design documents for our new feature were due by the end of the day, and everyone was waiting for my technical input to move forward. I could almost hear the impatience in their emails, the subtle pressure to not be the bottleneck. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support Sarah and the obligation to my team. Both roles demanded my full attention, but there was only one of me, and the clock was ticking. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my own anxiety rising as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
