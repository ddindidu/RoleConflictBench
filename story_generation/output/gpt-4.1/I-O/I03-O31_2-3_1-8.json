He barely looked at me, his jaw clenched, eyes glassy. I wanted to wrap my arms around him, tell him everything would be okay, that I was here for him no matter what. But my phone buzzed with a message from the station: I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. I knew how important my testimony was\u2014justice depended on it, and my integrity as an officer was on the line. But Alex needed me too; he\u2019d asked if I could stay home with him, just this once, to help him process the blow. My heart twisted as I looked at him, torn between the duty I owed to my badge and the comfort I owed to the man I loved. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to reconcile."}
