As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach, smile, and help them feel welcome. I knew how intimidating these gatherings could be, and I wanted to be the friendly face that eased their nerves.\n\nBut just as I took a step toward them, I caught sight of Mark, the machine operator, fiddling with the control panel again. My other role as the machine repairer kicked in. I\u2019d already seen the waste piling up from his repeated mistakes, and I knew I needed to step in, explain the correct settings, and prevent further loss. Management expected me to be proactive and firm, not just fix things after the fact.\n\nI felt torn\u2014should I prioritize being approachable and supportive to the newcomer, or fulfill my duty to guide Mark and address the ongoing issue? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the pull of kindness and the push of responsibility."}
