It was Jamie, someone I knew from the neighborhood, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for her visiting family. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to be helpful, to respond quickly and warmly, maybe even offer to make a reservation. But as a pharmacist, I knew how important this workshop was\u2014missing even a few minutes could mean overlooking crucial updates that would affect my patients\u2019 safety. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I replied now, I\u2019d be late and possibly miss the introduction. If I waited, I\u2019d risk seeming unfriendly or unhelpful, maybe even damaging a budding friendship. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a supportive acquaintance and the responsibility to stay sharp and informed for my patients. The phone vibrated again in my hand, and I stood frozen in the hallway, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
