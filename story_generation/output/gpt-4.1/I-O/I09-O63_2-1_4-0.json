The calls were routine\u2014most people listened politely, and the few questions they asked were ones I could answer in my sleep. But just as I was about to close a sale, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. I winced, knowing the sound echoed through the thin apartment walls. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had already mentioned how the barking startled her toddler during naptime. I felt the pressure to keep my dog quiet, to be the considerate neighbor everyone expected. But I couldn\u2019t leave my post; my supervisor tracked every second I was off-script. The customer on the line asked a question, and I fumbled for the right answer, distracted by the barking and the thought of Mrs. Lee\u2019s disapproving look. I felt torn\u2014should I mute my call and calm my dog, risking my job\u2019s metrics, or stay focused on the customer and risk upsetting my neighbor again? The demands of both roles pressed in, and I sat frozen, headset in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
