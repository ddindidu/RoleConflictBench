As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in the new accounting software\u2014nothing urgent, but I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to ask, even about the little things.\u201d At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from our major supplier, their tone unmistakably stern.
