The final day of the quarter always brought a tightness to my chest\u2014management\u2019s emails about sales targets echoed in my mind. Every call mattered. My bonus, my team\u2019s standing, even my job security, all hung in the balance. Just as I was about to dial, Maya, my mentee, slid into the empty chair beside me. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I\u2019m struggling with the new script. Can you walk me through it?\u201d Her eyes were hopeful, trusting. I\u2019d always told her to come to me with questions, and I prided myself on being approachable, sharing what I\u2019d learned over the years. But now, every minute spent mentoring was a minute not selling. The pressure to perform, to hit that elusive target, pressed against my promise to be there for Maya. My hand hovered over the phone, torn between dialing the next prospect and turning to help her. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
