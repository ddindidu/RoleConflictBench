Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words to calm him, to resolve the conflict before it tore us apart. But my laptop chimed insistently\u2014my team was waiting for me in a video call. The client needed my project estimates tonight, or the contract would fall through. My manager had already messaged twice, reminding me how crucial my input was. I felt pulled in two directions, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations. I wanted to be present for him, to fix what was breaking between us, but I also knew my team was counting on me. My hands shook as I stared at the screen, torn between the person I loved and the career I\u2019d worked so hard to build."}
