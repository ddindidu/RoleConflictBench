Across from me, a new guy lingered by the coffee machine, eyes darting around, clearly uncomfortable. As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to walk over, introduce myself, and help him feel welcome. I remembered how lost I\u2019d felt on my first day, and I didn\u2019t want him to feel the same. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was time for the end-of-shift sweep-up. As a construction laborer, I was expected to keep my area spotless, and the foreman had been strict about safety and cleanliness lately. If I didn\u2019t get out there soon, I\u2019d be letting my crew down and risking a warning. I glanced at the new guy, then at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside me. Should I stay and offer a friendly word, or rush out to meet my work obligations? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between being the welcoming face someone needed and the reliable worker my team depended on."}
