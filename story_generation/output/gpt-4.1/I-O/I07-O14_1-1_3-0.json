As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the project summary by Friday, but with the generous buffer time, no one would be held up if I took a little longer. Still, I could already hear my teammate\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cLet\u2019s keep things moving, okay?\u201d At the same time, the lab schedule beckoned. As a scientist, I was supposed to run the next experiment to test our new hypothesis. The equipment was available today, but there were plenty of open slots next week too. Skipping this session wouldn\u2019t derail our research, but I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014what if I missed a breakthrough by waiting? My mind spun with the competing demands: be a reliable teammate, be a diligent scientist. I felt the pressure building, the weight of expectations from both sides pressing in, and I wondered which role I should honor first."}
