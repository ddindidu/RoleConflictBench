I\u2019m free all week, just want to spend some time together.\u201d I smile, picturing her waiting for my reply, but my headset crackles, snapping me back. \u201cTower, this is Delta 214, requesting climb instructions. Cloud tops are building fast.\u201d I scan the radar\u2014storm cells are rising, and pilots are depending on me for safe guidance. My fingers hover over the keyboard, ready to issue new altitudes, but my mind drifts. She\u2019s been patient, hoping for a night where I\u2019m not distracted or exhausted. I want to give her that, to be present, not just physically but emotionally.
