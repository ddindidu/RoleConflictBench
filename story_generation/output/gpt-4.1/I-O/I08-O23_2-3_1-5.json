As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to approach, to offer a warm smile and gentle conversation, to help her feel welcome. I could see the expectation in my friends\u2019 glances; they knew I was good at this, at making people feel at ease. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the trial starting tomorrow.
