We\u2019d just had the worst argument of our relationship\u2014words thrown like daggers, doubts about our future hanging in the air. She needed me to come over, to sit with her, to show her that I cared enough to fight for us, to resolve this before it broke us apart. But the shrill sound of a splash snapped my attention back to the pool. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, to keep everyone safe, and right now those kids were ignoring every warning. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My girlfriend\u2019s pleading eyes met mine, silently begging for reassurance, while the teens\u2019 reckless laughter echoed, demanding my authority. I stood frozen, caught between the person I loved and the duty I couldn\u2019t ignore, my mind racing as I tried to decide which role I had to answer first."}
