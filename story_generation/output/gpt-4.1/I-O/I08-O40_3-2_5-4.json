The deadline was tight, and the electrician was waiting for me to finish so he could install the lighting. I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, an old acquaintance. I hesitated, but answered. His voice was shaky; his car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and he needed help. I could hear the anxiety in his words, and I knew he didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to call. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to offer support, to be there for someone in need. But as a carpenter, I was already behind schedule, and the whole team was counting on me to keep things moving. If I left now, the project would stall, and I\u2019d let down my coworkers and the client. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help Sam and the responsibility to my work. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand I could afford to ignore."}
