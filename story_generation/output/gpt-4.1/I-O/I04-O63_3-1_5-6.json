It was Jamie, my best friend, her voice shaky and urgent. \u201cMy car broke down on the highway. Can you come get me? Please, I\u2019m scared.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was in ten minutes, but the call volume was low tonight, and the supervisors had said we could be flexible. Still, I was supposed to stick to my scheduled hours, and leaving early without notice could get me in trouble. My headset itched against my ear as I listened to Jamie\u2019s breathing, picturing her stranded in the dark. I knew she\u2019d do the same for me, no questions asked. But I also knew my job was on the line, and I\u2019d already been warned about not following protocol. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of being a reliable friend against the expectations of my job. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between duty and loyalty, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
