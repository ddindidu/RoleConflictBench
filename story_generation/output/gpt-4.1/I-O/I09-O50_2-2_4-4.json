She shot me a look\u2014half annoyance, half exhaustion. I know the walls are thin, and everyone expects me to keep things quiet and respectful, especially in shared spaces. I apologized, tugging my dog back inside, but I could feel the tension simmering. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my supervisor: \u201cThe machines in sector B are overheating. Need urgent maintenance.\u201d I\u2019m the only one on shift today, and if I don\u2019t get to those machines soon, we risk a breakdown. But if I leave now, my dog will be alone, likely barking at every sound, disturbing the neighbors even more. I\u2019m torn\u2014do I rush to the machines and risk upsetting everyone on my floor, or do I stay and calm my dog, knowing the machines could fail? The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I stand frozen in the hallway, caught between being a good neighbor and a reliable repairer."}
