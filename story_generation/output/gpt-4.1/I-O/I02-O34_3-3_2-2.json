The supervisor\u2019s voice crackles in my ear\u2014another route just closed, and now the sky above us is a tangled mess of holding patterns. Every second counts; one mistake could mean disaster. My hands hover over the controls, sweat beading on my brow.\n\nMy phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s her. I know she\u2019s alone at home, her world shattered by her brother\u2019s sudden passing. She needs me\u2014my voice, my comfort, my presence. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d help her through this. But right now, dozens of pilots are waiting for my instructions, and hundreds of passengers depend on my focus.\n\nMy heart aches with guilt. I want to drop everything, to be the boyfriend she needs, but the weight of responsibility pins me to my seat. The demands of the sky and the pain in her voice pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t see a way to be enough for both. My phone keeps buzzing, and I stare at the radar, torn and helpless, as the world expects me to choose."}
