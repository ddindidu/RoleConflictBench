The project deadline loomed, and our collaboration was falling apart. I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, ask for guidance\u2014my mentor expected honesty and prompt communication. But right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat, and the meter ticking. As a taxi driver, I had to keep my eyes on the road, obey every traffic law, and ensure my passenger\u2019s safety. My phone buzzed again, and my heart pounded. If I pulled over to message my mentor, I\u2019d delay my passenger and risk a complaint. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, possibly jeopardizing the project. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with its own consequences. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the responsibility to my mentor and the duty to my passenger, feeling the tension build as I approached the next intersection."}
