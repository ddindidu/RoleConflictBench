He was heading to a casual lunch, no rush, just another fare on a slow afternoon. But my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, desperate for help. She was about to submit a critical report, and her last draft had major errors\u2014mistakes that could cost her the project. She needed my guidance, my experience, right now. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. As a mentor, I was expected to be there, to offer in-depth advice and steer her away from disaster. But as a taxi driver, my job was to focus on the road, keep my passenger safe, and get him to his destination on time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the urge to pull over and call her fighting with the responsibility to my passenger. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to guide my mentee and the immediate duty to drive safely. The city blurred past my window as I wrestled with what to do next."}
