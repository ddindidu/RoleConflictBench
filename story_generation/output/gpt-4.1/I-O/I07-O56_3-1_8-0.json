I glance at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my manager, asking for confirmation on tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our external partner. I know leadership expects a quick reply, and I can already imagine the follow-up emails if I don\u2019t respond soon. But at the same moment, Mrs. Lee walks in, smiling, and the receptionist is chatting with someone else. As her hairdresser, I\u2019m supposed to greet her warmly, offer her tea, and make her feel at home. I can see her looking around, waiting for that familiar welcome. My fingers itch to type a quick response to my manager, but I also feel the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectation for personal attention. My mind races, torn between the pinging demands of my inbox and the warmth I owe my client. I stand there, caught between two worlds, heart pounding, unsure which role to honor first."}
