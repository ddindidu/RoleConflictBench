As a mentor, I knew I should step in, walk him through the process, and make sure he understood every step\u2014especially since a mistake here could mean a safety hazard for everyone. My mind raced with the best way to explain the technique, to share the hard-earned lessons I\u2019d gathered over years on the job. But then I caught sight of the notice tacked to the trailer door: an optional training session next week, right in the middle of our busiest period. As a laborer, I was expected to keep pace with the crew, follow every protocol, and not fall behind. If I took time for mentoring or the training, I\u2019d risk slowing the team, maybe even drawing the foreman\u2019s ire. My stomach twisted as I weighed the responsibility to guide the rookie against the pressure to keep my head down and work. The voices of both roles clashed in my mind, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
