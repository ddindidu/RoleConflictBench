The hum of the station was oddly soothing, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend had sent a long message, venting about a rough, tedious day at work. I knew she needed someone to listen, someone to reply right away and make her feel heard. That\u2019s what I always did for her, and I could almost hear her voice in my head, hoping for a quick, comforting response.\n\nBut the checklist in front of me demanded my full attention. Even though these weren\u2019t the most vital systems, I was expected to be thorough and focused\u2014any distraction could mean missing something important, and the train\u2019s schedule depended on me. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between the urge to be the friend she needed and the responsibility of keeping everything on track. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
