My boyfriend was in the back seat, his arms crossed, his jaw set. We\u2019d just had another argument\u2014this one worse than the rest. He accused me of never listening, of caring more about my job than about us. I wanted to turn around, to reach out and fix things, to show him I could resolve this, that I cared. But the meter was running, and my next passenger was due in ten minutes. The back seat was a mess\u2014crumbs from his snack, a spilled coffee on the floor mat. As a taxi driver, I was expected to keep my cab spotless, to greet every customer with a smile, to be professional no matter what. But right now, my heart was pounding, torn between cleaning up the mess and cleaning up the mess between us. I could feel his eyes on me, waiting for me to say something, to choose him. But the clock was ticking, and I didn\u2019t know which role to answer first."}
