I knew it was my team\u2019s group chat\u2014waiting for my response so they could move forward with the project. I\u2019d promised to clarify a key point before noon, and it was already 11:45. But just as I reached for my phone, I caught sight of a group of teenagers at the deep end, laughing and edging dangerously close to the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My supervisor had drilled it into us: safety first, always intervene before an accident happens. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I didn\u2019t respond to my colleagues, I\u2019d hold everyone up and risk their frustration. But if I turned my attention to my phone, even for a minute, someone could get hurt. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the urgent ping of my work life and the immediate responsibility of keeping everyone safe."}
