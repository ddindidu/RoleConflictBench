We\u2019d planned everything: a quiet dinner, a walk by the river, and hours just talking, holding on to every moment. But as I stood in the courtroom, robe heavy on my shoulders, I was deep into jury instructions when my clerk slipped me a note. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My heart thudded. I knew I had to stop, review the new ruling, and rewrite my instructions\u2014right now. The law demanded it. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: Mia\u2019s message, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you tonight.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My duty to justice, to the law, to the people in this room. My promise to Mia, to be present, to make these last hours count. I stood there, torn, the courtroom silent, my mind racing between the bench and the woman I loved."}
