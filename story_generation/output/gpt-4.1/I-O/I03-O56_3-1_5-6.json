It\u2019s Saturday afternoon\u2014the last weekend before Alex leaves for months. We promised to spend every moment together, to make memories we could hold onto while he\u2019s away. But here I am at the salon, scissors in hand, with Mrs. Lee in my chair. She smiles, her hair still damp, explaining she washed it just before coming. I know the salon\u2019s policy: every client must have their hair washed here, no exceptions. My manager expects me to follow the rules, to keep up the standards. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair is spotless, and she looks tired, like she\u2019s had a long day. If I insist on another wash, I\u2019ll be late meeting Alex. If I skip it, I risk my job. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Alex\u2019s hopeful texts, the salon\u2019s strict routine. My hands tremble as I reach for the cape, torn between being the girlfriend Alex needs and the hairdresser my boss expects."}
