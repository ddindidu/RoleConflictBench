We\u2019d fought before, but this time it felt different\u2014like we were standing on the edge of something we couldn\u2019t come back from. I know I should call him back, try to fix things, but my shift as a telemarketer just started, and the calls are relentless. \n\nA customer\u2019s voice crackles through my headset, launching into a barrage of technical questions about the new service. The script in front of me only covers the basics, and I can hear the impatience in his tone. I\u2019m supposed to stay calm, answer everything, and keep him interested. But my thoughts keep drifting back to Alex\u2019s words, the hurt in his voice, the way he said, \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not right for each other.\u201d \n\nI want to hang up, to text him, to do something\u2014anything\u2014to resolve what\u2019s happening between us. But the next call is already waiting, and my supervisor is watching. I feel pulled in two directions, the pressure mounting, unsure which role I\u2019m supposed to play first."}
