Across the room, I noticed a new face\u2014someone who looked out of place, nervously fidgeting with their sleeve. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to approach, to offer a warm smile and easy conversation, to help them feel welcome. But my phone buzzed again, another urgent message from the contractor about a delivery delay at the construction site. As the architect, I was expected to respond immediately, to keep the project moving and avoid costly setbacks. My mind raced, torn between the friendly gesture I knew I should make and the professional responsibility demanding my attention. I could feel the tension knotting in my stomach, the weight of two worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present. I hesitated, caught in the space between a friendly hello and a critical reply, unsure which role to honor first."}
