Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. Management had been clear\u2014no excuses this time. As I rounded the corner, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Patel, my neighbor from across the hall. She smiled warmly, her arms full of groceries. \u201cHello! How are you today?\u201d she asked, expecting the usual friendly exchange. I forced a smile, but my thoughts were tangled in scripts and quotas. I knew she hated telemarketing calls\u2014she\u2019d complained about them in the elevator just last week. Yet, her name was on my call list for the afternoon, and I needed every sale I could get. Should I keep things neighborly and skip her number, or risk our hallway smiles for the sake of my job? The weight of both roles pressed on me as I stood there, caught between a friendly hello and the relentless pressure of my headset."}
