My phone vibrates with a message from Mia: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019s been devastated since her brother passed away last week, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, no matter what. My break is scheduled in ten minutes, but the floor is quiet, and my supervisor said we could be flexible today. Still, I know the rules\u2014leaving my station early, even on a slow day, could be frowned upon. I stare at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds. Mia needs me now, not in ten minutes. But I also need this job, and I don\u2019t want to risk being seen as unreliable. My heart aches for her, but my mind races with worry about my responsibilities here. I grip my phone, torn between the urge to step away and comfort her, and the pressure to stay put and follow the rules."}
