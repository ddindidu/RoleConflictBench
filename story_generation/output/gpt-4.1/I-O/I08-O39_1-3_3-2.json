It was Mark, a guy I\u2019d met at a friend\u2019s party last month. \u201cHey, you know any good places to eat around here?\u201d he texted. I knew he was new in town, and I remembered how lost I\u2019d felt when I first moved here. I wanted to help him out, maybe even suggest a place we could grab a bite together sometime. But just as I started typing a reply, the foreman shouted my name. The crane was swinging a massive steel beam into place, and I was needed right away to help guide it. My gloves were already on, sweat prickling my forehead. If I didn\u2019t get over there, the whole crew would be waiting on me, and the beam could become unstable. I stared at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, torn between being the helpful acquaintance Mark expected and the reliable laborer my team depended on. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
