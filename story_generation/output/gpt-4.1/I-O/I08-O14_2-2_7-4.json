As a scientist, I knew I had to present my preliminary data honestly, even though the results from our joint project were underwhelming. Just then, Mark, an acquaintance from another lab, slid into the seat beside me. He leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you see the mess Alex made with the last experiment? No wonder your data\u2019s all over the place.\u201d\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I believed in steering clear of gossip and not speaking ill of others, especially when they weren\u2019t present to defend themselves. But as a scientist, I was expected to report my findings accurately, which meant mentioning the inconsistencies in Alex\u2019s work during the meeting. Mark\u2019s words echoed in my mind, fueling my anxiety. If I brought up the issues, would it seem like I was confirming the gossip? If I didn\u2019t, would I be compromising my integrity as a scientist? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself caught between loyalty to my values and my professional responsibility, unsure of which path to take."}
