It was Jamie, my best friend, her voice trembling on the other end. \u201cCan you talk? I just had the worst fight with Alex.\u201d I could hear the tears in her words, and my instinct was to drop everything and listen, to be the friend she needed\u2014present, patient, and supportive. But as I opened my mouth to answer, the bell above the salon door chimed. A young woman stepped in, clutching her bag, eyes darting nervously around the room. She was my next client, and I could see the anxiety written all over her face. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to greet her warmly, put her at ease, and make her feel welcome. My heart pounded as I stood there, phone pressed to my ear, torn between comforting Jamie and fulfilling my professional duty. Both needed me, right now, in completely different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, and for a moment, I just stood frozen, caught between two worlds."}
