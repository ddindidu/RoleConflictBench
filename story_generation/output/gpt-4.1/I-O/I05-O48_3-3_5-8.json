She looked up at me, her eyes searching for reassurance as she prepared to administer a high-risk drug for the first time. I knew I needed to be present, to guide her step by step, sharing every bit of knowledge I had to ensure she didn\u2019t make a mistake. But just as I opened my mouth to explain, I heard a soft sob from the room across the hall. Mrs. Lee, who had just received her diagnosis, was alone, her shoulders shaking with grief. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be there for her, to offer comfort and companionship in her darkest moment. My heart twisted as I glanced between my mentee, desperate for guidance, and Mrs. Lee, desperate for comfort. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I felt torn, rooted to the spot, uncertain which need to answer first."}
