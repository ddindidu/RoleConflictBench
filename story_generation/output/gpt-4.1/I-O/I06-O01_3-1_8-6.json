My mentor had squeezed in this session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to show respect, to be fully present, to ask thoughtful questions and listen carefully. But my phone kept buzzing\u2014messages from my project team. As the lead architect, I was supposed to keep tabs on our progress, even if I usually took a more relaxed approach. Today, though, a contractor had hit a snag, and the team needed my input to keep the timeline on track. I tried to focus on my mentor\u2019s advice, but my mind kept drifting to the project. Every minute I spent here felt like I was letting my team down, but if I checked my phone, I\u2019d be disrespecting my mentor\u2019s rare availability. My stomach twisted as I wrestled with the impossible choice: be the attentive mentee I aspired to be, or the responsible architect my team expected."}
