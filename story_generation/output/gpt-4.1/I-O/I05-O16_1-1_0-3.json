She was here for a routine check-up, but her questions drifted beyond blood pressure and cholesterol. \u201cDoctor, do you think I should start that yoga class? My daughter says it might help my back, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Her eyes searched mine, not just for medical advice, but for reassurance, for guidance. As a doctor, I knew my responsibility was to communicate clearly, to explain the benefits and risks, to be empathetic and professional. But as a mentor\u2014something I\u2019d become to a few patients over the years\u2014I felt the urge to offer more personal advice, to share stories, to nudge her gently toward choices that might enrich her life. The expectations pressed in from both sides: the need to remain objective and clinical, and the desire to be supportive and encouraging. I could feel the tension in my chest as I weighed my words, knowing that whatever I said next would tip the balance between my roles."}
