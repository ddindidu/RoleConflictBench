We\u2019ve argued three times this week about money\u2014he says I\u2019m too cautious, I say he\u2019s too reckless. I know I should call him during my break, try to smooth things over, but the pharmacy is busy and I\u2019m behind on paperwork. A woman approaches the counter, asking about pain relief for her headache. I give her a quick answer, barely making eye contact, my mind still replaying last night\u2019s argument. I know I should ask more questions, make sure she\u2019s choosing the right medication, but I can\u2019t focus. My heart pounds with guilt\u2014am I failing him as a girlfriend, or failing my patients as a pharmacist? I want to be present for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. The woman thanks me and leaves, and I stare at the counter, torn between picking up the phone and doing my job right."}
