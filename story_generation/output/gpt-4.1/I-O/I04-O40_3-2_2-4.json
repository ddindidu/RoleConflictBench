It was Sam, my oldest friend, sobbing so hard I could barely make out the words. He\u2019d just lost his father. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be the friend he needed\u2014someone who would stay on the line, offer comfort, and just be there. But as I murmured words of support, my mind kept drifting to the job site. The cabinetry project was behind schedule, and the electricians and plumbers were coming at dawn. If I didn\u2019t get the framework ready, the whole team would be delayed, and I\u2019d let everyone down. I could hear the expectation in Sam\u2019s voice, desperate for me to stay, and I could feel the weight of my responsibility as a carpenter pressing on my chest. I wanted to be the friend who never left, but I also needed to be the professional who kept his word. My hands trembled as I tried to balance the phone and my thoughts, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
