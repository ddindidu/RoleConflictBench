I\u2019m free any evening!\u201d I smile, picturing her excitement, and start to type a reply. But then my laptop pings\u2014a reminder about the purchase agreement I need to review. The deadline is looming, and the client is counting on me to catch any issues before filing. I know how much Mia values our time together, especially since we\u2019ve both been so busy lately. She\u2019s been patient, waiting for us to have a real evening out, just the two of us. But the contract is dense, and I can\u2019t afford to rush it. My mind races, torn between wanting to be the attentive boyfriend she deserves and the diligent lawyer my client expects. I feel the pressure mounting, my heart heavy with the knowledge that no matter which night I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down. My fingers hover over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
