Can you get me there in time?\u201d I nodded, shifting into drive, but my mind was elsewhere. My mentor\u2019s message blinked on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to finish the code sample before our meeting. Looking forward to seeing your progress!\u201d I\u2019d barely started the assignment, and every minute behind the wheel was a minute lost. But now, the passenger\u2019s anxious glances in the rearview mirror pressed on me. He was counting on me to navigate the rush hour chaos and get him to the station safely and quickly. My mentor expected focus and dedication, but my job demanded my full attention on the road.
