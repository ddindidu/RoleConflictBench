I read their reply\u2014short, clipped, and clearly upset. My heart sinks as I realize my earlier text must have come across as cold. I know Sam values honesty and expects me to clear things up right away, especially when feelings are hurt. I want to call immediately, to explain, to make sure they know I care.\n\nBut just as I reach for my phone, my manager waves me over. The team is gathering for an informal project planning session. As the lead engineer, everyone expects me to provide accurate time estimates for the new feature. Even though the timeline isn\u2019t set in stone, my input will shape the whole project. I can\u2019t just disappear or give a half-hearted answer.\n\nI feel the pressure mounting\u2014my friend needs me to be present and open, but my team needs me to be focused and precise. My mind races, torn between the urge to fix things with Sam and the responsibility to my colleagues. I stare at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to let down."}
