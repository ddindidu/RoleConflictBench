My girlfriend and I have only one evening free together before I leave for a week-long business trip. She\u2019s already sent a sweet message about planning something special\u2014dinner, maybe a walk, just us. I know how much this means to her; we\u2019ve barely seen each other lately, and she\u2019s been looking forward to this night.\n\nBut then, a Slack notification pops up: the product team is holding a big brainstorming session that same evening. It\u2019s technically optional, but everyone knows these sessions are where new ideas are born, and cross-team collaboration is highly valued. I\u2019ve been wanting to get more involved, to show initiative, and missing this could mean being left out of important decisions.\n\nI feel the pressure mounting\u2014on one side, the person I love, hoping for my undivided attention; on the other, my career, nudging me to step up and be present. My mind races, torn between the warmth of her smile and the buzz of professional opportunity, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
