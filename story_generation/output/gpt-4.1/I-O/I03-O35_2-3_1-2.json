Got chewed out by my boss. Can we talk?\u201d My heart aches\u2014I know how much he needs me right now, how he counts on me to listen and reassure him when things go wrong. But just as I start to type a reply, a shrill alarm blares in the control panel. A red warning light flashes: brake system malfunction. My training kicks in\u2014protocol demands I report the issue and bring the train to a halt immediately, for everyone\u2019s safety. My hands tremble as I reach for the intercom, but my mind is split. Alex\u2019s words echo in my head, his need for comfort pulling at me, while the responsibility for hundreds of passengers presses down like a weight. I feel torn in two, caught between the person I love and the duty I can\u2019t ignore, the expectations of being there for him and the unyielding demands of my job."}
