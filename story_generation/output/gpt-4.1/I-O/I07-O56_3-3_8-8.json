She sat in my chair, waiting for the relaxing wash I promised, but I could already tell it would take extra time to detangle and cleanse her hair properly before I could even think about cutting. At the same time, I knew the leadership team at my other job was waiting for my reply\u2014an urgent email about confirming details for an external partner. I could almost hear the impatience in their silence, the expectation that I\u2019d respond within minutes, not hours. My mind raced: if I paused to answer, I\u2019d leave my client awkwardly waiting, her hair half-wet, feeling neglected. But if I focused on her, I risked missing a critical window for my colleagues, letting them down and possibly jeopardizing the partnership. My hands hovered, torn between the soapy water and the phone vibrating in my apron, my heart pounding as I weighed which role to disappoint."}
