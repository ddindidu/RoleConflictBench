I knew she\u2019d appreciate a check-in, maybe even some help securing her windows or just a friendly face to ease her nerves. That\u2019s what good neighbors do\u2014look out for each other, especially in times like this. But as I reached for my coat, my eyes fell on the thick law review journal that had just arrived. The latest issue, packed with articles on evolving legal theories, was essential reading for any judge who wanted to stay sharp and current. My docket was full, and tomorrow\u2019s hearing would demand every ounce of my legal acumen. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to the law, my responsibility to my neighbor. The storm outside seemed to echo the turmoil inside me as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of the robe I wore and the community I called home."}
