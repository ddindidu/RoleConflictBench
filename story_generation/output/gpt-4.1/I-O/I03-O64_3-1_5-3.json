It was Saturday evening\u2014the last weekend before Alex left for his new job overseas. We\u2019d promised to spend every moment together, to make memories that would last until he returned. But here I was, stuck behind the counter, counting bills and coins, my mind drifting to the dinner reservation we\u2019d made weeks ago. \n\nAs I closed out my drawer, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected a full report, and I knew ignoring it could get me in trouble. But if I stayed to sort it out, I\u2019d be late meeting Alex. He\u2019d understand, I told myself, but I could already picture his disappointed smile, the way he\u2019d try to hide it. \n\nI stared at the register, torn. My job demanded responsibility and honesty, but my heart ached to be with Alex, to hold onto these last precious hours. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which expectation to meet."}
