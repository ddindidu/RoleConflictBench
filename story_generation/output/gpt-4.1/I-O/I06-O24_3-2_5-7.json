As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor immediately\u2014my project was unraveling fast. Two teammates had clashed so badly that they\u2019d stopped speaking, and our deliverable was due in days. My mentor always said, \u201cDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late to ask for help.\u201d But as I sat at my desk, the thick appellate court opinion glared at me from my laptop. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, and now an attorney had cited a brand-new decision that could change the entire direction of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I needed to read and analyze it tonight. My mind spun with the weight of both roles: the mentee who shouldn\u2019t hide problems, the judge who must be prepared and impartial. If I called my mentor now, I\u2019d lose precious time for legal review. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting my team\u2014and myself\u2014down. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
