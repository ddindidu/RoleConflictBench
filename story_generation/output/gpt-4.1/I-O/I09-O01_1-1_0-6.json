She greeted me with her usual warm smile, and I returned it, exchanging a few pleasantries. I know she expects friendliness\u2014after all, we see each other almost every day in the corridor. But as we chatted, she mentioned the ongoing noise from the renovation upstairs and asked if I, as an architect, had any insight into how long it might last. I felt the familiar tug of my other role. At work, I\u2019m expected to keep projects on track, to be efficient and professional, and I\u2019d just reviewed the timeline for that very renovation. I knew there had been delays, and the project was running behind. Mrs. Lee\u2019s tone was hopeful, maybe expecting reassurance or even a little inside help. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I be the supportive neighbor, or the efficient, honest architect? My mind raced, caught between wanting to maintain our friendly rapport and the professional obligation to be truthful about the delays. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure of which expectation to meet."}
