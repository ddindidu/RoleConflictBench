She was about to oversee her first major project, and I knew how much this meant for her career. As her mentor, I wanted to step back, let her take the lead, and learn through experience. But just as she prepared to start the batch, I noticed a group of new staff nearby, fumbling with the safety locks on another machine. My role as a repairer demanded I intervene, explain the protocols, and prevent a potential disaster. My mentee looked at me, seeking reassurance, while the staff\u2019s confusion grew. I felt torn\u2014should I stay by my mentee\u2019s side, encouraging her independence, or rush to guide the staff before they made a dangerous mistake? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I could feel the tension building inside as I hesitated, caught between two urgent needs."}
