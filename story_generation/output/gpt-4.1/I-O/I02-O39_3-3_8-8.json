I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from her, the words sharp and desperate. We\u2019d been fighting all morning, and now she was threatening to leave, demanding I call her right now to talk things through. My heart pounded. I knew if I didn\u2019t respond, she\u2019d see it as me giving up, but the foreman\u2019s voice was already barking orders, and everyone was streaming toward the muster point. Site protocol was clear: drop everything, no exceptions, no delays. But how could I just walk away when she was on the edge, waiting for me to prove I cared enough to fix things? My hands shook as I weighed the phone in my palm, torn between the urgent call of my team and the desperate plea of the woman I loved. The alarm kept wailing, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
