As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to listen and contribute, especially since today\u2019s updates wouldn\u2019t be shared later. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s presence. But as I turned to head inside, my boot squelched in something slick. A small puddle of oil glistened on the walkway, right where the crew would be hauling materials in a few minutes. As a construction laborer, I knew the rules: safety first, always. Any spill, no matter how minor, had to be cleaned up immediately. If someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. My heart pounded as I stared at the spill, then at the clock. If I stopped to clean it, I\u2019d miss the meeting and let my team down. If I left it, I\u2019d be risking someone\u2019s safety and breaking site protocol. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the meeting room and the mop closet, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
