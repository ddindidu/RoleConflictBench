As a mentee, I knew how rare and valuable these moments were\u2014my mentor\u2019s schedule was packed, and I\u2019d promised to respect her time by never missing our sessions. But today, I was also wearing my judge\u2019s robe, presiding over a high-profile trial. Just as I began instructing the jury, my clerk rushed in, eyes wide, and handed me a printout: the Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My duty as a judge was clear\u2014I had to halt proceedings and review the new ruling immediately, to ensure justice and accuracy. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor was waiting, expecting me to show up, prepared and present. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I failed. My mind raced, torn between the courtroom\u2019s urgency and the promise I\u2019d made to my mentor, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
