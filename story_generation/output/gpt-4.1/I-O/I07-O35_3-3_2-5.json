My manager\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s input before we finalize the project.\u201d I knew how important this was\u2014missing it could mean my ideas wouldn\u2019t be heard, and the team might move forward without my perspective. Just as the meeting began, my radio crackled to life. \u201cEmergency alarm activated in car three. Possible medical emergency.\u201d My heart pounded. As a subway operator, I was trained to respond immediately, to ensure passenger safety above all else. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the discussion, let my colleagues down, and risk being seen as unreliable. If I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the passengers, possibly putting someone\u2019s life at risk. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stared at the screen, then at the radio, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
