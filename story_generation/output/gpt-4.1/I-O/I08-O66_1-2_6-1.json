As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t join in the gossip or say anything negative, but the group\u2019s eyes turned to me, expecting me to add my opinion. My phone buzzed\u2014my shift as a taxi driver was about to start. Minutes later, I picked up a passenger who was visibly anxious; her train was leaving soon, and the station was all the way across town. She pleaded with me to hurry, her voice tight with urgency. I felt the pressure to drive faster than usual, but I also knew my responsibility was to get her there safely. The words from the break room echoed in my mind, the expectation to stay neutral and not speak ill of others, while now, behind the wheel, I faced the demand to rush against my better judgment. My mind raced, torn between the urge to fit in with my colleagues and the need to keep my passenger safe, both situations pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
