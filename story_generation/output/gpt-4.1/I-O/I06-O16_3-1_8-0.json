My mentor had squeezed in our session just before catching a long flight, and I knew how precious this hour was. I wanted to show respect, to be fully present, to ask thoughtful questions and absorb every bit of wisdom. But as I sat in my office, a patient with a runny nose and a cough waited outside, expecting a thorough check-up. I couldn\u2019t ignore the possibility that something more serious might be hiding behind those common symptoms. My mind raced\u2014if I rushed, I might miss a crucial detail; if I took my time, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s tight schedule. The pressure built inside me, torn between my duty to my patient and my responsibility as a mentee. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentor session in 10 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded as I stared at the patient\u2019s chart, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each demanding my full attention."}
