As a colleague, I knew the report I was working on was crucial\u2014my part was the last piece before we could deliver the project to the client. The deadline was just hours away, and everyone was counting on me. But as I typed, my phone buzzed. The nurse on the floor needed help; Mr. Thompson, fresh out of surgery, was struggling to get out of bed and needed assistance dressing. I could picture his anxious face, the pain he must be feeling, and I knew how much he depended on me as his nursing assistant. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014my team\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, and the responsibility I felt for my patient\u2019s comfort and dignity. I felt torn, my hands hovering over the keyboard, my feet itching to rush to Mr. Thompson\u2019s side. The pressure built inside me, a knot of guilt and worry, as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be let down."}
