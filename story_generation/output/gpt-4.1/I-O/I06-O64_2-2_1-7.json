The lunch rush was in full swing, and the line of customers snaked past the bakery display. Each person expected a smile, a quick greeting, and efficient service. I forced myself to keep my voice cheerful, even as my mind drifted to the code sample my mentor had assigned. Three days to finish it, and I\u2019d barely started. Every beep of the scanner reminded me of the ticking clock, the looming deadline. My mentor expected me to be diligent, to show initiative and growth. But right now, my manager expected me to be present, friendly, and fast. A customer asked about a coupon, and I fumbled for the answer, my thoughts tangled between lines of code and customer service scripts. I could feel the pressure building, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations, my heart pounding as I handed back change and tried to remember where I\u2019d left off in my code."}
