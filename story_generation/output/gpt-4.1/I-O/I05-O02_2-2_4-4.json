As a mentor, I had promised my team a session this afternoon, carefully preparing slides to walk them through the skills they\u2019d need for the upcoming project. They were counting on me to guide them, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned the hard way. But as an engineer, my inbox was filling with urgent messages about the new safety standard that had just been updated. The release was days away, and I was responsible for ensuring every detail was compliant, with documentation ready for audit. My mind raced\u2014if I focused on the training, I\u2019d risk missing a critical compliance check. If I dove into the technical work, I\u2019d let down the team that looked to me for support. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I stared at my calendar, torn, feeling the pressure build as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
