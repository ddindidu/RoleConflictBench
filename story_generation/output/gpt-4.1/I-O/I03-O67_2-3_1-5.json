He read the message, and his face fell. He\u2019d been hoping for a promotion, but the feedback was harsh, and I could see the disappointment in his eyes. He needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to remind him of his worth. I reached for his hand, ready to be the support he deserved.\n\nBut then my radio crackled. \u201cUnit 12, we have a possible cardiac arrest, respond immediately.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. Someone out there was fighting for their life, and I was trained to help. My uniform felt heavier than ever.\n\nAlex looked at me, his eyes pleading for comfort, while my mind raced with the urgency of the call. I was torn between the person I loved and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I couldn\u2019t move, caught between the need to be there for Alex and the responsibility to save a stranger\u2019s life."}
