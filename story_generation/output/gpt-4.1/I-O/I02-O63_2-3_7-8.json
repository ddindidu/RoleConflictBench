I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve fought three times this week about money\u2014her frustration, my defensiveness, both of us exhausted. I know I should call her, try to fix things before it festers. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does: listens, apologizes, tries to make it right.\n\nBut the clock on my screen blinks red. My ten-minute break is up. If I\u2019m not back on the dialer, the compliance system will flag me. Too many flags, and I could lose this job. I need this job\u2014especially now, with money so tight. My supervisor\u2019s already warned me once.\n\nI stare at my phone, thumb hovering over Mia\u2019s name. I can\u2019t be late. But I can\u2019t ignore her, not again. My heart pounds as I weigh the risk of another warning against the risk of losing her. The seconds tick by, and I\u2019m caught between the demands of the person I love and the job I desperately need."}
