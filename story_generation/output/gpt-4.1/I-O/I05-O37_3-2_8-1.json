She was anxious, her future riding on this presentation, and I promised to help her polish every detail. My phone buzzed with her questions, and I could hear the urgency in her words. I wanted to be the mentor she needed\u2014encouraging, attentive, and wise. But as I glanced around, the dust on the shelves and crumbs on the floor nagged at me. The house was slipping into disarray, and I knew the expectation was clear: keep everything spotless, no excuses. The vacuum sat in the corner, a silent reminder of my other role. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my mentee\u2019s hopes on one side, the growing mess on the other.
