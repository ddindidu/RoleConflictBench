My shift as a hairdresser was supposed to end in five minutes, and I still had to finish the report for my other job as a colleague at the marketing firm. The report was due tonight, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t send it, my teammate would be stuck waiting, unable to start her part. The pressure was already building in my chest.\n\nBut right now, an angry client sat in my chair, her voice rising as she criticized the cut I\u2019d just given her. She demanded I fix it, and I could see the frustration in her eyes. I knew I couldn\u2019t just brush her off\u2014client satisfaction was everything here, and a complaint could mean trouble for the salon and my reputation.\n\nI felt torn in two. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another reminder from my colleague about the deadline. I tried to steady my hands, caught between the demands of my two worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
