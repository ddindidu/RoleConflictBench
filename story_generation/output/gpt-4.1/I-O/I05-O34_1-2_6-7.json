My headset crackled with voices\u2014sector handoffs, reroute requests, pilots anxious about the storm. I was supposed to be the calm in the chaos, coordinating with my team, making sure every flight found a safe path. But my mind kept drifting to my mentee, Jamie. Just this morning, during our check-in, I\u2019d noticed the dark circles under their eyes, the way they fumbled with their schedule. As a mentor, I should help Jamie find balance, encourage them to grow, not just survive. But now, as the storm intensified, the demands of the job pressed in. My team needed my full attention; one missed call could mean disaster. Yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the urge to send Jamie a quick message, to offer support. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my responsibility to the skies, and to the person who looked up to me. My hands hovered over the console, torn between the demands of the moment and the promise I\u2019d made to guide someone else."}
