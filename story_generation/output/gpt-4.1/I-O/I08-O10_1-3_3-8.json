The message was from Mark, someone I\u2019d met a few times at community events. \u201cHey! You know the area well\u2014can you recommend a good restaurant for my anniversary tonight?\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in. As an acquaintance, I wanted to be helpful, to respond quickly and thoughtfully. Mark was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nBut the email from our major supplier still glared at me from my laptop. They\u2019d made it clear: no payment, no more shipments. As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my job to resolve this\u2014fast. My boss expected me to handle it with urgency and professionalism, and the entire production schedule depended on my next move.\n\nI felt my heart race, torn between the friendly obligation to Mark and the professional crisis demanding my immediate attention. Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my time and care, and I sat frozen, phone in one hand, mouse in the other, unsure which demand to answer first."}
