Her eyes were red, and she was dabbing at her cheeks with a tissue. When it was her turn, she tried to smile, but her voice trembled as she handed me a prescription for cold medicine. As her acquaintance, I wanted to step out from behind the counter, offer her a hug, and ask what was wrong. I could see she needed comfort, someone to listen. But as a pharmacist, I had to focus on the prescription, double-check the medication, and maintain professionalism. My mind raced with questions\u2014should I ask if she\u2019s okay, or would that cross a line? If I get distracted by her tears, could I make a mistake with her medication? I felt torn, my heart aching for her as a friend, but my hands steadying themselves to count pills and check labels. The line behind her grew, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding different things at the same moment."}
