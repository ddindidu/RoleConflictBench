I smiled, made small talk, and tried to keep the mood light, just as my manager expected. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen and saw a frantic message from my best friend: their car had broken down on the highway, and they needed me to come get them right away. My heart pounded. As a friend, I knew I should drop everything and help, especially since it was late and they were alone. But as a cashier, I was the only one on shift, and leaving would mean abandoning my post and the customers who relied on me for service. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My hands trembled as I handed a receipt to the next customer, my mind racing with what to do next."}
