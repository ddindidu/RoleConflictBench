My mentor had squeezed in a ten-minute meeting for me\u2014her only free slot all week. I\u2019d promised to be there, to show I valued her time and guidance. But just as I was about to call for my break, a customer approached, clutching a blender and looking flustered. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said, voice pleading. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. I could feel the line growing behind her, impatient eyes on me. My manager always reminded us\u2014no exceptions, or we\u2019d be written up. I wanted to help, but I also couldn\u2019t risk my job. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the meeting. I felt torn, caught between my commitment to my mentor and my responsibility as a cashier. The customer\u2019s hopeful gaze, the ticking clock, and the weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which expectation to honor."}
