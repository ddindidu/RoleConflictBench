As an architect, I was expected to keep everything moving\u2014reviewing timelines, making sure tasks didn\u2019t stall, but not getting bogged down in every detail. Yet, as a mentor, I had promised to guide Maya, my eager mentee, through her first major project. She needed regular check-ins, detailed feedback, and reassurance, especially now that she\u2019d hit a roadblock with the design software.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: Maya\u2019s check-in was in ten minutes. At the same time, an email popped up from the project manager, asking for a status update on the site plans. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I gave Maya the attention she deserved, I\u2019d fall behind on my own work. If I focused on my architectural duties, I\u2019d be letting her down, leaving her to struggle alone. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I could feel the tension building in my chest as I stared at the clock, torn between the two roles I was supposed to fulfill."}
