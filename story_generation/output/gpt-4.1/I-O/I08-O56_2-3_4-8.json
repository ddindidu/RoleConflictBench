It was Jamie, someone I knew from the gym, asking if I could help move some boxes into their new apartment that afternoon. I\u2019d always tried to be the kind of person who offered a hand when asked, especially to acquaintances who might not have many people to rely on. I texted back a quick \u201cLet me see what I can do!\u201d and slipped my phone into my pocket.\n\nJust then, my next client arrived, her hair stiff with layers of hairspray and dry shampoo. As a hairdresser, I knew I couldn\u2019t just start cutting\u2014her hair needed a thorough wash and deep conditioning, or my scissors would snag and the cut would be uneven. But she looked anxious, glancing at the clock, and mentioned she was in a rush for a meeting. I felt the pressure mounting: Jamie was counting on me for help, but my client expected me to work quickly and skillfully, even though her hair needed extra care. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being a helpful acquaintance and a responsible hairdresser, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
