Across from me, Sarah, a friend of a friend, shifted uncomfortably, her eyes darting to the floor. I could sense her anxiety, and I knew I should help her feel at ease, maybe ask about her interests or share a light story. That\u2019s what a good acquaintance would do\u2014be present, approachable, and kind.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket, and my heart lurched. The lab group chat was exploding: the atmospheric conditions we\u2019d been waiting months for had finally arrived. If I left now, I could run the experiment that might make or break my research\u2014and my career. The funding review was next week. I felt the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations, the years of work leading to this moment.\n\nI tried to focus on Sarah, but my mind raced with protocols and data points. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. Should I stay and be the friend she needed, or rush to the lab and seize the scientific opportunity I\u2019d worked so hard for?"}
