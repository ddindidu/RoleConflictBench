I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I could almost hear her excitement, and I knew she wanted us to finally have a real date, just the two of us, no distractions. But the line at my register stretched halfway down the aisle, and my manager had already reminded me twice to keep things moving. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, my mind split between the expectation to be the attentive boyfriend she deserved and the reliable cashier my job demanded. I wanted to text her back right away, to show her she mattered, but the next customer was already unloading groceries, watching me expectantly. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the prices, but my thoughts kept drifting to her, waiting for my answer. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I didn\u2019t know which one I could afford to let down."}
