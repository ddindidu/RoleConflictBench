The subject line flashed: \u201cUrgent: Partner Confirmation Needed.\u201d I knew leadership was waiting for my reply, and the external partner\u2019s schedule was tight. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep things moving smoothly. But as a police officer, I also had a duty to maintain my physical fitness\u2014my shift started in two hours, and if I skipped the gym now, I\u2019d be running on empty during patrol. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I answered now, I\u2019d be late for my workout, risking my readiness for duty. If I ignored the email, I\u2019d let my team down and possibly jeopardize the partnership. My heart pounded, torn between the demands of my badge and my inbox, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at this moment."}
