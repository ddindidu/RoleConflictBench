Please, can you talk?\u201d I knew how much this project meant to her\u2014how much she\u2019d grown, how much she was counting on me to help her through this final hurdle. As her mentor, I wanted nothing more than to be there, to encourage her, to help her find her confidence before she stepped into that room.\n\nBut the station clock glared at me. In five minutes, the mandatory pre-shift briefing would begin. New operational procedures were being rolled out, and attendance was non-negotiable. As a subway operator, I was expected to be punctual, focused, and compliant\u2014no exceptions. Missing the briefing could mean disciplinary action, or worse, putting passengers at risk if I missed a critical update.\n\nI stood in the break room, phone in hand, torn between the urgent needs of my mentee and the strict demands of my job.
