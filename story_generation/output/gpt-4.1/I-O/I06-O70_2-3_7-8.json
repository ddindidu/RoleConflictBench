My mentor had finally squeezed in a ten-minute meeting for me, a rare window in her packed schedule. I knew how much she valued punctuality and respect for her time\u2014she\u2019d made that clear from the start. But just as I was about to log in, my work phone buzzed insistently. A customer was calling, her tone already tense in the voicemail: \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? It\u2019s late, and I need it today.\u201d I checked the tracking system\u2014there was a mix-up, and the package was delayed. I was expected to respond quickly, calmly, and professionally, to reassure her and resolve the issue. My mentor\u2019s meeting was starting in two minutes. If I took the call, I\u2019d be late and disrespectful to my mentor. If I ignored the customer, I\u2019d fail at my job and risk a complaint. My hands shook as I stared at both screens, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
