He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback from his boss, and I could see how much it stung. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around him, listen, and reassure him that he was more than his job. But the whistle around my neck felt heavier than ever. The beach was packed, the tide was high, and every few seconds, I scanned the water, counting heads, watching for raised hands or sudden splashes. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Alex, who needed me to be present and comforting, and toward the ocean, where a single missed moment could mean disaster. I could feel his disappointment deepen each time my gaze flicked away, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the swimmers. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the full attention they deserved."}
