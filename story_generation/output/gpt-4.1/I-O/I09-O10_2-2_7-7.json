Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just across the hall. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, and I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I check in, maybe offer to help her secure her balcony or just reassure her? At the same time, my laptop pinged with an urgent email from a client, confused about a line item on their invoice. They needed clarification before the end of the business day, and I knew a delayed response could jeopardize our professional relationship. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of neighborly care and the cold precision of my accounting duties. I could almost hear Mrs. Lee\u2019s soft voice through the wall, while the client\u2019s message blinked insistently on my screen. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the storm gather both outside and within me."}
