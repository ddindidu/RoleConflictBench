It was Mia, my girlfriend, texting about our weekend plans. She thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with her, but I\u2019d mentioned a work event. Her messages grew sharper, frustration seeping through the screen. I knew I should call her, clear things up, and reassure her\u2014she always said I was good at resolving our little conflicts. But just as I started typing, a colleague\u2019s friend sidled up, drink in hand, and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s that big case you\u2019re working on? Must be juicy, right?\u201d I felt the familiar tug of professional duty\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable, even in casual conversation.
