As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, and to catch the crucial project updates that wouldn\u2019t be repeated. But right in front of me sat my next client, already in the chair, her hair damp and smelling of fresh shampoo. She smiled, \u201cI just washed it at home, so you can skip that part, right?\u201d As a hairdresser, I was supposed to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting\u2014salon policy, and what my boss expected. I could feel the pressure mounting: if I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be bending the rules, but if I insisted, I\u2019d run late and miss the meeting.
