She needed me\u2014her texts were raw, her grief pouring through the screen. Her father had passed away suddenly, and she was lost, reaching for me to anchor her. I wanted nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her and let her cry, to be the boyfriend she needed right now. But my shift wasn\u2019t over. Down the hall, Mrs. Carter was waiting for me. She\u2019d just come out of surgery, her eyes wide and searching every time I entered her room. She clung to my words, needing reassurance, needing someone to sit with her and ease her fear. My supervisor expected me to be present, attentive, and calm. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014Emily\u2019s pain on one side, Mrs. Carter\u2019s anxiety on the other. Both needed me, both deserved my care. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone, torn between the person I loved and the patient who depended on me."}
