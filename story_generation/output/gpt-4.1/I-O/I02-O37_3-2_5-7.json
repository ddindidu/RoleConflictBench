It was the last weekend before Mia left for her job abroad, and she wanted us to spend every moment together. She\u2019d planned a cozy breakfast, a walk in the park, and a movie night\u2014just us, making memories before the long distance began. But as I got ready, my phone buzzed with a message from my supervisor at the cleaning company: \u201cShort-staffed today. Need you to cover the morning shift. Remember, strict safety and hygiene protocols\u2014no exceptions.\u201d\n\nI stared at my uniform and the protective gear, thinking about the new rules. Gloves, masks, sanitizing every surface, double-checking everything. I knew how important it was, especially after last week\u2019s health scare at one of the offices. But Mia\u2019s eyes sparkled with hope when she talked about our plans. She needed me, just this once, to be fully present. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I\u2019d made to her. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move."}
