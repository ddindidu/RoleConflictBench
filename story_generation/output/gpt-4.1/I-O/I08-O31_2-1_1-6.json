She clung to her coffee cup, eyes darting around, clearly overwhelmed. As an acquaintance, I wanted to be warm, to help her feel welcome, to show her that this group was friendly. I smiled, asked gentle questions, and tried to draw her into the conversation.\n\nThen, through the window, I spotted a car parked illegally\u2014blocking a fire hydrant. My training as a police officer kicked in. I knew the rules: safety first, no exceptions. But as I stepped outside, I realized the car belonged to the very woman I\u2019d just been comforting. She\u2019d mentioned her anxiety about driving and parking in new places. My duty demanded I issue a ticket, but my heart ached at the thought of adding to her stress. I stood on the curb, ticket book in hand, torn between the expectations of my uniform and the kindness I wanted to offer as a friend."}
