We\u2019ve always exchanged friendly hellos, and I could tell from the way Jamie smiled that she expected the same warmth from me. But as I got closer, I realized she was holding a shopping bag from the store where I work as a cashier. My heart sank when she pulled out a sweater and explained she wanted to return it, but didn\u2019t have the receipt. As a cashier, I\u2019m supposed to strictly follow the store\u2019s return policy\u2014no returns without a receipt, no exceptions. Jamie looked at me, clearly hoping I\u2019d bend the rules just this once. I could feel the tension building inside me. On one hand, I wanted to be the friendly, approachable acquaintance she knew, but on the other, I was expected to uphold the store\u2019s policies. My mind raced, torn between disappointing a friend and risking trouble at work."}
