I\u2019m lost.\u201d I know he\u2019s been anxious about this dinner, hoping we can clear the air after our last argument. As his friend, I should reply right away, reassure him, and make sure we don\u2019t miss each other again. But at the same moment, the attorney in front of me references a new appellate decision\u2014one I haven\u2019t read yet. The courtroom waits for my response, and I\u2019m expected, as a judge, to be fully informed, to uphold the law with precision and fairness. My mind races. If I pause to help Sam, I risk appearing unprepared and unprofessional. If I focus on the case, I let my friend down when he needs me most. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I feel the tension rising as I try to decide which expectation I can afford to disappoint."}
