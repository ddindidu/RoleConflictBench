My mentee, Sarah, was waiting in the conference room, her project files spread out, eyes searching for reassurance. She\u2019d been struggling, and I\u2019d promised her my full attention, to guide her through the next steps. But just as I was about to sit down with her, my phone buzzed\u2014a patient was waiting for their routine check-up, and the nurse mentioned they seemed anxious, wanting to discuss some health concerns.\n\nI could hear Sarah\u2019s hopeful voice in my mind, expecting guidance and encouragement. At the same time, I pictured my patient, perhaps worried about symptoms they hadn\u2019t shared before, needing me to listen and explain things with care. Both roles demanded my presence, my empathy, my focus. I felt torn, my heart racing as I weighed the disappointment in Sarah\u2019s eyes against the trust my patient placed in me. The hallway stretched between the two rooms, and I stood there, caught in the middle, wishing I could split myself in two."}
