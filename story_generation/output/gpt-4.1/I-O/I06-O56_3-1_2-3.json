My mentor\u2019s assignment\u2014an in-depth reflection on my progress\u2014was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d finish it tonight, but the salon was still buzzing. Just as I was about to close up, Mrs. Lee, my favorite regular, slid into my chair with her usual warm smile. \u201cJust a quick trim on the fringe, dear. I know you\u2019re closing, but it\u2019s been poking my eyes all week.\u201d Her tone was gentle, but I could see she really needed this. \n\nAs I combed her hair, my mind raced. If I rushed, I might mess up and disappoint her. But if I took my time, I\u2019d lose precious minutes for my assignment. My mentor expected thorough, thoughtful work\u2014anything less would reflect poorly on me. Yet, as a hairdresser, I prided myself on never making a client feel like an afterthought. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself torn, wishing I could split in two."}
