My mentee, Sarah, was waiting in the consultation room, her notes spread out, eyes bright with hope. She was counting on me to help her prepare for the interview that could launch her career. I wanted to give her my full attention, to ask the right questions, to challenge her thinking and encourage her growth. But as I turned to join her, a patient approached the counter, clutching a bottle of ibuprofen. \u201cIs this safe for my migraines?\u201d she asked, her voice uncertain. I knew the answer was simple, but I also knew that every patient deserved more than a rushed response. My mind raced\u2014Sarah\u2019s future, the patient\u2019s trust, my own standards as a mentor and a pharmacist. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the needs of the person in front of me and the one waiting just beyond the door."}
