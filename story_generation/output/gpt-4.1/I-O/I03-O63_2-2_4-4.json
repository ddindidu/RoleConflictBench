He\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014dinner, a movie, just us. I promised I\u2019d be done with work on time. But as I stare at my computer, headset still on, I see the sales numbers blinking on my screen. I\u2019m three sales short of my weekly target, and there\u2019s only an hour left in my shift. Management has been clear: hit your numbers or risk losing your bonus. My phone buzzes with a text from him: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you. Should I start the movie?\u201d My heart twists. I want to be the girlfriend who keeps her promises, who\u2019s present and loving. But I also need to be the telemarketer who delivers, who doesn\u2019t let the team down. The clock ticks louder, and I feel pulled in two directions, each expectation weighing on me, demanding I choose."}
