It was the last one before Mia left for her fellowship abroad, and we\u2019d planned every moment\u2014her favorite brunch spot, a walk by the river, and just being together. As we sat in the caf\u00e9, her hand in mine, my phone buzzed. It was the pharmacy. One of my regulars, Mrs. Patel, was at the counter, confused about which pain reliever to buy for her arthritis. The technician said she seemed anxious and wanted to speak to me directly.\n\nMia squeezed my hand, her eyes searching mine. I knew how much this time meant to her, to us. But I also knew Mrs. Patel relied on me for reassurance and clear advice. I could just call and give her a quick answer, but I also knew she valued a thorough explanation, and I prided myself on being the kind of pharmacist who never rushed a patient. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the woman I love and the patient who trusts me."}
