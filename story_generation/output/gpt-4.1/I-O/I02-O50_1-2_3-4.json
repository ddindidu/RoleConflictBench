I\u2019m free whenever you are.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d talked about making more time for each other, how she\u2019d said she missed our long walks and late-night talks. I wanted to be the boyfriend she deserved, attentive and present, not distracted or tired.\n\nBut as I put my phone down, my mind drifted to the machines at work. The last service window had slipped by\u2014too many urgent jobs, not enough hands. Now, a few of the units were running hotter than they should, and I knew if I didn\u2019t get in soon to clean and check them, we could be looking at a breakdown. My boss had made it clear: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Stay on top of it.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure building, tugged in two directions. She was waiting for me to pick a night, to show her she mattered. The machines were waiting too, their hums and whirs echoing in my mind, warning me of what could go wrong. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, caught between the warmth of her smile and the cold logic of the machines."}
