Tomorrow was pickup day, and I knew Mrs. Patel next door always appreciated when I waited until the bins were truly full before dragging them out, so the sidewalk stayed clear for her morning walk. I could easily wait another week, but the thought nagged at me\u2014what if I forgot next time? \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a notification: the clerk had delivered the file for the upcoming procedural hearing. It was a simple matter, nothing urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough. I always reviewed files as soon as they arrived, even if the hearing was weeks away. That was the expectation\u2014diligence, preparedness, no matter how routine the case.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I took the bins out now, I\u2019d have to pass by Mrs. Patel\u2019s window, risking a disapproving look. If I sat down with the file, I\u2019d be putting off a neighborly courtesy. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
