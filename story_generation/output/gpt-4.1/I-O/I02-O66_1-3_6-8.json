I could almost hear the disappointment in her voice. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her right away, clear up the misunderstanding, and reassure her that I cared about our plans. But at that exact moment, my taxi app pinged\u2014my next passenger was already waiting, and the app showed a flurry of urgent messages: \u201cAre you close? I really need to get to the station fast.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I called Mia now, I\u2019d be late picking up the passenger, risking a bad rating and maybe even a complaint. But if I ignored Mia, the tension between us would only grow, and I hated the thought of her feeling neglected. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, my mind torn between the responsibility to my passenger and the need to fix things with Mia. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good boyfriend and a reliable taxi driver."}
