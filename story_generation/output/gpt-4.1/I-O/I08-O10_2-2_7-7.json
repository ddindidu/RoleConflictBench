I don\u2019t know how she still has her job.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossip, especially about colleagues. I nodded politely, not wanting to encourage him, but also not wanting to seem rude. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a client was calling about a confusing line item on their invoice. As an accountant, I\u2019m expected to be clear and responsive, but I could hear Mark waiting for my reaction, expecting me to join in his criticism. I felt torn between my desire to maintain a positive atmosphere and my professional obligation to address the client\u2019s concern immediately.
