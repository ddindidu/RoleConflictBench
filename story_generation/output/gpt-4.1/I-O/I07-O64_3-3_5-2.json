As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish the report before the end of the day. The client was waiting, and any delay on my part would hold up the entire project. My phone buzzed with reminders from my manager, and I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I missed the deadline.\n\nBut as the cashier on the evening shift, I was also responsible for closing out the register. The line of customers grew longer, each transaction requiring my full attention. The drawer was full of large bills, and I knew that even a small mistake could mean hours of reconciliation and suspicion from my supervisor. My hands trembled as I counted change, my mind racing with numbers from both the register and the unfinished report.\n\nI felt torn in two, pulled by the urgent needs of my team and the critical responsibility of handling money.
