As a colleague, I knew the report I\u2019d been assigned was due by midnight, and the project manager had made it clear: if I missed the deadline, the client\u2019s delivery would be delayed, and the whole team would suffer. But as a construction laborer, I was also responsible for making sure my section of the site was spotless before I left. The foreman had already warned us that any slip-ups could mean safety violations or even injuries.\n\nThe last hour of my shift ticked away. My boots crunched over scattered debris, and I could see dust collecting in the corners. I knew I should grab the broom and get to work, but my mind kept drifting to the unfinished report waiting on my laptop in the break room. If I left the site messy, I\u2019d be letting down my crew and risking everyone\u2019s safety. But if I didn\u2019t finish the report, I\u2019d be letting down my colleagues and jeopardizing the project. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands, feeling pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly meet both expectations at once."}
