The project deadline was looming, and I knew how much they needed this\u2014my guidance, my experience, the structured walkthrough I\u2019d promised. I could almost hear their questions, see their anxious faces, and I felt the weight of their expectations. Just as I was about to print the handouts, my phone buzzed. Dispatch needed me to deliver a high-value package\u2014immediately. The recipient was only available for a short window, and I had to verify their identity in person. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d let my team down, but if I stayed, I\u2019d risk the package\u2019s security and my reputation as a reliable delivery person. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both mattered deeply to me. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure build as the minutes ticked by, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
