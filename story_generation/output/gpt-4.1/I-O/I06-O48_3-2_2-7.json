The deadline was tomorrow, and my mentor had emphasized how important it was to have everything perfect before upper management\u2019s evaluation. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind kept drifting to Mrs. Lee in room 204. She\u2019d just come out of surgery and, earlier, I\u2019d seen her eyes darting around the room, her hands trembling as she clutched her blanket. I knew she needed someone to sit with her, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But the assignment weighed on me\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it tonight, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, maybe even jeopardizing my future opportunities. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the urgent task and the anxious patient who needed me. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move in either direction."}
