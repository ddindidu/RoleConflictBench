I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my next scheduled break. As a telemarketer, every second of my workday was tracked. If I stepped away from my headset outside of those rigidly scheduled breaks, the compliance system would flag me. Too many flags, and I could lose my job. But then I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. The lights in her apartment had flickered earlier, and she\u2019d mentioned her phone sometimes cut out during storms. I knew she\u2019d appreciate someone checking in, maybe even just to reassure her or help with a flashlight. But if I left my desk now, even for five minutes, I\u2019d risk a warning. My job demanded strict adherence to the schedule, but being a good neighbor meant being there when someone needed help, especially in a storm. I stared at the headset in my hand, torn between the blinking red light of the compliance system and the thought of Mrs. Lee sitting alone in the dark."}
