He looked flustered, juggling his phone and a set of keys. As I scanned his groceries, he leaned in and whispered, \u201cHey, could you help me move a few boxes to my new place after your shift? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I could see the hope in his eyes, the silent expectation that I\u2019d say yes, just like I had when we were in college.\n\nBut the store was packed, and my manager had already reminded us twice about the importance of accuracy and speed during peak hours. I knew I\u2019d be expected to stay late to help close, double-check the register, and make sure every transaction was perfect. My mind raced, torn between wanting to help Mark and not wanting to let my team down or risk making mistakes at the register. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to say."}
