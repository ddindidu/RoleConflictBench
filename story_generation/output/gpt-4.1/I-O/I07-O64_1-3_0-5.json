My team\u2019s weekly meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to join in, share updates, and show I was engaged. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed\u2014my manager always encouraged live participation, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged.\n\nBut as a cashier, I was staring at a mountain of bills and coins, the end-of-shift deposit looming over me. The store\u2019s policy was clear: every cent had to be counted, double-checked, and logged before I could leave the register. No shortcuts, no distractions\u2014especially with a large deposit like this. Corporate audits were strict, and any mistake could mean trouble for me and the store.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the expectation to be a reliable teammate and the responsibility to follow store procedures to the letter. My phone buzzed with a meeting reminder as I stared at the cash, my mind racing, caught between two worlds and unsure which demand to answer first."}
