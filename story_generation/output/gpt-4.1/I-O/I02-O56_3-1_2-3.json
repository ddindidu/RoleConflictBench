She\u2019d lost her brother just two days ago, and I knew she needed me\u2014her boyfriend\u2014to be there, to hold her, to listen, to just exist beside her in her grief. But I was at work, scissors in hand, halfway through a trim for Mrs. Lee, my favorite regular. She smiled at me in the mirror, her tone gentle as she asked if I could just snip a little more off her fringe. It was a simple request, but my mind was split. I wanted to drop everything, rush to Mia, and be the comfort she needed. At the same time, I felt the weight of my professional duty: Mrs. Lee deserved my full attention and care. My heart pounded as I glanced between the two women\u2014one needing my love, the other my skill. I felt torn, the expectations of boyfriend and hairdresser pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which part of me to honor first."}
