The deadline for my written judgment loomed, and I knew the parties were anxiously awaiting my decision. Every word I wrote had to be precise, every conclusion justified. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mark, an old college acquaintance who\u2019d recently moved to town. \u201cHey! Any recommendations for a good restaurant nearby? I\u2019m meeting someone important tonight and want to make a good impression.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the tug of obligation. Mark had always been friendly, and I knew he\u2019d appreciate my help. But the judgment demanded my full attention; any distraction could compromise its clarity. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014on one hand, the expectation to be supportive and helpful, on the other, the duty to deliver a thorough, timely legal opinion. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between composing a thoughtful reply and returning to the dense legal analysis before me. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I found myself paralyzed, unable to satisfy either expectation without neglecting the other."}
