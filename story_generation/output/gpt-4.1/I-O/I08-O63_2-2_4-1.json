Earlier, my acquaintance Sam had messaged, \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d I knew he didn\u2019t have many friends in town, and I\u2019d always tried to be supportive when someone reached out. But my shift as a telemarketer was about to start, and lately, the calls had been relentless. Prospects kept asking technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script barely covered. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to never say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and to keep the calls moving. I could already feel the pressure building in my chest, imagining Sam\u2019s disappointment if I said no, and my boss\u2019s frustration if I got flustered on the phone. Both roles demanded my attention, my time, and my best self. I wanted to help Sam, but I also needed to keep my job. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
