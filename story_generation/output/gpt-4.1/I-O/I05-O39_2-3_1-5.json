She was anxious, and I could hear the uncertainty in her voice as she described her plan. I knew she needed my full attention, my steady reassurance, and clear feedback. I was about to offer a suggestion when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Joe, one of the new guys, heading straight toward a suspended load. My heart pounded. As a construction laborer, I was expected to keep the site safe, to act immediately if I saw danger. But if I shouted now, I\u2019d break the flow of the conversation, possibly shattering my mentee\u2019s fragile confidence. If I didn\u2019t, Joe could get hurt. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide and support my mentee and the urgent need to protect my coworker. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding action, each in their own way."}
