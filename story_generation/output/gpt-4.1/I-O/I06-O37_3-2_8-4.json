I have a flight at 4, so I can only spare this hour.\u201d I knew how rare it was for her to fit me in, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But as I was about to leave for the session, my client called. \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of floor cleaner. Can you pick some up before your next visit? I need the house spotless for guests.\u201d I glanced at the clock, calculating the time it would take to stop by the store. If I went now, I\u2019d risk being late for my mentor, disrespecting her tight schedule. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be letting down my client, who trusted me to keep things running smoothly. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension build as I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in hand."}
