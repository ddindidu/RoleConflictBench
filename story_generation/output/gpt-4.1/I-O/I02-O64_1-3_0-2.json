My partner stood just outside the store, waiting for me, her shoulders slightly hunched, eyes tired. I could tell she\u2019d had a rough day, and I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that everything would be okay. But right now, I was the only cashier on duty, and the end-of-day rush had begun. Customers lined up, some with large purchases, and I had to focus\u2014every bill, every receipt, every number had to be perfect. One mistake could mean hours of paperwork or worse, a loss I\u2019d have to explain to my manager.

My heart ached as I watched her wait, knowing she needed me, while my hands moved mechanically over the register, trapped by the demands of my job."}
