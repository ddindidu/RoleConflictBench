It was Mark, an old college friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on a deserted stretch outside town, and he didn\u2019t know who else to call. He needed a ride, maybe even help with a tow. I glanced at the clock\u2014less than two hours until my client\u2019s contested motion, a case that could make or break their business. They were counting on me to be sharp, prepared, and present in court. But Mark\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, the unspoken expectation that friends help each other in a pinch. My heart pounded as I weighed the loyalty I owed to a friend in need against the professional duty I had sworn to uphold. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the urge to rush to Mark\u2019s side and the responsibility to stand by my client. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
