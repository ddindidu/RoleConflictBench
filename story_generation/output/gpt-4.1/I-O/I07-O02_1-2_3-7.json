As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the documentation task by Friday, but honestly, there was plenty of buffer time. The team could move forward without it for now, and no one seemed particularly pressed. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down or seem unreliable.\n\nBut as an engineer, my mind was elsewhere. Management had just sent a reminder: they needed my input on the project planning session. My estimates would shape the entire quarterly roadmap, and everyone was waiting for me to weigh in. I felt the pressure to be precise, to think through every possible risk and dependency, knowing how much the team relied on my accuracy.\n\nI could feel the tension building inside me. If I focused on the documentation, I\u2019d delay the planning input and hold up management. If I dove into the estimates, I\u2019d risk missing the documentation deadline and disappointing my colleagues. My stomach twisted as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, knowing that either way, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
