My girlfriend sits across from me, her suitcase half-packed in the corner, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. It\u2019s our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I know she wants every moment to count. She suggests a walk by the river, maybe dinner at our favorite place, and I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. The latest law review journal arrived this morning, thick with articles on new legal theories that could reshape my courtroom decisions. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay ahead, to be prepared for any argument that might arise. I feel the journal\u2019s presence in my bag, a silent reminder of my duty. My heart aches with the pull between her hopeful smile and the professional obligation gnawing at me. I want to be fully present with her, to make these hours matter, but the thought of falling behind in my field fills me with anxiety. I sit there, torn, the evening stretching before me, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
