It was Priya, one of the new hires I\u2019d been mentoring. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d she asked, poking her head in. She wanted advice about whether to take a lateral move in the company\u2014something minor, but she valued my opinion. I glanced at my calendar. In thirty minutes, a seminar on upcoming tax law changes was starting, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to attend and report back. Missing it could mean overlooking crucial compliance updates, but Priya looked anxious, clearly hoping for guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my responsibility to keep the company compliant, and my desire to be the supportive mentor Priya needed. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of professional duty and the quiet importance of being there for someone just starting out."}
