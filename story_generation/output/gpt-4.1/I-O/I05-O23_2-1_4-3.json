They were eager, relying on me to guide them through the skills they\u2019d need for the upcoming project. I\u2019d spent hours preparing, determined to give them the clarity and confidence I wished I\u2019d had at their stage. Just as I was about to print the handouts, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about a procedural hearing scheduled for the afternoon. It was a minor court matter, one that could be postponed without much consequence, but as a lawyer, I knew my client expected me to be present, to represent their interests no matter how small the issue seemed.\n\nI felt the familiar tension rising in my chest. My mentees were counting on me to show up, to share what I knew and help them succeed. My client, though, trusted me to be their advocate, to never treat their case as an afterthought. Both roles demanded my presence, my commitment. I stared at my calendar, torn between the responsibility to teach and the duty to represent, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter which path I chose."}
