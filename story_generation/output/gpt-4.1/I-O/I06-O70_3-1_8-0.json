I can only spare this hour before my flight.\u201d My heart raced. I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this session, and I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and preparation. I quickly gathered my notes, but just as I was about to leave, my work phone buzzed. A package, delayed all morning, had finally arrived at the depot. It was urgent\u2014marked \u201csame-day delivery\u201d\u2014and the address was across town. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo late deliveries, no exceptions.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left now, I\u2019d risk missing the delivery window and disappointing my boss. If I waited to deliver the package, I\u2019d miss the only chance to meet my mentor before they left the country. My hands trembled as I stood at the crossroads, torn between two worlds, each demanding my full attention and respect."}
