The subject line\u2014\u201cImmediate Action Required: Discrepancy Detected\u201d\u2014made my stomach twist. As an accountant, I knew I had to respond right away. Missing a deadline could mean penalties for my client, and my reputation was on the line. But as I reached for my laptop, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Alex: \u201cCan we talk? We can\u2019t keep fighting like this.\u201d We\u2019d argued about money again last night, voices raised, both of us exhausted. I knew he expected me to help us work through it, to listen and find a way forward. I wanted that too. But the tax notice glared at me, demanding my attention.

My chest tightened as I tried to decide which crisis to face first, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
