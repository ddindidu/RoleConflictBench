As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach her, offer a warm smile, and help her feel welcome. I knew how intimidating these gatherings could be, and I wanted to be the friendly face she needed. But just as I took a step in her direction, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. I spotted a row of pool chairs, slightly out of place. They weren\u2019t a hazard, but I\u2019d been told to keep everything orderly, to set an example for the others. My supervisor had been strict about maintaining the facilities, and I could already hear his voice in my head, reminding me of my responsibilities. I hesitated, torn between the expectation to be approachable and supportive, and the demand to keep the pool area in perfect condition. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between two roles, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
