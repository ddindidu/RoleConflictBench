Just as I dialed, I noticed Sarah, an old acquaintance from college, sitting across the caf\u00e9, tears streaming down her face. My instinct was to go over, offer comfort, and be the friendly, supportive person she remembered. But before I could move, my call connected. On the other end, Mr. Thompson, a long-time customer, launched into a tirade, questioning the legitimacy of our latest offer and demanding detailed explanations. My training as a telemarketer kicked in\u2014I needed to stay calm, address his objections, and keep the conversation professional. Yet, every word I spoke felt forced, my attention split between the angry voice in my ear and Sarah\u2019s silent distress. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides: the expectation to be a compassionate acquaintance and the demand to be a composed, persuasive telemarketer. My heart raced as I struggled to decide which role to fulfill, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in on me."}
