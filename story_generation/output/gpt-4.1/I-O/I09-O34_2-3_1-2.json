I baked a small cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. As I stepped into the hallway, cake in hand, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly, and I felt the pressure to be friendly, to chat and share the cake as a gesture of goodwill. Just as I opened my mouth to greet her, my phone buzzed urgently\u2014an alert from the tower. A major route closure had just been announced, and dozens of flights were now circling, waiting for instructions. My team needed me to help manage the chaos, to keep the skies safe. I could see Mrs. Kim\u2019s expectant face, the cake growing heavier in my hands, while my mind raced with the demands of the airspace above.
