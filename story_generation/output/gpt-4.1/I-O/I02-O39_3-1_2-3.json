My girlfriend\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d lost her brother just two days ago, and I knew she was barely holding it together. My heart twisted\u2014I wanted nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her and let her cry. But the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, reminding us all: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone, sweep up your area before you leave. Safety first.\u201d I looked at the scattered debris around my feet, the nails and splinters that could hurt someone if left behind. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking someone\u2019s safety, maybe even my job. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the dust and the grief, not knowing which way to turn."}
