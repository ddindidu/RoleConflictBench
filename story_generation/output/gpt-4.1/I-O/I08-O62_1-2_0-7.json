I smiled, ready to exchange a friendly hello, remembering how important it is to be approachable and warm\u2014especially since we\u2019re both new to the area. But just as I opened my mouth, I glanced through the glass doors to the pool and saw a group of teenagers laughing and lining up at the edge, clearly ignoring the bold NO DIVING signs. My lifeguard instincts kicked in, and I felt a surge of anxiety. I knew I had to enforce the rules, even if it meant interrupting the moment and possibly coming off as stern or unfriendly. I could feel Jamie\u2019s eyes on me, expecting a friendly word, while my mind raced with the responsibility of keeping everyone safe. The pressure of these two roles\u2014being the approachable acquaintance and the vigilant lifeguard\u2014pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me frozen for a split second, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
