My mind was deep in measurements and flow, thinking about how to make the cramped space functional. Just then, I noticed someone hovering nearby\u2014a friend of a friend, introduced earlier, who looked lost in the crowd. I remembered my role as an acquaintance: I should be warm, inviting, help them feel at ease. But my mind was still tangled in the demands of the architect\u2014every minute away from the sketch meant losing the thread of my design, risking a clumsy, impractical plan.\n\nI glanced up, catching their anxious eyes. They needed a friendly word, maybe a seat at my table. But my page was half-finished, and I knew if I stopped now, the ideas would scatter. I felt the tension coil in my chest: the urge to be present and kind, the pressure to deliver a thoughtful, functional design. Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my full attention, and I sat there, pen hovering, heart caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
