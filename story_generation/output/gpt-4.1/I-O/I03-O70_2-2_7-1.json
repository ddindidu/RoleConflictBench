My boyfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen: \u201cCan we talk? I don\u2019t want to go to bed angry again.\u201d We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014rent, groceries, who pays for what. I knew he expected me to help fix things, to talk it out, to be the understanding girlfriend who could smooth over our rough edges. But my delivery app pinged, reminding me that Mrs. Lee\u2019s groceries had to be at her door in the next fifteen minutes. She\u2019d called earlier, her voice tight with worry, saying she needed everything for her family\u2019s dinner tonight. My boss had warned me: one more late delivery and I\u2019d be written up. I stared at the two addresses\u2014his apartment, just a few blocks away, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s house in the opposite direction. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between being there for him and doing my job right."}
