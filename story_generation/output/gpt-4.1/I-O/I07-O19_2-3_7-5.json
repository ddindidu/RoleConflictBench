I knew they were waiting for my input on the shared project, and the last email had made it clear: they couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified a key point. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the workflow smooth and show respect for everyone\u2019s time. But right now, I was sitting across from Mrs. Lee, a patient with a complicated medication regimen. She looked anxious, clutching her list of prescriptions, and I could see how much she needed my full attention. As a pharmacist, I was responsible for ensuring her safety, explaining each drug, and checking for dangerous interactions. My mind raced, torn between the urgent pings from my team and the vulnerable woman in front of me. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I paused to answer my colleagues, I\u2019d risk missing something critical in Mrs. Lee\u2019s care. But if I focused solely on her, I\u2019d be letting my team down, delaying their work. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, caught in the impossible space between two roles."}
