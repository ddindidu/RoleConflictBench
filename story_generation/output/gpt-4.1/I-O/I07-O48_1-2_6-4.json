My phone buzzed with a new email from a colleague\u2014just an update, nothing urgent, but I knew the expectation: respond within a reasonable time, show I\u2019m engaged and reliable. I started typing a quick reply, but just then, the call light blinked from Room 204. I remembered the patient there, still groggy from surgery, her vitals a little higher than normal earlier. As a nursing assistant, I knew I needed to check on her, take her temperature and blood pressure, and make sure she was stable. My mind raced\u2014if I ignored the email, I\u2019d seem unresponsive, maybe even careless to my team. But if I delayed checking on the patient, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to her care, risking her safety. I stared at my phone, torn between the silent pressure of my inbox and the urgent responsibility waiting down the hall, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
