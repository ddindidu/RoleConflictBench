The parties are waiting for my judgment, and I know the law demands clarity and thoroughness\u2014no shortcuts, no delays. Yet, as I try to focus, my phone buzzes with a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Lee. She\u2019s at work and asks if I can receive her package, which is due to arrive any minute. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these small favors. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure of the court\u2019s deadline and the expectation that I\u2019ll be a good neighbor. My mind races\u2014should I step away from my writing, risking my concentration and precious time, or ignore her request and let her down? The demands of justice and community tug at me from opposite sides, and I feel the tension rising, unsure which role I can afford to disappoint."}
