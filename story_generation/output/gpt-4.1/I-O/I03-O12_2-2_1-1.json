Had a rough day.\u201d My heart sinks. I know he\u2019s been anxious about his project, and now he needs me. I want to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019s more than his boss\u2019s opinion. But my laptop screen is filled with red flags\u2014performance warnings in the code review. The new feature is so close to being done, but if I don\u2019t fix these issues tonight, the team will be blocked tomorrow. My lead expects clean, efficient code, and I can\u2019t let them down. I stare at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to close my laptop and call Alex, but the code nags at me, demanding my attention. My chest tightens as I try to decide who needs me more right now\u2014my partner or my team."}
