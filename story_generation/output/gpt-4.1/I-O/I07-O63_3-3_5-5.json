As a colleague, I knew the report I was working on was the last piece before we could deliver to the client\u2014everyone was waiting on me, and the deadline was today. My manager had reminded me twice already that any delay would jeopardize the whole project. But as a telemarketer, today was the final day of the quarter, and we were just shy of our sales target. Management had made it clear: if we didn\u2019t hit the number, there would be no bonuses, and worse, there might be penalties for the whole team. My phone buzzed with reminders from both teams\u2014one urging me to finish the report, the other pushing for more calls. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between letting down my colleagues or my sales team. The pressure from both sides felt suffocating, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in, demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
