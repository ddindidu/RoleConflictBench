My phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cClient needs the update by noon. We\u2019re counting on you.\u201d I knew this task was the linchpin for the whole project, and if I missed the deadline, the client delivery would be delayed. My colleagues were relying on me, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 12, we have a call. Elderly female, possible broken arm after a fall. Respond immediately.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I knew how crucial it was to reach patients quickly, to offer comfort and care in those first frightening moments. Someone was in pain, waiting for help only I could give.\n\nI looked from the urgent email to the flashing lights on my radio.
