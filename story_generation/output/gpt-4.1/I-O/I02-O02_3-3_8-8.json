My mind raced, trying to recall the last time we\u2019d had a real conversation that didn\u2019t end in frustration. She wanted answers, reassurance, a plan to fix what was breaking between us. But my laptop screen glowed with urgent messages from my project manager\u2014our client was waiting for my time estimates, and the contract deadline was tonight. If I didn\u2019t respond soon, the whole project could be delayed, and my team would be furious. I felt torn in two, heart pounding, as I tried to listen to her pain while mentally calculating story points and dependencies. She needed me present, emotionally available, but my team needed me focused and precise. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I could feel myself unraveling, caught between the person I loved and the work I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
