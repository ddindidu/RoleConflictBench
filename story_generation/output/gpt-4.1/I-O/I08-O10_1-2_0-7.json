Suddenly, I spotted Mark, someone I\u2019d met at last week\u2019s office mixer, coming toward me. He smiled, and I knew he expected a friendly hello, maybe even a quick chat. At the same moment, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a client, asking for clarification about a line item on their invoice. As an accountant, I knew I needed to respond quickly and professionally, especially since this client was known for being particular about details. But as an acquaintance, I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or distracted. My heart raced as I tried to decide: should I stop and chat with Mark, keeping up the friendly rapport, or should I excuse myself and focus on the client\u2019s urgent financial question? The hallway felt even quieter as I hesitated, caught between the expectations of being approachable and being reliable."}
