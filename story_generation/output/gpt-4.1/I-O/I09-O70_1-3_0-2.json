The hospital\u2019s instructions were clear: this delivery had to reach the cardiology department within the next ten minutes, or patient care could be compromised. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Mrs. Patel, my neighbor from down the hall. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly hello and a moment of small talk. I could see she was carrying groceries, probably hoping I\u2019d offer to help as I often did. But every second I spent here was a second lost for the delivery. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the considerate neighbor she knew, or the reliable delivery person the hospital depended on. I opened my mouth, torn between a rushed greeting and the urge to explain, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
