My mind was deep in the flow of designing\u2014calculating the best way to maximize light, privacy, and collaboration. Just as I was finalizing the placement of the conference rooms, Maya, a junior designer, poked her head in. \u201cDo you think I should take the lead on the client presentation next week?\u201d she asked, her voice tentative. As her mentor, I knew she looked to me for guidance, even on these small career steps. I wanted to encourage her, to help her grow, but my mind was tangled in the demands of the project. The client expected a flawless, functional design by tomorrow, and every minute counted. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding my undivided attention to detail, the other asking for thoughtful, supportive advice. My heart raced as I tried to balance the urge to help Maya with the urgent need to finish the floor plan. I hesitated, caught between the expectations of being a mentor and the responsibilities of being an architect, unsure which role to answer first."}
