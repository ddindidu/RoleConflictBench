My heart pounded as I recognized the next person in line\u2014Maya, an old classmate and now a regular. She smiled, but her eyes darted around, and I knew she wanted to talk. Just yesterday, I\u2019d overheard something about her from a coworker\u2014something personal, something that could easily become gossip if repeated. As a cashier, I was expected to be friendly, to chat and make customers feel welcome, even during the holiday chaos. But as an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid spreading rumors or saying anything that could hurt Maya. She leaned in, her voice low, asking if I\u2019d heard anything about her. The expectation to be open and friendly warred with my responsibility to protect her privacy. My hands shook as I scanned her items, my mind racing, caught between the demands of my job and the loyalty I owed as a friend."}
