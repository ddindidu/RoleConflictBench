His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me to come get him right away. I could hear the wind howling through his cracked window, and I pictured him stranded, headlights flickering in the dark. As his friend, I knew he was counting on me to show up, to be the person he could rely on in a crisis.\n\nBut just as I grabbed my keys, my work phone lit up. The night shift operator was on the line again, confused and frustrated. He\u2019d been adjusting the machine settings all evening, and now the material waste was piling up. As the repairer, it was my job to guide him, to prevent costly mistakes and keep production running smoothly. My supervisor expected me to be available, especially during critical moments like this.\n\nI stood in my kitchen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, heart pounding. Both needed me\u2014one as a friend, one as a professional. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which call to answer first."}
