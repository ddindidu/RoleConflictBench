As a colleague, I knew the report I was working on was crucial\u2014my team was counting on me to finish it before the end of the day. The client was waiting, and any delay would throw off the entire project timeline. But as a telemarketer, I was also painfully aware that I was just three sales short of my weekly target, with only an hour left in my shift. Management had made it clear: missing targets would affect my bonus and possibly my standing in the team. My heart pounded as I weighed my options. If I focused on the report, I\u2019d let my sales numbers slip. If I picked up the phone to make more calls, the report would be late, and my colleagues would be disappointed. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt trapped, torn between loyalty to my team and the demands of my sales role, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
