As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk it out, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. But just as I reached for my phone, a Slack notification popped up: \u201cHey, we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll join the brainstorming session next week. Your input on the new feature would be awesome!\u201d \n\nI knew the session was technically optional, but as a software developer, I felt the unspoken pressure to show up, contribute, and prove I was a team player. My manager always said collaboration was key, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. I could already feel the tug-of-war inside me\u2014Mia needed reassurance and attention, but my team expected commitment and creativity. My mind raced, torn between smoothing things over with Mia and stepping up at work, both roles demanding more than I felt I could give at once."}
