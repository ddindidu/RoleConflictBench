She looked to me for reassurance, for the kind of guidance that could shape her future. I nodded, offering advice, trying to instill confidence, knowing how much this moment meant to her. Just as she began to relax, a sudden commotion caught my eye\u2014a child, flailing in the deep end, where swimming was strictly off-limits. My training as a lifeguard kicked in, heart pounding as I scanned the water. I was torn. My mentee\u2019s eyes pleaded for my attention, desperate for support, while the child\u2019s safety demanded immediate action. The weight of both roles pressed down on me: the expectation to nurture growth, and the duty to enforce safety. I felt the seconds stretch, my mind racing, caught between the promise I made to guide her and the responsibility to protect those in danger."}
