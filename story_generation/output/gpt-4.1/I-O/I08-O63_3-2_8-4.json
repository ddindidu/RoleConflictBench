Only an hour left, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need results, not excuses.\u201d I scrolled through my contacts and paused when I saw Lisa\u2019s name. We\u2019d met at a friend\u2019s party last month, and she\u2019d been friendly, even sharing a bit about her recent struggles at work. Just yesterday, I\u2019d overheard something sensitive about her\u2014something that, if mentioned, might make her more receptive to my pitch, or at least keep her on the line longer.\n\nBut as an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t use what I\u2019d learned. Gossiping or speaking negatively about others was something I always tried to avoid. Yet, the pressure to meet my sales quota was suffocating. My finger hovered over the call button, my mind racing between the expectations of being a decent acquaintance and the demands of my job. The clock ticked louder, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
