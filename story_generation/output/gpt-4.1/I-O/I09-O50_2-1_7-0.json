As a neighbor, I knew Mrs. Kim down the hall would be anxious\u2014she always was during storms, and her children lived far away. I felt a tug of responsibility to check in, maybe bring her some candles or just reassure her. But just as I reached for my umbrella, my work phone buzzed. The plant manager\u2019s voice was tense: the old packaging machine was acting up again, and even though production was slow, any downtime now could mean bigger problems later. As the machine repairer, I was expected to drop everything and get to the plant, diagnose the glitch, and keep things running smoothly. My mind raced\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d be a reliable employee, but I\u2019d leave Mrs. Kim alone in the storm. If I stayed, I\u2019d be a good neighbor, but risk letting my team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me tonight."}
