I glanced at the line\u2014just three customers, but each one waiting for me to finish. I finally checked my phone during a lull. It was Sam, my best friend, frantic: \u201cI think I left my passport at home! My flight\u2019s in two hours. Can you check and bring it to the airport if it\u2019s there?\u201d My heart pounded. Sam had always been there for me, and I knew how much this trip meant. But I was the only cashier on shift, and my manager had just reminded me about the importance of accuracy and not leaving the register unattended. The customers eyed me, expecting quick service. Sam was counting on me, desperate. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
