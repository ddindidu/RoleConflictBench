The store was quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights the only sound. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name flashed across it. My stomach twisted. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke, and from the look on their face, I knew I\u2019d crossed a line. I needed to call, to explain, to apologize before the hurt festered. That\u2019s what friends do: we talk things out, we don\u2019t let misunderstandings grow.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, my eyes caught a small error in the register. The numbers didn\u2019t quite add up, and store policy was clear\u2014every discrepancy, no matter how minor, had to be reported and investigated immediately. My manager expected me to follow the rules, to put the job first while on the clock. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the urgency to fix things with my friend, and the responsibility to do my job right. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the two worlds, not sure which one needed me more in that moment."}
