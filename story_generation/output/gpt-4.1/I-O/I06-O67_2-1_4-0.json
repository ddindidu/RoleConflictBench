My mentor had always emphasized the importance of reaching out immediately if I hit a wall, and I could almost hear her voice urging me to send a message, to not let problems fester. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, drafting an email explaining the technical hurdle I couldn\u2019t solve alone. But every few seconds, my eyes darted to the radio on the wall, knowing that at any moment, a call could come in and I\u2019d have to drop everything, sprint to the ambulance, and race into the city\u2019s chaos. The pressure to be ready, to respond without delay, was drilled into me as an ambulance driver\u2014lives depended on it. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down. If I reached out to my mentor now, I risked being interrupted mid-conversation, appearing unreliable or distracted. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, hiding my struggle. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, caught between the urgent needs of two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
