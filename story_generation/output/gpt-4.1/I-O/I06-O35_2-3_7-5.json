My mentor had finally carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me\u2014a rare window in her packed schedule. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time, and I was already rehearsing my questions as the subway rumbled beneath the city. But then, the shrill emergency alarm blared through the train. Instinct took over; I was the operator, responsible for every soul on board. The intercom crackled with frantic voices\u2014someone needed urgent medical help in car three. My hands hovered over the controls, torn. If I responded immediately, I\u2019d miss the meeting and risk disappointing my mentor, maybe even losing her support. But if I delayed, a passenger\u2019s safety could be at stake. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of neglect. I stared at the emergency panel, my mind racing, caught between duty and aspiration, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
