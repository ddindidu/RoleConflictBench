The safety concerns are serious\u2014if I don\u2019t address them tonight, the plant could be shut down by morning. My mind races with possible solutions, regulations, and the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. Just then, I hear the front door open. My boyfriend walks in, shoulders slumped, eyes tired. He tries to smile, but I can tell something\u2019s off. I want to wrap him in my arms, listen to his day, and be the supportive girlfriend he needs. But my laptop is open, documents scattered, and my thoughts are tangled in engineering jargon and compliance codes. He sits beside me, quietly waiting, and I feel the pull in two directions\u2014one toward the man I love, who needs comfort, and the other toward the job that demands my immediate attention. My heart aches as I wrestle with the impossible choice: be present for him, or dive into the crisis that could define my career."}
