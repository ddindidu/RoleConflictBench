As a lifeguard, I knew I had to keep my eyes on every swimmer, especially the group of teens who kept drifting toward the deep end. My job demanded constant vigilance\u2014one moment of distraction could mean disaster. But then, my phone buzzed with a message from a friend, another lifeguard on break. She\u2019d heard a rumor about one of the swimmers, something that could ruin their reputation if it spread. As an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to shut down the gossip, to protect the person\u2019s privacy and dignity. But my friend was persistent, asking what I knew, expecting me to join in.
