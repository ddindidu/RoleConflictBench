As a cashier, I knew the end-of-shift deposit was non-negotiable\u2014every bill counted, every form signed, every step double-checked. The store manager had drilled it into us: no shortcuts, no delays, or the audit team would be on us in a heartbeat. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder for the team meeting upstairs. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to listen and contribute, especially since today\u2019s agenda included project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. I could already imagine the disappointed looks if I missed it, the subtle exclusion from future decisions. My hands shook as I sorted the cash, torn between the rigid procedures of my cashier role and the collaborative demands of my team. Both sides expected my full attention, both saw their needs as urgent. I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing through possible excuses, but knowing none would satisfy everyone.
