My mentee\u2019s voice trembled as she described her anxiety about the big interview tomorrow. As her mentor, I knew she needed reassurance, guidance\u2014my full attention. I wanted to encourage her, help her see her strengths, and offer last-minute advice that could make all the difference. But as I turned the corner, orange cones forced traffic into a single lane. Up ahead, a school zone sign flashed, and children clustered near the curb, their laughter piercing through the hum of engines. As a taxi driver, I was expected to drive defensively, obey every law, and keep my passengers and those children safe.
