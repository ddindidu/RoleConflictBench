I glanced at the screen\u2014Maya, my best friend, had sent a long message about her awful, dragging day at work. She needed me to listen, to be there for her, like always. I started typing a reply, but then I noticed the shelf was empty where the stainless-steel cleaner should be. Mrs. Lee was particular about her kitchen, and I knew she\u2019d be upset if I didn\u2019t use the right product. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Maya\u2019s words scrolled across my mind, her need for comfort tugging at me, but the clock was ticking and I had to manage the supplies before Mrs. Lee returned. I stood there, phone in one hand, supply list in the other, torn between being the friend Maya needed and the reliable cleaner Mrs. Lee expected.
