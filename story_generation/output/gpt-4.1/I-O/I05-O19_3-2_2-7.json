In fifteen minutes, my mentee, Sarah, would arrive, anxiously awaiting my guidance on whether she should accept a hospital residency or pursue a clinical research path. She\u2019d emailed me her questions, her worries, and I\u2019d promised her a thorough, structured discussion\u2014one that could shape her entire career. But at the same time, the local pharmacy association\u2019s workshop on the new prescription guidelines was starting. Missing it meant falling behind on crucial updates, risking my ability to counsel patients safely and confidently. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cWorkshop begins in 10 minutes.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014Sarah\u2019s trust in my mentorship, my duty to stay current as a pharmacist. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be present and insightful for Sarah, and the professional responsibility to keep my knowledge sharp for my patients. I stared at my calendar, feeling the pressure build, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
