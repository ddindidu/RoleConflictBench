They needed my input on the shared document before they could move forward, and I knew they were waiting. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the workflow smooth and show that I valued their time. But my sketchbook was open in front of me, pencil poised above the page. I was deep into designing a renovation layout for my tiny studio, trying to make every inch count. The ideas were flowing, and I could almost see the new space taking shape\u2014functional, simple, exactly what I needed. If I stopped now, I might lose the thread, but if I ignored my team any longer, I\u2019d be letting them down. My mind tugged in two directions, frustration simmering as I weighed the demands. I glanced between the blinking notification and the half-finished sketch, feeling the pressure build, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both roles at once."}
