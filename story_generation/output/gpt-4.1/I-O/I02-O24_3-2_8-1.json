Tomorrow\u2019s trial is one of the most complex I\u2019ve faced, and the final briefs demand my full attention. Every detail matters\u2014lives and livelihoods hang in the balance. Yet, my phone vibrates again. It\u2019s her. The argument we had earlier still echoes in my mind, sharp and raw. She\u2019s questioning if we should even stay together, and I know I can\u2019t just ignore her pain. As her boyfriend, I\u2019m supposed to resolve conflicts, to listen, to fight for us. But as a judge, I must be impartial, focused, and prepared. My heart aches with the weight of her words, but my mind is pulled back to the legal arguments in front of me. I feel torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding more than I have to give. I stare at the phone, then at the files, caught in the impossible space between duty and love, not knowing which to choose."}
