As a colleague, I knew my team expected me to finish my part on time, but the deadline was generous and the others could keep working without my section for now. My phone buzzed\u2014a call from dispatch. There was a car parked illegally outside the building, blocking a fire hydrant. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, and the rules were clear: issue a ticket. But when I stepped outside, I recognized the car. It belonged to a coworker who was rushing to meet a critical client. I could use my discretion and let it slide, just this once, especially since it wasn\u2019t causing an immediate hazard. But was that fair? Was I compromising my duty as an officer for the sake of a colleague? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, ticket book in hand, torn between what I owed my team and what I owed the badge."}
