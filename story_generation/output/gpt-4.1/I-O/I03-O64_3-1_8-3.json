There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a couple of dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to report it, fill out the paperwork, and wait for the inevitable questions. But my phone kept buzzing in my pocket. It was him\u2014my boyfriend. Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind, harsh words and accusations hanging between us. He wanted to talk, to resolve things, but I was stuck here, expected to be the perfect cashier, focused and precise. I felt torn in two, the pressure of my job colliding with the desperate need to fix what was breaking in my relationship. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding my attention, demanding a choice."}
