That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do\u2014face the conflict, not let it end with slammed doors and silence. But my phone buzzes again: a message from my team lead, reminding me about the project planning call starting in five minutes. They\u2019re counting on me to give accurate time estimates, to help shape the next sprint. I know the session is informal, and the timeline isn\u2019t set in stone, but I also know how much my input matters. I stare at the closed bedroom door, torn. If I join the call, I\u2019m leaving him alone with his doubts. If I stay, I let my team down. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014resolve the fight, or be the reliable engineer. I can\u2019t seem to breathe as the minutes tick by, and I still haven\u2019t moved."}
