As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute my thoughts before the final decisions were made. My team counted on my input, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But as the architect overseeing three different teams, my phone buzzed with urgent messages\u2014one team was stuck on a technical snag, another was behind schedule, and the third needed my sign-off to proceed. The project deadline loomed, and any delay could throw everything off course. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the need to be present and supportive for my colleagues, and the responsibility to keep the project moving smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the meeting and the crisis unfolding on the project floor. I could feel the tension building in my chest as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
