The task was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation, and my mentor had stressed its importance\u2014this was my chance to prove myself. Every few minutes, I glanced up, scanning the pool. A group of kids kept edging into the shallow end, giggling and splashing, no adult in sight. I knew the rules: no unsupervised swimmers, especially children. My supervisor expected vigilance, zero tolerance for rule-breaking. But every time I started typing, my attention was split. If I focused on the assignment, I risked missing a safety violation. If I enforced the rules, I\u2019d fall behind on the task my mentor was counting on. My heart pounded with the pressure of both roles, the weight of expectations pulling me in opposite directions. I could feel the eyes of my mentor and my supervisor, both waiting for me to prove I could handle responsibility. I stared at the screen, then at the pool, torn between two worlds, knowing I had to choose which demand to answer first."}
