As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor right away\u2014she always said to communicate any roadblocks immediately. But as a telemarketer, I was painfully aware of the ticking clock; I had just one hour left in my shift and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. Management had been clear: no excuses, just results. My phone headset felt heavier than usual, and my fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting an email to my mentor and dialing the next number on my call list. If I paused to explain the technical issue, I\u2019d lose precious minutes, maybe even my chance to hit my target. But if I ignored the problem, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, betraying her trust in my honesty and communication. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull of two roles demanding my full attention at the same time."}
