Everything feels pointless.\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to let him vent, maybe even to offer a few words of comfort. That\u2019s what friends do, and Jamie had always been there for me. But as I started to type a reply, my email pinged. The attorney in tomorrow\u2019s hearing had just sent over a new appellate court decision, one that could shift the entire direction of the case. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to be thorough, to stay current, to ensure every ruling is grounded in the latest law. The clock was ticking; I needed to read and analyze the decision before morning. My thumb hovered over Jamie\u2019s message, guilt prickling at me. I wanted to be the friend he deserved, but the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed down, demanding my focus. I stared at the two screens, torn between the comfort of a friend and the duty of the bench, feeling the tension knot in my chest."}
