As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, especially now, with the noise complaint making everyone tense. Mrs. Kim from 402 was already there, her polite smile a little too tight. I knew I had to be extra courteous, maybe even apologize on behalf of the floor, even though I wasn\u2019t the one making noise. But my telemarketer side nagged at me\u2014I was on a scheduled break, and my supervisor had said I could take it now since calls were slow. If I stayed too long, I\u2019d risk missing the next window and falling behind on my call quota. If I left too soon, I\u2019d seem rude, maybe even suspicious, to my neighbors. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectation to be a good neighbor with the pressure to stick to my work schedule. I could feel both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, unsure which demand to meet first."}
