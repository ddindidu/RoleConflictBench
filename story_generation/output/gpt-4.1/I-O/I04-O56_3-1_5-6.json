It was Mia, my best friend, her voice shaky as she told me her car had broken down on the highway. She was alone, scared, and needed me to come get her right away. My heart twisted\u2014I wanted to drop everything and rush to her side. But in my chair sat Mrs. Patel, who had just arrived for her appointment. She smiled and told me she\u2019d washed her hair at home, so I could skip the wash and get straight to the cut. But as a professional, I\u2019m expected to always wash and condition clients\u2019 hair myself, to ensure it\u2019s perfectly prepped and to maintain salon standards. If I skipped this step, I\u2019d be breaking protocol and risking my reputation. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be making Mia wait, alone and frightened. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. My hands trembled as I tried to decide what to do next."}
