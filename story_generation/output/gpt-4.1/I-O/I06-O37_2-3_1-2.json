My mentor had been clear: \u201cI want to see your progress at our next meeting. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to prove I was serious about learning. But as I typed, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014today was my deep cleaning shift. The house manager expected every corner spotless, every surface sanitized. I could already hear her voice: \u201cNo shortcuts. We have guests tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMy mind raced. If I focused on the code, I\u2019d fall behind on cleaning, risking complaints or even losing my job. But if I prioritized cleaning, I\u2019d disappoint my mentor and maybe lose her trust. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait. I felt torn, anxious, and guilty, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both. My hands hovered over the keyboard, but my eyes drifted to the cleaning supplies waiting in the corner, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
