There\u2019s a term in the new policy document I don\u2019t quite understand. It\u2019s not urgent, but I know I\u2019m supposed to communicate any confusion right away. My finger hovers over the send button, but my police radio crackles to life. \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and Fifth. Immediate response required.\u201d My heart pounds. I\u2019m on duty, and every second counts. I know what\u2019s expected of me as a police officer\u2014drop everything, respond, protect lives. But as a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to be open and proactive, not let questions pile up. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the need to be a good mentee clashing with the urgency of my badge. My mind races, torn between the quiet responsibility to my mentor and the blaring siren of duty outside. I can\u2019t do both at once."}
