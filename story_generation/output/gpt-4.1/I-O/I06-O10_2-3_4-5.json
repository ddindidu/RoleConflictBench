As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor and let her know about the technical hurdle blocking my progress. She always emphasized open communication, and I could almost hear her voice reminding me that no problem was too small to share. But just as I was about to draft an email, my phone buzzed\u2014a notification from the tax authority. My heart sank. As the accountant for our small firm, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail was compliant. The notice flagged a discrepancy in last quarter\u2019s filings and demanded an immediate response. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the expectation to be transparent and proactive with my mentor, and the urgent duty to protect the company from potential penalties. My mind raced, torn between the need to ask for help and the obligation to fix a critical financial issue. I sat frozen, anxiety building, unsure which responsibility to address first."}
