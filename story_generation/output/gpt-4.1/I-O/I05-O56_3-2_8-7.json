My mentee, Sarah, sat across from me, her eyes wide with anxiety as she described the high-stakes project her boss had just assigned. She needed guidance, reassurance, and a push to believe in herself. I wanted to be fully present, to help her see her strengths and encourage her to take this leap for her career. But as she spoke, I noticed her hair\u2014damp and greasy from her rushed gym session. In my other role as her hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition her hair before we started the cut she\u2019d booked. The salon was busy, and my next client was already waiting. I felt torn: should I pause our mentoring conversation to fulfill my professional duty as a hairdresser, or should I ignore the state of her hair and focus on her emotional needs? The expectations of both roles clashed inside me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor first."}
