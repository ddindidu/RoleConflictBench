I\u2019m free all week, just want to see you.\u201d My heart warms\u2014he\u2019s been looking forward to this, and so have I. We promised to make more time for each other, to not let work always come first. But as I start to type a reply, my headset crackles. \u201cSector boundary handoff in two minutes,\u201d my colleague reminds me. I check the radar: Flight 482 is approaching the edge of my airspace, and I need to coordinate with the next controller to ensure a seamless handoff. It\u2019s routine, but timing is everything.
