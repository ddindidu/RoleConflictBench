The line snakes down the aisle, and I can feel the impatience in the air. My manager expects me to keep things moving and stay cheerful, even when I\u2019m tired. Suddenly, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s Jamie, my best friend, texting frantically: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I know Jamie\u2019s been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there if they needed anything. But right now, I\u2019m trapped behind the register, with a dozen hungry shoppers waiting for their lunch break groceries. My heart twists as I glance at the phone, torn between the friend who needs me and the customers who expect my attention. I can feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing as I try to figure out what to do."}
