The store was quiet, just a handful of people waiting, but my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I knew it was my team at the office, waiting for my response to a question that would let them move forward with our project. I could almost picture them, eyes on their screens, growing impatient as the minutes ticked by. At the same time, the customer in front of me smiled politely, expecting me to focus on ringing up her items and handling her payment without mistakes. My manager always reminded us that accuracy was everything\u2014one wrong scan, and the till would be off at the end of the day. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the responsibility to my colleagues and the duty to the customers in front of me. My hand hovered over the register, my mind racing with the knowledge that someone would be disappointed, no matter what I chose."}
