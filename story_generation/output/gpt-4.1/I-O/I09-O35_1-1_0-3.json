She smiled warmly, and I returned the gesture, exchanging a quick hello as we always do. I know she appreciates these small courtesies, and I try to be the kind of neighbor who\u2019s friendly and approachable. Later, as I settled into my shift as a subway operator, I heard a familiar voice over the intercom\u2014Mrs. Kim, asking for directions to the transfer line. She sounded a bit flustered. My job requires me to remain professional and impartial, offering clear, concise instructions to all passengers. But I could sense her anxiety, and the neighbor in me wanted to offer extra reassurance, maybe even step out of the booth to guide her personally. Yet, I knew I couldn\u2019t show favoritism or leave my post. The pressure of balancing my duty to all passengers with my instinct to help a neighbor weighed on me, and I hesitated, torn between the expectations of my two roles."}
