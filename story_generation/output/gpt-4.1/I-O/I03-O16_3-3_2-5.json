My phone buzzed with a message from Alex: \u201cCan you come home? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d barely spoken since his brother died last night, and I knew he needed me to hold him, to listen, to just be there.

Mrs. Patel\u2019s test results were back, and I was the one who had to tell her family the news they\u2019d been dreading. I could already picture their faces, the hope in their eyes, the way they\u2019d look to me for answers and comfort. I was supposed to be strong, clear, and compassionate for them.
