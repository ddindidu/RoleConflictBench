My partner\u2019s messages were desperate, raw with pain after losing his father last night. He needed me\u2014my words, my comfort, my presence. I wanted to drop everything, to call him, to be the shoulder he could lean on. But the clang of machinery snapped me back.

I felt torn, my throat tight, caught between the person I loved and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
