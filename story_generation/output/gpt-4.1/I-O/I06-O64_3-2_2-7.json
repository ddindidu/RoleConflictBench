The line stretched past the bakery, and every customer seemed to want a chat or needed help finding something. My manager had reminded me just this morning: \u201cFriendly service, always.\u201d But my mind kept drifting to the assignment my mentor had given me\u2014an analysis that had to be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice: \u201cThis is your chance to show initiative. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d Each beep of the scanner felt like a countdown, every friendly exchange with a customer a reminder of the time slipping away. I tried to focus on the shoppers, but anxiety gnawed at me. Should I rush through the line, risking my reputation as a helpful cashier, or keep up the cheerful service and risk disappointing my mentor? My heart pounded as I handed a receipt to the next customer, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet."}
