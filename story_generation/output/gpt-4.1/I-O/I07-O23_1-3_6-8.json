It was from a colleague, just a quick note about an upcoming meeting\u2014nothing urgent, she said, but she liked to keep everyone in the loop. I knew she expected a timely reply, even if just a thumbs-up. That was the culture here: responsive, supportive, always present. But my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed again, this time with a call from opposing counsel. He was persistent, pressing for details about my client\u2019s case\u2014details I was ethically bound to protect. The pressure was mounting; he hinted that a little transparency could smooth negotiations, but I knew the line I couldn\u2019t cross. My inbox blinked with another gentle reminder from my colleague, while my conscience weighed the gravity of my silence with opposing counsel. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding collegial responsiveness, the other unwavering confidentiality. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which expectation to meet first, knowing that either choice would leave someone waiting, or worse, disappointed."}
