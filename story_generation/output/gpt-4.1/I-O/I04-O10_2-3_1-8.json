It was Jamie, my closest friend, her voice trembling. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d she said, barely holding back tears. I could hear the pain in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to help her untangle the mess of her argument with her partner. But on my desk, the red-flagged invoice glared at me\u2014a supplier threatening to cut us off if I didn\u2019t resolve the payment immediately. My boss had emailed twice already, expecting a quick response. I felt my chest tighten. Jamie needed my empathy and undivided attention, but my job demanded urgency and focus. I wanted to be the friend she could count on, but I also couldn\u2019t risk jeopardizing the company\u2019s operations. My mind raced, torn between the comfort I owed my friend and the responsibility I owed my employer, both expecting me to be fully present, right now."}
