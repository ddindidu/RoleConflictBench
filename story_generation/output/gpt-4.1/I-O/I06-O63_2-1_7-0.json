My mentor, who rarely had free time, had carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me. I knew how much she valued punctuality and focus\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that respecting her time was non-negotiable. But as the clock ticked closer to our meeting, my headset buzzed. Another call. As a telemarketer, I was expected to answer every ring, handle objections, and never let a customer feel ignored. Most days, the calls were routine, with questions I could answer in my sleep, but today, every second felt like a tug-of-war. If I let the call go, I\u2019d risk my stats and maybe even my job. If I took it, I\u2019d be late for my mentor, disrespecting the one person investing in my growth. My hands hovered over the mouse, torn between the blinking call and the meeting invite, my mind racing with guilt and anxiety, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
