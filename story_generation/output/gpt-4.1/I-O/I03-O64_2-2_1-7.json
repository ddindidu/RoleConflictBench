He\u2019d just texted me about the harsh feedback from his boss, and I knew he needed comfort\u2014my words, my touch, my undivided attention. But the lunch rush was in full swing, and the line of customers stretched past the bakery display. My manager had already reminded me twice to keep things moving and stay cheerful. \n\nAs Alex reached the front, I wanted to step out from behind the counter, to hug him, to tell him it would be okay. But the woman behind him was already sighing impatiently, and the man two spots back was checking his watch. I forced a bright smile, my voice chipper as I greeted him like any other customer, my heart twisting with guilt. I could see the hurt flicker in his eyes, and I felt torn\u2014torn between being the girlfriend he needed and the cashier I was expected to be. My hands shook as I rang up his sandwich, my mind racing, caught between the demands of my job and the needs of someone I loved."}
