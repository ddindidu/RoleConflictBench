The code sample was due in three days, and I hadn\u2019t even started. My mentor expected me to show progress, to ask questions, to be prepared. But right now, I was in the middle of my morning rounds at the hospital, the blood pressure cuff in my hand, moving from one patient to the next. Each patient depended on me to be attentive, to record their vitals accurately, to notice if something was wrong. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust in my learning, my patients\u2019 trust in my care. As I wrapped the cuff around Mrs. Lee\u2019s arm, my mind kept drifting to lines of code and looming deadlines. I tried to focus, but the anxiety gnawed at me. How could I be present for my patients when my mind was tangled in unfinished assignments? How could I meet my mentor\u2019s expectations when every minute was spoken for by my nursing duties? The pressure built inside me, and I stood there, torn, the stethoscope cold in my hand, not knowing which role to serve first."}
