The departmental meeting was looming, and I still hadn\u2019t finished compiling the preliminary data summaries. My notes were scattered, and I knew the faculty expected clear, accurate reports. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the stack of articles my mentor had suggested last week. They weren\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed and eager to learn. She\u2019d mentioned the readings were optional, with a loose deadline, but I sensed she\u2019d be disappointed if I didn\u2019t at least start them soon. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me desperate to meet the high standards of my scientific peers, the other anxious not to let down the person guiding my growth. My heart pounded as I glanced between the unread articles and the unfinished data charts, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to tackle first."}
