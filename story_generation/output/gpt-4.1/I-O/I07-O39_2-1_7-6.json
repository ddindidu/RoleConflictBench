The team was waiting for my input on the project plan, and I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified a few details. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d respond quickly, as I always tried to do. But the noise of the construction site pressed in around me\u2014shouts, the clang of metal, the constant hum of machinery. My foreman had just posted a notice about an optional training session next week, and he\u2019d made it clear that those who attended would be seen as more committed to the team. I wanted to show I was dedicated, not just another guy punching the clock. But I also didn\u2019t want to let my office team down. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both worlds pulling at me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be fully present. I stood there, torn, the decision looming over me, unsure which role I was about to disappoint."}
