Instinctively, I wanted to go over, offer a tissue, and ask if she was okay. I knew she\u2019d appreciate a friendly ear, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or indifferent. But just as I took a step toward her, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I needed to send a formal reply to a vendor\u2019s payment confirmation within the next ten minutes. As the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m expected to be prompt and professional, and I knew the finance manager was waiting for my response. I stood there, torn between the urge to comfort Jamie and the pressure to fulfill my work duties. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I weighed the expectations of being a caring acquaintance against the demands of my role as an accountant."}
