The deadline was tomorrow, and she\u2019d made it clear how important it was for my evaluation. My phone buzzed, jolting me from my thoughts. Dispatch: \u201cAmbulance 3, respond to a possible fracture, 5th and Main.\u201d I felt my heart rate spike. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to drop everything and get to the scene fast\u2014someone was counting on me. But the report still glared at me from the screen, half-done, my mentor\u2019s words echoing in my mind: \u201cThis is your chance to show upper management what you can do.\u201d I glanced at the clock, then at the call details. If I left now, I\u2019d be doing my duty as a driver, but the report would remain unfinished. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a patient in pain. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from opposite sides."}
