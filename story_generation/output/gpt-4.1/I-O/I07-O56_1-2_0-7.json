As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was engaged with the team\u2014even if it was just a routine catch-up. But as a hairdresser, I had a client already in my chair, her hair damp with sweat from her gym session, strands sticking to her forehead. She looked at me expectantly, waiting for the wash and condition she\u2019d booked. I could see the slight discomfort in her eyes, probably hoping I\u2019d make her feel fresh and pampered. My manager always emphasized the importance of not rushing this part, making clients feel cared for. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d seem disengaged; if I rushed the wash, I\u2019d let my client down. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between my team\u2019s expectations and my client\u2019s trust in my care."}
