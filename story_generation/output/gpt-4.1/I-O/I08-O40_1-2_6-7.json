A few coworkers were discussing the recent changes our colleague, Mr. Lee, had made to the office layout. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but the group was eager for my opinion. They nudged me, expecting me to join in, maybe even share some inside knowledge since I\u2019d helped with the renovations.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a homeowner. Their deck was in bad shape, and as a carpenter, I knew I needed to get over there soon to assess the damage and start repairs. The expectation was clear: fix the deck, restore its safety and beauty. But here I was, caught between two worlds\u2014one demanding my professional attention, the other pressing me to participate in a conversation I\u2019d rather avoid. My mind raced, torn between the urge to escape the gossip and the responsibility to my craft, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
