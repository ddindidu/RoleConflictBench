She was standing by the fence, her shoulders shaking, tears streaming down her face. Instinctively, I wanted to go over, offer a kind word, maybe just listen\u2014after all, that\u2019s what a decent acquaintance should do. But as I stood up, I caught sight of a slick, shiny puddle right in the middle of the walkway where the crew would be returning any minute. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cAny spill, no matter how small, gets cleaned up right away. Safety first.\u201d I felt torn, my feet rooted to the spot. Lisa needed someone, but so did my team\u2014if someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. My heart pounded as I glanced between her and the spill, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
