Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d My heart tugs\u2014I want to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like a good girlfriend should. But just as I\u2019m about to reply, the salon door swings open. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids bustle in, all nerves and chatter, twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Their anxious eyes land on me, expecting warmth and calm. I force a bright smile, welcoming them, but my mind is split. I know Alex needs me, maybe just a quick call or a hug, but these clients expect my full attention, my best work, and a soothing presence. My chest tightens as I juggle the urge to comfort Alex and the professional duty to ease the bridal party\u2019s nerves. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both expectations presses down, leaving me frozen for a moment, torn between love and responsibility."}
