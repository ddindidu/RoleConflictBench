I miss you.\u201d My heart warms, remembering our promise to spend more time together this week. We finally have evenings free, and I want to make it special\u2014just us, no distractions. But as I start to reply, my taxi app pings. A passenger, flagged as urgent, is waiting across town. The app flashes: \u201cHurry, passenger waiting. High priority.\u201d I know what\u2019s expected of me\u2014professionalism, punctuality, a reliable ride. My rating depends on it, and so does my income. I stare at the two screens, feeling the weight of both worlds. My boyfriend wants my time, my attention, my love. My job demands my speed, my focus, my responsibility. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both need me now. My chest tightens as I try to decide which role to answer first, torn between the promise of love and the call of duty."}
