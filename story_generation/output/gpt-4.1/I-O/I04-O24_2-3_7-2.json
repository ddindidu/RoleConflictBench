His reply was curt, almost cold\u2014he\u2019d clearly misread the tone of my earlier text. I could feel the tension in his words, and my heart sank. I knew I needed to call him right away, to explain, to clear the air before the misunderstanding grew roots. That\u2019s what friends do: we talk things out, we don\u2019t let silence fester.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my clerk rushed in, breathless.
