Instinctively, I wanted to go over, sit beside her, and offer comfort\u2014just like I would have years ago. But before I could move, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases behind them. They waved me down, asking if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare to the airport. \n\nAs a taxi driver, I knew I needed to stay professional, keep the meter running, and help with their luggage efficiently. But as an acquaintance, I felt a pull to check on Jamie, to be the friendly, approachable person she might need right now. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to provide prompt, courteous service to my customers and the urge to support someone I cared about, even if only distantly. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which role I should step into next."}
