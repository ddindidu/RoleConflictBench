She had that eager look in her eyes, notebook in hand, ready to jot down every tip I could offer. She asked about blending techniques, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014I wanted to give her the best advice, to share everything I\u2019d learned over the years. But just as I started explaining, I caught sight of my new client in the mirror. She was frowning, tilting her head, clearly unhappy with the colour I\u2019d just finished applying. My heart sank. I knew I needed to check in with her, reassure her, and fix whatever was wrong. But Mia was waiting, pen poised, and I could see how much she valued these moments. I felt torn, pulled between being the supportive mentor Mia needed and the attentive hairdresser my client expected. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to be both at once, feeling the pressure of not wanting to let either of them down."}
