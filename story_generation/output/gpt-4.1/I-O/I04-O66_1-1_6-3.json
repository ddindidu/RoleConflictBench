We\u2019d had a weird conversation last night, and I knew I needed to clear things up\u2014Sam hated being left in the dark. As a friend, I owed him a quick, honest reply to avoid another misunderstanding. But right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the back, and the light had just turned green. The road was clear, and the speed limit was normal, but I knew the rules: no texting while driving, always keep my eyes on the road. My passenger trusted me to get them to their destination safely. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Sam would think I was ignoring him, maybe even that I was still upset. But as a taxi driver, I couldn\u2019t risk a glance, not even at a red light. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between being the reliable friend Sam needed and the responsible driver my passenger expected."}
