She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially since the building was expecting a power interruption. As her neighbor, I wanted to help\u2014after all, we always look out for each other. But as I entered her apartment to check for deliveries, I realized I hadn\u2019t brought my gloves or mask, which I\u2019m required to wear as part of my cleaning job. The protocols are strict: no exceptions, even for a quick favor. I could see a package just inside her door, but I hesitated. If I went in without my protective gear, I\u2019d be breaking the rules and risking my job. But if I left the package, it might get damaged or stolen, and I\u2019d be letting Mrs. Lee down. My mind raced, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible cleaner, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
