As a colleague, I was expected to join and actively participate\u2014today\u2019s agenda included crucial project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared in any other way. Missing it meant falling behind, maybe even letting my teammates down. But as a telemarketer, my break was strictly scheduled, and management watched our logs like hawks. The phone queue was always full, and if I took an unscheduled break, it would be noticed immediately. I could already imagine the supervisor\u2019s email about adherence and the impact on our call stats. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: loyalty to my team versus my responsibility to the call center\u2019s rigid schedule. I felt torn, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. The meeting invite blinked on my screen, and my break timer ticked away, each second tightening the knot in my stomach."}
