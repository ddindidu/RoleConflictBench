My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our scheduled video call\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she needed my guidance. I\u2019d promised to help her rehearse answers, boost her confidence, and talk through her anxieties. She was counting on me to be present, to encourage her, to help her grow. But as I hurried down the apartment hallway, the package in my hands reminded me of my other responsibility. The customer I was about to meet had left a note: \u201cPlease deliver between 2:00 and 2:15. Important meeting after.\u201d It was 2:07. I knew I had to be polite, professional, and on time\u2014my job depended on it. My phone buzzed again: Sarah\u2019s nervous message. I felt torn, pulled between being the mentor she needed and the reliable delivery person my customer expected. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest. I stood outside the customer\u2019s door, phone in one hand, package in the other, caught between two worlds and unsure which to let down."}
