Can we talk later?\u201d I know he needs me, probably just to listen, maybe to reassure him that things will be okay. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do\u2014be there, emotionally, when he\u2019s feeling off. But as I tuck my phone away, my supervisor\u2019s voice cuts through the noise, reminding me about the stack of materials that needs moving before the shift ends. The pile is heavy, and the storage area is on the far side of the site. If I don\u2019t get it done, I\u2019ll be letting the team down, maybe even risking my job. My hands ache from the morning\u2019s work, and my mind is already tired, but I can\u2019t ignore either responsibility. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014my boyfriend\u2019s quiet need for comfort, and the unyielding demands of the site. My heart pounds as I weigh what to do next, caught between the person I love and the job I can\u2019t afford to lose."}
