It was Mia, someone I\u2019d met at a neighbor\u2019s gathering a few weeks ago. She messaged, \u201cHey! You know the area well, right? Can you recommend a good restaurant for dinner tonight?\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt I should respond quickly and helpfully\u2014after all, that\u2019s what friends, even casual ones, do. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was on the clock, expected to keep the house spotless and not get distracted. My supervisor had already mentioned that the living room needed extra attention today, and I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. I stared at my phone, feeling the pressure from both sides: the urge to be helpful and friendly, and the responsibility to do my job thoroughly. My hands hovered over the phone, torn between sending a quick reply and focusing on the dust cloth in my other hand."}
