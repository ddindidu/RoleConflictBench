Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, was struggling with her groceries near our shared door, and I could see the frustration on her face. I knew she expected me to keep my dog calm and respect the peace in our building. At the same time, my phone buzzed\u2014a passenger had requested a ride to the train station, and their train was leaving in less than half an hour. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt and reliable, especially when someone\u2019s travel plans were at stake. I felt torn, standing there with my keys in one hand and my dog\u2019s leash in the other. Should I stay and soothe my dog, making sure I didn\u2019t let down my neighbor, or rush out to pick up my passenger, risking another complaint about the noise? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the hallway and the open road."}
