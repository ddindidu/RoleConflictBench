As a colleague, I knew I had to finish this report by noon\u2014if I didn\u2019t, the next person in the workflow would be stuck, and the whole team\u2019s project would stall. I could already imagine the disappointment in my teammate\u2019s voice, the subtle frustration in tomorrow\u2019s meeting. But my phone buzzed again: a notification from the delivery app. A customer was waiting for their groceries, and the time window was closing fast. If I didn\u2019t leave now, they\u2019d be left without dinner ingredients, and my rating as a delivery person would take a hit. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my team counting on me to keep things moving, and a customer depending on me for something as basic as a meal. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my bag already packed by the door. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between two worlds, each demanding I be there, right now."}
