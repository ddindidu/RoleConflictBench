The rain drums steadily on the windshield, blurring the city lights. My boyfriend sits beside me, his suitcase wedged between his knees. It\u2019s our last weekend together before he leaves for months, and I promised we\u2019d make every moment count. He reaches for my hand, his thumb tracing circles on my skin, and I feel the weight of his expectation\u2014he wants me present, attentive, not just physically but emotionally. But the road is slick, and cars dart unpredictably in and out of lanes. My other role takes over: I\u2019m a taxi driver, responsible for our safety, for following every rule, for anticipating every sudden stop. I can\u2019t let my guard down, not even for a second. He sighs, sensing my distraction, and I feel the tension coil tighter inside me. I want to turn to him, to reassure him, to be the girlfriend he needs right now. But my eyes flick to the rearview mirror, scanning for hazards, my mind split between the love in the passenger seat and the dangers outside."}
