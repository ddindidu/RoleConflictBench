My heart thudded. If I didn\u2019t act fast, there could be a hazardous leak\u2014protocol demanded my full attention. I grabbed my checklist, already running through the emergency steps in my mind, when my phone buzzed. It was an email from a colleague, marked \u201cinformational\u2014no immediate action required.\u201d Still, our team values quick responses, and I knew she\u2019d expect at least a brief acknowledgment within the hour. I could almost hear her voice in my head, reminding me how important it is to stay connected and responsive, even for non-urgent matters.
