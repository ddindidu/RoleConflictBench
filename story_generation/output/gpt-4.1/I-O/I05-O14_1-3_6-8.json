She confessed she was overwhelmed, missing deadlines, and unsure how to prioritize her work. As her mentor, I wanted to sit with her, help her map out a plan, and reassure her that growth comes with struggle. But just as I was about to offer advice, my own phone buzzed with an urgent alert from the lab. The gas chromatograph was issuing warning signals\u2014if not addressed immediately, it could leak hazardous chemicals. As the lead scientist, I was responsible for the safety of everyone in the lab and the integrity of our research. I could see Maya needed me, but so did the lab. My mind raced, torn between nurturing her development and fulfilling my duty to prevent a potential disaster. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds."}
