I\u2019m free all week.\u201d I could almost hear her excitement, and I wanted to match it. We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and I knew how much she valued our time together. But as I started to type a reply, my mind drifted back to the hospital. There was a patient\u2014Mr. Lee\u2014whose symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern. I\u2019d spent hours reviewing his charts, running tests, and still, nothing made sense. The pressure to find an answer weighed on me; his family was counting on me, and so was he.\n\nI felt torn. Mia deserved my attention, laughter, and presence. But Mr. Lee needed my focus, my expertise, and maybe even my late nights. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions\u2014one toward love and connection, the other toward duty and responsibility. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time. My fingers hovered over my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
