The holiday rush was in full swing, and I knew the approach fixes were already stacked with holding patterns. My mind was half on the airspace, half on the coffee in my hand, when Mark, an acquaintance from another shift, slid into the seat beside me. He leaned in, voice low. \u201cDid you see how badly Sarah botched that handoff yesterday? She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d \n\nI felt a jolt of discomfort. As an acquaintance, I tried to avoid gossip, to keep things neutral and professional. But as an air traffic controller, I was already bracing for the next wave of planes, knowing that any mistake\u2014Sarah\u2019s or anyone\u2019s\u2014could ripple through the system and make my job even harder. Mark\u2019s words hung in the air, and I could feel the expectation to either agree or defend, to join in or shut it down. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message: \u201cPrepare for increased holding.\u201d My mind raced, torn between the demands of camaraderie and the relentless pressure of the radar screen."}
