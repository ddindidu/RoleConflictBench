As a judge, I was expected to stay current with every legal development, and now an attorney had cited a brand-new appellate decision that could shift the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I needed to read it thoroughly, analyze its implications, and be ready to rule impartially. But my phone buzzed with a message from a friend\u2014someone I knew only casually, but who trusted me enough to confide a sensitive secret about a mutual acquaintance. The information was damaging, something that could easily spiral into gossip if repeated. I felt the urge to process what I\u2019d heard, maybe even warn someone, but I knew my role as an acquaintance demanded discretion and kindness, not rumor-mongering. Yet, my mind kept drifting back to the legal brief on my desk, the expectation that I would be fully prepared, unbiased, and focused. The two roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding empathy and silence, the other requiring my undivided attention and professional rigor. I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of friendship and the duties of the bench, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
