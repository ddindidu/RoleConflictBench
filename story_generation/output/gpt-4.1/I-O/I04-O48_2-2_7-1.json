I glanced at the screen and saw a message from my friend, Sarah. Her words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. I thought you understood me.\u201d My heart dropped. She\u2019d misread my earlier text, and I knew if I didn\u2019t call her right away, the misunderstanding would only grow. But Mr. Lee was waiting, his face anxious, his movements slow and unsteady. He needed my full attention to make sure he didn\u2019t fall or hurt himself. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014Sarah expecting me to be the friend who always listens and explains, Mr. Lee relying on me to be the steady, caring nursing assistant. My mind raced, torn between the urge to fix things with Sarah and the responsibility to keep my patient safe. I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two people who needed me in completely different ways."}
