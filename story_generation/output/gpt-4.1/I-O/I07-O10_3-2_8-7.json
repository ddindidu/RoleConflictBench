They needed me to confirm details for an external partner, and I knew they expected a prompt reply. As a colleague, I prided myself on being responsive, never letting messages linger. But just as I started typing my response, my desk phone rang. It was a client, sounding anxious, asking about a confusing line item on their latest invoice. As the accountant, I was responsible for clear, timely communication with clients and vendors, and I could hear the frustration in their voice. I glanced at the blinking cursor on my half-written email, feeling the pressure mount. Both sides needed me\u2014my team for a quick answer, my client for clarity and reassurance. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a reliable colleague and the duty to support our clients. I could feel my heart pounding, caught in the middle, knowing that whichever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
