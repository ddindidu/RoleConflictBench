It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her voice frantic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home! Can you check and bring it to the airport if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift had just started, and my supervisor had already reminded us about the importance of not missing calls. Most days, the job was routine: answer questions, follow the script, keep the customers happy. But now, my mind raced. Jamie had always been there for me, and I knew how much this trip meant to her. At the same time, I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s disappointment if I left my desk, even for a few minutes. My headset felt heavier than usual as I stared at the blinking phone line, torn between the urgent need of a friend and the steady expectations of my job. My heart pounded as I weighed loyalty against responsibility, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
