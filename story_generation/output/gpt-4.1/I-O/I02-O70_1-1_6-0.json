As her boyfriend, I always tried to be the one who smoothed things over, who made sure we were on the same page. But just as I was about to dial her number, my work phone buzzed. The dispatcher\u2019s message was clear: \u201cPackage for 14B just arrived\u2014customer requested ASAP delivery. Please confirm drop-off within the hour.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I left now, I could make the delivery on time, keep my record spotless, and avoid any complaints. But that meant putting off the call with Mia, letting her stew in uncertainty a little longer.
