The first is from QA: \u201cProduction outage\u2014urgent! Users can\u2019t log in. Looks like it\u2019s your module.\u201d My stomach drops. I know how critical this is; every minute down means angry customers and a stern meeting with my manager. I open my laptop, heart pounding, already scanning through error logs in my mind.\n\nThen I see the second message. It\u2019s from Jamie, my closest friend. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. I thought you cared.\u201d My last text must have come off cold, and now Jamie\u2019s hurt. I know I should call right now, explain, and fix this before it festers. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air.\n\nBut the outage is a five-alarm fire. My team and our users are counting on me to fix this, fast. My hands hover over my phone and keyboard, torn. I can\u2019t do both at once. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014be a good friend, be a responsible developer. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
