He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback from his boss, and I could feel his disappointment radiating off him. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around him, listen, and reassure him that he was more than his job. But as I reached for his hand, a sudden commotion caught my attention. Out in the deep end, a small child flailed, clearly out of their depth\u2014right where swimming was strictly off-limits. My heart lurched. I knew I had to act, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. But Alex\u2019s pain anchored me to the bench. I could see the expectation in his eyes, needing me to stay, to be present for him. At the same time, the lifeguard in me screamed to intervene, to protect. I felt torn in two, caught between the person I loved and the duty I owed to every swimmer in the pool."}
