As an air traffic controller, I was trained to keep calm, to prioritize safety above all else. Suddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through, tense and clipped: \u201cMayday, mayday, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart thudded. Every second counted. But beside me, my trainee, Sarah, looked at me with wide, anxious eyes. She was in the middle of her first solo critical task, and I was supposed to guide her, let her handle the situation, and only step in if absolutely necessary. She needed to learn, to build confidence, but the stakes were terrifyingly high. My mind raced\u2014should I take over, ensuring the pilot\u2019s safety, or let Sarah try, risking a mistake but fulfilling my duty as her mentor? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, my hands hovering over the controls, torn between the desperate pilot and the hopeful trainee, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left behind."}
