She\u2019d been struggling with her project, and I promised to help her break it down step by step. As a mentor, I felt responsible for her progress, and I could see how much she depended on my guidance. But just as I was about to step away for our meeting, I noticed a small discrepancy in my register\u2014ten dollars off, not enough to affect the day\u2019s total, but still a violation of store policy if left unreported. As a cashier, I was expected to follow every procedure to the letter, no exceptions. My manager had made it clear: accuracy and honesty above all. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my mentee\u2019s anxious messages pinging on my phone, the register\u2019s numbers glaring at me. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
