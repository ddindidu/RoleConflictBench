As a colleague, I was expected to join in, share updates, and show I was part of the team\u2014even if today\u2019s meeting was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded for anyone who missed it. I logged in, ready to listen, when a swim instructor rushed in, breathless. \u201cThe lane rope\u2019s snapped. Swim lessons start in ten minutes.\u201d My heart sank. As the lifeguard, it was my job to keep the pool safe and the equipment in order. If I didn\u2019t fix the rope now, the lessons would be chaotic, maybe even unsafe. But if I left the meeting, I\u2019d look unreliable to my colleagues, like I didn\u2019t care about the team. I stared at the screen, hearing my manager\u2019s voice, while the broken rope waited outside. The pressure built inside me, torn between being a dependable teammate and a responsible lifeguard, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
