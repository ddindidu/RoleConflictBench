My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014Jenna, my mentee, had messaged again. She\u2019d been missing deadlines, and during our last check-in, I\u2019d promised to help her map out a better schedule. I could hear the uncertainty in her voice, the way she hesitated before admitting she was overwhelmed. As her mentor, I wanted to be there, to encourage her, to help her grow and not let her down.\n\nSuddenly, the site-wide evacuation alarm blared, jolting me from my thoughts.
