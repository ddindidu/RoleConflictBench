We\u2019d just had a spat about our weekend plans\u2014he thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with him, but I\u2019d forgotten about a work commitment. As his girlfriend, I knew he expected me to smooth things over, to reassure him that he mattered most. But as I stood in the middle of the crowded networking event, a colleague leaned in, lowering her voice, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story with your new client? I heard it\u2019s juicy.\u201d \n\nMy mind raced. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, and even a hint of information could cross a line. Yet, I could see Alex\u2019s name flashing on my phone, waiting for a response that would calm his worries. The pressure built inside me\u2014one part of me wanted to step outside, call Alex, and fix things; the other part knew I had to stay composed, professional, and silent about my work. I felt torn, the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, heart pounding, unsure which demand to answer first."}
