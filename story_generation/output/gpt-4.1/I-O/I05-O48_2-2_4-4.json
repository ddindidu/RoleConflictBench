As a mentor, I had spent hours preparing a session for the new trainees, determined to share the skills they\u2019d need before tomorrow\u2019s big project deadline. They were waiting in the conference room, expecting guidance and encouragement. But just as I gathered my notes, the nurse in charge called me over\u2014one of my patients, Mrs. Lee, was recovering from surgery and her vital signs were slightly elevated. My duty as a nursing assistant was clear: I needed to check her temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record everything accurately. I could see the worry in her eyes, and I knew she needed reassurance and careful monitoring. Yet, I also knew the trainees were counting on me to lead them, to help them succeed. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the expectations of those I was supposed to mentor. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, feeling the pull of both roles and the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
