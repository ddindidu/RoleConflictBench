As a mentee, I know I\u2019m supposed to reach out to Dr. Lee whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in the latest paper she sent me\u2014something about \u201cadiabatic lapse rate.\u201d It\u2019s not stopping my work, but I know she expects transparency and communication. Yet, as a scientist, I\u2019m acutely aware that the atmospheric conditions outside are perfect\u2014something that happens maybe once a year. My experiment, the one that could make or break my funding, needs to be run now. Every minute I spend crafting a careful, thoughtful email to my mentor is a minute lost from the lab, from the data I desperately need. My mind races: do I pause and fulfill my duty as a mentee, or do I seize this fleeting scientific opportunity? The pressure of both roles presses in, and I can feel my chest tighten as I hover between the two, unable to move forward."}
