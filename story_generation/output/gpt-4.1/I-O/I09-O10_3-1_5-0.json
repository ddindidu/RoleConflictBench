My phone buzzed with a message from the HOA: \u201cReminder\u2014inspection at 2 p.m. today. Corridors must be clear.\u201d I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, had left her walker and a few bags outside her door again. As a neighbor, I knew I should help her move them, especially since the inspection could mean a fine or worse for her. But as an accountant, I was already behind on the filings, and any delay could mean errors or missing the deadline, which my boss would not tolerate. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a good neighbor and the pressure to meet my professional obligations. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
