My mentor\u2019s office hours were a rare window\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that her time was precious, and I was lucky to have her guidance. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d show up, prepared and respectful, never wasting a minute. But as I dialed into my telemarketing shift, the phone lines lit up. Prospect after prospect grilled me with technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely touched. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection, to keep callers engaged, to never say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d make my mentor\u2019s office hours, but I\u2019d be abandoning my post, letting down my team and risking my stats. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to connect with my mentor, maybe for weeks. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands\u2014be the reliable mentee, or the dependable telemarketer. Both roles pulled at me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to satisfy either without disappointing someone."}
