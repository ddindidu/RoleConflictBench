I replay the conversation in my head, realizing too late how my careless words must have sounded. I know I need to call Sam right now, to apologize, to explain, to fix what I\u2019ve broken before it festers. But as I glance in the rearview mirror, my passenger\u2019s anxious eyes meet mine. \u201cCan we make it to the station in fifteen minutes?\u201d she asks, clutching her ticket. The city traffic is thick, and every second counts. My hands tighten on the wheel. I want to pull over, dial Sam, and be the friend I should be\u2014honest, open, there when it matters. But I also have a responsibility to this stranger, to get her safely and quickly to her train. My mind races, torn between the urgent need to mend my friendship and the duty to my passenger. The phone vibrates again. I grip the steering wheel, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both need me, right now."}
