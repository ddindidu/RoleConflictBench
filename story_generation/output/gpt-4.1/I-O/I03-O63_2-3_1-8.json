My headset itches against my ear, but I can\u2019t take it off yet. Just as I\u2019m about to log back in, I hear the front door creak. My boyfriend walks in, shoulders slumped, eyes red. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just drops his bag and sits heavily on the couch. I know that look; he\u2019s had a rough day. I want to go to him, to wrap my arms around him and listen, to be the girlfriend he needs right now. But my heart pounds as I remember the compliance system at work. If I\u2019m even a minute late logging back in, the system will flag me, and I can\u2019t afford another warning. My job expects me to be punctual, to put work first during my hours. But my partner expects me to be present, to care, to support him when he\u2019s hurting. I stand frozen between the living room and my desk, torn by the demands of both worlds, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
