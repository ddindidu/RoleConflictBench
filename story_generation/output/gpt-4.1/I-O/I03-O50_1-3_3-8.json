I miss you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy, but finally, our schedules lined up. I could almost feel the warmth of his hand in mine, the easy laughter we shared over coffee. I wanted to be there, to give him the time and attention he deserved.\n\nBut just as I started to reply, my work phone buzzed. A panicked message from the plant: the new staff were about to start a batch on the old press, and no one had shown them the safety protocols. My heart thudded. If I didn\u2019t step in, someone could get hurt. They needed me to walk them through the process, to make sure everything was safe.\n\nI stared at both screens, feeling the weight of expectation from both sides. My boyfriend wanted me present, attentive, loving. My job demanded vigilance, responsibility, expertise. I could feel the tension coil in my chest, torn between being the girlfriend he needed and the repairer my team depended on."}
