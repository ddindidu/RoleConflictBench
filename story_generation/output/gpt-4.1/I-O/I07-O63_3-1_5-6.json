As a colleague, I know my team is counting on me to finish this report by noon\u2014without it, the client\u2019s delivery will be delayed, and everyone\u2019s hard work could unravel. My phone buzzes with a reminder: it\u2019s time for my scheduled break as a telemarketer. Normally, I\u2019d welcome the pause, but today, the call volume is light, and supervisors have said we can be flexible. Still, the expectation is clear\u2014take breaks as scheduled, don\u2019t burn out, and set a good example for others.\n\nMy fingers hover over the keyboard, torn. If I keep working, I\u2019ll meet my team\u2019s deadline, but I\u2019ll be ignoring the company\u2019s policy and risking burnout. If I step away, I\u2019ll be following the rules, but letting my colleagues down. My mind races, heart pounding, as I weigh the demands of both roles, feeling the pressure build. I stare at the screen, caught between responsibility and self-care, unable to move."}
