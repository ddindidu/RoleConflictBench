As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a roadblock, and right now, the conflict with my teammates was more than a roadblock\u2014it was a full-blown barricade. Our arguments over task ownership had already delayed our progress, and I could feel the deadline looming. But as an engineer, I was also expected to join the upcoming project planning session and give an accurate estimate for our deliverables. The session was informal, and the timeline wasn\u2019t set in stone yet, but I knew that if I mentioned the conflict, it could raise red flags and possibly shift the project\u2019s perception of our team\u2019s reliability. If I kept quiet, I\u2019d be failing my mentor\u2019s trust; if I spoke up, I risked undermining my team. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pressure build from both sides, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
