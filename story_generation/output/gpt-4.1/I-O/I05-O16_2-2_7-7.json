My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our meeting, anxious about her upcoming interview for a fellowship that could change her career. She needed my undivided attention, my encouragement, and honest feedback to help her grow. I wanted to be the mentor who believed in her, who pushed her to reach her potential.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the clinic: my patient, Mr. Lee, was experiencing a flare-up of his autoimmune disease. His treatment was complex, requiring careful adjustment of medications and close monitoring. As his doctor, I was expected to act quickly, to ensure he received the right care without delay.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I focused on Sarah, I risked neglecting Mr. Lee\u2019s urgent needs. If I rushed to the clinic, I\u2019d let Sarah down at a crucial moment. My mind raced, torn between nurturing a future leader and safeguarding a patient\u2019s health, both expecting me to be fully present, both needing me now."}
