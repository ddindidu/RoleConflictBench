As a colleague, I knew my part of the report was due by noon, and if I missed it, the next person in line would be stuck, their own work delayed. The team was counting on me to keep things moving. But as an architect, I was deep into designing the new office floor plan, and the client had just sent urgent feedback. They wanted a complete rework of the meeting spaces to better support collaboration, and the deadline for revised plans was tomorrow. My mind raced, torn between the immediate pressure from my team and the responsibility to deliver a thoughtful, functional design. I could feel the tension in my shoulders, the weight of two sets of expectations pulling me in opposite directions. If I focused on the report, the floor plan would suffer; if I dove into the design, my teammate\u2019s work would stall. I sat frozen, caught between the demands of being a reliable colleague and a dedicated architect, unsure which role to serve first."}
