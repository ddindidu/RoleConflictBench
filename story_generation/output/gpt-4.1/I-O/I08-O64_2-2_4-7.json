I\u2019m in a bind.\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt a tug of obligation\u2014wasn\u2019t I supposed to help out, at least when someone asked directly? But the lunch rush was just beginning, and the line at my register was already snaking past the bakery display. As a cashier, I was expected to greet every customer with a smile, keep things moving, and make sure no one waited too long. My manager had just reminded us about the importance of customer service during peak hours. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: Mark probably needed help soon, but the store needed me here, focused and friendly. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a helpful acquaintance and the responsibility to my job.
