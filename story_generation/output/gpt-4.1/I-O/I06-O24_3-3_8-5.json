My mentor had squeezed in our session just before her flight, a rare chance I\u2019d waited weeks for. She\u2019d made it clear: she only had this one hour, and I needed to be prepared and focused. But as I sat down, my phone buzzed with a message from the court clerk\u2014urgent. The bail hearing I\u2019d just presided over had ended, and the defendant was still in custody. The order detailing the conditions of release had to be drafted and signed immediately, or the defendant would remain locked up longer than necessary. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. As a mentee, I owed my mentor my full attention and respect for her limited time. As a judge, I was responsible for someone\u2019s liberty, and the law demanded clarity and promptness. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the obligation to justice, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
