I remembered her anxious face last week, asking if I could check in if the weather got bad. At the same time, my shift at the care home was ending, but I couldn\u2019t leave yet. Mr. Alvarez, one of my patients, had just received a devastating diagnosis. He was crying, clutching my hand, needing comfort and reassurance. My supervisor expected me to stay with him, to offer the emotional support he desperately needed. But Mrs. Kim would be waiting, maybe scared, maybe needing help if the power went out. I felt torn, my mind racing between the two places I was needed most. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one as a neighbor, the other as a nursing assistant\u2014each demanding my presence, each expecting me to care. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between the storm outside and the storm of emotions inside."}
