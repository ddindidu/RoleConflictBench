I know it\u2019s my team\u2014waiting for my reply, the one that will clear up the confusion and let them move forward with the project. I promised I\u2019d be responsive, even during my shift, and I can almost feel their impatience growing with every minute I don\u2019t answer. But just as I consider sneaking a quick response at the next stop, the radio crackles: a passenger has reported an unattended bag in car three. My heart rate spikes. Protocol is clear\u2014passenger safety comes first. I need to investigate, alert security, maybe even halt the train. Yet, the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations presses on me.

My mind races, trying to balance the demands of both worlds, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be left waiting."}
