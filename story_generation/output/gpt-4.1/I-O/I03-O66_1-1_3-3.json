Any evening works for me.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d promised to spend more time together, to really be present. I wanted to make it special, to show him he mattered. But as I drove my taxi through the city, the meter ticking, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. My evenings were when fares were best\u2014steady rides, good tips, and, most importantly, fewer distractions on the road. I prided myself on being a careful driver, always following the rules, never rushing, even when the streets were clear and the temptation to speed up was strong. My boyfriend expected my time and attention, but my passengers expected a safe, reliable ride. I could feel the pressure building, the weight of wanting to be the perfect girlfriend and the responsible driver. My mind raced with possible compromises, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
