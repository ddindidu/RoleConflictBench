My phone buzzed again\u2014another reminder from him, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, this is important for your growth.\u201d I knew he expected me to deliver flawless work, to prove I was ready for more responsibility. But just as I started typing, a piercing screech echoed from the production floor. My heart sank. That sound meant the main conveyor\u2019s bearing was about to seize. If I didn\u2019t get down there and fix it now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company thousands and putting everyone behind schedule. As the only machine repairer on shift, I was expected to drop everything and handle emergencies like this. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urgent spreadsheet and the shrill alarm of the failing machine. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were critical, and I could feel the pressure mounting in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
