It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her voice tight with panic. She was already halfway to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check and, if it\u2019s there, bring it to me? My flight\u2019s in three hours,\u201d she pleaded. I could hear the desperation in her voice\u2014she\u2019d been planning this trip for months, and missing it would devastate her.\n\nAt the same moment, my work phone pinged with an email from my supervisor. There was an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar\u2014something I\u2019d been waiting for, since it could help me move up in the company. The catch: spots were limited, and I needed to respond immediately if I wanted a chance.\n\nI stared at my phones, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Jamie needed me, and I wanted to be the friend she could always count on. But this seminar was a rare opportunity, and I knew my boss expected quick, decisive action. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the friend Jamie needed and the professional my job demanded."}
