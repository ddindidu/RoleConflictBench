The accident had just happened, and I was focused on keeping everyone safe, waving drivers past the wreckage, checking for injuries, and radioing for backup. But the buzzing wouldn\u2019t stop. I glanced down and saw my friend\u2019s name\u2014three missed messages. We were supposed to meet for dinner, and I remembered she\u2019d been confused about the restaurant. She needed me to confirm the spot, to clear up the misunderstanding before she gave up and went home. As a friend, I should reply right now, reassure her, keep our plans intact. But as a police officer, I couldn\u2019t look away from the chaos in front of me. Every second counted for the people here, and my duty was to them. My hand hovered over my phone, torn between the urgent needs of the street and the silent plea from my friend, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing in on me."}
