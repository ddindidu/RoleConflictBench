He barely looked up when I walked in, and I knew he needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he was more than the criticism he\u2019d received. I wanted to sit beside him, hold his hand, and let him talk it out. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from my supervisor: the stack of unused tiles had to be moved to the new storage area before the end of the day. I could already hear his voice in my head, stern and impatient, if I left it too late. My body ached from the morning\u2019s labor, but I knew the job wasn\u2019t done. I stood in the doorway, torn, feeling the pull of both worlds\u2014one needing my strength, the other my heart. My hands clenched, uncertain, as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
