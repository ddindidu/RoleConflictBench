I know if I don\u2019t reply now, he\u2019ll probably go to the wrong place, and we\u2019ll both end up frustrated. But I\u2019m sitting in the telemarketing office, headset on, eyes flicking to the clock. My break isn\u2019t for another twenty minutes, and management has been strict lately\u2014every second off the phone is tracked, and the queue is never-ending. If I sneak a message now, I risk getting flagged for an unscheduled break. But if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m letting Sam down, and we\u2019ve been trying to patch things up after our last misunderstanding. My thumb hovers over my phone, heart pounding, torn between being the reliable friend Sam needs and the dependable employee my boss expects."}
