It was Jamie, someone I knew from the gym, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for her anniversary dinner. I wanted to help\u2014after all, that\u2019s what friends, even casual ones, do. But before I could reply, my work line lit up. I put on my telemarketer voice and answered. The caller was Mr. Patel, a long-time customer, and he was furious. He questioned the legitimacy of our latest offer, demanding a detailed explanation. My manager expected me to stay calm, address every objection, and keep the call professional. But Jamie\u2019s message kept flashing on my screen, reminding me of her trust and my promise to help. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on soothing Mr. Patel and risk letting Jamie down, or quickly text her back and risk losing my composure with the customer? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my heart race as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
