My team was gathering in five minutes to discuss critical project updates\u2014details that wouldn\u2019t be shared again. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show I was part of the team. But just as I reached for my headset, the radio crackled with urgency. A major route closure had just been announced, and now dozens of flights were circling, waiting for instructions. As an air traffic controller, I was responsible for keeping those planes safe, for managing the sudden congestion in the sky. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford mistakes.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my team counting on my input, pilots counting on my guidance. I felt the pressure building, torn between the meeting I couldn\u2019t miss and the airspace I couldn\u2019t abandon, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
