The conflict with my teammates had escalated, and now our deliverable was at risk. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor, Dr. Lee, and let her know about the situation before it spiraled further. She always emphasized open communication, and I could almost hear her voice urging me to be proactive.\n\nBut just as I started typing a message, my pager beeped. A patient with a complex autoimmune disease was waiting for me. Her treatment plan was delicate, requiring careful adjustments and precise prescriptions. As her doctor, I couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted or rushed. She depended on me to get it right, to listen, and to act with unwavering focus.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My mentor expected honesty and transparency, but my patient needed my undivided attention. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility to address first, torn between the demands of my training and the needs of my patient."}
