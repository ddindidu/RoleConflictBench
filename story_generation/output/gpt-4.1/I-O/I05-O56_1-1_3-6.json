She smiled, mentioning she\u2019d just washed her hair at home, and I could feel how clean and soft it was. Normally, I\u2019d move straight to the cut, but the salon\u2019s policy\u2014and my own professional standards\u2014said I should always wash and condition before styling. It was expected, part of the experience. As I hesitated, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, who often reached out during my breaks. She was struggling with a tricky coloring technique and needed advice. I prided myself on being available, sharing what I\u2019d learned, even if it meant answering her questions between clients. Now, I felt pulled in two directions: do I stick to the hairdresser\u2019s routine, possibly making my client uncomfortable by insisting on another wash, or do I use the extra time to mentor, risking the salon\u2019s expectations? My mind raced, caught between the demands of being a reliable mentor and a professional hairdresser, unsure which role to prioritize in this moment."}
