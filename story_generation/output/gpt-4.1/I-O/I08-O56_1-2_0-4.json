As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to smile and greet her warmly, to show I was approachable and friendly. But just as I opened my mouth, I heard a soft sigh from behind me. Turning, I saw my new client, her eyes fixed on the mirror, lips pressed in a thin line. The colour I\u2019d just finished applying wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for\u2014I could see the disappointment in her face. As her hairdresser, I knew I needed to address her concerns immediately, to reassure her and offer solutions. But Jamie was already waving, expecting a cheerful hello, while my client needed my full attention and professionalism. My heart raced as I stood between them, torn by the pressure to be both the friendly acquaintance and the attentive hairdresser, feeling the weight of their expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
