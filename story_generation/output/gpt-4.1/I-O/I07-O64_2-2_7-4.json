My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014again. I knew it was my team\u2019s group chat; they were waiting for my input on a project detail before they could move forward. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep things moving. But right now, I was a cashier, and the line was growing. A woman stepped up, holding a blender and no receipt. She explained her situation, clearly frustrated, and I remembered the strict return policy: no returns without proof of purchase. I could feel her eyes on me, expecting empathy, maybe a little rule-bending. At the same time, my team was expecting reliability and promptness. My heart pounded as I weighed the store\u2019s rules against the customer\u2019s plea, and the pressure of my colleagues\u2019 waiting messages against the immediate demands of my job. I felt pulled in two directions, unable to satisfy both sides at once."}
