But as I glanced around the workshop, saw the scattered wood shavings and tools, my heart sank. The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another accident. Keep your area spotless.\u201d I knew the risks\u2014one careless moment, and someone could get hurt. My hands trembled as I swept, but my mind kept drifting to the dinner reservation I\u2019d made, the movie tickets in my bag. I wanted to be the loving girlfriend he needed, to hold him close before he left, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility of keeping my coworkers safe. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing between the promise of love and the duty of care, unsure which part of me to let down."}
