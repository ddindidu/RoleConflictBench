Our argument from last night had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. My heart pounded with anxiety\u2014I knew I needed to call him, to try and fix things before it was too late. But as I pulled up to my next delivery, the app pinged: \u201cHigh-value package. Confirm secure drop-off.\u201d I glanced at the empty porch, the wind picking up. If I left the box out in the open, it could get stolen, and I\u2019d be in trouble at work. But if I took the time to call my boyfriend now, I\u2019d fall behind on my route and risk a complaint. My hands shook as I held the package, torn between the urgent need to save my relationship and the responsibility to do my job right. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen on the doorstep, unable to choose."}
