As a mentor, I knew how much this project meant to Priya, my mentee. She was on the verge of presenting her findings to the executive team, and she needed my guidance to polish her proposal. She\u2019d already messaged me twice, her anxiety seeping through the screen. I wanted to be there for her, to help her grow and seize this opportunity.
