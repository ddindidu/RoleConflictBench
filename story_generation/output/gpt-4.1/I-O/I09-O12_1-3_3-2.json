I glanced at my own bin\u2014only half-full, but tomorrow was pickup day. I knew Mrs. Patel next door always appreciated when I waited until the morning to put mine out, so the sidewalk stayed clear for her evening walk. But my mind was already racing with the performance traces from work. The new code I\u2019d merged was causing a bottleneck, and my team was counting on me to fix it before the morning standup. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the considerate neighbor who respected shared spaces, and the responsible developer who delivered clean, efficient solutions. My laptop chimed with another Slack message\u2014urgent, of course. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, code in my head, torn between the quiet expectations of my neighborhood and the relentless demands of my job."}
