We\u2019d argued again this morning\u2014money, always money. She wanted to talk, to fix things before I left for my shift, but I\u2019d already been late twice this week. Now, as I pulled into the ambulance bay, my mind was still tangled in our words, her voice echoing in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t keep ignoring this.\u201d \n\nThe radio crackled. Dispatch: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall, possible fracture.\u201d I grabbed my bag, heart pounding. I knew what was expected\u2014calm, focus, reassurance. The patient would need me to be steady, to manage their pain, to make them feel safe. But Jamie\u2019s texts kept lighting up my screen, each one a reminder that I was failing her, too. \n\nI stood at the ambulance door, torn. My patient needed me now, but so did Jamie. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose which crisis to answer first."}
