I could already picture us laughing over dinner, the warmth of his hand in mine. But as I set my phone down, the work order on my desk caught my eye\u2014a new client wanted a custom bookshelf, and they needed an estimate by tomorrow. I mentally ran through the steps: measure, sketch, calculate materials, call the supplier before they closed for the day. My mind buzzed with numbers and wood types, but my heart tugged me toward the promise of time together. I knew he was hoping for a night where I wasn\u2019t distracted, where I could be fully present.

I sat there, torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
