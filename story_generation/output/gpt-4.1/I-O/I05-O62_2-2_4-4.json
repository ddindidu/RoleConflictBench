My mentees were counting on me to guide them through the final steps before their big project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing, determined to share every bit of knowledge and experience I could. As I set up in the poolside meeting room, I glanced out at the water and noticed the lane rope sagging, nearly split in two. My lifeguard instincts kicked in\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it, the afternoon swim lessons would be a mess, maybe even unsafe. But the session was about to start, and my mentees were already gathering, eager and expectant. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down: the mentor who must be present, focused, and generous with wisdom; the lifeguard responsible for every detail of safety and order. My heart pounded as I stood between the meeting room and the pool, torn by the urgent demands of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
