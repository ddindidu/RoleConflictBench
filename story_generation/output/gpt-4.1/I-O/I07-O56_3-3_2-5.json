The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and this was the final discussion before we locked in the new project direction. My phone buzzed with reminders from my manager\u2014everyone\u2019s input was crucial, and I was expected to be there, to speak up, to show I was committed to the team. But right in front of me, in my other world, an angry client was waving her hands, her voice rising above the hum of the closing salon. She hated her cut, she said, and she wanted it fixed now, not tomorrow. My scissors felt heavy in my hand. I could see my colleagues in the break room, packing up, glancing at me with sympathy. I knew the expectation: every client leaves happy, no matter what. But my laptop was open in the back, the meeting link waiting. I felt pulled in two, my mind racing with what I owed to my team and what I owed to my client, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly satisfy both at once."}
