My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. The conflict with my teammates had exploded this morning, and I knew I was supposed to communicate any issues right away. But as I started to type a message, I caught a glimpse of a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on the water, to be ready to jump in at any second. Yet, the pressure from my mentor weighed heavily on me; I couldn\u2019t let the project slip, not after all the guidance I\u2019d received. My heart pounded as I gripped my phone, torn between my responsibility to the swimmers and my duty to be honest and proactive with my mentor. The seconds stretched, each one thick with the impossible choice between two roles I cared about deeply."}
