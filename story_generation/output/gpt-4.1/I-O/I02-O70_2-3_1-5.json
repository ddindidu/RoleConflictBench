I had a terrible day.\u201d I could almost hear her voice trembling, and I knew she needed me\u2014her boyfriend\u2014to listen, to hold her, to reassure her that she was more than her boss\u2019s harsh words. But as I pulled up to the next address, the reality of my other role pressed in. The package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cSensitive\u2014Hand Deliver Only.\u201d My manager\u2019s warning echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Confirm ID.
