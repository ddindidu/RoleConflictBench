The line stretched past the candy racks, and customers shifted impatiently. My mind was still reeling from what I\u2019d overheard in the break room just minutes before\u2014something deeply personal about a coworker, something that could easily become the next big rumor. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t breathe a word of it, but the customer now at my register was a mutual friend, and she leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cDid you hear about Jamie?\u201d she whispered, eyes searching mine for confirmation. My hands fumbled with the barcode scanner, the beep echoing my racing thoughts.
