The line stretches down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cKeep the line moving, no mistakes.\u201d But my phone vibrates in my apron pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s him. My boyfriend, shattered by the news of his brother\u2019s passing, needs me. He called this morning, voice raw, asking if I could come over, just to sit with him. I promised I\u2019d try, but now I\u2019m trapped behind the counter, forced smiles and polite greetings masking the ache in my chest. Each beep of the scanner feels like a countdown, each customer a barrier between me and the person I love. I want to drop everything, rush to his side, hold him while he cries. But I can\u2019t abandon my post, not with the line growing and my supervisor watching. My heart pulls in two directions, guilt and duty twisting inside me, and I don\u2019t know which role I\u2019m supposed to choose."}
