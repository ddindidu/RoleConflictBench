He was furious, demanding to know why our \u201cexclusive offer\u201d was any different from the last three he\u2019d received. My script felt useless; he wanted real answers, not rehearsed lines. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle every objection, don\u2019t escalate unless absolutely necessary.\u201d I tried to keep my voice steady, but my mind kept drifting to the email draft open in another window\u2014a question for my mentor about a term in our latest project. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d been told to communicate any challenge, no matter how small, as soon as it arose. I felt torn. If I paused to send the email, I\u2019d be distracted from Mr. Jenkins, risking a complaint. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, not living up to the expectations set for me as a proactive mentee. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
