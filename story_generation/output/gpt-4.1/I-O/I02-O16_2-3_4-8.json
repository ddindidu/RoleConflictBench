After weeks of mismatched schedules, my girlfriend and I finally carved out a single evening together before I left for a conference. She\u2019d planned everything\u2014her favorite takeout, a movie, even a walk by the river. I could see the hope in her eyes as she talked about how much this meant to her, how much she missed us. But just as I was about to leave the hospital, my pager buzzed: a patient in the ER, a young man with a rapidly spreading infection, needed immediate attention. The right antibiotic could save his life, but it would take time\u2014time to assess, prescribe, and monitor. My heart twisted as I imagined her waiting, watching the clock, wondering if I cared as much as she did. I felt torn in two, the weight of her expectations pressing against the urgent responsibility I owed my patient. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between the person I loved and the oath I\u2019d sworn, not knowing which part of me I\u2019d have to let down tonight."}
