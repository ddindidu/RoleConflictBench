The deadline was in three days, and I could already hear his voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to show progress. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind kept drifting to the pharmacy newsletter I\u2019d just started skimming. There was a new drug release, and I knew my manager expected me to be up-to-date, ready to answer questions from both patients and colleagues. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust in my commitment, my professional duty to stay informed. The minutes of my break ticked by, and I wrestled with the urge to dive deeper into the newsletter, fearing I\u2019d miss something crucial for my job, while the unfinished code glared at me, a silent accusation. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the stress of being pulled in two directions at once."}
