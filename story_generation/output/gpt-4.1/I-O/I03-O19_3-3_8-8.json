My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex. Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved and raw. He wanted to talk, to finally address whether we could move past this or if we were done for good. My heart pounded with anxiety. As his girlfriend, I knew I owed him my full attention, a real conversation to work through our pain. But as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t afford to miss this session; my license and my patients depended on me staying current. The presenter\u2019s voice faded into the background as I stared at Alex\u2019s words, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down. I wanted to be present for him, to fight for us, but I also needed to be present for my profession. My hands trembled as I hovered between the call button and the webinar window, torn by the impossible demands of love and duty."}
