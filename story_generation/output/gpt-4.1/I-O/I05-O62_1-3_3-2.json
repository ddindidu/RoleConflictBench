The beach was packed, high tide pulling at the edges of the shore, and every instinct told me to watch, to never let my gaze wander. But beside me, Jamie, my eager mentee, leaned in with a notebook, voice low. \u201cHey, can you explain how you spot a rip current so quickly?\u201d he asked, pen poised. I knew he looked up to me, counted on these moments to learn, and I wanted to share everything I knew. But as I started to answer, a group of kids shrieked near the waterline, and my heart thudded.
