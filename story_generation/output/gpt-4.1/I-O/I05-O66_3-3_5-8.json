On one side, my mentee\u2019s anxious messages blinked\u2014she was about to submit her first big project, and she needed my guidance to avoid a costly mistake. On the other, the taxi app flashed a new ride request: a passenger at the hospital, marked \u201curgent,\u201d already sending impatient texts about my ETA. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. As a mentor, I knew how much my mentee depended on me; she trusted my experience, and I couldn\u2019t let her down when the stakes were so high. But as a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt and professional, especially with someone in distress. The minutes ticked by, each one stretching the tension inside me. Should I pull over and call my mentee, risking a late arrival and a poor rating? Or should I focus on the road, leaving her to face the challenge alone? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
