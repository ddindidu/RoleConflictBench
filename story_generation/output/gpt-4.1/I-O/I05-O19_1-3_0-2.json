It was Maya, my mentee, asking if I had a moment to chat about a job offer she\u2019d just received. She sounded anxious, and I knew she valued my guidance, even on these seemingly minor career choices. I glanced at the prescription in front of me, aware that even the smallest distraction could lead to a catastrophic error for the patient waiting on the other side of the counter. But Maya rarely reached out, and I felt the weight of her trust in me as a mentor. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to be there for her, to offer the support she expected, while knowing my primary responsibility as a pharmacist was to ensure the medication\u2019s accuracy. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of someone seeking guidance and the life-altering consequences of a single mistake."}
