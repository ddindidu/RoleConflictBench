As a neighbor, I always tried to be considerate\u2014never leaving my trash bins overflowing, always making sure the shared alley stayed clean. This morning, I noticed the bins were only half-full, but I knew some neighbors would want to toss in more before pickup. I hesitated, not wanting to drag them out too soon and take up space, but I also had to leave for my shift as a police officer.\n\nAt the station, the radio crackled with news of a protest growing downtown. As an officer, I was expected to enforce the law, keep the peace, and act decisively if things got out of hand. The tension in my chest grew. I thought about my neighbors, trusting me to respect our shared space, and the city, trusting me to maintain order. Both roles demanded my attention, but in such different ways. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of expectation pressing down as I laced up my boots, wondering which responsibility would have to give."}
