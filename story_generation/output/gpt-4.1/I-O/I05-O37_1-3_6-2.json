As a mentor, I\u2019d promised myself to be available for my mentee, Jamie, who\u2019d been struggling with time management. During our casual check-ins, I could see the frustration in Jamie\u2019s eyes, the way they hesitated before admitting they were falling behind. I wanted to encourage them, to help them find a system that worked, to be the support I never had. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the deep cleaning schedule for the house. Every room needed to be spotless today\u2014no shortcuts, no missed corners. The supervisor had been clear: thoroughness was non-negotiable.\n\nI felt torn, standing in the hallway with Jamie\u2019s anxious voice in my ear and the scent of cleaning supplies lingering on my hands. My mind raced with the expectations\u2014be present, be supportive, but also be efficient, be meticulous. The clock ticked louder, and I could feel my heart pounding, caught between the urge to guide Jamie through their struggles and the pressing demand to scrub, sanitize, and shine every inch of the house."}
