My thoughts drifted to Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone just down the hall. As her neighbor, I felt a responsibility to check in, maybe help her prepare for the storm or just reassure her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I was about to leave, a young woman approached the counter, her face anxious. \u201cExcuse me, which pain reliever is best for a headache?\u201d she asked. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of the approaching storm and the urge to get home to Mrs. Kim. As a pharmacist, I knew I should take the time to counsel her properly, ask about her symptoms, allergies, and other medications. But every minute I spent here was a minute Mrs. Kim might need help. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my patient and my responsibility as a neighbor. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
