I miss you.\u201d My heart warms. We finally have a few evenings free, and I promised we\u2019d make time for each other. I want to be present, to laugh and talk and just be together, not distracted or tired. But right now, I\u2019m behind the wheel of the ambulance, moving it from the main station to the satellite location for the shift change. The radio crackles, and I focus on the road, hands steady, eyes alert. I know how important it is to drive safely\u2014lives depend on it, even when there\u2019s no patient in the back. My supervisor expects me to be professional, careful, and on time. But my mind keeps drifting to Alex, to the promise I made, to the guilt of maybe letting her down if I can\u2019t give her my full attention later. The pressure builds in my chest, torn between being the reliable girlfriend she deserves and the responsible ambulance driver my team and the community need. I grip the steering wheel tighter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019ll have to disappoint."}
