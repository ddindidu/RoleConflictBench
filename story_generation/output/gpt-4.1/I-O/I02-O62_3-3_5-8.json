It was our last chance before she left for her new job overseas, and I wanted every moment to count. We sat together on the beach, her head on my shoulder, the sun setting in a blaze of orange. My phone was off, my lifeguard whistle tucked away\u2014I was determined to be present, to make her feel like she was the only thing that mattered.\n\nBut then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small figure flailing in the deep end, right where swimming was off-limits. My training kicked in instantly. I knew the rules: safety first, always. But Mia\u2019s hand tightened around mine, her eyes searching my face, silently pleading for just a little more time, a little more of me. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads of duty and love, torn between the promise I made to her and the responsibility I owed to that struggling child."}
