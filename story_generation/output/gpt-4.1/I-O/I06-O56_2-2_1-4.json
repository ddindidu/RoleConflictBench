The code sample was only half done, and the next meeting was in three days. My mentor expected me to show up prepared, and I could already hear her voice in my head, urging me to push through and deliver my best work. But right now, I was standing behind a new client, her eyes fixed on the mirror, lips pressed tight. She finally spoke, her voice low, \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I imagined.\u201d My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to address her disappointment, listen carefully, and make it right\u2014her satisfaction was everything, especially for a first-time visitor. But as she explained her concerns, my mind kept drifting to the unfinished code, the logic errors I hadn\u2019t fixed, the pressure to impress my mentor. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be present for my client and the looming deadline for my assignment. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the colour chart, wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
