I really need you.\u201d She\u2019s just had her performance review, and I know how much she was hoping for a promotion. My heart aches, wanting to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that she\u2019s more than her boss\u2019s words. But as I look up, the prescription in front of me snaps me back to the pharmacy. It\u2019s a high-risk chemotherapy order, and I can\u2019t afford a single distraction. Every decimal, every instruction, every label must be perfect. The patient\u2019s life depends on my focus. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014Mia needs my comfort, but this patient needs my undivided attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down, my hands trembling slightly as I reach for the medication bottle, my phone buzzing insistently in my pocket."}
