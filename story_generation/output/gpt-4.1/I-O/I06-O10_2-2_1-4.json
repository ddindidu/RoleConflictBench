On one side, the code sample my mentor assigned glared at me, half-finished and riddled with errors. He expected me to have it ready before our next meeting in three days, and I could already hear his voice in my head, urging me to push harder, to prove I was serious about learning. On the other side, spreadsheets and tax forms piled up, reminders of my responsibility as the company\u2019s accountant. The quarterly tax filing deadline was looming, and any mistake could mean penalties for the business. My manager trusted me to get everything right, to keep us compliant and safe. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, my mind racing with doubts. If I focused on the code, would I miss a crucial detail in the tax forms? If I prioritized the taxes, would I let my mentor down and fall behind in my learning? My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between two sets of expectations that felt impossible to meet at once."}
