As a telemarketer, I was painfully aware that every minute mattered\u2014my team was just shy of our sales target, and management had made it clear: miss it, and we\u2019d lose our bonuses. My fingers hovered over the call list, but my mind kept drifting to the email from my mentor. She\u2019d set aside office hours this afternoon, a rare window in her packed schedule, and she\u2019d encouraged me to drop by with questions about my career path. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation; she\u2019d made it clear that respecting her time was non-negotiable. But every call I made now could be the one that pushed us over the line. My heart pounded as I weighed the pressure from my manager against the trust my mentor had placed in me. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which role to honor first."}
