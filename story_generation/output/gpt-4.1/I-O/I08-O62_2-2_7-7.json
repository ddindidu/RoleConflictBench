We stood near the pool, keeping an eye on the swimmers. Mark leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you see how badly Sarah messed up the schedule last week? She\u2019s always making mistakes.\u201d I felt a twinge of discomfort\u2014gossip wasn\u2019t something I wanted to encourage, and I knew Sarah worked hard. At the same time, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a group of teenagers laughing and preparing to dive right next to the big, bold \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My job demanded I enforce the rules immediately, but Mark was waiting for my response, expecting me to join in or at least acknowledge his comment. I felt torn, caught between the urge to redirect Mark away from gossip and the responsibility to stop the teens before someone got hurt. My heart pounded as I weighed which role to prioritize, feeling the pressure of both expectations closing in on me."}
