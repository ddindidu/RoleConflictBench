I glanced at the screen\u2014Maya. Her voice trembled when I answered, \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that only comes after a fight with someone you love. As her friend, I knew what she needed: someone to listen, to reassure her, to help her untangle the mess of her feelings. But as a scientist, I was minutes away from running a crucial experiment. The equipment was ready, the samples prepped, and although I could reschedule, I\u2019d spent days preparing for this. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Maya\u2019s need for comfort, my responsibility to my research. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of friendship and the cool logic of science, each demanding my full attention. I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
