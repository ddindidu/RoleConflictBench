After days of mismatched schedules, my boyfriend and I finally carved out a few precious hours together before I left for a week-long training. He sat on the bleachers, grinning, waving at me every so often as I paced the pool deck in my red lifeguard shirt. I could feel his expectation\u2014he wanted my attention, my laughter, my hand in his. I wanted that too. But my eyes kept darting to the water, scanning for trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle lane, their strokes uneven, head bobbing awkwardly. My training kicked in: stay alert, be ready. But my heart tugged in the other direction, aching to sit beside him, to make the most of our fleeting time. I felt split in two, the whistle heavy around my neck, the weight of his hopeful gaze just as pressing. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to protect and the desire to be present, knowing I couldn\u2019t give myself fully to either."}
