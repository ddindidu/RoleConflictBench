It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her message popping up: \u201cSOS! Can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in screws and planks over here.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. Management had been clear: no exceptions, no excuses. The pressure to perform gnawed at me, but Jamie\u2019s text tugged at something deeper. She\u2019d always been there for me, especially during my rough patches. I could almost hear her frustration through the screen, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t ask unless she really needed help. My headset felt heavier as I weighed my options. If I stopped now, I might miss my target and face another stern talk from my supervisor. But if I ignored Jamie, I\u2019d be letting down someone who counted on me. My thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding, torn between the demands of my job and the loyalty of friendship."}
