I baked a small lemon cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and maybe make a good impression. As I wrapped the cake, I glanced at my phone and saw a reminder: the national continuing education webinar for pharmacists was starting in fifteen minutes. It was a crucial session, covering new guidelines I needed to stay licensed and competent at work. \n\nI looked at the cake, then at the clock. I knew the neighbors would likely be home now, and I wanted to be friendly, to show I cared about being part of the community. But I also knew how important it was to keep up with my professional responsibilities. If I missed the session, I\u2019d fall behind, maybe even risk my standing at the pharmacy. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, cake in hand, torn between the warmth of a neighborly gesture and the pressing duty of my profession."}
