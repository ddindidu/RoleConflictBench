The team meeting was in fifteen minutes\u2014the last chance to weigh in before our department\u2019s new workflow was finalized. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. But my mind kept drifting back to the thick stack of notes on my desk, the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded. As a judge, I was under pressure to draft the final judgment, a document that needed to be thorough, precise, and delivered within the next thirty days. The attorneys and parties were waiting, and any delay would be unacceptable. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, while my computer screen displayed a blank page, cursor blinking impatiently. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my colleagues counting on my input, the justice system demanding my focus and clarity. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between loyalty to my team and my duty to the law."}
