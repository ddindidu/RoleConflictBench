My mentor\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cLet\u2019s see your code sample at our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d finish it tonight, but the clang of shovels and the foreman\u2019s shout snapped me back to the construction site. My shift was ending, and the dust from the day\u2019s work hung thick in the air. I glanced at the broom leaning against the wall\u2014routine sweep-up time. If I left my area messy, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking someone\u2019s safety, and maybe even a warning from the boss. But if I stayed, I\u2019d lose the only quiet hour I had to code before exhaustion took over. My hands ached from hauling bricks, but my mind buzzed with unfinished logic and the weight of my mentor\u2019s expectations.
