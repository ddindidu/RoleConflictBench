He\u2019d planned a cozy dinner at our favorite restaurant, and I could see the excitement in his eyes as he texted me reminders all day. But just as I was about to leave the courthouse, a bail hearing ran late. The defendant\u2019s lawyer pleaded for a quick decision, and I knew the order had to be written and signed tonight\u2014otherwise, the defendant would spend another night in custody. My clerk hovered by my office door, waiting for my draft. I glanced at my phone, seeing my boyfriend\u2019s hopeful messages, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be present for him, to laugh and talk and make the most of our precious time. But I also knew my duty as a judge: to be thorough, fair, and timely. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat at my desk, torn, the cursor blinking on a blank document as my phone buzzed again."}
