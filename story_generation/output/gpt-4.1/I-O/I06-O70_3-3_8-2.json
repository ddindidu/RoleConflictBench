My mentor, Dr. Lee, had squeezed in a session for me just before catching a long flight. She\u2019d emphasized how tight her schedule was, how this hour was all she could spare for weeks. I knew how much she valued punctuality and respect for her time\u2014she\u2019d chosen me as her mentee because I was reliable. But just as I was about to log in, my dispatcher called. A medical supply package needed to reach the hospital\u2019s ER within the hour. The supplies were critical for a patient\u2019s care, and any delay could have serious consequences. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: Dr. Lee\u2019s trust in my commitment, the hospital\u2019s reliance on my timely delivery. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between honoring my mentor\u2019s rare availability and fulfilling my duty to deliver life-saving supplies. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility I could let down, knowing that either choice would mean disappointing someone who counted on me."}
