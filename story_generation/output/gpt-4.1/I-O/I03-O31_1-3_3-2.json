For once, our schedules aligned, and my boyfriend and I could finally have a proper date night\u2014just the two of us, no interruptions. He\u2019d been dropping hints about a new restaurant, and I promised I\u2019d make time. As I was getting ready, my phone buzzed with an urgent call: an armed robbery in progress, just a few blocks away. My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me as a police officer\u2014drop everything, respond immediately, protect lives. But as a girlfriend, I\u2019d promised him my time, my attention, and tonight was supposed to be about us. I could already imagine the disappointment in his eyes if I canceled again. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my heart\u2014pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between duty and love, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
