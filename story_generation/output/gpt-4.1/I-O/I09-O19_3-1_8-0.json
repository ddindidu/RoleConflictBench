She was out of town for a week and wanted to know if any packages had arrived, especially since the building was about to have a planned power outage. She trusted me to keep an eye on things, and I\u2019d promised to help. As I was about to reply, a customer approached the counter with a prescription for a common cold. I checked the medication, double-checked the label, and was about to hand it over when my phone buzzed again\u2014Mrs. Lee, asking urgently if I could move a delivery inside before the outage.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. As a neighbor, I wanted to be reliable, to reassure Mrs. Lee that her things were safe. But as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t let my attention slip for a second; accuracy was everything, and even a small distraction could lead to a dangerous mistake. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my neighbor and the duty to my patient. I stood there, prescription in hand, phone vibrating in my pocket, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
