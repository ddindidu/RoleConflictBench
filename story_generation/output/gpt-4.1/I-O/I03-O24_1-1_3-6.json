I\u2019m free whenever you are.\u201d I smiled, picturing his easy grin, the way he always made me laugh after a long day. We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and I knew he was hoping for a real evening together\u2014no distractions, just us. I wanted that too. But as I set my phone down, my eyes landed on the thick law review journal on my desk, its glossy cover promising hours of dense, fascinating reading. The new issue had just arrived, packed with articles on emerging legal theories I needed to understand to stay sharp on the bench. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me: the expectation to be present and loving for Alex, and the professional demand to keep up with the ever-evolving world of law. My mind raced, weighing the warmth of his company against the quiet satisfaction of intellectual growth. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both needed all of me."}
