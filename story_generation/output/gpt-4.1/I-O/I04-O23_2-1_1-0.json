It was Sam, my oldest friend. His voice trembled, \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain in his words, the kind that only comes after a fight with someone you love. As his friend, I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through the mess of emotions. But as a lawyer, I also felt the weight of the contract waiting on my screen. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get ahead on my work tonight. My mind raced, torn between the comfort Sam needed and the professional standards I held myself to. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
