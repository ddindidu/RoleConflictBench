She was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten we were supposed to go hiking this weekend, and now she thought I didn\u2019t care. I could feel the tension in her words, the expectation that I\u2019d drop everything and reassure her, fix things before they got worse. But as I started typing a reply, I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. A group of teenagers was gathering at the deep end, laughing and edging dangerously close to the no-diving signs. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cNo exceptions. Safety first.\u201d I knew I had to act, to enforce the rules before someone got hurt. But Emily\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more urgent, and I felt torn in two\u2014my responsibility to her pulling me one way, my duty as a lifeguard pulling me the other. My heart pounded as I stood up, phone in hand, caught between the demands of the person I loved and the lives I was supposed to protect."}
