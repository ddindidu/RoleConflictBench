My phone buzzed with reminders: \u201cDon\u2019t miss this one, we\u2019ll cover the new project scope.\u201d I was supposed to be in the office, sitting with my colleagues, listening and contributing. But here I was, behind the wheel, filling in for a friend\u2019s taxi shift, trying to make ends meet. The route was already tight, and now a construction detour forced me into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, a school zone sign flashed, and children clustered near the curb, their laughter and sudden movements unpredictable. My passenger checked his watch, clearly in a hurry, but I knew I had to slow down, keep everyone safe, and obey the law. My mind raced\u2014if I stopped for the kids, I\u2019d miss the meeting and let my team down. If I rushed, I\u2019d risk their safety and my license. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My hands tightened on the wheel as I approached the crosswalk, torn between responsibility and obligation, not yet sure which role would win."}
