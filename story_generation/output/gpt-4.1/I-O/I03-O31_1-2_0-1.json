He\u2019d had a rough day at work, and I could feel the tension radiating from him. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around him, listen to his worries, and reassure him that everything would be okay.

As a police officer, I was expected to suit up, head out, and help keep the peace, no matter what was happening in my personal life. I glanced at Alex, torn.
