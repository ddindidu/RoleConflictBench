I knew the equipment was running smoothly, but protocol demanded every item be checked and logged. As I scrolled through my emails, I heard the front door open. My partner walked in, shoulders slumped, eyes red. He barely managed a smile before collapsing beside me. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d he whispered, voice trembling. \u201cMy boss said my project isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d I reached for his hand, feeling the weight of his disappointment. He needed me\u2014needed comfort, reassurance, someone to listen. But my mind kept drifting to the lab, to the checklist, to the possibility of missing something crucial and letting my team down.
