As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish this report by tonight. The client\u2019s project depended on it, and any delay would throw off the entire delivery schedule. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my other job as a housekeeping cleaner. I remembered the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner at the client\u2019s house. If I didn\u2019t buy more before the next cleaning, I\u2019d be unprepared and risk disappointing them. Both roles demanded my attention: my team needed my focus and timely work, while my cleaning client expected me to manage supplies and keep their home spotless. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between staying late to finish the report and rushing out to buy the cleaner before the store closed. My mind raced, weighing the consequences of letting down my colleagues versus failing my housekeeping responsibilities. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
