It was the last weekend before Mia left for her internship abroad, and we\u2019d promised to spend every moment together. She was waiting for me at the caf\u00e9 across the street, texting me updates about her coffee and the playlist she\u2019d made for us. But as I was closing out my shift, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few dollars off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still against store policy to ignore. My manager always emphasized accuracy, and I knew I was supposed to stay, recount, and fill out the discrepancy form. But every minute I spent here was a minute less with Mia, and I could already picture her glancing at the door, hoping I\u2019d walk in. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest from both sides. I wanted to be the reliable boyfriend she deserved, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down. My hands hovered over the register, caught between duty and love, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
