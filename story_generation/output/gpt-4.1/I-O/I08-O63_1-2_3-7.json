You know the area well\u2014can you recommend a good restaurant for tonight?\u201d I glanced at the clock. My break was scheduled in five minutes, but the call queue was already stacked, and management had sent another reminder about sticking to our break times. If I replied to Mark now, I\u2019d have to take my break early, risking a warning. But if I waited, he might think I was ignoring him or, worse, that I didn\u2019t care to help. As an acquaintance, I wanted to be helpful, maybe even strengthen our connection. As a telemarketer, I was expected to follow the rules, keep the calls moving, and not disrupt the tightly monitored schedule. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a quick reply and waiting for my official break, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing in on me."}
