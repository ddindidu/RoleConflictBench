Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a tired look as she passed, her arms full of groceries. I knew she expected me to keep the noise down, especially since her husband worked nights too. I tried to hush my dog, feeling the weight of her silent judgment. My phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. I was needed for a call: a man with a broken ankle across town. Not life-threatening, but urgent enough. I rushed to the garage, my mind still on the hallway. As I pulled the ambulance into traffic, the city was thick with cars, horns blaring. I was expected to get there quickly, but safely\u2014no reckless driving, no unnecessary risks. My neighbor\u2019s frustration echoed in my mind, and I wondered if I was failing at both roles. Should I have stayed to calm my dog, or was I already late for someone who needed me? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I gripped the wheel, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible ambulance driver."}
