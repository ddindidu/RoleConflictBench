She was about to submit a client report\u2014one with zero margin for error\u2014and she needed my guidance. I could hear the anxiety in her voice as she described her confusion over the data analysis section. As her mentor, I knew I should walk her through every step, share the tricks I\u2019d learned, and make sure she didn\u2019t make a costly mistake. But the clock on my screen blinked a warning: my scheduled break was in two minutes. If I missed it, the compliance system would flag me, and I\u2019d be one step closer to a formal warning. My supervisor had made it clear\u2014no exceptions, no unscheduled downtime. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the urge to help her and the fear of disciplinary action. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between the expectations of being a supportive mentor and a rule-abiding telemarketer."}
