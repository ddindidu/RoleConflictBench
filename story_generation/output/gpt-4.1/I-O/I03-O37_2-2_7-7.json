We\u2019d argued again last night about money\u2014he said I was too cautious, I said he was too reckless. I knew he expected me to reach out, to smooth things over, to be the one who always resolved our fights. But as I stood in the supply closet at work, the weight of my other role pressed in. My supervisor had just reminded us about the new safety protocols: gloves, masks, and extra sanitizing steps. I\u2019d been cutting corners lately, rushing to finish so I could get home early and talk to him, but now I felt the pressure to do everything by the book. My phone buzzed again. I wanted to call him, to fix things, but I also needed to focus, to keep my job and follow every hygiene rule. The mop handle felt heavy in my hand as I wrestled with what to do first, feeling pulled in two directions, each demanding more than I could give."}
