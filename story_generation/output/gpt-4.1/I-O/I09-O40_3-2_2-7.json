As a carpenter, I take pride in my work\u2014making sure every board is solid, every nail flush. But as I stepped out of the elevator, I saw a small group of neighbors gathered, their faces tense. The noise complaint had finally come to a head, and I was expected to be the friendly, approachable neighbor, smoothing things over with a smile and a calm word.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014Mrs. Lee, again, asking when I\u2019d arrive. She\u2019d been waiting all morning, and I knew her deck was a safety hazard. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the neighbor who should stay and help ease the tension, and the carpenter who needed to get to work, tools ready, to fix what was broken. My heart pounded as I stood in the lobby, caught between the expectation to be present and polite, and the urgent responsibility to repair. I could feel the eyes of my neighbors on me, waiting for me to choose."}
