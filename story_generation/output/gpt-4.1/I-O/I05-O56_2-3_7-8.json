My mentee, Sarah, was due in ten minutes, anxious about her upcoming interview for a promotion. She\u2019d asked for my guidance, hoping I could help her find the confidence and clarity she needed. As her mentor, I wanted to be fully present, to listen, to encourage her to push past her doubts and seize this opportunity. But just as I was rehearsing what I\u2019d say, my next hair client arrived, her hair thick with product, the strands matted and stubborn. She expected me to work my usual magic\u2014wash, condition, detangle, and style her hair to perfection. I could see the frustration in her eyes, the silent plea for comfort and transformation. My hands itched to get to work, but my mind was split. How could I give Sarah the attention she deserved while also meeting my client\u2019s expectations? The pressure built inside me, a tug-of-war between nurturing growth and delivering beauty, and I stood frozen, torn between two people who needed me in completely different ways."}
