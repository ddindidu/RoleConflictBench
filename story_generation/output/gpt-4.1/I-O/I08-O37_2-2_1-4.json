As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be friendly, especially now, with a new person in the group who looked like she wanted to disappear into the couch. I caught her eye and smiled, hoping to make her feel welcome. But my mind kept drifting to the supply closet. I\u2019d noticed earlier that the floor cleaner was almost gone, and I was responsible for making sure everything was stocked before the next cleaning. If I didn\u2019t act soon, I\u2019d be letting my client down. But if I excused myself now, I\u2019d seem rude and unapproachable, maybe even cold to the new girl who clearly needed a friendly face. I felt the pressure building inside me\u2014torn between being the warm acquaintance everyone expected and the diligent cleaner I was paid to be. My hands tightened around the tray as I tried to decide which role to prioritize, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
