She smiled politely, but I could sense her unease. Just this morning, my dog had barked loudly at her as she passed our door, and I\u2019d seen her flinch. Now, as I rang up her bread and milk, I felt the weight of both my roles pressing in. As a neighbor, I knew I should apologize, maybe promise to keep my dog quieter, but as a cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving and focus on the transaction. The next customer was already unloading their basket, and my manager glanced over, expecting efficiency. My heart pounded as I tried to decide whether to say something personal or just finish the sale. The beep of the scanner seemed louder than usual, and I could feel Mrs. Patel\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for a sign of acknowledgment or regret. I hesitated, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility I felt as her neighbor."}
