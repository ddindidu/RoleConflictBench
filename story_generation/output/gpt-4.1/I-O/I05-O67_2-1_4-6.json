My team was counting on me to walk them through the new triage protocols before our big project deadline. I could see their eager faces in my mind, waiting for guidance, expecting me to share the experience I\u2019d gained over the years. Just as I was about to head to the meeting room, my radio crackled. Dispatch needed the ambulance moved to the satellite station for the shift change\u2014immediately. I was the only available driver.\n\nI glanced at the clock, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the start of the session, letting down my mentees who needed me. But if I stayed, the ambulance wouldn\u2019t be in place for the next crew, and I\u2019d be failing my duty to keep the vehicle ready and drive it safely as required. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each vital in its own way. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of my team and the responsibility of my post, feeling the tension rise as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
