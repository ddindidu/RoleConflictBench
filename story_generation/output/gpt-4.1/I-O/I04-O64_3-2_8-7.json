Each customer expects a cheerful greeting, quick service, and a little small talk. But my mind is somewhere else\u2014just ten minutes ago, I saw a text from my friend, saying she was really hurt by something I said last night. My stomach twists with guilt. I know I should call her right now, explain myself, and apologize before the misunderstanding grows. That\u2019s what a good friend would do\u2014communicate, not let things fester. But the line stretches past the bakery, and my manager is watching. If I step away, I\u2019ll leave my coworkers stranded and customers frustrated. I can\u2019t just abandon my post, but every beep of the scanner feels like a countdown. My friend needs me, but so do these customers. I grip the counter, torn between the urge to grab my phone and the duty to keep smiling, my heart pounding with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
