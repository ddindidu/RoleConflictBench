She was already at the airport, asking if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries, especially since the building\u2019s power would be out for a day. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014last winter, she\u2019d shoveled my walkway when I was sick. I wanted to help, but my mind was already spinning with the project planning meeting scheduled for tomorrow. My manager had made it clear: the client\u2019s contract depended on my effort estimates, and any delay would cost us the deal. I knew I\u2019d need every spare minute tonight to review specs and run calculations. If I missed a delivery or the power outage caused a problem for Mrs. Kim, I\u2019d feel terrible. But if I didn\u2019t nail these estimates, my team would be in trouble. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
