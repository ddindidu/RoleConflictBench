The code sample she\u2019d assigned was more complex than I\u2019d expected, and she wanted it done before our next meeting in three days. I knew she\u2019d ask detailed questions, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But my shift as a cashier was about to start, and I had to put my mentee worries aside for now.\n\nAs I rang up customers, my mind kept drifting back to the unfinished code. Then, during a lull, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the total sales. Store policy said I should report any irregularity, no matter how minor. But if I did, I\u2019d have to fill out paperwork and stay late, eating into the precious time I\u2019d set aside to work on my assignment. My mentor expected me to be prepared, but my manager expected me to follow every procedure to the letter. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the two roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
