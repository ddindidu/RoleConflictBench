My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone to hit their numbers this week.\u201d I know if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll get that disappointed look and maybe lose out on the weekend bonus. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Alex: \u201cHey, which night do you want to go out? I\u2019m free all week, just want to spend some time together.\u201d I feel a pang of guilt. We\u2019ve both been so busy, and I promised we\u2019d have a real date this week. He\u2019s been patient, but I can sense he\u2019s hoping for more than just a quick dinner squeezed between work. My headset feels heavier as I stare at the screen, torn between dialing another number and replying to Alex. I want to be the girlfriend who makes time, but I also need to be the employee who delivers. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to answer first."}
