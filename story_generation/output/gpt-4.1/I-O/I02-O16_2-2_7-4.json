We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014this time about our budget, about how I never seemed to have time to talk things through. She wanted me to come home early, to finally sit down and resolve things. I knew she was right; I owed her my attention, my patience, my willingness to fix what was broken between us. But just as I was about to reply, my pager went off. Mrs. Patel, my new patient, had just learned she\u2019d be living with diabetes. Her daughter was waiting for me in the hallway, anxious and full of questions. They needed me to be calm, clear, and compassionate\u2014to explain, to reassure, to guide them through the uncertainty. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, my empathy, my best self. My heart raced as I stood between the door to the ward and the phone in my hand, torn by the impossible choice of who needed me more in that moment."}
