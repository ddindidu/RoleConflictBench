The line snaked past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently. My mind, though, was half with Jamie, my mentee, who had just texted me in a panic about missing another project deadline. I\u2019d promised to help Jamie develop better time management, to be available when they needed guidance. But right now, the store was packed, and my manager expected me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays.\n\nAs I handed a receipt to a customer, my phone buzzed again. Jamie\u2019s message was desperate, asking if I could talk for just five minutes. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my mentee needed support, but the customers and my boss needed efficiency. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the next transaction, torn between the urge to step away and help Jamie, and the responsibility to keep the checkout running smoothly.
