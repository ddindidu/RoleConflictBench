As an architect, I was expected to keep projects moving, but my style was relaxed\u2014I checked in on timelines, nudged things along, but rarely micromanaged. Today, though, my mentee, Sarah, hovered at my door, uncertainty written on her face. She wanted advice about whether to take on a new responsibility in her current project. Normally, I\u2019d offer a few words and let her decide, but she seemed genuinely lost, looking for more than my usual casual guidance.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the client meeting was in an hour, and I hadn\u2019t double-checked the team\u2019s progress on the latest design revisions. If I didn\u2019t review the updates now, we might miss a critical detail. But if I brushed Sarah off, I\u2019d fail her as a mentor. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding I be present and thorough, the other expecting me to be available and supportive. I felt torn, caught between the needs of my team and the needs of someone looking up to me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
