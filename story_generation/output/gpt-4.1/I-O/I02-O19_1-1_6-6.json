Our weekend plans had gotten mixed up\u2014she thought we were meeting her friends, but I\u2019d promised my parents I\u2019d visit. Her messages grew sharper, and I could feel the tension rising. I knew I should call her, talk it out, and smooth things over before it turned into something bigger. But in front of me was the latest pharmacy newsletter, full of updates on new drug releases and safety alerts. My manager always emphasized how important it was to stay current, and I\u2019d already missed the last two updates. If I didn\u2019t catch up now, I\u2019d fall behind, and I couldn\u2019t risk making a mistake at work. My thumb hovered over Mia\u2019s name, but my eyes kept darting back to the article on the new anticoagulant. The pressure built in my chest\u2014Mia needed me to be present, to listen and resolve things, but my professional responsibility demanded my focus. I felt torn, caught between the person I loved and the job I cared about, unsure which demand to answer first."}
