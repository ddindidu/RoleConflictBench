She\u2019s stuck on the final stage of her project, her anxiety practically leaping off the screen. As her mentor, I know she needs immediate guidance; I promised her I\u2019d be available for these moments, and I can\u2019t bear the thought of letting her down. But as a telemarketer, my world is ruled by the compliance system. Every second of unscheduled downtime is tracked, and I\u2019ve already been warned once this month. If I step away from my calls now to help Sarah, the system will flag me, and I could face disciplinary action. My headset feels heavier as I weigh my options. The expectation to be a reliable mentor clashes with the rigid demands of my telemarketing job. My heart pounds as I hover over the keyboard, torn between the urge to support Sarah and the fear of risking my own position."}
