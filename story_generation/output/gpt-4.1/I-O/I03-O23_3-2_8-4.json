My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I knew every minute of preparation mattered. But across the room, my boyfriend paced, his voice raw from our argument. We\u2019d been fighting for days, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. He looked at me, eyes pleading for answers, for some sign that I cared enough to fix this. I wanted to reach out, to talk it through, to show him I was committed to us. But my mind kept drifting to the case files on my laptop, the legal arguments I still needed to refine. He needed me to be present, to resolve our conflict before it broke us apart. My client needed me to be sharp, focused, and ready to fight for them in court. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding, unable to choose which role to answer first."}
