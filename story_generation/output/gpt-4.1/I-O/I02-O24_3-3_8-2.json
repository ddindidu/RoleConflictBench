My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia. Our argument from earlier still hung heavy in the air, her words echoing in my mind: \u201cIf you can\u2019t be here for us, what\u2019s the point?\u201d I knew she was waiting for me to call, to talk things through, to prove that I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I reached for my phone, an urgent email popped up: an emergency motion for a restraining order, demanding my immediate attention as a judge. The clock was ticking; I had less than an hour to read, analyze, and rule. My heart pounded as I stared at the files, guilt gnawing at me. Mia needed me to be present, to resolve our conflict, but the law demanded my focus and impartiality. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down, each expecting all of me, right now."}
