My phone buzzes\u2014it's Maya, my mentee, with a quick question about handling difficult customers. She always waits for these moments, catching me between calls, eager to learn from my experience. I want to help her, to share what I\u2019ve learned, but I also know management is watching. They\u2019ve sent two reminders this week alone: \u201cBreaks must be strictly timed. The queue is full.\u201d If I go over, it\u2019ll be flagged. If I ignore Maya, I\u2019ll let her down, and I remember how much I needed guidance when I started.
