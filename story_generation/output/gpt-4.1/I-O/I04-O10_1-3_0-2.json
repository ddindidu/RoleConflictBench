Can I vent for a bit?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20144:45 p.m. The external auditor\u2019s email was still open on my screen, the subject line glaring: \u201cURGENT: Financial Statements Needed ASAP.\u201d My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between opening Sarah\u2019s chat and finishing the reconciliations. As a friend, I knew she counted on me to listen, especially on days like this. But as an accountant, I couldn\u2019t ignore the pressure to deliver spotless records before the auditor\u2019s deadline. My mind raced, guilt prickling at the thought of letting Sarah down, but anxiety gnawing at the idea of missing a critical work task. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
