I don\u2019t know how she still has her job.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I always try to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but Mark was waiting for a response, his eyes expectant. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to send a prompt, formal reply. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014Mark\u2019s expectation for camaraderie through shared criticism, and my professional duty to maintain timely communication with vendors. My mind raced, torn between the urge to deflect Mark\u2019s comment without offending him and the need to step away to fulfill my accounting responsibilities. The weight of these conflicting demands pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
