She\u2019d been clear: \u201cHave it ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. But my headset buzzed, reminding me of my telemarketer shift. The call volume was light today, and my supervisor had said we could take breaks whenever, as long as we stuck to our hours. I could use this lull to work on the code, but I knew I was supposed to be available, ready to jump on any incoming call. If I got caught coding during work, it could mean a warning\u2014or worse. Yet, if I waited until after my shift, I\u2019d be exhausted, and the code would suffer. My mentor expected commitment, my job expected presence. I felt the pressure building, torn between wanting to prove myself as a mentee and needing to keep my job. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
