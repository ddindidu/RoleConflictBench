The project pitch is in two hours. I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d As her mentor, I knew how much this moment meant\u2014her whole career could pivot on this presentation. She needed my encouragement, my guidance, and I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to help her find her confidence. But just then, a passenger slid into the back seat of my cab, their cologne sharp and their briefcase pristine. \u201cAirport, please. And could you make sure the seat\u2019s clean? I have allergies.\u201d I caught sight of a stray coffee lid on the floor mat and felt a flush of embarrassment. My mind raced: should I pull over and clean, risking a delay, or focus on my mentee\u2019s crisis, possibly neglecting my passenger\u2019s comfort?

My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
