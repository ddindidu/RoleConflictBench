As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to be open about the conflict brewing with my teammates\u2014our arguments over task ownership had already delayed our deliverables. My mentor always said, \u201cTell me early if you hit a wall.\u201d But as an engineer, I was also expected to join the project planning call in ten minutes and give management a solid estimate for the next quarter. They needed numbers, not excuses, and I could already hear the impatience in their last email. My mind raced: if I told my mentor, it might help, but it would also mean admitting I couldn\u2019t keep the project on track. If I focused on the planning call, I\u2019d have to fudge the estimates, knowing the conflict made any timeline a guess. My stomach twisted as I weighed honesty against responsibility, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, demanding different things at the same time."}
