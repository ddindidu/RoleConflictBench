She\u2019d just gotten some harsh feedback at work, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my words, my comfort, the reassurance that she was more than her boss\u2019s opinion. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to tell her she was enough. But as I reached for my phone, the cabin door slid open. The transit authority supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cUnannounced audit,\u201d he said, settling into the observer\u2019s seat. My heart thudded.
