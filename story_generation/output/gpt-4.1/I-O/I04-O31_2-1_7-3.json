It was a message from Sam, my closest friend. His reply was curt, almost cold. I scrolled up and realized my earlier text could have sounded harsh, though I hadn\u2019t meant it that way. Sam and I always promised to talk things out, never let misunderstandings fester. I knew I should call him right now, clear the air before it grew into something bigger.\n\nBut as a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just about looking good\u2014it\u2019s about being able to protect people, to do my job. I\u2019d already missed two workouts this week because of overtime. If I skipped today, I\u2019d be letting down my team, maybe even putting someone at risk. My phone felt heavy in my hand. I could picture Sam waiting for my call, but I could also hear my sergeant\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that fitness is part of the job. My heart pounded, torn between the friend who needed me and the duty I owed to my badge."}
