I could almost hear the disappointment in her voice. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her right away, talk it through, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. But my headset beeped, and I was connected to Mr. Harris, a customer notorious for his skepticism. He was already raising his voice, demanding to know why our offer was any different from the last one he\u2019d been pitched. My manager expected me to keep him on the line, answer every objection, and not let the call end in another lost sale.
