My manager had made it clear: this document was the linchpin for the client\u2019s delivery, and the deadline was non-negotiable. My phone buzzed with reminders, and I could almost feel my colleagues\u2019 eyes on me, silently urging me to get it done. Just as I was about to attach the final file, I glanced out the window and saw a slick, glistening puddle in the walkway\u2014oil, maybe, or some chemical. As a laborer, I knew the rules: any spill, no matter how small, had to be cleaned up immediately. Safety first, always. But if I left my desk now, I\u2019d miss the deadline and let my team down. My heart pounded as I stared at the spill, torn between the urgent demands of my two worlds. The weight of responsibility pressed on me from both sides, and I felt frozen, caught in the impossible space between being a reliable colleague and a responsible laborer."}
