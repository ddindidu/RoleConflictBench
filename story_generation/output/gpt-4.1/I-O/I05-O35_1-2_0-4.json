As I started typing a thoughtful reply, the radio crackled: \u201cUnattended bag reported in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart thudded. The safety of hundreds of passengers depended on my swift response. But Jamie\u2019s message blinked on my screen, a silent plea for direction. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one expecting calm, practical advice, the other demanding immediate, decisive action. My mind raced, torn between the intern\u2019s trust and the passengers\u2019 safety, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
