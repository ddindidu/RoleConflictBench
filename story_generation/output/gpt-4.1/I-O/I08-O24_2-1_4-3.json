He was moving to a new apartment and asked if I could help him move a few boxes this weekend. I could almost hear the hope in his message\u2014he didn\u2019t have many friends in town, and I knew he\u2019d helped me once before when my car broke down. As an acquaintance, I felt a pull to return the favor, to be supportive and not let him down.\n\nBut as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. I had a new case assigned just yesterday, and the scheduling order was due by the end of the week. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough and timely, to draft clear and detailed orders that set the tone for the entire case. The court relied on me, and any delay could ripple through the docket, affecting lawyers, clients, and even other judges.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Mark\u2019s request was simple, but the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to help a friend and the duty to uphold my professional responsibilities."}
