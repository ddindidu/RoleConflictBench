The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and I knew everyone expected me to be there, to show I cared about the group and our progress\u2014even if it was just a routine catch-up that would be recorded. At the same time, my project lead pinged me, asking if I could join an impromptu planning session. As the engineer, I was supposed to give accurate time estimates for the next sprint, and even though the session was informal and the timeline flexible, I knew my input would shape how the work was divided.\n\nI stared at the two invites, feeling the pressure build. If I skipped the team meeting, would my colleagues think I didn\u2019t value our connection? But if I missed the planning session, would the project suffer from poor estimates? I wanted to be a reliable teammate and a responsible engineer, but right now, it felt impossible to be both. My hand hovered over the mouse, torn between two windows, my mind racing with the weight of expectations from both sides."}
