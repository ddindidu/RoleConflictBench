The store was quiet, the kind of slow afternoon where every word seemed to echo. As I handed a receipt to the woman in front of me, I noticed Mark, an acquaintance from my old book club, step up with a basket. He smiled, then leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you hear about Jenna? She totally messed up the inventory last week. Management\u2019s not happy.\u201d \n\nAs an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but as a cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving and process transactions accurately. Mark\u2019s words hung in the air, and I felt my hands falter as I scanned his items. I could sense the next customer watching, waiting for me to finish. My mind raced\u2014should I ignore Mark\u2019s comment and focus on my job, or should I say something to steer the conversation away from gossip, risking an awkward moment in front of the other customers? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between what was expected of me as a cashier and as an acquaintance."}
