My mentor had finally found a sliver of time for me\u2014a brief meeting squeezed between her endless appointments. I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of it. But as I prepared my notes, a notification flashed on my screen: the specialized instrument I needed for my experiment was available only during the exact window of our meeting. The next chance wouldn\u2019t come for weeks, and my data collection was already behind schedule. As a scientist, I was expected to seize every opportunity to test my hypotheses, to push my project forward. But as a mentee, I was supposed to show respect and gratitude, to be present and prepared when my mentor made herself available. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my mentor and responsibility to my research. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone\u2014or something\u2014down."}
