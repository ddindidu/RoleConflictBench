My cheeks ached from smiling, and I kept my voice upbeat, \u201cHi, how are you today?\u201d Then, I saw her\u2014Maya, someone I knew from my building, eyes red and cheeks streaked with tears. She clutched a carton of milk, barely meeting my gaze. As her acquaintance, I wanted to step out from behind the counter, offer a hug, and ask what happened. But as the cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving, stay cheerful, and not get too personal. The customers behind her shifted impatiently, glancing at their watches. My heart twisted. I could see Maya needed comfort, not just a transaction, but the store manager was watching, and the register beeped for the next item. I felt torn, caught between the urge to be a caring friend and the pressure to be an efficient cashier, my hands hovering uncertainly over the register as I tried to decide what to do next."}
