I knew I should reach out, explain the problem, but my shift as a taxi driver had just started. Two travelers waved me down, their arms full of suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I forced a smile, feeling the weight of their expectation for quick, professional service. My mind raced: if I paused to message my mentor now, I\u2019d keep these customers waiting, risking a complaint or a bad review. But if I waited until after the ride, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, possibly delaying the whole project. My phone buzzed again in my pocket as I hoisted a suitcase, torn between the demands of both worlds, my heart pounding with the pressure of choosing which role to disappoint."}
