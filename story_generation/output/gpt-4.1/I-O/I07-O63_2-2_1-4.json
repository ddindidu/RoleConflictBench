My heart pounds as I stare at the list of leads, knowing I\u2019m still three sales short of my weekly target. Management has been clear: missing targets isn\u2019t an option if I want to keep this job. I reach for the phone, but just then, a calendar reminder pops up. The team meeting is starting in five minutes. It\u2019s not just any meeting; this one will cover key project updates that won\u2019t be summarized later. My colleagues expect me to be there, to participate and show I\u2019m part of the team. If I skip, I\u2019ll let them down and risk missing out on crucial information. But if I join, I\u2019ll lose precious time to make those last sales calls. My stomach twists as I hover between the meeting link and the phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I can\u2019t ignore."}
