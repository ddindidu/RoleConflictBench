One was the dense, technical document my mentor had suggested I read\u2014optional, he\u2019d said, but I knew he expected me to be prepared for our next meeting. The other was the new safety standard, just released, that would soon govern our next product launch. As an engineer, I was responsible for making sure our design met every requirement, and the deadline for submitting evidence of compliance was looming.\n\nMy mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTake your time, but I think you\u2019ll find this reading really valuable.\u201d I wanted to impress him, to show I was committed to learning. But the pressure from my engineering team was mounting. \u201cWe need your analysis on the new standard by Friday,\u201d my manager had said, his tone leaving no room for delay.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. Should I dive into the reading to honor my mentor\u2019s trust, or focus on the urgent compliance work that my team\u2014and the company\u2014was counting on? My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
