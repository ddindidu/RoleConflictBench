My mentor had squeezed in a quick meeting for me between her appointments, a rare chance I couldn\u2019t afford to waste. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be fully present, respectful of her time, and ready with questions. But just as I was about to step into the back room, the salon door chimed. The bride-to-be and her entourage swept in, faces tense, eyes darting to the clock. They were early, and the nervous energy was palpable. As the hairdresser, I was expected to greet them warmly, offer reassurance, and help them settle in\u2014especially today, when everything had to be perfect. I could feel their anxiety radiating, and I knew a warm welcome could make all the difference. But my mentor was waiting, and I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or distracted. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to my clients, both expecting my full attention at the same moment."}
