Had a rough day.\u201d My heart sinks. I know she\u2019s been working hard on that presentation, and the feedback didn\u2019t go as she hoped. I want to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that she\u2019s more than her boss\u2019s opinion. But as I look up from my phone, my laptop screen is filled with project timelines and emails from contractors. The site inspection is tomorrow, and I still haven\u2019t checked if the structural drawings are up to date. My team expects me to keep things moving, to catch mistakes before they become disasters. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mia needs me to be present, to care, to listen. My team needs me to be focused, to lead, to deliver. My mind races, torn between the urge to call Mia right now and the responsibility to double-check the project files. I can\u2019t shake the guilt, knowing that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
