Why don\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d My thumb hovers over the screen, wanting to call her, to explain, to smooth things over before the misunderstanding grows. But my laptop pings\u2014a new email from the court clerk. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order has just landed on my desk, and I\u2019m expected to review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. \n\nMy mind races. As Mia\u2019s boyfriend, I know she expects me to resolve conflicts quickly, to show her she\u2019s a priority. But as a judge, I\u2019m bound by duty to give this urgent case my full, undivided attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I can\u2019t give to the other. My chest tightens as I stare at the phone, then at the stack of legal documents. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I can\u2019t let either side down."}
