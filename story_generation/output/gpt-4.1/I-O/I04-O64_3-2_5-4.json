I glanced at the screen and saw a frantic message from my best friend: her car had broken down on the highway, and she was scared, stranded in the dark. She begged me to come get her right away. My heart raced\u2014I knew she needed me, and I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and rush to her side. But just then, a customer approached the counter, holding a blender and looking frustrated. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said. I knew the policy: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had been clear\u2014no exceptions, even if the customer got upset. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between my duty as a friend and my responsibility as a cashier. My friend\u2019s desperate texts kept coming, but the customer was waiting for my answer, her eyes pleading. I stood there, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
