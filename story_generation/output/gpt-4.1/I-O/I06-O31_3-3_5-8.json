The truth was, my teammates and I had hit a wall\u2014arguments flared daily, and our deliverable was slipping through our fingers. I knew I should reach out, be honest, and ask for help, just as my mentor expected. But then my police radio crackled, and I was reminded of my other duty. I\u2019d just received a court summons, scheduled for the same day as our project\u2019s final review.
