I knew it was Mia\u2014her texts had been coming in rapid bursts since our argument this morning. She\u2019d said she couldn\u2019t keep doing this, that maybe we needed a break. My chest tightened every time I thought about it. But right now, I was at the register, counting out the day\u2019s final cash drop. The numbers had to be perfect; one slip and I\u2019d be responsible for hundreds of dollars missing. My manager expected nothing less than total focus, especially at closing. But my mind kept drifting to Mia\u2019s words, her voice trembling with hurt. I wanted to call her, to fix things before it was too late, but the line of customers was growing, and the safe was open in front of me. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the boyfriend who could make things right, the other forced to be the cashier who couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake. My hands shook as I tried to count the bills, my heart pounding with the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
