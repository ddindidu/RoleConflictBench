My boyfriend\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just gotten some tough feedback at work, and I could almost hear the heaviness in his words. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him, to be the girlfriend he needed right now. But just as I started to type a reply, my pager beeped. Room 214. Mrs. Harris, fresh out of surgery, had slightly elevated vitals. As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to check on her immediately, record her temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and alert the nurse if anything seemed off. My heart twisted. My boyfriend needed my comfort, but my patient needed my care. I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to call him and the duty to rush to Mrs. Harris\u2019s bedside, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
