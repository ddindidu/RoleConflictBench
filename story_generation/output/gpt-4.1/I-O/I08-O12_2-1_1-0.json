As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug: I should go over, smile, and help her feel at ease. That\u2019s what people expect from me, to be warm and welcoming, especially to someone who looks so out of place. But my mind kept drifting back to the half-finished code waiting on my laptop at home. I\u2019d been meaning to refactor that old module, and with the rare luxury of a generous deadline, I could finally do it right\u2014write something clean, something I\u2019d be proud to maintain. The urge to slip away, to open my editor and lose myself in logic, was almost overwhelming. Yet, here I was, torn between the gentle pressure to be present and friendly, and the quiet, persistent call of my craft. My heart thudded with indecision, caught between the warmth of human connection and the cool satisfaction of perfect code."}
