Our argument from this morning had spiraled out of control, and now he was threatening to walk away if I didn\u2019t call him back immediately. My heart pounded with panic\u2014I knew I needed to talk to him, to fix things before it was too late. But the line at my register was long, and the end-of-shift rush meant I was handling hundreds of dollars in cash and credit. My manager had just reminded me how important it was to double-check every transaction, especially now, when one mistake could throw off the entire day\u2019s balance. I tried to focus on the bills in my hand, but my mind kept drifting to Alex\u2019s words, the fear of losing him gnawing at me.
