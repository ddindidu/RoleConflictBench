My manager expects me to keep things moving, double-check prices, and never make mistakes, especially now, when the store is packed. Suddenly, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s Jamie, my best friend, who just moved into her new apartment. She\u2019s panicking\u2014her message says she\u2019s stuck halfway through assembling her bed, the instructions make no sense, and she\u2019s asking if I can hop on a quick video call to help her figure it out. I know she\u2019s overwhelmed and alone, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, especially after her rough week. But I can\u2019t just leave the register, not with this crowd and my supervisor watching. My heart pounds as I glance at the growing line, then at my phone, torn between the friend who needs me and the job that demands my full attention."}
