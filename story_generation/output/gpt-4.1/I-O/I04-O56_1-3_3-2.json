It was Mia, my oldest friend, her name flashing with a desperate text: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with this furniture and need help.\u201d I glanced at the bridal party, their anxious eyes darting around the salon, clearly expecting warmth and reassurance from me. But Mia\u2019s message tugged at me\u2014she\u2019d just moved into her new place, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d always be there for her, especially during tough moments like this. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the calming, professional hairdresser these women needed, or the loyal friend Mia counted on. I could feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be both, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly give my best to either at the same time."}
