It\u2019s not a critical bug, but they want it fixed before tomorrow\u2019s release. I know it\u2019s a quick fix, but my mind is elsewhere. My boyfriend\u2019s words from earlier echo in my head\u2014he\u2019s hurt, frustrated, and now he\u2019s questioning if we should even be together. I promised I\u2019d call him tonight to talk things through, to try and resolve this mess before it gets worse. But my laptop pings again, a reminder that the team is waiting on me. I feel pulled in two directions: the expectation to be present and supportive as a girlfriend, to help us heal, and the demand to be reliable and responsive as a developer, to keep the project on track. My heart pounds as I sit at my desk, torn between opening my code editor and dialing his number, knowing that whichever I choose, I\u2019m letting someone down."}
