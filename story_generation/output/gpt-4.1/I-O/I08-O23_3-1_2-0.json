As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to sit beside her, offer comfort, and listen to whatever had left her so distraught. I knew she expected me to be present, to show warmth and understanding. But as a lawyer, I was also aware of the client\u2019s contract in my inbox\u2014routine, yes, and not urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely. My reputation depended on it. I could almost hear my client\u2019s voice, expecting professionalism and attention to detail. I stood there, torn, my heart aching for Jamie and my mind racing with legal clauses and deadlines. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
