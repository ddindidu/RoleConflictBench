As a mentee, I know I should reach out to Dr. Patel, my mentor, and let her know about the technical hurdle that\u2019s brought my project to a standstill. She\u2019s always emphasized the importance of open communication, especially when things go wrong. But as a scientist, I\u2019m painfully aware that the journal deadline is just two days away. The expectation is clear: my report and datasets must be complete, accurate, and submitted on time. If I admit the problem now, I risk delaying the entire submission and letting down the team. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m hiding a flaw that could compromise the integrity of our research. My inbox blinks with a new message from Dr. Patel, asking for a progress update. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between honesty and the pressure to deliver. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t decide which expectation to meet first."}
