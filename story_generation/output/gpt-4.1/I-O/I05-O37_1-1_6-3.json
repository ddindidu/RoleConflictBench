She\u2019d missed another deadline, and I could sense her frustration growing. As her mentor, I wanted to encourage her, help her find strategies to manage her time better, and remind her that setbacks are part of growth. I started typing a supportive reply, but the clatter of bottles in the supply closet snapped me back to my other reality. As the housekeeping cleaner, I was responsible for making sure the supplies were stocked and organized. The manager had been clear: no more last-minute shortages. I scanned the shelves, realizing we were low on disinfectant and sponges\u2014again. My mind tugged in two directions: Jamie needed my guidance now, but if I didn\u2019t finish the inventory, the household would be in chaos tomorrow. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me not to let anyone down. My phone buzzed again, and I stood frozen, torn between the needs of someone\u2019s growth and the demands of a spotless, well-stocked home."}
