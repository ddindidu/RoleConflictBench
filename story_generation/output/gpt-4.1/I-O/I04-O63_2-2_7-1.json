I read it and my stomach drops\u2014he thinks I was being sarcastic in my last text, and he sounds genuinely hurt. I know I should call him right away, clear things up, and talk it through like we always do. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But I\u2019m sitting at my desk, headset on, staring at the blinking light on my screen. Another call is coming in. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to answer every question about our new service, even when the script barely covers the technical stuff. My supervisor is watching, and I can\u2019t afford to lose focus or skip a call. The pressure to perform is intense\u2014every second counts, every objection needs a smooth answer. My heart pounds as I glance at my phone, torn between the urge to be there for Sam and the demand to stay professional. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the weight of both expectations presses down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
