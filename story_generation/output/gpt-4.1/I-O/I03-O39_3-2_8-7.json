Our argument last night still hangs heavy in the air, unresolved and raw. He\u2019s just texted: \u201cWe need to talk now. I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My heart pounds. I know if I don\u2019t respond, he\u2019ll think I don\u2019t care, that I\u2019m giving up on us. But the foreman\u2019s whistle pierces the morning chill, and the crew is already gathering for the safety briefing. If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get written up\u2014again. The guys are counting on me to be there, focused and ready, not distracted by personal drama. I stare at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, torn between the desperate need to fix things with Alex and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I can feel myself splitting in two, unable to be what everyone needs at the same time."}
