I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of neighbor who smiled in the hallway and remembered birthdays. As I wrapped the cake, my phone buzzed\u2014a client had emailed a contract for review. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew the expectation: be thorough, be prompt, always stay ahead. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I might catch Mrs. Kim next door before she left for work. But the contract nagged at me; what if I missed a clause, what if I forgot a detail? My mind spun between the warmth of a neighborly gesture and the cold precision of legal review. I could almost hear my own voice, rehearsing pleasantries for Mrs. Kim, while another part of me mentally outlined the contract\u2019s key points. The cake cooled on the counter, the laptop glowed on the table, and I stood in the middle, torn between being the neighbor I wanted to be and the lawyer I was expected to be."}
