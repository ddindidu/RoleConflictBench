I knew I needed to call her right away, to explain, to fix this before it grew into something bigger. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the register screen. There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: I had to report it immediately, fill out the paperwork, and wait for the supervisor. No exceptions, even if it was a tiny mistake. My friend\u2019s pain tugged at me, but so did the weight of my responsibility as a cashier. I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that procedures come first. My hands shook as I held my phone, torn between the urge to call my friend and the duty to follow the rules. The minutes ticked by, each one stretching the distance between me and the person who needed me most."}
