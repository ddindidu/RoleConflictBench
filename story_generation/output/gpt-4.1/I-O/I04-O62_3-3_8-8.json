I replay my careless words from lunch, realizing how they must have sounded. I know I need to call Jamie right now, to apologize, to explain, to fix what I\u2019ve broken before it festers. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, don\u2019t let misunderstandings grow.\n\nBut as I reach for my phone, a shrill whistle pierces the air.
