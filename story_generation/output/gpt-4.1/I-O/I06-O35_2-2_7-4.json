She\u2019d carved out just fifteen minutes for me, squeezed between her own endless obligations. I knew how much she valued punctuality and respect for her time\u2014she\u2019d said as much, more than once. I was already rehearsing my questions, determined not to waste a second. But as I prepared to step away from the operator\u2019s cabin, the radio crackled: \u201cUnattended bag reported, car three. Possible security risk.\u201d My heart thudded. Protocol was clear\u2014passenger safety came first. I was supposed to investigate immediately, reassure the riders, and coordinate with security if needed. But if I missed this meeting, I might not get another chance for weeks. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My mentor\u2019s trust, my passengers\u2019 safety\u2014both demanded my full attention, right now. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, the seconds ticking by."}
