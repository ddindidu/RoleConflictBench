The conversation teetered on the edge of gossip, and I felt the familiar tug of discomfort. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid speaking negatively about others, but the group\u2019s curiosity was infectious, and they kept glancing at me, expecting my input. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: the latest issue of the law review journal had just been released. As a judge, I was expected to stay current on legal developments, and I knew I should be reading those articles, not sitting here. The pressure mounted\u2014my friends wanted me to join in, to share what I knew about Mark\u2019s decisions, while my professional conscience nagged at me to leave and focus on my judicial responsibilities. I felt torn, caught between the pull of social expectations and the weight of my duty to the law, unsure which demand to answer first."}
