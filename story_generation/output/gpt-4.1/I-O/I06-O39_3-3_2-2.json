My mentor\u2019s message glared at me: \u201cSend the completed report tonight. Upper management reviews it first thing tomorrow.\u201d I knew how important this was\u2014my mentor had trusted me with a critical assignment, and I couldn\u2019t let them down. But just as I started to type a response, the foreman\u2019s shout cut through the noise. The crane was lowering a massive steel beam, and I was needed to help guide it into place. The whole crew was waiting; if I didn\u2019t act now, the beam would hang dangerously, delaying the project and risking safety. My hands shook as I looked from the dangling beam to my phone. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and I could feel the pressure mounting in my chest. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I knew that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
