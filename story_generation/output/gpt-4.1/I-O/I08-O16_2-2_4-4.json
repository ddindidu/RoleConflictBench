He was moving to a new apartment and asked if I could help him move a few boxes that evening. I remembered how, years ago, he\u2019d helped me out when I was in a bind, and I felt a tug of obligation to return the favor. At the same time, as I was about to leave, Mrs. Patel\u2019s daughter stopped me in the hallway. Her mother had just been diagnosed with diabetes, and she looked overwhelmed, clutching a notepad full of questions. I could see the worry in her eyes, and I knew how important it was to take the time to explain everything clearly and compassionately. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, I wanted to be there for Mark, to show I valued our connection and repay his kindness. On the other, I knew my patient and her family needed my support and expertise right now. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, my phone buzzing in my pocket, unsure which role I could let down."}
