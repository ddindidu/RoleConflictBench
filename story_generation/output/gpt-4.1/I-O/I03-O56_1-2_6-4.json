We\u2019d had a silly misunderstanding about our weekend plans\u2014he thought I\u2019d promised to visit his parents, but I\u2019d already made plans with my friends. He wanted to talk, to clear things up, and I knew he expected me to smooth things over, like I always did. But right now, I was standing behind a new client, her eyes fixed on the mirror, lips pressed tight. She\u2019d asked for a warm caramel, but the tone looked a little too ashy under the salon lights. I could see her disappointment, and as her hairdresser, I was supposed to fix it, reassure her, make sure she left happy. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, and I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my boyfriend\u2019s need for reassurance, my client\u2019s need for confidence in my work. I could feel myself pulled in two directions, my mind racing with what to say to him, what to say to her, and how to be the person both of them needed right now."}
