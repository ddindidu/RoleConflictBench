As a neighbor, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t clutter the curb with unnecessary bins, especially when space is tight on pickup day. But as an architect, my mind was elsewhere, tangled in the details of the hospital wing I was designing. I\u2019d spent hours ensuring every inch was functional, every route efficient\u2014no wasted space, no overlooked need. That same logic nagged at me now: why not fill the bins to capacity, maybe even offer space to neighbors who had overflow? It would be the most efficient use of our shared resource. Yet, I could already imagine Mrs. Lee\u2019s frown if I moved her bin or the grumble from Mr. Patel about \u201coverstepping.\u201d My architect\u2019s instinct to optimize clashed with my neighborly duty to respect boundaries. I hovered by the bins, torn between maximizing function and maintaining harmony, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in as the evening light faded."}
