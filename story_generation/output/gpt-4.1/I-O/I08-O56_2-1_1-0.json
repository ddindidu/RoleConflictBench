She\u2019s new here, and I can see the nerves in her tight smile. As her acquaintance, I want to be warm and welcoming, maybe introduce her to a few people, help her feel at ease. But just as I\u2019m about to walk over, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that my shift at the salon starts in ten minutes. I rush across the street, still thinking about Jamie, and slip into my hairdresser role. The bell jingles as Mrs. Patel, my regular, enters. She beams at me, expecting our usual cheerful banter and a relaxing experience. The receptionist is free, chatting idly, but Mrs. Patel looks straight at me, waiting for my greeting. I feel pulled in two directions: the urge to be a supportive friend to Jamie, and the professional expectation to give Mrs. Patel my full attention. My mind races, torn between the comfort I want to offer Jamie and the comfort Mrs. Patel expects from me. I stand at the threshold, heart pounding, unsure which role to step into first."}
