The production floor was quiet, but the machine\u2019s intermittent glitch gnawed at me\u2014I knew if I didn\u2019t catch it now, it would resurface at the worst possible time. My phone buzzed on the workbench. I glanced at the screen: an urgent email from leadership, subject line flagged, asking for a quick confirmation on details for an external partner. I knew they expected a prompt reply; the deal was time-sensitive, and my input was crucial. But if I left the machine now, I might lose the chance to observe the glitch in action, and the repair could drag on for days. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team as a reliable colleague and the technical duty to keep our equipment running smoothly. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed the consequences of delay on either side, feeling the tug of both roles, each demanding my immediate attention."}
