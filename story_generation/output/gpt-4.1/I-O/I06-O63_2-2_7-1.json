My mentor had carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me\u2014her only free slot in a day packed with meetings. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation, and I wanted to show her I respected her time. But just as I was about to log off my telemarketing system, my phone lit up with another call. The prospect on the line was full of questions about our new service\u2014questions that went far beyond the script. I could hear the curiosity and hesitation in his voice, and I knew that if I brushed him off, I\u2019d lose a potential sale and fail my team\u2019s expectations to handle objections thoroughly. My mind raced: if I cut him short, I\u2019d be disrespecting his needs and possibly my job\u2019s standards. But if I stayed, I\u2019d risk being late for my mentor, letting her down after she\u2019d made time for me. My hands trembled as I tried to juggle the demands, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting my full attention at the same impossible moment."}
