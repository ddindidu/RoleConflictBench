I could tell from the curt reply that they\u2019d misread my earlier text\u2014my joke must have sounded harsh. I knew Jamie well enough to sense the hurt behind their words, and I felt a pang of guilt. I should call them right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the lab bench. The safety audit was in less than an hour, and I still hadn\u2019t recalibrated the centrifuge or checked the chemical storage logs. Last week, the inspector had already flagged a few minor issues, and my supervisor had made it clear: no more mistakes. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to reassure my friend and the professional responsibility to ensure everything in the lab was perfect. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s voice, hurt and confused, but I could also picture my supervisor\u2019s disappointment if the audit went poorly. My hands trembled as I stood between the phone and the lab equipment, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
