We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014his tone still echoed in my mind, sharp and tired. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, try to smooth things over, maybe even apologize for my stubbornness. But my work phone rang, and I stared at the caller ID: Mrs. Evans. Her voice trembled as she explained the termite damage in her house, the urgency in her words impossible to ignore. As a carpenter, I was expected to inspect, plan, and reassure her that her home wouldn\u2019t collapse. My toolbox was already by the door, but my heart felt split. Mark needed me to be present, to help us find peace. Mrs. Evans needed me to be decisive, to save her home. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing between the two roles, unsure which demand to answer first."}
