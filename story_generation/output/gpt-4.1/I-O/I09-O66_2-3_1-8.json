I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of friendly, polite neighbor people remembered. As I stepped into the hallway, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled, and I knew this was my chance. But just then, my phone buzzed\u2014another ride request. The app showed a passenger waiting nearby, sending urgent messages: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being prompt and professional.
