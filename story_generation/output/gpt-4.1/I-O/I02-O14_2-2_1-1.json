I really need you.\u201d She\u2019s had a rough day\u2014her boss criticized her project, and I know how much she poured into it. I want nothing more than to hold her, listen, and remind her she\u2019s brilliant. But I\u2019m standing in the lab, surrounded by humming equipment. The mass spectrometer, booked weeks in advance, is finally mine for the next three hours. If I miss this window, my experiment\u2014months in the making\u2014will be delayed indefinitely. My advisor expects results by next week, and the data could make or break my thesis. I stare at the vials lined up on the bench, then at Mia\u2019s text, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands tremble as I try to focus, but my mind is split\u2014torn between being the partner she needs and the scientist I\u2019ve worked so hard to become."}
