My mentee, Sarah, had just messaged me, anxious about her project\u2019s looming deadline. She needed my guidance, and I\u2019d promised her a check-in this afternoon. But at the same time, my headset buzzed with the voice of Mr. Jenkins, a long-time customer, his tone sharp and suspicious. \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t another scam?\u201d he demanded, his frustration palpable. My script urged me to stay calm, address his objections, and keep him on the line. Yet, my mind kept drifting to Sarah, picturing her waiting for my feedback, counting on me to help her through her confusion. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the expectation to be a patient, attentive mentor and the pressure to be a persuasive, unflappable telemarketer. Both needed me, right now, in completely different ways. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which role to answer first, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at once."}
