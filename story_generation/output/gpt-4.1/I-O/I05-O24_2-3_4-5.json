As a mentor, I had promised my team a structured session this afternoon, carefully preparing materials to teach them the skills they\u2019d need before the looming project deadline. They were counting on me to guide them, to share what I\u2019d learned, and I could already picture their eager faces waiting in the conference room. But just as I was about to leave my chambers, the bail hearing ended, and the clerk handed me the file. As a judge, I was expected to draft and sign the order immediately\u2014someone\u2019s freedom depended on my clear, detailed legal opinion. The defendant was still in custody, waiting for my decision to be put into writing. My mind raced, torn between the urgent legal responsibility and my commitment to my mentees. I could feel the tension in my chest, knowing that whichever role I chose to fulfill first, I would be letting someone down."}
