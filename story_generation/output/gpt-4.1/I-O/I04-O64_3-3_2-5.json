My shift was almost over, but I still had to complete the large cash deposit\u2014every bill, every receipt, double-checked and logged, just as the store demanded. The rules were clear: no distractions, no shortcuts, or I\u2019d risk my job. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw my best friend\u2019s name flashing. I answered, and immediately heard her sobbing. She could barely speak, her words tumbling out about her father\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to just be there. My heart twisted. I wanted to drop everything, to give her my full attention, to be the friend she deserved. But the cash drawer was open, the cameras were watching, and the deposit had to be done by the book. I stared at the money, the phone pressed to my ear, torn between the friend who needed my heart and the job that demanded my focus."}
