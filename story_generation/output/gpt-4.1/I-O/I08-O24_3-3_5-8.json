It\u2019s Sam, an old friend, texting frantically\u2014her car\u2019s broken down on a deserted road, and she\u2019s scared. I glance at the message, heart pounding, but before I can respond, my clerk rushes over, whispering that the Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I\u2019m about to instruct the jury on. The courtroom is silent, all eyes on me, waiting for guidance. I feel the weight of my gavel and the trust placed in me to uphold the law, but Sam\u2019s message tugs at me\u2014she\u2019s alone, vulnerable, and reaching out for help. I\u2019m torn between the urgent duty to halt proceedings and rework my instructions, and the equally urgent pull to be there for someone who needs me. The expectations of impartiality and legal precision clash with the simple, human need to support a friend. My mind races, caught between the solemnity of the bench and the desperate plea on my phone, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both roles at once."}
