Each transaction required my full attention\u2014large bills, credit cards, and the pressure of balancing the drawer at the end of the night. My mind kept drifting to my phone, where my mentee had just messaged me, desperate for advice before their big project presentation tomorrow. I could sense their anxiety, and I knew how much my encouragement meant to them. As a mentor, I wanted to drop everything, call them, and help them find their confidence. But as a cashier, I couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake, not with these high-value transactions. The expectation to be present and precise at the register clashed with my urge to support my mentee in their moment of need. My hands trembled slightly as I handed back change, my thoughts torn between the numbers in front of me and the words I wanted to say to reassure them. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, unsure which demand to answer first."}
