My headset itches against my ear, but I can hear her muffled sobs from the living room. She just got off a call with her boss, and the feedback was harsh. I know she needs me. I want to drop everything, wrap her in my arms, and tell her she\u2019s more than her job. But the compliance system at work is ruthless. If I\u2019m not back on calls exactly on time, the system will flag me, and I can\u2019t afford another warning. My supervisor made it clear: every minute counts. My heart aches as I watch her wipe her tears, trying to compose herself. I feel torn\u2014my job demands strict adherence to the schedule, but my partner needs me now, not in an hour. My hand hovers over the \u201cReady\u201d button on my screen, but my eyes keep drifting to the living room, and I can\u2019t quiet the storm of guilt and worry inside me."}
