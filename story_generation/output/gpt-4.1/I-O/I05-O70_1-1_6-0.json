He looked tired, his words tumbling over each other as he described his mounting deadlines. As his mentor, I wanted to help him find balance, to encourage him to set boundaries and prioritize his well-being. But my own schedule was tight\u2014my next delivery was already running behind, and the customer had left a note: \u201cPlease deliver before 3 PM, urgent.\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s eyes searched mine for advice, and I felt the weight of his trust. I wanted to stay, to help him map out a plan, but the ticking clock in my pocket reminded me of my other responsibility. If I delayed the delivery, I\u2019d risk a complaint, maybe even my job. If I rushed Jamie, I\u2019d fail him as a mentor. My chest tightened as I tried to split myself in two, torn between the promise I made to guide Jamie and the obligation to deliver on time. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which role to let down."}
