My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only time we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long delivery route. She\u2019d cooked my favorite meal, set the table, and even lit candles. I could see the excitement in her eyes as we sat down, both of us eager to make the most of these precious hours. Just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a customer, asking about a delayed package. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly and professionally, no matter the hour. I glanced at my girlfriend, her smile faltering as she noticed my attention shift. My mind raced\u2014should I answer now and risk ruining our evening, or ignore the message and potentially upset a customer? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the tension rise in the quiet room."}
