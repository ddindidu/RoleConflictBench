My mentor had finally carved out a sliver of time for me\u2014a quick meeting squeezed between their endless appointments. I\u2019d promised to be there, to show I valued their guidance and respected their schedule. But right now, I was behind the wheel, my passenger chatting idly in the backseat, unconcerned about the time. Their meeting wasn\u2019t urgent, and they\u2019d even told me, \u201cNo rush, driver, I\u2019m early anyway.\u201d Still, I felt the weight of my other promise pressing down on me. If I sped up, I could make it to my mentor\u2019s office just in time, but I\u2019d be risking my passenger\u2019s safety and the standards of my job. If I drove carefully, I\u2019d be late, letting down the person who\u2019d invested so much in me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to my passenger, each expectation pulling me in a different direction as the city lights blurred past."}
