She had that look\u2014curious, eager, a little nervous. \u201cCan you explain how you handled the last system migration?\u201d she asked, notebook already open. I wanted to give her a thoughtful answer, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned, but my phone buzzed again: another message from management. They needed my time estimates for the new project, and the roadmap meeting was in less than an hour. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my team was waiting on my numbers to move forward, and management expected accuracy and speed. But Maya was looking at me, hoping for guidance, and I didn\u2019t want to brush her off. My mind raced, torn between the urge to mentor and the responsibility to deliver. I tried to focus on her question, but the weight of the project deadlines pressed in, making it hard to be present. I could feel myself pulled in two directions, each role demanding more than I could give in this moment."}
