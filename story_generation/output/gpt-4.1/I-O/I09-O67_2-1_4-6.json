Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, was struggling with her groceries near our shared door, and my dog\u2019s barking made her jump. I apologized quickly, trying to calm my dog, but I could see the frustration in her eyes. She\u2019s mentioned before how the noise makes her anxious, especially in the evenings. I wanted to help her with her bags, maybe reassure her that I\u2019m trying to be a good neighbor, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I needed to move the ambulance to the satellite location for the shift change. I knew the team was counting on me to be on time and to drive safely, no rushing. But I also felt the weight of Mrs. Patel\u2019s expectations, the unspoken plea for peace and consideration in our shared space. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent responsibility of my job and the immediate need to be a better neighbor."}
