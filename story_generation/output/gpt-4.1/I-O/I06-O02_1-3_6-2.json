But then I remembered my mentor\u2019s office hours\u2014she\u2019d set aside this time specifically for us to ask questions and get guidance. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of her availability, to show respect for her commitment and not waste the opportunity. Yet, if I left my desk now, the build would remain stalled, and my team would be left waiting. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my mentor, who always emphasized the importance of showing up and being proactive. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team as an engineer and my commitment as a mentee. I hovered over the \u201cJoin Meeting\u201d button, heart pounding, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between two roles I cared about deeply."}
