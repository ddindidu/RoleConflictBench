The group of coworkers was deep in conversation, voices low and animated. They were talking about Mark, a mutual colleague, and his recent decisions at work. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t join in or say anything negative\u2014gossip always made me uncomfortable, and I prided myself on staying out of it. But as the delivery person, I was expected to be friendly, to blend in, and sometimes that meant joining the conversation, even if just to keep things smooth and professional.\n\nAt the same time, I was already running a bit behind schedule. The package in my hand was supposed to be delivered earlier, and I could feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me. If I interrupted now, I\u2019d risk seeming rude or out of place, but if I waited, I\u2019d be even later. My mind raced, torn between the urge to avoid gossip and the need to fulfill my delivery duties efficiently. The group looked up, expecting me to say something, and I hesitated, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
