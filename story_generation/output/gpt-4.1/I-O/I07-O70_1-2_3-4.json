The deadline wasn\u2019t tight, and my teammates could keep working without my part for now. Still, I knew my manager expected me to stay on top of things and not let tasks pile up. Just as I was about to dive in, my phone buzzed\u2014a notification from the delivery app. A moderately valuable package needed to be delivered across town, and the customer specifically requested a signature. As a delivery person, I was expected to ensure the package\u2019s safety and confirm the handoff, especially for items like this. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me. If I left now, I\u2019d be stepping away from my desk during work hours, risking my reputation as a reliable colleague. But if I ignored the delivery, I\u2019d be letting down the customer and possibly jeopardizing my rating. My mind raced, weighing the expectations from both sides, feeling the pressure build as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
