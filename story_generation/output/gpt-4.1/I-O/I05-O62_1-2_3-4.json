I knew these moments mattered\u2014sharing what I\u2019d learned, helping her grow. I started to answer, but my gaze drifted to the far end of the pool. A lane rope, frayed and sagging, bobbed in the water. If I didn\u2019t fix it before the next lesson, it could tangle a swimmer or throw off the class schedule. My supervisor expected me to keep everything running smoothly, no excuses. Jamie waited, notebook in hand, eager for advice.
