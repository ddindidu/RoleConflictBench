She smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. I knew that look\u2014she\u2019d had a rough day at work. As her boyfriend, I wanted to sit beside her, listen, and help her unwind, maybe make her laugh. But in the back of my mind, the blueprints for tomorrow\u2019s big project nagged at me. I had to review every measurement, every joint, or risk mistakes that could cost me days of work.
