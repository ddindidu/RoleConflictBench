It was the last one before my boyfriend left for his new job overseas, and we\u2019d promised to make every moment count. We were curled up on the couch, his head on my shoulder, when my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from a customer. My heart sank. There was a problem with their package, and they wanted an update right away. I could feel my boyfriend\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for me to put the phone away and focus on us. But as a delivery person, I was expected to respond quickly, to be calm and professional, even when things went wrong. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending a reassuring message to the customer and tossing my phone aside to savor these precious hours. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
