It was him\u2014my boyfriend\u2014texting again about the argument we\u2019d had last night. We\u2019d been fighting all week about money, and I knew he expected me to call and talk things through, to be the one who smoothed things over. My chest tightened with guilt; I wanted to fix things, to be the understanding girlfriend he needed. But right now, I was on the clock, wearing my delivery uniform, and the customer was already waiting at the door. I had to greet her with a smile, speak politely, and make sure the handoff went smoothly. My mind raced between the urge to reply to his messages and the need to stay professional. I could feel my frustration simmering, afraid it might slip into my voice. I took a deep breath, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my relationship, unsure which role to answer first."}
