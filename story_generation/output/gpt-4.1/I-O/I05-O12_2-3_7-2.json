The service was slowing, and the traces pointed directly to the functions I\u2019d merged just yesterday. My team was counting on me to fix it\u2014fast. But as I started to dig into the code, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Priya, my mentee. She was anxious about her upcoming interview, the one that could launch her career. She needed guidance, reassurance, maybe even a mock interview. I\u2019d promised to help her prepare, to be the mentor I wished I\u2019d had. But now, the team needed me to be the developer who could untangle this mess before it spiraled. My mind raced, torn between the urge to nurture Priya\u2019s growth and the responsibility to deliver clean, efficient code. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, forcing me to choose which part of myself to let down."}
