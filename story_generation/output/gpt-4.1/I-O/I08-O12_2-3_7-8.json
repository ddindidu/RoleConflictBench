No wonder things are falling apart.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossip, especially at work, but Mark was waiting for a response, his eyes expectant. At the same time, my phone buzzed with urgent Slack messages\u2014there was a production outage, and the root cause was a bug in my code. Customers couldn\u2019t access the service, and the pressure from QA and my manager was mounting by the second. I could feel the weight of two worlds pressing in: the social expectation to either agree or deflect Mark\u2019s comment without fueling negativity, and the professional demand to drop everything and fix the critical bug. My mind raced, torn between the urge to uphold my values in conversation and the immediate responsibility to restore the system. I stood frozen, caught between the need to respond to Mark and the desperate calls for help from my team."}
