It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me to come get him right away. I could hear the panic in his voice, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t have called unless it was serious. But as I glanced around the shop, I remembered the inspection I was supposed to finish tonight. Tomorrow\u2019s job was a big one\u2014structural beams, heavy machinery, and a crew depending on me to make sure everything was safe. If I left now, I\u2019d be skipping the safety checks, risking not just my own well-being but everyone\u2019s on site. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility I owed my friend and the duty I had as a carpenter. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move in either direction."}
