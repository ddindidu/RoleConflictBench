My mentor had squeezed in our session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious this hour was. I wanted to show respect, to be present, to soak up every bit of advice she offered. But my phone kept buzzing\u2014reminders from my manager, notifications about hot leads, and a blinking message: \u201cPush now, and you\u2019ll crush your sales target this week.\u201d As a telemarketer, I was on fire, and every minute away from the phones felt like money slipping through my fingers. I tried to focus on my mentor\u2019s words, but my mind kept drifting to the sales dashboard, the numbers climbing, the pressure mounting. I felt torn\u2014should I honor my commitment to my mentor, or should I jump on those calls and secure my record-breaking week? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I could feel myself fraying at the edges, caught between loyalty and ambition, respect and results."}
