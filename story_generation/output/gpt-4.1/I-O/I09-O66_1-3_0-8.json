My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked my taxi, asking if I could hurry up because they were late for an important meeting. I quickened my pace down the corridor, rehearsing my apology for the delay. Just then, Mrs. Kim from next door appeared, arms full of groceries, struggling with her door. She smiled and greeted me, expecting the usual friendly chat and maybe a helping hand. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014neighbors here always looked out for each other, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or uncaring. But my phone buzzed again, the passenger\u2019s impatience practically leaping off the screen. I stood there, torn between the urge to help Mrs. Kim and the professional duty to get to my passenger on time. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role I should honor in that moment."}
