I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I ran into anyone. As I stepped out into the hallway, cake in hand, I spotted Mrs. Lee from next door. She smiled, and I felt the pressure to stop, introduce myself, and offer her a slice\u2014after all, being friendly and polite was important, especially as the new neighbor.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the pool supervisor: a lane rope had snapped, and swim lessons were starting soon. As the lifeguard on duty, I was expected to maintain the equipment and make sure everything was safe and ready. If I didn\u2019t fix the rope immediately, the lessons would be disrupted, and the kids\u2019 safety could be at risk.\n\nI stood there, torn between the warm, expectant smile of Mrs. Lee and the urgent responsibility waiting at the pool. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the choice\u2014should I be the friendly neighbor or the diligent lifeguard?"}
