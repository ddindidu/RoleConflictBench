I baked a small cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. As I stepped into the hallway, cake in hand, I heard the unmistakable shriek of metal grinding on metal from the laundry room. My heart sank. That sound meant a bearing was about to fail\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, the whole machine could seize up, leaving everyone without laundry for days. \n\nBut just then, Mrs. Kim from next door appeared, smiling warmly. \u201cOh, is that for us? How thoughtful!\u201d she said, clearly expecting a friendly chat and maybe a slice of cake. I could see the anticipation in her eyes, the hope of a new friendship. At the same time, the screeching from the laundry room grew louder, demanding my immediate attention as a repairer. I stood there, torn between being the friendly new neighbor everyone hoped for and the responsible machine repairer the building desperately needed. My hands tightened around the cake plate as I wrestled with what to do next."}
