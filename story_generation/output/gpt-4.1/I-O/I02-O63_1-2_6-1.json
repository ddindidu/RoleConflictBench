As her boyfriend, I know I should call her, clear up the misunderstanding, and reassure her that I care about our plans. But right now, I\u2019m at my desk, headset on, listening to a customer pepper me with technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script barely covers. My manager expects me to handle every objection smoothly, to keep the call moving, to never say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I feel my heart race as I try to sound confident, flipping through the FAQ, while Mia\u2019s message sits unanswered. I want to be the attentive boyfriend who resolves conflicts, but I also need to be the competent telemarketer who never falters. The pressure from both sides squeezes me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m about to let someone down, no matter what I do next."}
