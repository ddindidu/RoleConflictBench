The journal\u2019s submission portal was open on my laptop, the countdown clock glaring at me: two hours left. I was so close to finishing, but then I saw it was Jamie calling. Her voice was frantic\u2014she was already halfway to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check and, if it\u2019s here, bring it to me? Please?\u201d she pleaded. I glanced at the clock again, feeling my chest tighten. As a friend, I knew she was counting on me; missing her flight would be a disaster. But as a scientist, I had a responsibility to submit my findings on time, with every detail checked and every dataset uploaded. The pressure from both sides was crushing. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, Jamie\u2019s anxious voice echoing in my mind, and felt completely torn\u2014pulled between the urgency of a friend in need and the demands of my professional integrity."}
