The subject line read, \u201cFYI: Updated Project Timeline.\u201d She\u2019d even written, \u201cNo action needed right now, just keeping you in the loop.\u201d Still, as a colleague, I knew the unspoken rule: respond soon, show you\u2019re engaged, be a team player. But my headset was already pinching my ear, and the clock on my screen glared 4:15 PM\u2014the last day of the quarter. As a telemarketer, I was three sales short of my target, and the whole team\u2019s bonus hung in the balance. Management\u2019s emails had been relentless: \u201cEvery call counts. Don\u2019t let up.\u201d My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between dashing off a quick reply to Sarah and dialing the next number on my list.
