The medication matched the label, and everything seemed routine, but I knew accuracy was non-negotiable. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t afford distractions\u2014one mistake could have serious consequences. Just then, my phone buzzed with a new email from a colleague. The subject line read, \u201cFYI\u2014No Action Needed,\u201d but I knew our team valued prompt responses, even to informational messages. I felt the familiar tug of expectation: as a colleague, I should acknowledge the message soon, showing I\u2019m engaged and reliable. But as a pharmacist, my focus had to be absolute, especially with patient safety on the line. My mind raced, torn between the urge to quickly reply and the responsibility to ensure every detail of the prescription was correct. The pressure built inside me, knowing that whichever role I prioritized, I risked falling short in the other."}
