I knew I should reach out, explain the mess, but my shift as a taxi driver had just started. Two travelers waved me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I forced a smile, feeling the weight of their expectation for quick, professional service. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, a reminder of my responsibility as a mentee to communicate honestly and promptly. But the travelers were watching, waiting for me to help, and I couldn\u2019t ignore them. My hands hovered between the phone and the suitcases, my mind torn between the urgent needs of my team and the immediate demands of my passengers. I felt the pressure building, caught between two worlds, unsure which to serve first."}
