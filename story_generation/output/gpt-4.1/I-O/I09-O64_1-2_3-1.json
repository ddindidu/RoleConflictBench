My mind was half on the beeping scanner, half on the trash bins outside my apartment. As a neighbor, I knew we were supposed to be considerate\u2014never overfill the bins, always leave space for others. But tonight, I\u2019d be closing late, and if I didn\u2019t take my trash out before work, I\u2019d miss pickup. The bins were only half-full, but if I added my bags, would I be taking more than my share? \n\nA customer handed me a crumpled bill, snapping me back. As a cashier, I had to stay focused, process each transaction accurately, keep the line moving. But my thoughts kept drifting: if I waited until morning, the bins might be full, and my trash would sit another week. If I took it out now, was I being selfish? The register beeped impatiently. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my neighbors\u2019 silent expectations, my manager\u2019s watchful eye, and the growing line of customers. I stood there, torn, the decision looming as the next customer stepped forward."}
