My mentor had managed to squeeze in a quick meeting for me, despite her packed schedule. I knew how important it was to respect her time\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that punctuality and preparation were signs of commitment. As I hurried down the hall, clipboard in hand, I passed by Mr. Lee\u2019s room. He was recovering from surgery, and I was responsible for checking his vital signs. When I took his temperature and pulse, I noticed they were a bit higher than usual. Protocol said I should monitor him closely and record everything immediately, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my mentor\u2019s meeting. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient and the responsibility to my mentor. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between the expectation to be a diligent nursing assistant and the pressure to be a respectful, attentive mentee."}
