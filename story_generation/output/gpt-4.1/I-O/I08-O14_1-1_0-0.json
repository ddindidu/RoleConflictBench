The lab was finally free, and I could run the tests today if I wanted\u2014though, truthfully, there were other slots available later in the week. As I rounded the corner, I spotted Jamie, someone I\u2019d met at last month\u2019s department mixer. We weren\u2019t close, but we\u2019d shared a few laughs and promised to catch up soon. Jamie smiled and slowed, clearly hoping for a quick chat. I felt the familiar tug: as an acquaintance, I should stop, be friendly, and show I valued our budding connection. But as a scientist, my thoughts raced ahead to the experiment\u2014what if I lost my focus, or worse, what if someone else booked the lab while I lingered? My heart thudded with the pressure of both roles, the urge to be warm and present warring with the drive to seize this scientific opportunity. I hesitated, caught between the expectations of friendship and the demands of my research, unsure which path to choose."}
