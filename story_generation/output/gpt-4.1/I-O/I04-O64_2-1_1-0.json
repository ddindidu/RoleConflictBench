My best friend\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I just\u2026 I really need someone right now.\u201d I glanced at the small line forming at my register\u2014Mrs. Patel with her usual milk and eggs, a teenager clutching a soda, and a man tapping his foot impatiently. As a cashier, I was supposed to focus, make no mistakes, and keep the line moving. But as a friend, I knew I should listen, offer comfort, and be present for her pain. My heart twisted as she started to cry softly, and I fumbled with the scanner, nearly missing a barcode. The customers\u2019 eyes were on me, expecting quick service, while my friend\u2019s voice pleaded for understanding. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
