My mentee, Sarah, hovered nearby, her eyes wide with uncertainty as she prepared to run her first solo experiment\u2014a delicate process where a single misstep could ruin weeks of work. She needed me to walk her through every step, to share the tricks I\u2019d learned from years of trial and error. I could see her anxiety, and I knew how much she depended on my guidance.\n\nBut the research logs for today\u2019s batch of results also sat open on my computer, half-finished. As a scientist, I was expected to document everything with precision, to ensure the integrity of our findings. The logs could technically wait, but I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on me\u2014what if I forgot a crucial detail later? My mind tugged in two directions: the urge to mentor Sarah through this critical moment, and the duty to uphold the standards of my scientific work. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the mentor she needed and the scientist my work demanded."}
