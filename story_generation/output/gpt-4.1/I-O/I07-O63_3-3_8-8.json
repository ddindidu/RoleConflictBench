It\u2019s from my manager, marked urgent: \u201cNeed your confirmation on the partner details ASAP\u2014leadership is waiting.\u201d As a colleague, I know how important it is to respond quickly, especially when the team is counting on me to keep things moving. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m painfully aware of the compliance system that tracks every second of my time. If I stay at my desk to reply, I\u2019ll miss my break and the system will flag me for not adhering to my schedule. If I take my break as planned, I\u2019ll leave my team hanging and risk looking unresponsive. My heart pounds as I stare at the screen, torn between the pressure to be a reliable teammate and the fear of disciplinary action. I can almost feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, demanding an answer I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
