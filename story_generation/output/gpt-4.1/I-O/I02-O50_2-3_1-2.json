It was Mia, her voice trembling. She\u2019d just gotten some harsh feedback from her boss, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. \u201cCan you come over? I just need you,\u201d she whispered. My heart twisted\u2014I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold her and tell her she was more than her job.\n\nBut then my work phone rang. The hospital\u2019s ICU\u2014one of the life-support machines was down, flashing critical errors. I was the only technician on call. The nurse\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe need you now. Someone\u2019s life depends on it.\u201d\n\nI stood frozen, phone in each hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mia needed me to be her anchor, to listen and comfort her. The hospital needed me to be precise, focused, and fast. I could feel the panic rising, torn between the person I love and the responsibility I can\u2019t ignore. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this impossible moment."}
