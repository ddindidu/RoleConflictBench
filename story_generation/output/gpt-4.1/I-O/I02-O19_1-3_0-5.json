My mind replayed every detail\u2014her confusion about dosages, her worried questions about side effects. I knew I needed to be thorough, to make sure she left with clarity and confidence. But as I stepped out of the consultation room, I saw a message from my girlfriend: \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I pictured her sitting on the couch, shoulders tense, waiting for me to listen and reassure her. My heart tugged in two directions. As a boyfriend, I wanted to be there, to offer comfort and a listening ear. As a pharmacist, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014patients like Mrs. Lee depended on me to keep them safe. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations from both sides pressing in, and I stood frozen, torn between the person who needed me at home and the patients who needed me here."}
