It was Jamie, my closest friend, texting, \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the kind of support only a good friend can give. But as I glanced at the machines humming in the corner, I felt a different kind of pressure. They\u2019d missed their last service, and now the temperature readings were creeping higher than they should. If I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we could be looking at a costly breakdown, and everyone would be asking why I hadn\u2019t acted sooner.\n\nI stared at my phone, thumb hovering over the reply button, heart pounding. Jamie was counting on me to be there for her, but so was my team, in a completely different way. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
