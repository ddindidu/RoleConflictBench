It was Jamie, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months, her voice shaky as she explained her car had broken down on a deserted road. She needed someone to come pick her up. As an acquaintance, I knew the right thing was to drop everything and help her, to be the support she needed in a stressful moment. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I was only halfway through my shift, and the house was still a mess. My employer expected the place to be spotless by the end of the day, and I\u2019d already been warned about missing spots in the past. If I left now, I\u2019d risk my job and disappoint my boss. If I stayed, I\u2019d let Jamie down when she needed me most. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a good friend and the responsibility to do my job well. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unable to decide which role to fulfill."}
