Just us, no distractions.\u201d It was the last weekend before she moved abroad for months, and I\u2019d promised her my undivided attention. But as I packed an overnight bag, my work phone buzzed. The opposing counsel was relentless, calling again, demanding a response about a sensitive detail in my client\u2019s case. He hinted at consequences if I didn\u2019t cooperate, but I knew the information was privileged\u2014sharing it would betray my client and violate every ethical code I\u2019d sworn to uphold.\n\nMy girlfriend deserved these precious hours, free from the shadow of my job. But the pressure from the case gnawed at me, the weight of my client\u2019s trust heavy on my conscience. I could almost hear my partner\u2019s voice, asking me to be present, to make memories before she left. At the same time, I felt the silent expectation of my profession, the duty to protect my client at all costs. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between love and loyalty, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
