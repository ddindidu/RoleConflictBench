My mentor\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cPlease finish the code sample before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. It should be enough, but my inbox pinged again\u2014another alert from production. The critical service was lagging, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged yesterday. As a developer, I knew what was expected: drop everything, fix the code, make it right. But as a mentee, I owed my mentor my best effort, a thoughtful solution to the assignment she\u2019d given me. \n\nMy fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds. If I focused on the production issue, I\u2019d have little time or energy left for the code sample. If I prioritized the assignment, the service might keep slowing, affecting users and my team\u2019s trust in me. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure from both sides. I wanted to be reliable, to meet every expectation, but right now, I could only choose one."}
