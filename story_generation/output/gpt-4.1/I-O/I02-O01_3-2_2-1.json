As an architect, I knew the gravity of the situation\u2014if I didn\u2019t review the plans and flag the safety risks now, the crew might move forward, and someone could get hurt. But beside me, my girlfriend curled into herself, silent tears streaming down her face. She\u2019d just lost her brother, and I could feel her need for me to simply be there, to hold her, to listen. My mind raced with the expectations pressing in from both sides: the responsibility to protect lives on-site, and the responsibility to support the woman I love through her grief. My heart ached as I tried to steady my breath, torn between opening my laptop and reaching for her hand. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I felt paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
