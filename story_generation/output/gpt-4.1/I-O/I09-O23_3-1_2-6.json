Smiling, I greeted Mrs. Lee, who lived across the hall, and tried to keep my tone light and friendly, even as tension simmered beneath the surface. As a neighbor, I was expected to be approachable and polite, smoothing over any awkwardness with a kind word or a joke. But as the conversation shifted, someone from the building\u2014who also happened to be at last week\u2019s networking event\u2014leaned in and asked, \u201cHey, you\u2019re a lawyer, right? What\u2019s the real story with that client you mentioned? The one with the late-night calls?\u201d \n\nMy mind raced. As a lawyer, I was bound by strict confidentiality, unable to share even the smallest detail. Yet, as a neighbor, I felt the pressure to be open and friendly, to not seem aloof or secretive. The group\u2019s expectant faces made my heart pound. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between the urge to connect and the duty to protect."}
