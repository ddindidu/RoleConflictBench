We\u2019d argued again this morning\u2014money, always money. She wanted us to talk, to fix things before it got worse. I could hear her voice in my head, pleading for me to stay, to show her I cared enough to work through it. But just as I was about to go inside, my radio crackled: a call for an elderly woman with a broken arm, pain level high, alone at home. I was the closest unit. My training kicked in\u2014someone needed me, needed my calm hands and quick thinking. But Mia needed me too, in a different way. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, my heart racing. I stared at the apartment door, then at the ambulance keys in my hand, torn between the woman waiting for help and the woman waiting for me."}
