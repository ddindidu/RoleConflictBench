The construction site is a ten-minute walk, and the safety briefing starts in two. I can\u2019t be late again\u2014last time, the foreman gave me a warning about team discipline. But as I pass the row of trash bins, I notice ours is only half-full. Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, always struggles to wheel it out, and she\u2019s mentioned how much she appreciates when I help. If I leave it, she\u2019ll have to drag it herself, and I know how steep the curb is. But if I stop to help, I\u2019ll be late for the briefing, and the team will have to wait for me. My mind races: be a good neighbor or a reliable worker? I stand frozen, the weight of both expectations pressing on me, heart pounding as the seconds tick by."}
