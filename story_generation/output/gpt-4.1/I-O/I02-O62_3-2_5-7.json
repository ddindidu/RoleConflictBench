It was our last weekend together before she left for London, and I\u2019d promised her my undivided attention. She leaned her head on my shoulder, and I felt the weight of time slipping away. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a group of teenagers at the pool\u2019s edge, laughing and daring each other to dive where the signs clearly said not to. My lifeguard instincts kicked in\u2014if I didn\u2019t intervene, someone could get hurt, and it was my job to keep everyone safe. But if I left Mia now, even for a moment, I\u2019d be breaking the promise I made to her, stealing precious minutes from our goodbye. My heart pounded as I glanced between her hopeful eyes and the reckless teens, torn between the duty I owed to my job and the love I owed to her."}
