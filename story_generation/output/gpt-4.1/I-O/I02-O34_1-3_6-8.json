Why do you never listen?\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019d talked about this, but I must have misunderstood. I know she expects me to call, to clear things up before it festers.

I\u2019m instantly alert, headset on, voice steady, coordinating with two other controllers. Every second counts; one mistake could mean disaster. But Mia\u2019s words echo in my mind, her disappointment heavy. I want to fix things with her, to show I care, but right now, dozens of lives depend on my focus.
