I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name flashed, and I could hear the strain in their voice as soon as I answered. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d they said, their words trembling. I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to be present, to help them sort through the mess of their argument. But as I tried to focus, the foreman\u2019s shout cut through the noise\u2014\u201cWe need that lumber, now!\u201d The carpenter stood waiting, arms crossed, tapping his foot impatiently. My hands were already raw from the morning\u2019s work, and I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to be the friend who listened, who cared, but I was also the laborer who couldn\u2019t let the team down. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the weight of the wood and the weight of my friend\u2019s words, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
