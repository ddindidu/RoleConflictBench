My mentee, Sarah, was pacing in the conference room, her presentation slides flickering on the screen. She needed me\u2014her mentor\u2014to help her rehearse, to calm her nerves before the biggest pitch of her young career. I saw the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for guidance. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the crew was waiting at the site, expecting me to lead the morning safety briefing. As the head carpenter, I was responsible for making sure everyone followed protocols, that no one got hurt. If I was late, corners might be cut, and someone could get injured. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Sarah\u2019s future, the crew\u2019s safety. I wanted to be the mentor she needed, but I couldn\u2019t ignore my duty as a carpenter. My mind raced, torn between nurturing growth and preventing harm, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
