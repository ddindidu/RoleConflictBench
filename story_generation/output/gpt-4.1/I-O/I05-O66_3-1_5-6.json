She was about to present a project that could make or break her career, and she needed my guidance. As her mentor, I was expected to walk her through the final details, to share every bit of knowledge I had so she wouldn\u2019t falter. But as her taxi driver, I was also responsible for keeping the cab spotless and professional\u2014especially today, with the company\u2019s secret inspection rumored to be happening. \n\nShe spread her papers across the back seat, coffee cup teetering dangerously close to the edge. My heart pounded. If a spill happened, I\u2019d fail the inspection and risk my job. But if I focused on the mess, I\u2019d fail her as a mentor, leaving her unprepared for the biggest moment of her career. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore.
