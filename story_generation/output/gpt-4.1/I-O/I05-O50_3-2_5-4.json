My apprentice, Jamie, hovered nearby, eyes wide with anticipation as I prepared to walk them through the calibration process\u2014a task where a single misstep could mean disaster. As their mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to share every detail, to answer every question, to make sure Jamie understood not just the how, but the why. But as I glanced at the temperature gauges, my stomach tightened. Three machines were running hotter than they should, overdue for maintenance after last week\u2019s chaos. If I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we risked a breakdown, or worse, a safety hazard. My mind raced, torn between the urge to slow down and guide Jamie thoroughly, and the pressing need to grab my tools and tend to the overheating machines. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t give it to both at once. I felt the pressure mounting, sweat prickling at my brow, as I tried to decide which responsibility I could afford to set aside, even for a moment."}
