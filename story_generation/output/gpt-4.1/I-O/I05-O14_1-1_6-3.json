My mentee, Sarah, had just left after our weekly check-in. She looked exhausted, her notes scattered, her words rushed. As her mentor, I felt the urge to sit her down, help her map out a better schedule, and encourage her to find balance. She needed guidance, and I wanted to be the one to help her grow, both personally and professionally.\n\nBut as a scientist, I had my own responsibilities. The latest batch of results sat in front of me, waiting to be logged. The protocol allowed for some flexibility, and I could technically record them later. Still, the expectation was clear: document findings accurately and promptly. If I delayed, even for a good reason, I risked setting a precedent for myself and the team.\n\nI stared at the data, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I prioritize Sarah\u2019s development right now, or fulfill my duty to the research? The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest, torn between the demands of mentor and scientist."}
