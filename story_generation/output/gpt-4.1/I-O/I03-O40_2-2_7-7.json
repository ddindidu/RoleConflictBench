We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014this time about money, about how I spend too much, how he worries about our future. I know he expects me to reach out, to smooth things over, to be the one who resolves our conflicts. But as I sat in my truck outside a client\u2019s house, my mind was already shifting to the deck repair I\u2019d been called for. The homeowner was waiting, expecting me to assess the damage and get started right away. I could see the splintered boards from the driveway, and I knew it would take hours to fix. My phone buzzed again. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my boyfriend\u2019s need for reassurance, the homeowner\u2019s need for a safe, sturdy deck. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urge to call him and the responsibility to get to work. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which role needed me more right now."}
