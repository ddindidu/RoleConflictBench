My break was scheduled to end in exactly two minutes, and the automated system at work was ruthless\u2014one minute late, and I\u2019d get flagged. As I rounded the corner, I nearly bumped into Sam, an old classmate I hadn\u2019t seen in years. His face lit up, and he slowed, clearly wanting to chat. I felt the familiar tug of expectation: as an acquaintance, I should stop, smile, and catch up, maybe even ask about his family. But the telemarketer in me screamed about the ticking clock, the threat of disciplinary action, the need to be back at my desk before the system noticed my absence. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the warmth in my voice with the urgency in my step, torn between the friendly greeting Sam deserved and the rigid demands of my job."}
