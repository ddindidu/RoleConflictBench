The beach was packed, high tide pulling the water dangerously close to the shore. As a lifeguard, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford a second of distraction\u2014one slip, one missed cry for help, and someone could drown. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket, a reminder of the other role I couldn\u2019t ignore. My mentor expected me to be open, to communicate any issues, and right now, my project team was falling apart. Arguments had erupted, deadlines were slipping, and I was supposed to let my mentor know immediately. My heart pounded with the weight of both responsibilities. If I texted my mentor, I\u2019d have to look away from the water, even for just a moment. But if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be failing as a mentee, letting my mentor down and risking the project. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent, each unforgiving, and I stood frozen, torn between the crashing waves and the silent call for help in my pocket."}
