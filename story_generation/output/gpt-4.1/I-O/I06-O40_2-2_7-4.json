She\u2019d carved out just fifteen minutes for me, squeezed between her own packed commitments. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation\u2014she\u2019d told me more than once that respecting her time was the first step to earning her trust. But as I set down my phone, the sound of saws and hammers pulled me back to the half-finished cabinetry in front of me. The electrician was waiting for my framework to be done before he could start, and the plumber had already asked twice when I\u2019d be finished. If I left now, even for a short while, the whole schedule could unravel, and I\u2019d be letting down the team. My hands hovered over the wood, my mind torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my mentor and the responsibility I owed to my crew. The pressure built in my chest, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
