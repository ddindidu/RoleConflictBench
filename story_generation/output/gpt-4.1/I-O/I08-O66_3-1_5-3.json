His voice was tight with worry\u2014his car had broken down on a quiet stretch of road, and he needed help. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to rush to his side, to be the reliable friend he expected in a pinch. But as a taxi driver, I knew the rules: I had to follow traffic laws, keep to the speed limit, and drive defensively, no matter how empty the roads seemed.
