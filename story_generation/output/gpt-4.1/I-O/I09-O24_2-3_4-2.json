Through the thin apartment walls, I could hear my neighbor\u2019s footsteps pause outside our shared door. I winced, knowing how much she valued peace and quiet, especially after her night shifts. I wanted to rush out, calm my dog, and apologize\u2014be the considerate neighbor I always tried to be. But my phone buzzed with an urgent notification: an emergency motion had just been filed, and as the judge on call, I was expected to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. If I left the files now, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk missing critical details that could affect someone\u2019s safety. But if I ignored the barking, I\u2019d be letting down my neighbor, possibly straining our relationship. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, torn between the demands of justice and the simple decency of being a good neighbor."}
