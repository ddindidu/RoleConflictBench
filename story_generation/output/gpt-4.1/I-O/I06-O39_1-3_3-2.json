My gloves were already slick, and I knew every second the beam hung in the air was a risk. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my mentor to reach out if I had any questions. I\u2019d been meaning to ask about a term in the project manual, something minor, but I remembered her stressing the importance of open communication. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate, even for small things.\u201d But right now, the foreman\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to move fast and steady, no distractions. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be the diligent mentee and the reliable laborer. The beam swayed slightly, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention at the exact same moment."}
