My shift was almost over, but I still had to process the large cash deposit\u2014every bill counted, every form signed, no shortcuts allowed. The store manager had drilled into us how important it was to follow every step, especially with corporate audits looming. As I started sorting the bills, I noticed someone hovering near the counter. It was Jamie, a friend of a friend I\u2019d met at a party last month. She looked nervous, clutching her bag and glancing around as if she wanted to disappear.\n\nI remembered how awkward she\u2019d seemed at the party, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be friendly if I saw her again. Now, she was here, clearly needing a familiar face. I could see the hope in her eyes as she caught my gaze, expecting a warm hello, maybe even a chat to ease her nerves. But the deposit forms stared back at me, a silent reminder of the rules I couldn\u2019t bend. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Jamie\u2019s need for kindness, and the unyielding demands of my job. I hesitated, torn, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
