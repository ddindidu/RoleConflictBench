Can I vent for a bit?\u201d I glanced at the screen, feeling a familiar tug. As a friend, I knew Sam counted on me to listen, to be present and supportive, especially on days like this. But my laptop screen was filled with diagrams and notes from our project\u2019s brainstorming session. As an engineer, I was supposed to be thinking creatively, mapping out possible solutions, and preparing to propose new ideas to the team. The project wasn\u2019t urgent yet, but I wanted to impress my manager with a well-thought-out approach. I stared at Sam\u2019s message, guilt creeping in. If I replied now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and maybe miss a breakthrough. If I ignored Sam, I\u2019d be letting down someone who needed me. My mind spun, torn between being the friend Sam deserved and the engineer I wanted to become."}
