It\u2019s Saturday afternoon, the last weekend before Alex leaves for his new job overseas. We promised to spend every moment together, to make memories that would last until he returns. He\u2019s waiting at the caf\u00e9 across the street, texting me sweet reminders of our plans. But here I am, behind the pharmacy counter, reviewing a complicated prescription for Mrs. Lee, a regular with a fragile health history. Her medications are a delicate balance\u2014one mistake could be dangerous. My manager expects precision, and I know how much Mrs. Lee depends on me. Yet, every second I spend double-checking her prescription is a second stolen from Alex, from us. My phone buzzes again. I feel torn, guilt pressing from both sides. I want to be the attentive girlfriend Alex deserves, but I can\u2019t ignore the responsibility I have as a pharmacist. My hands tremble as I reach for the next bottle, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice between love and duty."}
