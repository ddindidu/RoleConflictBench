I was supposed to be focused\u2014driving the ambulance from the main station to the satellite location for the shift change. But my mind kept drifting to Mia. She\u2019d just lost her brother, and her voice, raw and trembling, echoed in my head from our call this morning. She needed me, needed my words, my presence, my comfort. I could almost feel her pain through the screen, and every instinct screamed at me to call her back, to be the boyfriend she deserved right now. But the city traffic was thick, and the ambulance was heavy and unforgiving. My supervisor\u2019s words rang in my ears: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d I knew what was expected of me\u2014no distractions, no mistakes. Yet, as my phone vibrated again, I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on my chest, demanding I choose which part of myself to betray."}
