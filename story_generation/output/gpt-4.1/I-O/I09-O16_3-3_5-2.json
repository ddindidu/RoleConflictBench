The HOA had sent out reminders\u2014nothing should block the emergency exit, especially with today\u2019s inspection. As her neighbor, I knew Mrs. Patel struggled to move her things, and I didn\u2019t want to cause her trouble, but the rules were clear. I hesitated, torn between being considerate and ensuring everyone\u2019s safety.\n\nMinutes later, at the hospital, I was called to the ER. A patient had arrived, gasping for breath, his skin mottled and pulse racing. The symptoms didn\u2019t fit any clear diagnosis. As a doctor, I was expected to act fast, to piece together the clues and save his life. My mind raced with possibilities, but I couldn\u2019t shake the image of the cluttered corridor and the HOA\u2019s stern warnings. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me\u2014one demanding compassion and understanding, the other swift, decisive action. I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good neighbor and a competent doctor, feeling the tension pull me in two directions at once."}
