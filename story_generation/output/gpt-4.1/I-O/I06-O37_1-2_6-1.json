The dust on the living room shelves was thicker than usual, and I knew if I didn\u2019t tackle it today, it would only get worse. But my mentor\u2019s office hours had just started, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of every opportunity to learn from her. She always emphasized respecting her time, and I didn\u2019t want to show up late or distracted. Yet, the mess nagged at me\u2014if I left it, I\u2019d be failing in my responsibility as a cleaner, letting standards slip. My mind raced between the image of my mentor waiting, perhaps disappointed by my absence, and the growing mess that would reflect poorly on my work ethic. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
