Across the room, I spotted a new face\u2014someone clearly uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot, eyes darting around. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to walk over, introduce myself, and help them feel at ease. I knew how much a friendly word could mean in a room full of strangers.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again, the third urgent message from my project manager. The team was waiting on my core module, and the build was stalled. Every minute I spent away from my laptop meant more delays, more pressure. As an engineer, I was expected to deliver solutions, keep the project moving, and right now, everyone was counting on me.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. Should I step away and be the welcoming face this person needed, or rush back to my desk and be the reliable engineer my team depended on? The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds."}
