Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, the threat of breaking up hanging between us. I knew I should call him, try to fix things before they got worse. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do: resolve conflicts, not let them fester. But just as I was about to dial, the salon door chimed. Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walked in, her smile expectant. The receptionist was chatting with someone, so it was up to me to greet her, make her feel welcome, and start her appointment off right. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014my relationship teetering on the edge, and my professional duty demanding warmth and attention. I could feel my hands tremble as I forced a smile, torn between the urge to step outside and call Alex, and the need to be present for Mrs. Patel. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
