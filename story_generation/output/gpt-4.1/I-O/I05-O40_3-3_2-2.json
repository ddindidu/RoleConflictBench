My mentee, Sarah, waited anxiously at the edge of the workbench, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. She was about to make a decision that could change her career, and she needed my full attention\u2014my guidance, my experience, my words. But the tools on the bench were overdue for inspection, and the crew was waiting for me to sign off before they could start the day\u2019s work. If I rushed the safety checks, I\u2019d be risking everyone\u2019s well-being. If I focused on Sarah, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as a carpenter, the one who keeps the site safe. My mind raced, torn between the weight of her future and the responsibility for my team\u2019s safety. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I could feel the pressure building in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation I could afford to let down."}
