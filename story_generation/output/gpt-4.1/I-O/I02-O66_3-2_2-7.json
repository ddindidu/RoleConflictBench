Her words were shaky, even through the screen\u2014her uncle had passed away, and she needed me. My heart twisted; I knew she\u2019d want me by her side, to hold her, to listen, to just be there. But just then, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases behind them. They looked exhausted, hopeful. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019re splitting the fare to the airport,\u201d one asked, glancing at his watch. I could see the expectation in their eyes\u2014professional, reliable service, no delays.
