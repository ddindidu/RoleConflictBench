His voice shook as he explained his car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me\u2014now. I promised I\u2019d be there as soon as I could, picturing him stranded in the dark, maybe scared, definitely cold. I jumped into my cab, the familiar seat beneath me, and started the engine. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: safety first, always follow traffic laws, especially in tricky spots. But as I sped toward the highway, a construction detour forced me through a narrow lane right by a school zone. Children clustered near the curb, their bright jackets flashing in my headlights. My heart pounded. Sam was waiting, counting on me to be the friend he needed. But the rules of the road demanded caution, patience, and absolute care. I gripped the wheel, torn between the urge to rush to Sam\u2019s rescue and the responsibility to protect the kids just steps away. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught between loyalty and duty, not sure which path to take."}
