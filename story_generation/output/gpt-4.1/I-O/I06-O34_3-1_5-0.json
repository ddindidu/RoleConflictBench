As an air traffic controller, I\u2019m expected to be vigilant, ready to manage any sudden congestion, but this morning, the sky is clear and the holding patterns are empty. My mind drifts to my other role\u2014mentee. Yesterday, a heated argument with my project teammates erupted, and now our deliverable is at risk. My mentor expects me to communicate any challenges promptly, but I haven\u2019t reached out yet. I feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me, urging me to send a message, to ask for help. But here, in the tower, I\u2019m supposed to be fully present, alert for any blip on the screen. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cUpdate mentor.\u201d I clench it in my hand, torn between the duty to my mentor and the responsibility to the pilots in my airspace. The silence in the tower feels heavy, filled with the tension of my divided attention."}
