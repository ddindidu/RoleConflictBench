It was Mark, an old college acquaintance who\u2019d recently moved to town. \u201cHey! Any chance you could recommend a good restaurant nearby? I\u2019ve got family visiting and want to impress them.\u201d I glanced at the message, feeling the familiar tug of social obligation. Mark had always been friendly, and I knew he\u2019d appreciate a thoughtful suggestion.\n\nBut just as I started typing a reply, a shrill alarm blared from the other side of the lab. The gas chromatograph was flashing red\u2014an equipment warning I couldn\u2019t ignore. My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t act fast, there could be a hazardous leak, putting everyone in the building at risk. I was the only scientist on duty, responsible for safety and maintenance. Yet, Mark\u2019s message lingered on my screen, a simple request for help that suddenly felt impossibly complicated. I stood frozen, torn between the expectation to be a supportive acquaintance and my duty to ensure the lab\u2019s safety, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
