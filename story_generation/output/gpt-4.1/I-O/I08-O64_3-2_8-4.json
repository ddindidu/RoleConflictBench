My shift was almost over when I saw Lisa, someone I knew from my neighborhood, approach the counter. She looked uneasy, clutching a box and searching my face for a sign of recognition. As she placed the item on the counter, she whispered, \u201cI lost the receipt, but I really need to return this. Can you help me out?\u201d \n\nStore policy was clear\u2014no returns without a receipt. But Lisa was an acquaintance, and I remembered the rumors swirling about her lately. Just yesterday, I\u2019d overheard something sensitive about her, something that could easily be twisted and used against her if it got out. I felt the weight of my two roles pressing in on me. As an acquaintance, I wanted to protect her privacy and avoid fueling any gossip. As a cashier, I was expected to enforce the rules, no exceptions. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help her quietly and the responsibility to uphold store policy, knowing that whatever I chose could have consequences for both of us."}
