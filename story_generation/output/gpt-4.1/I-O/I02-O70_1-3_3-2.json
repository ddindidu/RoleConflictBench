We finally have time.\u201d I could almost hear her excitement, and I wanted nothing more than to say yes, to promise her an evening just for us. We\u2019d both been so busy, and she deserved my full attention. But as I started to reply, my work app pinged\u2014a high-priority delivery had just come in. Medical supplies, urgent, for the hospital. The note was clear: \u201cMust arrive on time for patient care.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. If I chose the wrong evening, I might have to leave Mia in the middle of dinner, or worse, cancel last minute. She\u2019d be disappointed, maybe even hurt, and I hated the thought. But if I delayed the delivery, someone\u2019s health could be at risk. I scrolled through our shared calendar, my thumb hovering, torn between the promise I wanted to keep to Mia and the responsibility I owed to my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
