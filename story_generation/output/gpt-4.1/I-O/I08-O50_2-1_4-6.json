It was Mark, someone I\u2019d met at a few neighborhood gatherings. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this evening? I\u2019m in a bind,\u201d he texted. I hesitated, knowing that as an acquaintance, I should offer support, especially since he rarely asks for favors. I replied, \u201cSure, let me see what I can do.\u201d\n\nAs I was about to head out, my work phone rang. It was a new client, Mrs. Patel, calling during my routine check-in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, but could you walk me through the basic controls again? I\u2019m still not confident with the machine,\u201d she said, her voice tinged with anxiety. As a machine repairer, I\u2019m expected to be patient and thorough, ensuring clients feel comfortable and supported.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. Mark was waiting for my help, counting on me to show up soon, while Mrs. Patel needed my guidance right now. My mind raced, torn between being a helpful acquaintance and a reliable professional, both expecting my time and attention at the same moment."}
