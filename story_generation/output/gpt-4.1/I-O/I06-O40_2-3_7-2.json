She\u2019d carved out just fifteen minutes for me, squeezed between her own back-to-back commitments. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But as I set my phone down, my eyes fell on the pile of tools in the workshop. The circular saw\u2019s guard was sticking again, and the drill\u2019s cord looked frayed. As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t ignore the safety protocols\u2014inspecting and maintaining every tool before starting the day\u2019s structural work was non-negotiable. One missed check could mean a serious accident, not just for me but for anyone on site. My stomach twisted as I weighed the ticking clock against the silent demand of the tools. If I rushed the inspection, I\u2019d be risking safety. If I delayed, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s time and maybe lose her trust. The pressure built in my chest, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen between the workshop and the door, unable to move."}
