I\u2019m in a bind.\u201d I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call on, and I\u2019d always tried to be the kind of person who\u2019d help out when needed. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. There was only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager had already sent a reminder about the numbers, and I could almost feel the weight of her expectations pressing down on me.\n\nIf I left now, I\u2019d let my team down and risk missing my bonus. But if I ignored Mark, I\u2019d be the kind of acquaintance who only shows up when it\u2019s convenient. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between dialing the next number on my call list and replying to Mark\u2019s plea for help. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the reliable friend and the dedicated employee at the same time."}
