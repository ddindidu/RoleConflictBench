My mentor had just emailed me a complex assignment, reminding me it needed to be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. I knew how much she valued diligence and reliability, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. Yet, as I opened the file, my eyes drifted to the latest issue of the law review journal lying unopened beside my laptop. As a judge, I was expected to stay current with evolving legal theories, and this issue promised insights that could shape my upcoming rulings. The pressure mounted\u2014if I focused on the assignment, I\u2019d risk falling behind in my judicial responsibilities. But if I dove into the journal, I might not meet my mentor\u2019s expectations. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my mentee role and the ongoing responsibility of my judicial position. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, unable to choose which part of myself to honor first."}
