She\u2019s in the other room, her voice still echoing in my head\u2014\u201cDo you even care about us anymore?\u201d I know I should go to her, try to fix things, but my shift as a telemarketer just started. The headset feels heavier than usual as I answer, \u201cThank you for calling, how can I help you today?\u201d The customer immediately launches into a barrage of technical questions about the new service, questions my script barely covers. I fumble for answers, my thoughts split between the customer\u2019s demands and Mia\u2019s tearful face. My supervisor expects me to handle every objection smoothly, but all I can think about is the expectation to be a good boyfriend, to resolve the mess I\u2019ve made at home. The pressure mounts\u2014do I put the customer on hold and risk my job, or do I let Mia wait, risking our relationship? My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
