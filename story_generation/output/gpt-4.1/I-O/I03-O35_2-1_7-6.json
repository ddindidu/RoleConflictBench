We\u2019ve argued about money all week, and I know she expects me to call during my lunch to talk things through. She hates leaving things unresolved, and I can already hear her voice in my head, asking why I\u2019m avoiding her. But as I glance at my work email, I see a message from my supervisor about a professional development seminar. It\u2019s not mandatory, but everyone knows that signing up shows initiative. I should respond now, before my next shift starts, to show I\u2019m committed to my job and maybe get a leg up for the next promotion. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between texting Alex to smooth things over and composing a thoughtful reply to my supervisor. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to put them first."}
