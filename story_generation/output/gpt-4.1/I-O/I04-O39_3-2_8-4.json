I freeze, heart pounding. The foreman\u2019s safety talk from this morning echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cOne spill, one slip, and someone could get hurt. Don\u2019t wait.\u201d But my phone keeps buzzing, and I know it\u2019s Sam. I remember the look on his face after my careless joke at lunch, the way he turned away, shoulders tense. I should have apologized right then, but I didn\u2019t. Now, if I don\u2019t call him back, the misunderstanding will fester. I can\u2019t let our friendship crack over a stupid comment. But if I leave the spill, even for a minute, someone could get hurt\u2014and I\u2019ll be the one responsible. My hands tremble as I grip the mop and my phone, torn between the urgent need to fix what I broke with Sam and the duty to keep my coworkers safe. Both roles demand my immediate attention, and I can\u2019t see how to do right by both at the same time."}
