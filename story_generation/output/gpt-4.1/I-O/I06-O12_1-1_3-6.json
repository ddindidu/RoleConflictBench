As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a bit of terminology in the codebase\u2014nothing major, just a word I wasn\u2019t sure about. It wasn\u2019t blocking my progress, but the expectation was clear: communicate challenges early.\n\nBut as a software developer, my Slack was already pinging with a bug report from QA. A minor UI glitch, they said, one that only appeared under certain conditions and had a simple workaround. Still, the expectation was to jump on these issues quickly, to keep the product polished and users happy.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I messaged my mentor now, I\u2019d be pulling focus from the bug fix, risking a delay. But if I ignored my confusion, I\u2019d be going against the spirit of open communication my mentor encouraged. My mind spun with the competing demands, each role tugging me in a different direction, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to ask and the need to act."}
