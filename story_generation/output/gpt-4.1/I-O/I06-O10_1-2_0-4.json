As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the quarterly tax filing was due next week, and every detail had to be perfect. The pressure from management was clear\u2014no mistakes, no delays. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the email from my mentor. She\u2019d suggested some optional reading, saying it would help me grow in my career. The deadline wasn\u2019t for weeks, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed and eager to learn. I felt torn. If I focused solely on the tax filing, I\u2019d risk falling behind on my mentor\u2019s expectations. But if I spent time on the reading now, I might miss something crucial in the tax documents. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each important in its own way. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, caught between the need to excel as a mentee and the responsibility to deliver as an accountant."}
