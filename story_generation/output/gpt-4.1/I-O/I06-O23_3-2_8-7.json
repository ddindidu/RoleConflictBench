She\u2019d squeezed me in just before her flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her effort and commitment. Just as the call connected, my phone buzzed with a message from the firm\u2019s assistant. She needed access to sensitive client files\u2014files I was responsible for as the lead lawyer on the case. She said it would save her hours of work, and she sounded desperate. But she wasn\u2019t cleared for this information, and I knew the ethical boundaries I couldn\u2019t cross.\n\nMy mentor\u2019s face appeared on the screen, smiling, ready to dive in. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the mentee who didn\u2019t want to waste a second of this rare opportunity, and the lawyer who had to uphold client trust at all costs. My mind raced, torn between responding to the assistant\u2019s urgent request and focusing on my mentor, knowing that any choice would mean letting someone down."}
