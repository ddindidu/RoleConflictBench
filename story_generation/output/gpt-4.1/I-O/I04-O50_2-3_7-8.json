She thinks I was annoyed with her, but it was just a rushed text. I know I should call her right now, explain, and clear the air before the misunderstanding grows. That\u2019s what friends do: talk things out, not let silence fester. But as I reach for my phone, I see the new staff at the factory huddled around the old mixer, fumbling with the controls. They\u2019re about to start a batch, and I overhear one of them say, \u201cI think this is how it works.\u201d My heart jumps. If they don\u2019t follow the safety steps, someone could get hurt. I\u2019m supposed to guide them, make sure they know what they\u2019re doing. My friend needs me, but so do these staff\u2014right now, both expect me to step in, to fix things. I stand frozen, phone in hand, torn between dialing Jamie and rushing to the machine, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
