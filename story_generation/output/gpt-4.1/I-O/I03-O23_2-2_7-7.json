We\u2019d argued again this morning\u2014money, always money. He wanted us to be more open, to talk things through, to resolve our conflicts instead of letting them fester. I knew he expected me to reach out, to bridge the gap, but my mind was tangled in work. \n\nJust then, Jenna from the admin team knocked on my door, asking for access to the files for the Carter case. She said it would make things easier for everyone, but she wasn\u2019t assigned to the matter. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable. Still, Jenna looked frustrated, and I could feel the pressure to be a team player.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. Alex\u2019s name flashed on the screen, a reminder of the conversation I was avoiding.
