My team\u2019s weekly meeting was about to start, and I knew my manager expected everyone to be present and engaged, even if it was just a routine catch-up. The agenda wasn\u2019t urgent, and the meeting would be recorded, but I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my colleagues\u2019 voices if I didn\u2019t show up. At the same time, the loudspeaker in the break room crackled, announcing the start of a mandatory pre-shift briefing for all subway operators. New operational procedures were being rolled out, and attendance was non-negotiable\u2014missing it could mean disciplinary action or, worse, putting passengers at risk. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting as I stared at the door to the briefing room. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be a reliable teammate, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility as an operator. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding my presence at the same moment."}
