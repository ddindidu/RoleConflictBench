The team meeting was about to start\u2014our last chance to voice concerns before the project\u2019s direction was set in stone. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. But just as I was about to join, a courier arrived with a thick envelope: the case file for a procedural hearing I was scheduled to preside over in two weeks. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail thoroughly, to ensure fairness and preparedness, even for cases that seemed routine. The file was marked urgent, flagged for preliminary review today. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, while the file sat on my desk, demanding my attention. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014my team counting on my input, the court system counting on my diligence.
