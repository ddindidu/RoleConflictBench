The team meeting was about to start\u2014just a routine catch-up, but as a colleague, I was expected to show up, contribute, and support the team spirit. I knew the meeting would be recorded, but skipping it felt like letting my coworkers down, especially since we\u2019d all agreed to be more present after last quarter\u2019s feedback.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, today was the final day of the quarter. We were just shy of our sales target, and management had made it clear: if we didn\u2019t hit the number, there\u2019d be penalties, and the bonus I\u2019d been counting on would vanish. Every minute on the phone could mean another sale, another step closer to the goal. My phone buzzed with leads waiting to be called, and my manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind.\n\nI felt torn, anxiety twisting in my stomach. Should I log into the meeting and risk missing crucial sales, or focus on calls and risk disappointing my team? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
