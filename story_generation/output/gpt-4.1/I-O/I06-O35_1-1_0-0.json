My mentor\u2019s message flashed in my mind: \u201cIf you have time, try reading the article I sent. It\u2019ll help you understand the bigger picture.\u201d The deadline was weeks away, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed. I pulled out my phone, intending to skim the article before my shift started. But then the clock on the dashboard blinked\u2014time for the pre-departure check. The systems I needed to inspect weren\u2019t critical, but skipping the routine could mean missing a small issue that might grow. My supervisor always emphasized punctuality and thoroughness. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the eager mentee wanting to go above and beyond, and the responsible operator, trusted with hundreds of lives. My heart pounded as I stared at the article on my phone, then at the checklist in my hand, torn between the expectations of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
