As a mentor, I was expected to help guide her through a career crossroads\u2014her choice today could shape her entire future. I\u2019d promised her my full attention, to walk her through every option, every risk, every hope. But as I hurried down the hallway, the building manager caught my eye, frowning at the overflowing trash bin and the dust gathering in the corners. \u201cWe need the lounge spotless for the afternoon inspection,\u201d he said, voice tight. I nodded, feeling the weight of the mop in my hand. The expectation was clear: the space had to be immaculate, and I was the one responsible. My mind raced\u2014if I left the cleaning, I\u2019d let down my team and risk complaints. If I missed the meeting, I\u2019d fail my mentee at her most vulnerable moment. I stood frozen, torn between the mop and my phone, the demands of both roles pressing in, my chest tight with the fear of disappointing someone, no matter what I chose."}
