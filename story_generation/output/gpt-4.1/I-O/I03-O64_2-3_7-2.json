The numbers blur together, and I blink hard, trying to focus. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014another message from him. We\u2019ve argued all week about money, about how we spend it, about how we never seem to have enough. I know he expects me to talk things through, to resolve this before it festers any further. But right now, I\u2019m supposed to be the perfect cashier, double-checking every bill, every coin, making sure the drawer balances to the cent. My manager expects accuracy, no mistakes, especially with these high-value transactions. I feel the pressure mounting, my mind split between the need to fix things with him and the need to not mess up at work. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, knowing my shift is almost over, knowing he\u2019s waiting for an answer. I can\u2019t be both at once, not right now. My hands tremble as I reach for the next stack of bills, torn between the demands of love and responsibility."}
