Tomorrow, I\u2019d be leading the assembly of a custom cabinet set\u2014a big step in my carpentry career. But as I traced the lines on the drawings, a term jumped out at me: \u201cdado joint.\u201d I\u2019d heard it before, but suddenly, I wasn\u2019t sure I understood it fully. As a mentee, I was supposed to reach out to my mentor with any questions, no matter how small. But this didn\u2019t feel urgent; I could probably figure it out with a quick search or by piecing together what I already knew.\n\nStill, the expectation nagged at me. My mentor always said, \u201cDon\u2019t let confusion fester\u2014ask.\u201d But as a carpenter, I was expected to be prepared, self-reliant, and ready to interpret technical documents on my own. I worried that asking about something so basic would make me seem unprepared for tomorrow\u2019s project. My phone sat on the bench, my mentor\u2019s number ready to dial. I stared at it, torn between reaching out and proving I could handle this on my own."}
