Ahead, I spotted Mark, someone I knew from the building\u2014a familiar face, but not quite a friend. As an acquaintance, I knew I should smile, maybe offer a quick hello, keep things light and friendly. That\u2019s what people expect, right? But my mind was still tangled in the last call I\u2019d made as a telemarketer. The customer had bombarded me with technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely covered. I could still feel the pressure in my chest, the expectation to sound confident, to handle every objection smoothly, even when I didn\u2019t have all the answers. Now, as Mark approached, I felt my face tighten, unsure if I could muster the easy friendliness he\u2019d expect. My mind raced with half-remembered product details and the fear of being caught off guard\u2014by him, by the next call, by myself. I wanted to be approachable, but I also wanted to retreat, to prepare, to not be exposed as uncertain. As we drew closer, I felt the two roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I hesitated, caught between a smile and a sigh."}
