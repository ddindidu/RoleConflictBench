My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014another message from Alex. Our argument from last night still hangs heavy between us, and his words echo in my head: \u201cAre we even right for each other?\u201d I know he expects me to respond, to try and fix things, to show I care enough to fight for us. But right now, I\u2019m supposed to be focused on my job, making sure every item is scanned correctly, every total is accurate. The line is short, but I can feel the customers\u2019 eyes on me, waiting for me to finish. My heart pounds as I glance at the phone, torn between the urge to text him back and the responsibility to do my job well. If I ignore him, the distance between us might grow. If I answer, I risk making a mistake at the register. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both."}
