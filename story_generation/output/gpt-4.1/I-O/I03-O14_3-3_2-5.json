The cursor blinked accusingly on the half-finished results section, the journal\u2019s submission portal open in another tab, the deadline just hours away.

I knew he needed me, needed my arms around him, my words, my presence. But the data sets on my screen demanded my attention, every detail needing to be checked, every sentence crafted with precision. My mind raced with statistical analyses and comforting words, guilt gnawing at me for even considering my work at a time like this.
