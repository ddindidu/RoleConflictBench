She\u2019d squeezed in this session just for me, her voice already tinged with the rush of travel. I knew how much she valued punctuality and focus\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that her time was precious, especially today. But as I tried to listen, my work phone buzzed insistently. I was on call as a telemarketer, and the campaign was in full swing. Most callers were easy, just a few questions I could answer in my sleep, but the company expected me to pick up every call, no exceptions. My supervisor had warned me: missing even one could affect my numbers. I felt my heart race as the phone rang again, my mentor pausing mid-sentence, waiting for my response. I was torn\u2014should I respect my mentor\u2019s rare availability, or do my job and answer the call? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I could feel myself caught in the middle, unable to satisfy either expectation without letting the other down."}
