It\u2019s Alex\u2014he\u2019s upset because I forgot to confirm our weekend plans, and now he thinks I don\u2019t care. I can almost hear his voice in the texts, hurt and frustrated, and I know if I don\u2019t respond now, the misunderstanding will only grow. But the loudspeaker crackles, calling all operators to the mandatory pre-shift briefing. New procedures are being rolled out, and attendance is non-negotiable. My supervisor\u2019s eyes sweep the hallway, making it clear there\u2019s no room for tardiness or distraction. I clutch my phone, feeling the weight of Alex\u2019s expectations to resolve things quickly, to be present and reassuring. At the same time, the responsibility of my job presses in\u2014lives depend on my focus and adherence to protocol. My heart pounds as I stand frozen between the two worlds, torn by the impossible timing, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
