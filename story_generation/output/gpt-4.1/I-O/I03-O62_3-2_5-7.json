He looked at me with that soft, searching gaze, and I knew he wanted these hours to be just about us\u2014no distractions, no interruptions. But as I leaned in, laughter and splashing caught my attention. Across the pool, a group of teenagers was daring each other to dive right under the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My lifeguard instincts kicked in, heart pounding with the familiar surge of responsibility. I was supposed to keep everyone safe, to enforce the rules, no exceptions. But if I left Alex now, even for a moment, I\u2019d be breaking the promise I made to make this day special for him. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, my mind racing between duty and love, torn by the impossible choice I had to make."}
