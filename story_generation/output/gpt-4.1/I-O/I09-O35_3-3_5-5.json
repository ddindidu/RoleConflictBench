The HOA inspection was today, and I knew anything left in the hallway could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I wanted to be considerate\u2014she needed her walker close by, and moving it might upset her. But as I hurried past, my phone buzzed: a message from dispatch. There was a medical emergency on my train, and the passenger alarm had been triggered. My duty as a subway operator was clear\u2014get there fast, ensure everyone\u2019s safety, and provide help. But the image of the walker lingered in my mind. If I left it, the HOA might fine Mrs. Kim or even the whole floor. If I stopped to move it, I\u2019d be late, and someone on my train needed me. My heart pounded as I stood in the corridor, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible subway operator, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from all sides."}
