He\u2019d just moved to the city and looked genuinely hopeful, expecting me to offer some friendly advice. I started to tell him about a cozy Italian place around the corner, but then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a commotion across the street. Two men were fighting, and it was escalating fast\u2014one of them had a bottle in his hand, and a small crowd was gathering, some people backing away in fear. My training as a police officer kicked in immediately. I knew I was expected to intervene, to protect everyone in that square from harm. But Mark was still looking at me, waiting for my answer, unaware of the chaos unfolding. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding I be a helpful friend, the other insisting I act to keep the public safe. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the expectations of friendship and duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both at once."}
