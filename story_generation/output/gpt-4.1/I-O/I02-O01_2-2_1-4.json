My phone buzzed\u2014another message from Mia. She\u2019d had a rough day, her boss criticizing her project, and she needed me. I could hear her voice trembling when she called, and I wanted nothing more than to hold her, reassure her that she was brilliant. But my mind kept drifting back to the office layout, the pressure to create a space that would actually help people like Mia thrive at work. My boss expected a flawless plan by morning, and I knew every minute counted. Yet, how could I ignore Mia\u2019s pain? I felt torn, my heart aching for her, my mind racing with design solutions. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which part of myself to give."}
