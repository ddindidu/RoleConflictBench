He sounded desperate\u2014he was moving apartments today and his help had bailed. \u201cCan you come by? Just need a hand with a few boxes,\u201d he wrote. As an acquaintance, I felt that tug of obligation; I knew how stressful moving could be, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. But as I was locking up, I noticed the lane rope in the main pool was snapped, floating limply in the water. Swim lessons were scheduled in less than an hour, and as the lifeguard on duty, it was my responsibility to make sure all equipment was safe and ready. If I left now, the lessons might be delayed or unsafe. If I stayed, Mark would be left stranded, maybe thinking I didn\u2019t care. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
