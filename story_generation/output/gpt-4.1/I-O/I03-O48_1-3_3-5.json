Just us.\u201d My heart lifts. We\u2019ve both been so busy, but this week, our schedules finally align. I imagine us laughing over pasta, his hand in mine, the comfort of being together without rushing. But then, my work phone buzzes. The charge nurse\u2019s voice is urgent\u2014Mrs. Carter, the patient I\u2019m assigned to, is in critical condition. Her blood pressure has been unstable, and I\u2019m responsible for checking her vitals every few minutes. I know how important it is; one missed reading could mean missing a sign that she\u2019s crashing. \n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. Alex wants me present, attentive, making memories. My patient needs me vigilant, focused, and reliable. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the thought of letting either down twists my stomach. I stare at the two screens, my fingers hovering, torn between love and duty, wishing I could split myself in two."}
