Mine was only half-full, but tomorrow was pickup day. Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, always reminded me to be mindful\u2014don\u2019t overflow, don\u2019t block the sidewalk, keep the lids closed. I prided myself on being considerate, never leaving a mess or taking up more than my share of space. But as I sipped my coffee, my phone buzzed with a reminder: another hour of telemarketing calls before dinner. My sales numbers were already strong this week, but management\u2019s emails kept coming\u2014push harder, don\u2019t let up, every call counts. I knew if I stayed on the phone longer, I could easily surpass my quota, maybe even earn a bonus. But that meant I\u2019d miss the window to take out the trash before the trucks came, and the bins would sit there, half-empty, wasting space and annoying the neighbors. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I focus on my job and risk being the inconsiderate neighbor, or keep the peace on my street and possibly fall short of the relentless expectations at work?"}
