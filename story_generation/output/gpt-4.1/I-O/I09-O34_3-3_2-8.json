The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and as a neighbor, I was expected to show up, smile, and help smooth things over. I hurried downstairs, rehearsing polite phrases in my head, determined to be the friendly face everyone needed. But just as I stepped into the lobby, my headset crackled. An emergency diversion was unfolding, cutting across three sectors. My colleagues\u2019 voices were tense, needing my immediate coordination to keep the skies safe. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectant eyes of my neighbors, waiting for calm reassurance, and the urgent voices in my ear, demanding focus and quick decisions. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the need to be present and polite in the lobby, and the responsibility to guide planes safely through chaos above."}
