My mentee, Sarah, is waiting for our scheduled chat\u2014she\u2019s on the verge of accepting a job offer, and she\u2019s counting on me to help her weigh the pros and cons. I promised her my full attention, to walk her through every angle, every possible outcome. But my telemarketing shift is still on, and though the call volume is light, I\u2019m expected to take my break now, not later. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStick to your break schedule, even if it\u2019s quiet. We need consistency.\u201d I know if I delay, I\u2019ll be out of sync with the team, maybe even flagged for not following protocol. Yet, if I rush Sarah or cut our conversation short, I risk letting her down at a pivotal moment. My phone buzzes with her message: \u201cReady when you are!\u201d I stare at the screen, torn between the rigid structure of my job and the responsibility I feel as her mentor. My heart pounds as I weigh which expectation to honor, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
