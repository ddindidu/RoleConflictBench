He was excited that we both finally had free evenings this week, suggesting we pick a night to go out and spend some real time together. I could almost hear his voice, hopeful and eager, and I wanted nothing more than to say yes, to promise him a night just for us. But then my work phone buzzed\u2014a new delivery assignment, flagged urgent. I was to hand-deliver a high-value package, and the recipient was only available in the evenings, the same window as our possible date nights. My manager\u2019s message was clear: this delivery had to be perfect, no mistakes, no rescheduling. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of my boyfriend\u2019s expectations for closeness and my boss\u2019s demand for reliability pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing either of them. I sat there, phone in each hand, torn between the promise of laughter and warmth, and the responsibility of a job that trusted me with so much."}
