A new email notification from my colleague, Mark, flashed on the screen. The subject line read, \u201cFYI\u2014No Action Needed.\u201d I knew our team valued quick responses, even for informational messages. It was part of our unspoken code: stay connected, stay reliable. But as I parked, I saw the time\u2014this package was already running a bit late, though still within the promised delivery window. The customer had called earlier, sounding anxious about the arrival. I felt the pressure to hurry, to make sure the package reached the right door without delay. My phone buzzed again, a gentle reminder of my other world\u2014the office, the team, the expectation to be present and responsive. I sat for a moment, torn between tapping out a quick reply to Mark or grabbing the package and running it up to the door. Both roles demanded something of me, and I could feel the tension tightening in my chest as I weighed which expectation to meet first."}
