My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had texted me earlier, asking if I could receive her package since she\u2019d be out. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these little favors. I promised her I\u2019d be home, and I meant it. But just as I was about to settle in, the salon phone rang. An irate client was demanding to come in before closing, furious about her last haircut. My boss expects me to handle complaints with patience and professionalism, no matter how late it gets. I could hear the tension in her voice, and I knew if I didn\u2019t help, she\u2019d leave a bad review or worse, complain to my manager. My heart pounded as I weighed the neighborly promise against my professional duty. Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my full attention, and I felt trapped in the middle, unable to satisfy either without letting someone down."}
