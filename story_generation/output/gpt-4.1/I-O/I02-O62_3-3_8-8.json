We\u2019d been fighting for days, and now she was saying she wasn\u2019t sure we should stay together. My heart pounded, desperate to fix things, to say the right words and prove I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I opened my mouth, I caught a glimpse of a small figure flailing in the deep end\u2014where kids weren\u2019t allowed. My training kicked in, every muscle tensing with the urge to blow my whistle, to jump in if needed, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. But my girlfriend\u2019s gaze held me, pleading for answers, for reassurance, for me to choose her in this moment. I felt split in two, the weight of her expectations pressing down on me, the responsibility of every swimmer\u2019s safety pulling me the other way. My mind raced, torn between the person I loved and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
