As an architect, I knew every inch mattered\u2014each wall, each window, each door had to serve a purpose. I was determined to make the space functional, even if it meant reworking the layout for the third time this week. My phone buzzed, a reminder that my mentor\u2019s office hours had just started. She\u2019d made it clear: her time was precious, and I should come prepared with questions, not just drop in for a chat. I glanced at my half-finished sketch, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and the momentum I\u2019d built. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the chance to get her feedback, and maybe even seem ungrateful for her availability. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to respect my mentor\u2019s time and the pressing need to finish my design. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I could give at once."}
