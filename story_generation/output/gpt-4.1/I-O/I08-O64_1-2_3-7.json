It\u2019s Jamie, an old classmate I haven\u2019t seen in years. As I scan her items, she leans in and asks, \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here? I\u2019m meeting someone for lunch.\u201d As an acquaintance, I want to help her out, maybe even catch up a little, but as the cashier, I see the line growing longer and the impatience on the faces behind her. My manager expects me to keep things moving and be friendly to everyone, not just the people I know. Jamie looks at me, waiting for a thoughtful answer, while the next customer sighs loudly. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014do I take a moment to help Jamie, or do I keep the line moving and risk seeming cold? My mind races, torn between being a helpful acquaintance and a responsible cashier, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly feel impossible to balance."}
