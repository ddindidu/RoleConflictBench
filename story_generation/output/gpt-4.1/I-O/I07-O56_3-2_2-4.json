The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and this was the final discussion before we locked in the new project direction. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about the outcome. But right in front of me, my client\u2014a first-time visitor\u2014was staring at her reflection, her lips pressed tight, eyes flicking nervously over the colour in her hair. I could see the disappointment, the uncertainty. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to make sure she left happy, to listen and fix any concerns. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, and I felt the pressure mounting. If I left her now, she might never come back, might even complain. But if I missed the meeting, I\u2019d let my team down, maybe lose their trust. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
