The phone queue is relentless, and management has sent two reminders today about sticking to break times. But across the desk, my mentee, Sarah, looks at me with anxious eyes. She\u2019s about to submit her first major report, and she\u2019s unsure about a crucial section. If she gets it wrong, the client could lose trust in our team. She asks, \u201cCan you walk me through this part again?\u201d I know she needs my full attention, and as her mentor, I\u2019m expected to guide her through these high-stakes moments, sharing everything I\u2019ve learned. But my headset buzzes with another call, and I see the supervisor\u2019s shadow in the hallway. If I miss my break or stay too long, I\u2019ll be flagged\u2014again. My chest tightens as I weigh the pressure to be the reliable mentor Sarah needs against the strict telemarketer rules I\u2019m expected to follow. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the seconds tick by, each one demanding a choice I\u2019m not ready to make."}
