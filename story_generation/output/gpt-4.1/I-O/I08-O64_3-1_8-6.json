My mind was still reeling from what I\u2019d overheard earlier in the break room\u2014a rumor about Sarah, someone we both knew from the neighborhood. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip, believing it only led to trouble. But now, as I smiled and greeted the next customer, I saw it was Mark, another mutual friend. He leaned in, lowering his voice, \u201cHey, did you hear anything about Sarah? People are saying things.\u201d \n\nI felt my heart thud. As a cashier, I was expected to be friendly and approachable, to make small talk and connect with customers. But as an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t spread what I\u2019d heard, especially since it could hurt Sarah\u2019s reputation. Mark\u2019s expectant look made my hands tremble as I bagged his groceries. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one urging me to be open and sociable, the other warning me to keep quiet and protect someone\u2019s privacy. I hesitated, caught between the urge to maintain friendly service and the responsibility to do no harm."}
