It was our last chance before she left for her new job overseas, and I could see how much it meant to her. She\u2019d planned everything\u2014her favorite caf\u00e9, a walk by the river, even a quiet evening at home. I wanted to be present, to hold her hand and make her feel like nothing else mattered. But as we sat together, my phone buzzed with an urgent message: a protest downtown was spiraling out of control. Officers were being called in, and as a sergeant, I was expected to lead. I saw the hope in Mia\u2019s eyes flicker, replaced by worry. My badge weighed heavy in my pocket, a reminder of my duty to protect the city.
