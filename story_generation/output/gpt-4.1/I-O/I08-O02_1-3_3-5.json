It was Mark, someone I knew from the gym, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for his anniversary dinner. He sounded excited, and I knew he trusted my taste. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help him out, maybe even suggest a place and make a reservation for him. But at that very moment, an email from the external inspector popped up on my screen\u2014urgent, flagged red. There were safety concerns in our plant, and if I didn\u2019t address them immediately, operations could be shut down. As an engineer, I was expected to drop everything and ensure compliance, to protect not just the company but everyone\u2019s safety. My mind raced, torn between wanting to be a helpful friend and the heavy responsibility of my job. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
