She\u2019d been missing deadlines, and I knew she needed guidance\u2014maybe a chat about prioritizing tasks, or just a listening ear. As her mentor, I felt responsible for her growth, for helping her find her footing in the chaos. But just as I stood to approach her, a shrill screech echoed from the production floor. The main conveyor\u2019s bearing was failing\u2014if I didn\u2019t get there now, the whole line could grind to a halt. My phone buzzed with a maintenance alert, and I could already picture the supervisor\u2019s glare if I delayed. I glanced back at Jamie, torn. She needed me, but so did the machines.
