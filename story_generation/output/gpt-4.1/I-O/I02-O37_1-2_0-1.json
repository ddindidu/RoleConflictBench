My mind starts ticking through the list of chores I haven\u2019t finished yet\u2014vacuuming, wiping down surfaces, taking out the trash. But then I see her on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on her phone. She looks up and gives me a tired smile, and I can tell something\u2019s weighing on her. As her boyfriend, I know I should sit beside her, ask about her day, and listen\u2014really listen\u2014to whatever\u2019s on her mind. She deserves my attention and support, especially when she\u2019s feeling off. But the mess nags at me, too. As the one responsible for keeping the place clean, I feel guilty letting things slide, even for a night. I stand in the hallway, torn between grabbing the cleaning spray or sitting down next to her, my heart pulled in two directions by the expectations I can\u2019t seem to meet at the same time."}
