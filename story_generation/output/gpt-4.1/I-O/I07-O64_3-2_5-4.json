The deadline was tonight, and I could already imagine the anxious messages piling up in our group chat.\n\nBut right now, I was a cashier, and the line at my register was growing. A woman stepped forward, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded for a return, explaining her situation, but store policy was clear: no receipt, no refund. My manager had drilled this into us, and I knew I\u2019d be held accountable if I bent the rules.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides.
