It\u2019s Saturday afternoon, the last weekend before Alex leaves for his new job in Germany. He\u2019s in the kitchen, humming as he makes coffee, and I can feel the weight of his expectation\u2014this is our time, our last chance to be together before months apart. But my work laptop sits open on the couch, the telemarketing software blinking. My scheduled break is almost over, and management has been strict lately, watching every minute logged. If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get another warning, maybe worse. But if I go back to work now, I\u2019ll miss the walk Alex planned, the one he\u2019s been talking about all week. I can see the hope in his eyes, the silent plea for just a few uninterrupted hours. My chest tightens as I weigh the demands\u2014my job\u2019s rigid rules against the fragile, precious time with the person I love. I stand frozen, torn between the ringing phone and Alex\u2019s waiting smile, feeling the pressure build as I try to decide which part of me to let down."}
