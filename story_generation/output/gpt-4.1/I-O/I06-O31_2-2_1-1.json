My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI expect you to have this ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show I could handle the responsibility.

Reports said the crowd was swelling, tempers flaring, and the risk of violence growing by the minute.\n\nAs I pulled on my uniform, my mind raced. I knew what was expected of me as a police officer: to be present, to keep the peace, to protect people from harm. But the code assignment weighed on me, a promise to my mentor and to myself. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours to work on the code. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my team and the community.
