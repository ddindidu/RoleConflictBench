As a nursing assistant, I knew I needed to check her vital signs again\u2014her temperature and pulse had been a little high after her procedure, and I couldn\u2019t let anything slip by. Just as I rounded the corner, I saw Mark, an old acquaintance from college, walking toward me. He smiled, clearly recognizing me, and slowed down, expecting at least a friendly hello or a quick chat. I felt the pressure of my two worlds colliding. Mark\u2019s eyes searched mine for warmth and familiarity, but my thoughts were tangled with numbers and protocols. I knew the patient was waiting, and my supervisor expected timely, accurate records. Yet, I also didn\u2019t want to seem cold or dismissive to Mark, who probably just wanted a moment of connection. My heart pounded as I tried to decide whether to stop and greet him or rush past with only a hurried nod, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of friendship."}
