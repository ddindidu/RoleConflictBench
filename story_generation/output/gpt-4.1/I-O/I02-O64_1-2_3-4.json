We finally have time!\u201d I\u2019d promised her we\u2019d make the most of our free evenings this week, just the two of us, no distractions. I wanted to be the boyfriend she deserved\u2014attentive, present, making her feel special. But as my shift resumed, a customer approached the register, frustration etched on her face. She wanted to return a blender, but she didn\u2019t have a receipt. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions, even if the customer got upset. I could feel the tension building inside me. If I followed the rules, I\u2019d likely delay closing, making me late for our date. If I bent the rules, I\u2019d risk my job. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, her name lighting up the screen. I stood there, torn between being the reliable boyfriend she hoped for and the responsible cashier my boss expected."}
