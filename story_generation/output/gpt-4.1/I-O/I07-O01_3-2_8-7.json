I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from leadership, asking for a quick confirmation on the specs we\u2019d promised the external partner. As a colleague, I knew how important it was to respond quickly, to keep the team moving and show reliability. But at that moment, I was deep in a call with the site contractor, sorting out a last-minute issue with the foundation pour. If I didn\u2019t give the contractor my full attention, the project could slip off schedule, and I\u2019d be failing in my role as the architect responsible for efficient project management.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, torn between the pinging messages and the urgent questions from the contractor. My mind raced\u2014should I pause the call and risk losing the contractor\u2019s focus, or ignore the messages and risk letting down my colleagues and leadership? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my frustration rising as I tried to decide which role to prioritize in that moment."}
