She was away for the week and had asked me to keep an eye out for her package, especially since the building\u2019s power would be out for a few hours today. She sounded anxious, and I knew how much she relied on those deliveries. I promised I\u2019d help, but as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard soft sobs from Room 204. My patient, Mr. Harris, had just learned his cancer had returned. He looked so small in his bed, tears streaking his cheeks, and I knew he needed someone to sit with him, to listen, to just be there. My mind raced\u2014should I step out to check on Mrs. Lee\u2019s package before the power cut, or stay with Mr. Harris, who was so alone in this moment? Both needed me, both expected something only I could give right now. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the neighbor who trusted me and the patient who needed comfort, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
