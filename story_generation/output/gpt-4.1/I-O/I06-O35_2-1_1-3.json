My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI want to see your code sample before our next meeting. Three days, okay?\u201d I\u2019d nodded eagerly, but now, with my shift stretching into the night, my laptop sat unopened in my bag. The intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop is closest to the hospital?\u201d The passenger\u2019s voice was anxious, and I knew my job was to help, to be present and attentive. But my mind kept drifting to the unfinished code, the pressure to impress my mentor, to not fall behind. I felt torn\u2014every minute spent guiding passengers was a minute lost for coding, but every moment I spent thinking about my assignment made me worry I\u2019d miss something important on the train. My hands hovered over the intercom button, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
