Users can\u2019t log in. Can you look now?\u201d My laptop is already open, error logs scrolling past, my mind racing to trace the bug. But then I hear a soft sigh from the couch. My partner sits hunched, eyes red, clutching a crumpled email. He barely looks up as I approach, but I can feel the weight of his disappointment filling the room. He needs me\u2014needs comfort, reassurance, someone to listen. I want to drop everything, wrap him in my arms, and tell him it\u2019ll be okay. But the outage is critical; customers are locked out, and the team is waiting for me to fix it. My inbox pings again, more frantic messages. I\u2019m torn, guilt gnawing at me. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give my full self to both. My hands hover over the keyboard, my eyes flicker to my partner. I feel the pressure mounting, the impossible choice pressing in from both sides."}
