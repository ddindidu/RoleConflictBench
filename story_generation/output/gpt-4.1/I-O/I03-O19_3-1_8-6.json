Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, the threat of breaking up hanging between us. I knew he expected me to reach out, to try to fix things, to show that I cared enough to fight for us. But as I scrolled through the pharmacy newsletter, my mind kept drifting. There was a new drug release, and I needed to understand its interactions before my shift ended. My manager always expected us to be on top of these updates, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the article, but Alex\u2019s words kept flashing across my screen. I felt torn\u2014should I put down the newsletter and call him, or keep reading so I wouldn\u2019t let my team down? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which part of myself to let down first."}
