My phone buzzed with a message from Priya, my mentee. \u201cCan I ask you something about client interviews? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d She\u2019d always been eager, and I\u2019d promised to help her whenever I could. Usually, I\u2019d answer her questions during coffee breaks, sharing stories and advice, enjoying the chance to guide someone just starting out. But today, the stakes were different. My client was counting on me to be focused, sharp, and ready to defend them in a case that could change their life. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Priya\u2019s trust in my guidance, my client\u2019s trust in my advocacy. My heart pounded as I stared at her message, torn between the urge to help her and the need to give my undivided attention to the trial. The courthouse clock ticked louder, and I felt the tension coil inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both the mentor Priya needed and the lawyer my client deserved, not at this moment."}
