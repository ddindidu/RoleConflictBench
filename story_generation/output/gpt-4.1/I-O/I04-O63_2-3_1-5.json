It was Jamie, my best friend, her name flashing on the screen. I hesitated, thumb hovering. I could hear her shaky voice through the receiver, \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I knew what she expected\u2014someone to listen, to care, to help her untangle the mess of her latest fight with her partner. But glancing at the clock, I felt my stomach twist. It was the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale. No exceptions.\u201d The spreadsheet on my screen showed I was just two calls away from hitting my target, the bonus that would help with next month\u2019s rent. My headset felt heavier than usual. Jamie\u2019s voice was pleading, but so was the silent pressure from my job. I wanted to be the friend she needed, but I also needed to be the employee my team was counting on. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking call, torn between picking up for Jamie or making the next sales call."}
