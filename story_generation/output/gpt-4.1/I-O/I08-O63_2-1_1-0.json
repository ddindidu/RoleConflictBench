As an acquaintance, I knew I should be warm, easygoing, someone who could help her feel at ease. I smiled, introduced myself, and tried to keep the conversation light. But as she hesitantly asked what I did for work, my mind shifted. As a telemarketer, I was trained to anticipate objections, to answer questions with practiced confidence, to keep the conversation moving toward a goal. When she asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it hard to call strangers all day?\u201d I felt the urge to launch into my well-rehearsed script, to handle her question like any other customer\u2019s. But I could see her uncertainty, her need for genuine connection, not a sales pitch. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to be efficient and persuasive versus the need to be gentle and real. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between the friendly acquaintance she needed and the telemarketer I was trained to be."}
