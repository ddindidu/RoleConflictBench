He\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning a quiet dinner at home, just the two of us. I promised I\u2019d be present, no distractions, just us. But as I\u2019m getting ready, my phone buzzes with a message from my manager: \u201cWe\u2019re close to breaking the monthly sales record. If you can make a few more calls tonight, we\u2019ll hit it.\u201d My sales numbers are already strong, but the team is counting on me. I know how much it would mean to my boss\u2014and to my own career\u2014if I help push us over the top. My boyfriend is setting the table, humming softly, and I can see the anticipation in his eyes. My phone feels heavy in my hand. I want to be the supportive girlfriend he deserves, but I also want to be the reliable team player my job demands. The pressure builds inside me as I stand in the hallway, torn between the dinner waiting in the next room and the calls I could be making."}
