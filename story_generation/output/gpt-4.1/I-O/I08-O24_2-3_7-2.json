Unbelievable.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort. I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossip, believing it only breeds negativity. I wanted to change the subject, to steer clear of speaking ill about Sarah, who I barely knew outside of work. But before I could respond, my phone buzzed urgently. The court clerk\u2019s message flashed on the screen: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. As a judge, I was expected to drop everything, review the case files thoroughly, and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting camaraderie or at least a nod of agreement. At the same time, the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed down on me\u2014I needed to focus, to give the case my full attention, but I was still here, caught in this awkward moment. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
