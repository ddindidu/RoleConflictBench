My radio crackled with updates\u2014high tide, strong currents, the beach packed with families and kids shrieking in the surf. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating with the urgency of a message from him. Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind, his words raw and final: \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not right for each other.\u201d He wanted to talk, to resolve things, to know if we were going to make it. I could picture him waiting, hoping for a reply that would fix everything.
