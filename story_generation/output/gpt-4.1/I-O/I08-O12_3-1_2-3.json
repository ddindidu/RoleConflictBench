As a software developer, I knew how important it was to show up and collaborate with other teams, especially since we were about to define new features. Even though the session was technically optional, I felt a subtle pressure to attend\u2014my absence might be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged.\n\nJust as I passed the break room, I spotted Jamie, someone I\u2019d chatted with a few times at office events, sitting alone and crying quietly. As an acquaintance, I felt a tug to stop, offer comfort, and be approachable. But the clock was ticking, and the session was about to start. If I stayed, I might miss the chance to contribute ideas and show my commitment to the team. If I left, I\u2019d be ignoring someone who clearly needed a friendly face. My mind raced, torn between being the supportive acquaintance Jamie needed and the dedicated developer my team expected. I hovered in the hallway, heart pounding, unsure which role to step into."}
