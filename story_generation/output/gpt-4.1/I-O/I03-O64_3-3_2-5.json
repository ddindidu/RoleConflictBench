His mother had passed away just hours ago, and all I wanted was to hold him, to be there for him, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But inside, the clock was ticking. My manager had just handed me the register keys and reminded me, again, that the end-of-day deposit had to be counted, logged, and double-checked\u2014no shortcuts, no mistakes, or we\u2019d risk an audit. My hands shook as I sorted the bills, my mind torn between the numbers in front of me and the image of Alex, lost and needing me. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down, the store\u2019s fluorescent lights harsh and unfeeling, the grief outside raw and urgent. I wanted to run to him, but I knew what was expected of me here. My heart pounded as I stared at the cash, caught between duty and love, not knowing which role I was supposed to choose."}
