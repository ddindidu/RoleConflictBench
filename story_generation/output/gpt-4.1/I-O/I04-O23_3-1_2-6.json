I answered, hearing my friend\u2019s shaky voice on the other end. She was crying, barely able to get the words out about her family\u2019s tragedy. I sat up, heart pounding, listening as she poured out her pain. I wanted to comfort her, to be the friend she needed\u2014someone who listened, who offered warmth and understanding. But my mind kept drifting back to the networking event earlier that evening, where a colleague had pressed me for details about a client\u2019s case. I\u2019d dodged the question, but the pressure lingered. Now, as my friend sobbed, she mentioned a name\u2014one that matched my client\u2019s. My roles collided: as a friend, I wanted to help, to share what I knew; as a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between loyalty and duty, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
