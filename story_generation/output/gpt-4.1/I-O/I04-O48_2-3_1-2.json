I glanced at the screen\u2014my best friend, Sarah. I hesitated, but answered, whispering, \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Her voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now. I had a huge fight with Mark.\u201d I could hear the tears in her voice, and my heart ached. I wanted nothing more than to listen, to be the friend she needed, to offer comfort and understanding.\n\nBut as I looked up, I saw Mr. Thompson struggling to lift his spoon, his face contorted in pain. He needed me, too. My job as a nursing assistant meant I was responsible for his well-being, for making sure he could eat and feel cared for. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Sarah\u2019s need for emotional support, Mr. Thompson\u2019s need for physical assistance. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be there for my friend and the duty to care for my patient. I stood frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two people who needed me in completely different ways."}
