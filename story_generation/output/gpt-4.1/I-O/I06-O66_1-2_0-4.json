I knew she expected me to take initiative, to show I was serious about learning. The book sat on the passenger seat, unopened, a silent reminder of what I should be doing in my spare moments. But right now, my focus had to be on the road. Rain streaked the windshield, and the wipers struggled to keep up. Cars darted between lanes, their brake lights flashing unpredictably. As a taxi driver, I was expected to keep my passengers safe, to anticipate every sudden stop and swerve. My mind kept drifting to the reading, wondering if I should have squeezed in a few pages during my last break. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014was I letting my mentor down by not making more time? But every time I considered pulling over to read, another car splashed past, reminding me that my responsibility here was to drive defensively, to get everyone home safely. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I gripped the wheel tighter, caught between what I owed my mentor and what I owed my passengers."}
