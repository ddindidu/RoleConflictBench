My trainee, Maya, stood beside me, her eyes fixed on the control panel as I explained the intricacies of the emergency brake system. She was nervous\u2014this was her first time handling a live run, and I knew how much she depended on my guidance. I wanted to give her my full attention, to answer every question and make sure she understood the gravity of each action.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an email notification. It was from HR: an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. The catch was, spots were limited and would fill up fast. As a subway operator, I was expected to stay updated and participate in these seminars, showing my commitment to the job and my own growth. But if I took a moment to respond now, I\u2019d be distracted from Maya, risking her confidence and possibly her safety. My mind raced, torn between being the mentor she needed and the professional I was expected to be. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between two sets of expectations."}
