We\u2019d argued three times this week about our budget, and she wanted to talk tonight\u2014she said we couldn\u2019t keep ignoring it. As her boyfriend, I knew I should go home, listen, and help us work through this. But inside, I clutched the workshop flyer, my name already on the sign-in sheet. The pharmacy had just updated our prescription guidelines, and my manager expected me to be on top of every change. If I missed this session, I\u2019d fall behind, maybe even risk giving patients outdated advice. My chest tightened as I pictured Mia waiting, frustrated, while I sat in a room full of colleagues, my mind half on the lecture, half on her. I wanted to be the partner she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my professional standards slip. The clock on the dashboard ticked closer to the workshop\u2019s start time, and I stared at my phone, torn between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
