The screeching of the critical bearing echoed in my head, and I knew every second counted\u2014if I didn\u2019t get there soon, the whole line could go down. Just as I rounded the corner, I saw Mark, someone I\u2019d chatted with a few times at lunch. He smiled and slowed, clearly expecting a friendly hello, maybe even a quick conversation. I felt the weight of my two roles pressing in on me. As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be warm and approachable, not just rush past like he didn\u2019t matter. But as the machine repairer, I was expected to drop everything and fix the problem before it became a disaster. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, feeling the tension twist inside me."}
