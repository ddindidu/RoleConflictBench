The radio crackled with routine updates, but my thoughts were tangled in the mess I\u2019d left behind at the hospital. As a mentee, I was supposed to keep my mentor in the loop, especially now that my teammates and I were at each other\u2019s throats, threatening to derail our project. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice: \u201cLet me know if anything gets in the way.\u201d But I was behind the wheel, responsible for getting this ambulance safely to the satellite station for the shift change. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014probably another message from the team, or maybe my mentor checking in. I couldn\u2019t risk a distraction, not with pedestrians and traffic swirling around me. Every second I delayed reaching out to my mentor, the conflict at work grew worse. But if I took my eyes off the road, even for a moment, I\u2019d be failing in my duty as a driver. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt trapped, torn between the urgent need to communicate and the equally urgent need to drive safely."}
