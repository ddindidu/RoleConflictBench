She needed me\u2014her text was shaky, words barely holding together. Her uncle had passed away, and she was at home, alone, asking if I could come over. My heart twisted; I wanted nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her and let her cry on my shoulder. But the back seat of my cab was a mess\u2014someone had just gotten sick, and the smell lingered, sour and sharp. I had a fare waiting at the next block, a regular who always complimented my spotless car. My boss had warned me: one more complaint about hygiene, and I\u2019d be suspended. I stared at the steering wheel, torn. Mia needed me, but so did my job. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations\u2014her grief, my duty. I could almost hear her sobs through the phone, but the ticking meter and the memory of my boss\u2019s stern face pressed in on me. I sat there, caught between the person I loved and the work that kept us both afloat, not knowing which way to turn."}
