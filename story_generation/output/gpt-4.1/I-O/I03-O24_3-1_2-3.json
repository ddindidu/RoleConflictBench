The court expected my scheduling order by Friday\u2014clear, detailed, no room for error. My chambers were already behind, and I knew the attorneys would be waiting for my direction. But in the next room, I could hear my partner\u2019s muffled sobs. He\u2019d lost his sister two days ago, and every hour since, he\u2019d needed me\u2014just to sit with him, to listen, to hold his hand. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to be his anchor, to help him through the storm of grief. But as a judge, I was supposed to be impartial, focused, and efficient. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my clerk. I closed my eyes, torn between the duty to my partner and the duty to the court, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, neither one willing to let go."}
