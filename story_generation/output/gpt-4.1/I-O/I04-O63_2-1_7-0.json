I could tell right away from the curt reply that something was off. My last text must have come across wrong\u2014maybe too blunt, maybe too cold. Jamie sounded hurt, and I knew I should call right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: talk things out, fix it before it festers.\n\nBut I was sitting at my desk, headset on, the telemarketing script open in front of me. The phone lines were quiet, but I was on the clock, expected to answer any incoming call within two rings. My supervisor had just reminded us that even a short delay could cost a sale. I was supposed to be ready, focused, and quick with the script, especially since most customers today were easy to handle.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. Jamie needed me to be a good friend, to drop everything and call. My job needed me to be a good employee, to stay glued to the headset and not risk missing a call. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
