I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with anyone I met in the hallway. As luck would have it, Mrs. Kim from next door stepped out just as I was leaving for my housekeeping shift. She smiled warmly, and I offered her a slice, eager to be friendly and polite. She invited me in for tea, and I felt a pang of guilt\u2014I was already running late for my cleaning job in another apartment. My employer expected every room to be spotless, every surface sanitized, and I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to cut corners. But Mrs. Kim\u2019s hopeful eyes made it hard to excuse myself. I stood there, cake in hand, torn between the neighborly warmth I wanted to show and the professional standards I was expected to uphold. My heart raced as I weighed the disappointment I might cause in either role, feeling the pressure of both expectations pressing in on me."}
