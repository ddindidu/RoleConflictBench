My mentee, Sarah, sat beside me, notebook in hand, eager for guidance on the new emergency protocol. She needed me to walk her through every step, to share the hard-earned lessons that could mean the difference between life and death. I could see her anxiety\u2014she wanted to get it right, and I wanted to help her. But as I started explaining, my attention kept flickering to the water. A group of teenagers was drifting toward the deep end, laughing and splashing, not in trouble but edging closer to the line where things could go wrong fast. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: Sarah\u2019s expectant gaze, the swimmers\u2019 unpredictable movements. My mind raced\u2014do I give Sarah the focus she deserves, or do I keep my eyes glued to the pool, ready to act at the first sign of trouble? The demands pulled me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to be both the mentor she needed and the vigilant lifeguard everyone expected."}
