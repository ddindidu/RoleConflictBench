I glanced up and saw Mrs. Kim, my neighbor from across the hall, coming toward me with her usual warm smile. As her neighbor, I knew she expected a friendly greeting, maybe even a quick chat about the weather or her new cat. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was in the middle of counting the bottles of detergent and noting which ones needed restocking. My supervisor had been clear: accuracy and efficiency were crucial, and I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus or make mistakes.\n\nMrs. Kim slowed down, clearly expecting me to pause and exchange pleasantries. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I stopped now, I might lose track of my count and risk being reprimanded later. But if I ignored her or brushed her off, I\u2019d seem rude and unfriendly, possibly straining our neighborly relationship. I stood there, clipboard in hand, caught between the polite smile I owed her and the meticulous attention my job demanded, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
