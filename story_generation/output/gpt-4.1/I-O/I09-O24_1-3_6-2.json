It was my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, asking if I could receive a package for her this afternoon. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these small favors. I glanced at the clock\u2014her package was due any minute. At the same time, my clerk emailed: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. I was expected to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. The weight of my judicial responsibility pressed on me; someone\u2019s safety could depend on my careful, immediate attention. Yet, I also felt the tug of neighborly duty, the unspoken expectation that we look out for each other. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of the law and the simple trust of a neighbor. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
