As a neighbor, I know we\u2019re supposed to be considerate\u2014no overflowing bins, no blocking the sidewalk, and definitely no putting out half-empty bins that waste space for others. But as I stood there, my phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: the lane rope was broken, and swim lessons were starting soon. As the lifeguard, it\u2019s my job to make sure everything is safe and ready, and a broken lane rope could mean chaos in the water. I glanced at the bins, then at my watch. If I left now to fix the rope, I\u2019d miss the trash pickup window, and my neighbors might be annoyed at the wasted space. But if I stayed to wait for the trash truck, the swim lessons could be delayed, and the kids\u2019 safety might be at risk. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing there with my trash bag in one hand and my lifeguard whistle in the other, unsure which role to put first."}
