My mentor had always emphasized the importance of open communication, urging me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. Today, a term in the training manual puzzled me, but it wasn\u2019t stopping my progress. I hesitated, wondering if I should email her now or wait until our next meeting.\n\nJust then, I noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system making an odd, grinding noise. I checked the pressure gauge\u2014well above normal. My heart raced. If the system failed, the water could become unsafe for swimmers within hours. As a lifeguard, I was expected to act immediately, report the issue, and start the repair protocol. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCheck in with mentor about any concerns.\u201d\n\nI felt torn. Should I pause to send my mentor a message about the terminology, fulfilling my role as a diligent mentee? Or should I drop everything and focus on the filtration system, as my lifeguard duties demanded? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, caught between the two roles."}
