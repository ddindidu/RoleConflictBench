The line stretched past the bakery, and every customer seemed to have a question or a story to share. I nodded, laughed, and tried to keep the line moving, but my mind kept drifting back to the article my mentor had suggested I read. It wasn\u2019t due for weeks, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. I could feel the weight of her expectations, even though she\u2019d said it was optional. \n\nA customer asked about a coupon, and I fumbled for a moment, my thoughts tangled between the register and the reading I hadn\u2019t started. I wanted to be present, to give each person my full attention, but the pressure to be a good mentee gnawed at me. I wondered if I should use my break to read, but then I\u2019d have less time to recharge before the next rush. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I felt myself caught between wanting to be the perfect mentee and the friendly, efficient cashier everyone expected."}
