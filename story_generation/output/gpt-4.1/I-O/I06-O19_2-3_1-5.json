My mentor had been clear: \u201cHave this ready before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make her proud, show her I could keep up. But the pharmacy was busy today, and Mrs. Lee, a regular, had just arrived for her medication review. She was on a complicated regimen\u2014anticoagulants, insulin, a new antipsychotic. I knew how critical it was to catch any dangerous interactions, to explain every detail so she\u2019d be safe. My white coat felt heavier than usual as I led her to the consultation room, my mind split between the lines of code I needed to write and the responsibility I owed her as her pharmacist. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectations, my duty to my patient, both demanding my full attention. As Mrs. Lee began describing her symptoms, I tried to focus, but the unfinished assignment nagged at me, guilt and anxiety twisting in my chest. I wondered how I could possibly do justice to both roles when they seemed to be pulling me in opposite directions."}
