She\u2019s had a rough day\u2014her boss criticized her project, and she\u2019s spiraling. I know she needs me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But my laptop screen is filled with red flags from the code review. The new feature I\u2019ve been building for weeks is almost done, but now there are performance warnings I can\u2019t ignore. My team expects me to fix them before tomorrow\u2019s release. My heart aches as I hear her muffled sobs from the next room, but my mind races with possible solutions to optimize the code. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me. If I step away now, I\u2019ll let my team down and risk a buggy release. If I stay glued to my screen, I\u2019ll fail her when she needs me most. My hands hover over the keyboard, my phone buzzes again, and I\u2019m paralyzed\u2014caught between being the boyfriend she deserves and the developer my team relies on."}
