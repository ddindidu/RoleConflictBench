As a cashier, I smiled and greeted the next customer, scanning their groceries with practiced efficiency. The store was quiet, and I tried to keep my tone warm, but my mind kept drifting to the spreadsheet waiting on my laptop in the break room. As a colleague, I was supposed to finish my part of the project by tonight\u2014my task was the linchpin for the client\u2019s delivery, and everyone was counting on me. \n\nBut here I was, stuck behind the register, exchanging pleasantries and making sure every barcode beeped just right. I could feel the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, even as I handed a receipt to a smiling customer. I wanted to be present, to offer the friendly service my manager expected, but the anxiety of letting my colleagues down gnawed at me. My hands trembled slightly as I bagged the next order, torn between the demands of the job in front of me and the urgent responsibility waiting just out of reach."}
