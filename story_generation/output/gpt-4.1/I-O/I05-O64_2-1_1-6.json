But right now, I was behind the register at the grocery store, scanning items for a small line of customers. \u201cHi, how are you today?\u201d I said, forcing a smile as I rang up a woman\u2019s groceries. My mind kept drifting to the project, wondering if my mentee would feel abandoned if I didn\u2019t reply soon. The next customer stepped up, and I greeted him, but my thoughts were split\u2014half on the beeping scanner, half on the draft I hadn\u2019t read. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be present and helpful for my mentee, and the need to be friendly and efficient for each customer. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment, feeling the tension build with every item I scanned."}
