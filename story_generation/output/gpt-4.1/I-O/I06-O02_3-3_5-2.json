As an engineer, I knew everyone was waiting on me\u2014the project couldn\u2019t move forward until I delivered. The pressure was suffocating, but every time I tried to focus, the memory of the heated argument with my teammates replayed in my mind. The conflict had left us barely speaking, and now, collaboration was impossible. As a mentee, I was supposed to reach out to my mentor, to be open about challenges like this. But I hesitated. Would admitting the team was falling apart make me look incompetent? Would my mentor think I couldn\u2019t handle pressure? Yet, if I stayed silent, the project would stall, and I\u2019d let everyone down as an engineer. My inbox pinged with another reminder from the project manager. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between writing code and drafting an honest message to my mentor, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
