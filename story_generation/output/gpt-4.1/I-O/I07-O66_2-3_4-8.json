On one side, my colleague\u2019s message blinked: \u201cCan you send the report by noon? I need it to finish my part.\u201d I knew the whole team was waiting on me, and any delay would throw off the project timeline. On the other side, the taxi app pinged again\u2014my next passenger, already waiting, sent another message: \u201cPlease hurry, I have a flight in an hour.\u201d I could almost feel their impatience through the screen.\n\nMy laptop was open on the passenger seat, the report half-finished. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get it done before my shift, but the morning rush had been relentless. Now, I was parked at the curb, torn. If I took a few more minutes to finish the report, I\u2019d be late picking up the passenger, risking a bad review and maybe even a complaint. But if I left now, the report would be late, letting down my colleague and the team. My hands gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
