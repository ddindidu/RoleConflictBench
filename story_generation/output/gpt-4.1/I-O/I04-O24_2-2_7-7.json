His reply was curt, almost cold\u2014he\u2019d clearly misread the tone of my earlier text. I could picture him, frowning at his screen, probably thinking I was annoyed with him. As his friend, I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, resolve things before they fester.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my clerk knocked, handing me a printout. \u201cCounsel just cited a new appellate decision from last week,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to review it before tomorrow\u2019s session.\u201d As a judge, I\u2019m expected to be thorough, to stay current with every legal shift. The attorneys, the parties\u2014they all rely on me to be prepared, impartial, and up-to-date.\n\nI stared at the printout, then at my phone. My friend needed me now, but so did my courtroom. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my immediate attention, each with consequences if I delayed. My heart pounded as I sat, torn between the call I needed to make and the case I needed to read."}
