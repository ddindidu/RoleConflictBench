My calendar is surprisingly open, and I could pick any evening. But as I close the message, my mind drifts to the lab. The maintenance checklist is due soon. No equipment has failed, but I know how important it is to double-check everything, especially after last year\u2019s near-miss. The team relies on me to keep things running safely, and I pride myself on never letting standards slip.\n\nAlex expects me to be present, to make time for us, and I want that too. But the lab expects vigilance, even when things seem fine. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014if I choose a night with Alex, will I be distracted, worrying about the lab? If I stay late at work, will I let Alex down again? I stare at my calendar, torn between the warmth of a dinner date and the cold, steady hum of the lab, unable to shake the feeling that I can\u2019t give my best to both."}
