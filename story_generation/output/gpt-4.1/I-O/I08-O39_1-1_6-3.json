The guys were clustered around, voices low, talking about Mark from the office\u2014how he\u2019d changed the schedule again, how nobody liked his decisions. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip, to keep things positive, but the group looked at me, waiting for my input. I could feel the pressure to join in, to be part of the team, to say something that would make them laugh or nod in agreement.\n\nBut then I glanced at the clock. My shift was almost over, and I hadn\u2019t swept my section yet. As a construction laborer, I was expected to keep my area spotless\u2014no debris, no hazards left behind. The foreman was strict about it, and I knew I\u2019d hear about it tomorrow if I didn\u2019t finish. My mind raced: if I stayed and joined the conversation, I\u2019d be neglecting my work duties. If I left to clean up, I\u2019d look like I was avoiding the group, maybe even like I was siding with Mark. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the two roles."}
