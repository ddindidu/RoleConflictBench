I\u2019d spent my lunch break preparing slides, determined to give her the best guidance I could. Sharing what I\u2019d learned over the years felt important, almost like a duty. But as I was about to log into our video call, my supervisor\u2019s message pinged: \u201cLight call volume\u2014take your break now if you want.\u201d The telemarketer in me knew this was a rare chance; if I didn\u2019t take my break now, I might not get another window, and missing scheduled breaks could mean a warning. I stared at the screen, torn. Sarah was counting on me to help her succeed, but my job demanded I follow the rules and take breaks when allowed. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of being a mentor against the strict expectations of my telemarketing role, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
