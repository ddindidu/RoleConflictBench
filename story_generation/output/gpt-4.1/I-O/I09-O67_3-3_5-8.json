The HOA inspection was today, and I remembered my neighbor\u2019s stroller still parked in the corridor. We\u2019d been warned: anything blocking the exit would be cited. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, to remind her gently or move it myself, but I barely had time to think before my phone buzzed\u2014an emergency call. I was needed at the hospital, now.\n\nMinutes later, I was behind the wheel of the ambulance, sirens wailing, a critically ill patient in the back. The storm was relentless, water pooling on the roads, visibility near zero. Every instinct screamed at me to slow down, to drive safely for my patient and my partner. But I couldn\u2019t shake the image of the stroller in the corridor, the risk it posed, the trouble it could cause for my neighbor\u2014and for me, as a member of this community.\n\nTorn between my duty to my patient and my responsibility as a neighbor, I gripped the wheel tighter, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
