She\u2019s always been a kind neighbor, sharing vegetables from her garden and chatting about her grandchildren. Later, as I started my shift in the emergency room, I was surprised to see her wheeled in, pale and feverish, her leg swollen and red. The infection was spreading fast\u2014she needed a strong antibiotic, but her chart showed a history of severe allergic reactions to the very medication I\u2019d normally prescribe. As her doctor, I was expected to act quickly and decisively, but as her neighbor, I felt the weight of her trust and the fear in her eyes. She looked at me, searching for reassurance, and I felt torn between the friendly face she knew and the clinical authority she needed. The pressure to make the right call pressed in on me from both sides, and I hesitated, caught between the expectations of neighborly warmth and medical responsibility."}
