She smiled, and I returned the gesture, exchanging a quick hello. She\u2019s always so warm, and I know she expects the same from me\u2014a friendly neighbor, someone she can trust and chat with in the hallway. But as soon as I got to the office, I put on my headset and dialed the first number on my list. The calls started coming in, and with them, the questions\u2014so many technical details about the new service, things my script barely covered. I could hear the frustration in their voices when I couldn\u2019t give them the answers they wanted. I felt the pressure to be patient, resourceful, and persuasive, even as I fumbled for words. My mind kept drifting back to Mrs. Lee, wondering if she\u2019d ever be on the other end of a call like this, expecting clarity and honesty. The demands of being a good neighbor clashed with the pressure to stick to the script and close the sale. I felt torn, caught between the need to be genuine and the need to perform."}
