My mentor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cI want to see your approach to this problem before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I promised myself I\u2019d make a good impression, show I\u2019m reliable. But the radio crackles, and my headset fills with urgent voices\u2014another cell of thunderstorms is rolling in, and the radar is a mess of red and yellow. Flights are stacking up, handoffs are coming faster than I can process, and every decision feels critical. My team depends on me to keep the airspace safe and flowing, to coordinate with the next sector, to not miss a single detail. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectations, my team\u2019s trust, the code I need to write, the planes I need to guide. My hands hover over the keyboard, but my mind is split, pulled in two directions, and I can\u2019t see how to do justice to either."}
