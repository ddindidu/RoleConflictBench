My manager had just reminded me to keep things moving and greet everyone with a smile. I tried to focus on scanning groceries and making small talk, but my mind kept drifting to the team meeting scheduled for 1:00 p.m. in the break room. My colleagues expected me there; the agenda included crucial project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. I could already imagine the disappointed looks if I missed it, the subtle sense of being left out. But right now, I was the only cashier on duty, and the customers were growing impatient. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my team counting on my input, my manager and customers needing my attention here. My heart pounded as I handed a receipt to the next shopper, torn between slipping away to the meeting and staying at my post, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
