The power\u2019s out, so I\u2019m worried about deliveries.\u201d As her neighbor, I\u2019d promised to help, and I knew how much she relied on me, especially with her being away for the week. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was already behind schedule. The cleaning supply closet was nearly empty\u2014no more disinfectant, and only a few trash bags left. My supervisor expected a full inventory report by noon, and I still had two more apartments to clean before then.\n\nI glanced at the hallway, torn. If I left now to check for Mrs. Lee\u2019s package, I\u2019d fall even further behind on my cleaning rounds, risking a reprimand from my boss. But if I ignored her request, I\u2019d be letting down a neighbor who trusted me. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, each role demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
