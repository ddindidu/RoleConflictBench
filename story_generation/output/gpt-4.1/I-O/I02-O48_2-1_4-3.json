Just us.\u201d It was the only evening we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long training, and she\u2019d been looking forward to it for days. I promised her I\u2019d be home early, that I\u2019d leave work on time for once. But as I made my morning rounds at the hospital, my supervisor stopped me. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed. Can you stay late and help with vitals on the new patients?\u201d I looked at the chart in my hand, the list of temperatures, pulses, and blood pressures I still needed to record. My mind raced\u2014my patients needed me, but so did she. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the hospital\u2019s fluorescent lights buzzing above me, my phone heavy in my pocket. I could already picture her disappointment if I was late, but I also knew the guilt I\u2019d feel leaving my team in the lurch.
