I want to say yes to all of them, to make up for the rushed dinners and missed weekends. But as I open my calendar, my architect\u2019s mind kicks in. The contractor just emailed; the steel delivery is delayed, and if I don\u2019t coordinate a workaround tonight, the whole project could slip. My team expects me to be on top of every detail, to keep things moving no matter what.
