As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to communicate even the smallest concerns, and I did have a minor question about a term I\u2019d come across in my notes. But right now, I was sitting beside Mrs. Lee, a patient who\u2019d been especially quiet today. She looked at me with hopeful eyes, clearly wanting someone to talk to. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer her my full attention and emotional support, especially during these routine check-ins. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014should I quickly message my mentor and risk seeming distracted, or focus entirely on Mrs. Lee and delay my question? I could feel the pressure building inside me, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something different in this moment."}
