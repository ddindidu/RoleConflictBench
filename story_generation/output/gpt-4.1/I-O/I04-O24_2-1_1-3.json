It was Jamie, my closest friend, her voice trembling as she asked if I had a moment. She\u2019d just had a fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. As her friend, I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to help her sort through the mess of her feelings. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety twisted in my stomach. The scheduling order for the new case was due by the end of the week, and I hadn\u2019t even started. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough, precise, and timely. The court, the attorneys, and the parties involved were all counting on me. I wanted to be there for Jamie, to give her my full attention, but the weight of my judicial responsibilities pressed down on me. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed me now and the duty that couldn\u2019t wait."}
