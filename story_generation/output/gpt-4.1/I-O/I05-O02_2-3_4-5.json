As a mentor, I\u2019d spent days preparing a session for my team, eager to share the skills they\u2019d need to succeed. They were counting on me to guide them, and I could see their anticipation as they gathered in the meeting room, notebooks open, ready to learn.\n\nBut just as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed. An external inspector had flagged a critical safety issue on the production floor. As the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to address it immediately\u2014if I didn\u2019t, operations could be shut down, jeopardizing the entire project.\n\nI felt torn. My team needed my guidance now more than ever, but the safety concern demanded my undivided attention. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I stood at the crossroads, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
