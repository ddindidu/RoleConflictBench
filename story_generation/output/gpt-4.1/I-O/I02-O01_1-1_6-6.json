She\u2019s upset because I forgot to confirm our weekend plans, and now she thinks I don\u2019t care. My chest tightens\u2014I want to call her, to explain, to smooth things over like a good boyfriend should. But my laptop screen is filled with project timelines, and my team is waiting for my feedback. As an architect, I\u2019m supposed to keep everything moving, make sure no detail slips through the cracks. I can\u2019t afford to let the project drift, not with deadlines looming. Yet, if I ignore Mia, the misunderstanding could grow, and I hate the thought of her feeling neglected. My mind races, torn between the urge to pick up the phone and the responsibility to my team. Both roles demand my attention right now, and I can feel the stress building as I sit, paralyzed, caught between the expectations of being a reliable boyfriend and a diligent architect."}
