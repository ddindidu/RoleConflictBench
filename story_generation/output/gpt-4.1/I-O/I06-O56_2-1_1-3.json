I could do it\u2014if I had the time. But right now, scissors in hand, I was a hairdresser, not a mentee. My regular, Mrs. Lee, smiled at me in the mirror. \u201cCould you just trim a little more off the fringe? It\u2019s almost perfect.\u201d Her tone was gentle, but I knew how much she cared about her hair. I nodded, but my mind was racing. If I spent extra time making sure Mrs. Lee was happy, I\u2019d get home late, and that code sample would have to wait. But if I rushed, she might leave dissatisfied, and I\u2019d be letting her down. My mentor expected me to be diligent and prepared, but my client expected care and attention. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between wanting to impress my mentor and not wanting to disappoint someone who trusted me with her appearance. My hands hovered, unsure, as I tried to decide which expectation I should meet first."}
