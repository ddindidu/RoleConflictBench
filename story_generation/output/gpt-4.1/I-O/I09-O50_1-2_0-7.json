He\u2019s my neighbor, always quick with a smile and a wave, and I try to match his friendliness. We exchanged a cheerful hello, and I felt that familiar warmth of neighborly connection. But as I walked into the factory, my mood shifted. Mr. Lee is also the operator on the new press machine, and lately, he\u2019s been adjusting the settings without following the guidelines I gave. Each time, it leads to wasted material and frustrated glances from the supervisor. As the machine repairer, I\u2019m expected to step in, correct him, and make sure he understands the proper procedure. But I can\u2019t shake the discomfort\u2014if I confront him too directly, will it sour our easy neighborly rapport? I feel the pressure from both sides: the need to be a supportive, friendly neighbor, and the responsibility to be a firm, knowledgeable technician. My mind races as I approach his workstation, torn between keeping the peace in the corridor and doing my job on the factory floor."}
