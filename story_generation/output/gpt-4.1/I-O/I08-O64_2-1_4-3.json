After a quick hello, he leaned in and quietly asked if I could help him move some boxes to his new apartment after work. He looked tired, and I could tell he really needed the help. As I rang up his groceries, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing major, but store policy was clear: every discrepancy had to be reported and investigated, no matter how minor. If I reported it, I\u2019d have to stay late to fill out paperwork and talk to my manager, which meant I\u2019d have to let Mark down. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be breaking the rules and risking my job. I could feel the pressure building inside me\u2014on one hand, the expectation to be a supportive friend, and on the other, the responsibility to do my job by the book. My mind raced as I tried to figure out what to do, torn between helping someone who needed me and following the rules I was supposed to uphold."}
