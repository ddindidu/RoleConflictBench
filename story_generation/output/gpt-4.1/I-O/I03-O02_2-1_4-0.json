My boyfriend sits across from me, his eyes hopeful as he suggests we finally have a quiet evening together\u2014just us, no distractions. It\u2019s the only night we have before I leave for a week-long business trip, and I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to it. But my mind keeps drifting to the project at work. We\u2019re still in the early stages, brainstorming solutions, and I keep thinking of new ideas I want to sketch out before I forget them. My team expects me to be proactive, to come up with innovative approaches, and I don\u2019t want to let them down. Yet, I see the anticipation in my boyfriend\u2019s face, the silent plea for my attention. I feel torn, pulled between the comfort of his company and the thrill of solving a technical puzzle. My heart aches with the pressure of choosing, knowing that whatever I decide, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014maybe even myself."}
