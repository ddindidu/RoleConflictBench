My mentor had been clear: \u201cI want to see your approach to this problem before our next meeting.\u201d That meeting was in three days, and I knew she expected not just a solution, but a thoughtful one. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the thick stack of case files on my desk. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, every argument, before the civil trial started tomorrow. The final briefs had just come in, and both parties were counting on me to be fair and thorough. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, the responsibility to my mentor clashing with my duty to the court. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between writing code and annotating legal arguments. The hours slipped by, and I could feel the anxiety building, knowing I couldn\u2019t give less than my best to either role."}
