My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cI need your report on my desk before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d The assignment sat unfinished in my bag, every minute ticking by a reminder of my promise. But right now, I was a taxi driver, and the city demanded my full attention. \n\nAs I turned the corner, orange cones forced me into a single lane. Up ahead, a cluster of children giggled near the curb, backpacks swinging. The school zone sign flashed, urging me to slow down. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the report, and my heart pounded. If I missed this window, I\u2019d disappoint my mentor and risk my future. But if I rushed, I\u2019d endanger the kids and break the law. \n\nCaught between the pressure to prove myself as a dedicated mentee and my duty to drive safely, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My foot hovered over the brake, my mind torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both demands at once."}
