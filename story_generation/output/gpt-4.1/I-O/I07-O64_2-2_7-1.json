The line stretches past the magazine rack, and I can feel the impatience radiating from the customers. My manager expects me to keep things moving, double-check every price, and never let my attention slip. But my phone, tucked in my apron pocket, vibrates again. I know it\u2019s my team from my other job, waiting for my response to a question that\u2019s holding up our project. They expect me to be reachable, to answer quickly so the work doesn\u2019t stall. I glance at the clock\u2014every minute I delay, the team\u2019s frustration grows. But if I pause now, even for a moment, the line will only get longer, and mistakes could happen. My mind races, torn between the urgent needs of the people in front of me and the silent pressure from my colleagues online. I grip the scanner tighter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
