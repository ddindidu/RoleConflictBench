As a judge, I knew I needed to stay current, to absorb every nuance of new legal theories\u2014my rulings depended on it. But my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She was on the verge of presenting her findings for a high-stakes project, one that could launch her career. She needed guidance, reassurance, and the kind of honest feedback only a mentor could give. I could hear the anxiety in her voice from our last conversation, and I remembered my promise to help her grow, to be present for her. Yet, the journal\u2019s articles beckoned, reminding me of my duty to the law and the people who relied on my judgments. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of someone I was guiding and the broader responsibility to my profession. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect."}
