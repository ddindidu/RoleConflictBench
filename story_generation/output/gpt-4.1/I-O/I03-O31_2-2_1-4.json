It was Alex\u2014his message was short, but I could feel the weight behind it: \u201cBad day. Need you.\u201d He\u2019d just gotten some tough feedback at work, and I knew he\u2019d be waiting for me to come home, to listen, to reassure him that he was more than his job. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold him and let him vent.\n\nBut as I stepped outside, my radio crackled. There\u2019d been a traffic accident a few blocks away\u2014multiple vehicles, possible injuries, traffic snarled. Dispatch needed all available officers. My training kicked in; I grabbed my gear and ran to my cruiser. The city needed me to keep people safe, to direct traffic, to help the injured. But my heart was torn, knowing Alex was sitting alone, needing me just as much.\n\nAs I sped toward the accident, my mind raced. I could hear Alex\u2019s voice in my head, asking for comfort, while the sirens blared, demanding my focus. I gripped the wheel, feeling the pull of both worlds, not sure which one I\u2019d have to let down tonight."}
