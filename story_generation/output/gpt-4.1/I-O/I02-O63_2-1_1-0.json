My phone buzzed\u2014my girlfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I glanced over; she was curled up on the couch, eyes red, clutching her phone. She\u2019d just gotten that email from her boss, the one she\u2019d been dreading. I knew she needed me, needed comfort, someone to listen and tell her it would be okay. But my shift had just started, and the calls were coming in steady. \n\nA customer\u2019s voice crackled through my headset, asking about our latest offer. I recited the script, but my mind was with her, picturing her wiping away tears. I wanted to drop everything, wrap her in my arms, and let her vent. But I also knew my supervisor expected me to stay focused, handle objections, and keep my numbers up. I felt torn, my heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the person I loved and the job that paid our bills. The next call beeped in, and I stared at the blinking light, caught between duty and devotion, not sure which role to answer first."}
