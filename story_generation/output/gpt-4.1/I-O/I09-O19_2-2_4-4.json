Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a weary look as she passed, her arms full of groceries. I knew she expected me to keep Max quiet, especially since she worked night shifts and needed her rest during the day. I apologized, promising to keep him calm, but guilt gnawed at me as I hurried out.\n\nAt the pharmacy, I was barely settled behind the counter when Mr. Patel arrived with a new prescription. He looked anxious, clutching the bag tightly. As a pharmacist, I knew he expected me to explain the medication thoroughly, answer his questions, and reassure him about possible side effects. But my mind kept drifting back to Max and Mrs. Lee\u2014was he barking again? Was I being a bad neighbor by not being there to manage him?\n\nStanding there, I felt torn. My responsibility to my neighbor clashed with my duty to my patient. Both needed my attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed on me as I tried to focus on Mr. Patel\u2019s questions, my heart pounding with indecision."}
