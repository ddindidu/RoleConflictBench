The team meeting was in ten minutes, and I knew I was expected to be there\u2014my input on the project was crucial, and the updates wouldn\u2019t be shared anywhere else. As a colleague, I didn\u2019t want to let the team down or seem disengaged. But as a scientist, I couldn\u2019t ignore the nagging worry about the lab. The safety audit was looming, and I\u2019d already been warned about a few minor equipment issues. If I didn\u2019t fix them now, we could fail the audit, putting our research on hold and risking everyone\u2019s safety. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, just as I glanced at the checklist of lab repairs. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and whichever role I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
