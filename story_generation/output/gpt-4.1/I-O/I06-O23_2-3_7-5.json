My mentor, who had been nearly impossible to pin down for weeks, finally offered me a thirty-minute window\u2014today, right before my trial. I knew how much this meeting meant; she\u2019d rearranged her own packed schedule, and I was desperate for her guidance. But as I glanced at the clock, my mind raced back to the courthouse, where my client\u2019s future hung in the balance. The jury trial was about to begin, and there was no room for delay. I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would be there, fully prepared, ready to fight for them. Yet, I also felt the pull of my mentor\u2019s investment in me, the rare chance to learn from her. My stomach twisted as I tried to reconcile the impossible: to be the diligent mentee who respects her mentor\u2019s time, and the committed lawyer who never lets a client down. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me, knowing I could not give both what they deserved."}
