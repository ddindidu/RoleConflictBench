I\u2019m losing my mind with these IKEA instructions.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift as a telemarketer had just started, and I was already on a call with Mrs. Jenkins, who was grilling me about the fine print of our latest offer. Her voice was sharp, \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t a scam? I want every detail, now.\u201d I could hear the frustration in her tone, and I knew my supervisor expected me to handle objections like a pro, never letting a customer feel ignored.\n\nBut Sam\u2019s message tugged at me. He\u2019d just moved out on his own, and I promised I\u2019d be there if he needed help. I imagined him surrounded by wooden planks and screws, feeling helpless. My headset felt heavier as Mrs. Jenkins pressed for answers, but my phone kept lighting up with Sam\u2019s desperate texts. I felt torn, my loyalty to a friend clashing with my responsibility to my job, both demanding my full attention at the exact same moment. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
