I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I ran into anyone. As I walked through the courtyard, cake in hand, I spotted Mrs. Lee from next door. She smiled and waved, and I felt a surge of nervous excitement\u2014this was my chance to be friendly and polite, just as a good neighbor should.\n\nBut then, as I passed the pool, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. I noticed a few pool chairs were out of place, not dangerously so, but not aligned as they should be. Part of my job as a lifeguard is to keep the facilities tidy and safe, and I knew the supervisor would expect me to fix it immediately. Yet, if I stopped to rearrange the chairs, I\u2019d miss my window to greet Mrs. Lee and offer her the cake. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between the urge to fulfill my neighborly duty and the responsibility to maintain the pool area. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between two sets of expectations, unsure which role to honor first."}
