My mentor had managed to squeeze in a session with me just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious this hour was. I wanted to show respect for her time, to be fully present and prepared, to make the most of her rare availability. But as I sat down in the conference room, my phone buzzed with a message from the lab manager: \u201cAudit in 30 minutes. Equipment issues still unresolved. Need you here ASAP.\u201d I felt a wave of anxiety. As a scientist, I was responsible for the lab\u2019s safety, and the upcoming audit could have serious consequences if the flagged issues weren\u2019t addressed. I tried to focus on my mentor\u2019s advice, but my mind kept drifting to the lab, picturing the faulty centrifuge and the checklist I hadn\u2019t finished. Torn between my duty to my mentor and my responsibility as a scientist, I felt the pressure mounting, each minute ticking by with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
