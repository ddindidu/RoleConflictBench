Users are getting confused.\u201d I glanced at the bug report. It was minor, and there was a simple workaround, but I knew from experience that these little things could snowball if left unchecked. As a colleague, I wanted to respect the team\u2019s plan and not disrupt the flow\u2014my task wasn\u2019t blocking anyone, and I had time. But as a software developer, I felt the pull to jump on the bug, to keep the product polished and users happy. My mind raced: Should I pause my current work and fix the glitch, or stick to the schedule and trust the workaround for now? I could feel the tension building, the weight of both expectations pressing in, and I sat there, torn, unable to decide which role to honor first."}
