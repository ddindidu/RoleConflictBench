He thought I\u2019d forgotten our weekend plans, and his words were clipped, tinged with disappointment. I knew I should call him, smooth things over before the misunderstanding grew into something bigger. But just as I reached for my phone, the lab\u2019s alarm blared, and red lights flashed above the fume hood. The gas chromatograph was issuing warning alerts\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, there could be a hazardous leak. My heart pounded as I glanced between my phone and the equipment. Alex expected me to be present, to resolve things before resentment set in. But the lab demanded my immediate attention; safety protocols couldn\u2019t wait. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mind racing with the fear of letting someone down, whether it was the person I loved or the responsibility I owed to my work and colleagues."}
