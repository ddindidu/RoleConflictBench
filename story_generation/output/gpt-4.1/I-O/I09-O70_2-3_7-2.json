The storm advisory flashed on my phone, warning of road closures and delays. My next delivery was urgent\u2014medical supplies for the hospital, marked \u201ctime-sensitive.\u201d I knew every minute counted for the patients waiting on the other end. But as I grabbed my jacket, I glanced at Mrs. Kim\u2019s door across the hall. She lived alone, and her daughter had called me last week, asking if I could check in on her during emergencies. I could already imagine her sitting by the window, worried about the storm, maybe needing help with her flashlight or just some reassurance. My job demanded I get those supplies to the hospital, no excuses. But as a neighbor, I felt responsible for Mrs. Kim\u2019s safety, especially tonight. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent call of my profession and the quiet expectation of neighborly care."}
