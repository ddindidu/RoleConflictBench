It\u2019s Saturday afternoon, and the sun is streaming through the window where my girlfriend sits, her suitcase half-packed on the bed. She\u2019s leaving for London tomorrow, gone for months, and we promised to make this weekend ours\u2014no distractions, just us. She smiles at me, hopeful, and I feel the weight of her expectation: to be present, to make every moment count.\n\nMy phone buzzes on the table. It\u2019s an email from a vendor\u2014just a standard payment confirmation, but protocol says I need to reply formally, acknowledge receipt, and update the records. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cPrompt communication is key, even on weekends.\u201d I know if I ignore it, it\u2019ll nag at me, and if I answer, I\u2019ll break the spell of this precious time.\n\nI sit there, torn, my laptop within reach and my girlfriend\u2019s hand reaching for mine. The pressure builds inside me, the demands of my job and my relationship pulling me in opposite directions. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
