My heart sank. We\u2019d talked about this weekend for days, and now a simple mix-up threatened to spiral. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before resentment built. That\u2019s what he expected\u2014quick resolution, reassurance that we were okay.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, my break was strictly timed. Management had sent out another warning this morning: \u201cNo extra minutes, no exceptions. The queue is full.\u201d If I took even a few extra minutes to call Alex, it would show up in the logs. I could get written up, maybe even lose my job if it happened again. My headset pressed against my ear, the blinking light signaling another call waiting. I stared at my phone, torn between the need to fix things with Alex and the fear of risking my job. My thumb hovered over the call button, my chest tight with indecision."}
