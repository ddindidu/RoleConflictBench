My team at work was counting on me to finish the project report by noon\u2014if I missed the deadline, the next person\u2019s work would stall, and the whole schedule would unravel. But the beach was packed, high tide rolling in, and every whistle-blast or shout made my heart leap. I was supposed to watch the water without pause; one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger. My phone buzzed with Slack messages: \u201cAre you almost done?\u201d \u201cWe need your section!\u201d I tried to type, but every time a swimmer drifted too far or a child squealed, my attention snapped back to the waves. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt gnawing at me\u2014if I focused on work, I risked missing something in the water; if I watched the swimmers, I\u2019d let my colleagues down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn, as the minutes ticked by and the demands of both worlds pressed in."}
