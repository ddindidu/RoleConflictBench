My boyfriend and I barely had time together lately, and this was our only free evening before I\u2019d be away for work. I promised him we\u2019d have dinner, just us, no distractions. But as I was finishing up my shift at the construction site, the evacuation alarm blared through the air. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed: \u201cEveryone to the muster point, now!\u201d I knew the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays. Safety protocols were strict, and the team counted on everyone to follow them. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: \u201cAre you on your way?\u201d he texted. I could picture him waiting, expecting me to keep my promise. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between running to the muster point with my crew and slipping away to make it to dinner on time. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both."}
