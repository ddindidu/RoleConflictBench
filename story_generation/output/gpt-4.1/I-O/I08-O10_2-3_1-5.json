Across from me, Sarah, a friend of a friend, hovered near the snack table, her eyes darting nervously. I could tell she felt out of place, and I remembered how it felt to be the newcomer. As an acquaintance, I knew I should walk over, smile, and help her feel welcome. That\u2019s what a good person does\u2014friendly, open, making sure no one feels left out.\n\nBut just as I took a step forward, my phone buzzed with a notification. It was an urgent email from the tax authority: a discrepancy in a client\u2019s file, requiring immediate clarification. As an accountant, I couldn\u2019t ignore it\u2014compliance is everything, and a delayed response could mean penalties for my client and trouble for me. My mind raced, torn between the warmth I wanted to offer Sarah and the professional duty demanding my attention. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart caught between two worlds, each expecting something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
