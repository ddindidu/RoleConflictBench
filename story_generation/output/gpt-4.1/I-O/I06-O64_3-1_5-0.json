As a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to keep my mentor updated about any issues, and right now, a heated argument with my project teammates is threatening our deadline. My mentor expects honesty and quick communication, but I\u2019m stuck here, hands busy with barcodes and receipts. The store is quiet, just a few people in line, but each beep of the scanner feels like a countdown. I know I should text or call my mentor, but as a cashier, I\u2019m expected to focus\u2014no distractions, no mistakes. My manager trusts me to handle money and customers with care. I feel the pressure building, torn between my responsibility to my mentor and my duty to the customers in front of me. My phone buzzes in my pocket, probably another message from my team. I glance at the growing line, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
