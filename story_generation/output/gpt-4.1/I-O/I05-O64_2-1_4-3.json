My notes were ready, slides organized, and I was determined to guide my mentees through the skills they\u2019d need for the big project. Sharing what I\u2019d learned was important to me\u2014I wanted them to succeed, to avoid the mistakes I\u2019d made. But as I closed my notebook, the register beeped. I noticed a small discrepancy, just a few cents off, nothing that would change the day\u2019s totals. Still, as a cashier, I was expected to follow every policy, report every irregularity, no matter how minor. My manager always said, \u201cAccuracy is everything.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. If I stopped to report this now, I\u2019d be late for the session, letting down the people counting on my guidance. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be breaking the trust placed in me as a cashier. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood frozen, torn between the urge to teach and the duty to report, my heart pounding as I weighed which responsibility mattered more in this moment."}
