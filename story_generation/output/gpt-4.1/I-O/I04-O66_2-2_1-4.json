It was Sam, my closest friend, and I could hear the strain in his voice before he even finished saying hello. \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Jamie. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to be present. But as I cradled the phone between my shoulder and ear, my eyes darted to the slick road ahead. Cars weaved unpredictably, brake lights flaring in the gray. As a taxi driver, I was supposed to keep both hands on the wheel, stay alert, and protect my passengers. But as a friend, I wanted to give Sam my full attention, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. My heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two, torn between the urge to comfort him and the responsibility to drive safely. The rain hammered harder, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
