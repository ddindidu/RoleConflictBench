As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, it was just a question about some terminology in the project brief\u2014nothing urgent, but the expectation was clear: communicate promptly. \n\nBut right now, I was also a taxi driver, and the city had thrown me a curveball. The construction detour squeezed the lanes just as I entered a school zone. Kids clustered near the curb, their laughter and sudden movements making me tense. I needed to slow down, watch every mirror, every blind spot. The rules here were strict, and for good reason. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder to send the email. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my mentor expecting initiative, the road demanding my full attention. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to pull over and type a quick message, even as the line of cars behind me grew impatient."}
