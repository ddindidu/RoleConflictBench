She was nervous, her hands trembling as she counted the bills, and I knew how important it was to walk her through every step\u2014one mistake could throw off the entire day\u2019s balance. At the same time, the line of customers stretched past the bakery display, their faces growing impatient. I caught the eye of a regular, Mrs. Patel, who smiled expectantly, waiting for the usual friendly banter. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the line moving, and always greet with a smile.\u201d But Emily\u2019s anxious glance tugged at me, reminding me of my responsibility to mentor her, to make sure she learned this right. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I slow down and guide Emily carefully, risking the customers\u2019 frustration, or rush through the lesson to keep the line moving, leaving her to flounder? The competing demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of the trainee and the expectations of the customers."}
