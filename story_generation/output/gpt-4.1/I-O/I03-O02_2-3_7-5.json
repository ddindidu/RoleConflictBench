This can\u2019t keep happening.\u201d My chest tightened. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014how we spend it, how we save it, how we never seem to agree. I knew he expected me to help resolve things, to listen and find a way forward together. But as I glanced at the stack of reports on my desk, my mind spun with a different urgency. The inspector\u2019s visit this afternoon had uncovered a compliance issue\u2014one that could shut down our entire operation if I didn\u2019t act fast. My team was waiting for my direction, and the company was counting on me to ensure everything met the strictest safety standards. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of Alex\u2019s disappointment pressing against the professional responsibility that demanded my immediate attention. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the partner Alex needed and the engineer my team depended on, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my all to both at the same time."}
