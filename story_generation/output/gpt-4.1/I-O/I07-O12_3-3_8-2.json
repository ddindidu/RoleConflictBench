I know they expect a prompt reply\u2014anything less could hold up the project and reflect poorly on our team. At the same time, my IDE is open, and I\u2019m staring at a block of code I wrote last week. The service is buckling under load, and the traces point directly to my recent changes. I can already hear the frustration in the ops channel. I know I need to focus, to dig in and refactor, to make the code clean and efficient before things get worse. But the unread messages keep piling up, and I can almost feel my colleagues\u2019 impatience through the screen. My mind races, torn between the expectation to be a responsive teammate and the responsibility to fix my code. My hands hover over the keyboard, caught between drafting a quick reply and diving into the code, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
