As a mentee, I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and respect for her time. She had generously set aside open office hours this week, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss the chance to ask her about my career path. But just as I was about to leave, an email from the court clerk popped up: an attorney in a case I was presiding over had cited a brand-new appellate decision. As a judge, I was expected to be thoroughly prepared, especially when new legal precedents could sway the outcome. The next session was tomorrow morning. My mind raced\u2014should I keep my commitment to my mentor, or stay and review the new case law? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I stared at my calendar, torn, feeling the tension coil in my chest as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
