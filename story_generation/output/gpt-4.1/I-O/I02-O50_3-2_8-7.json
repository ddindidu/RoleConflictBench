Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even be together. I knew I needed to call her, to try and resolve things, to show her I cared enough to fight for us. But inside, I was already late for my next appointment. The operator at the plant kept ignoring my instructions, fiddling with the machine settings and wasting expensive material. My supervisor expected me to guide the client, to be patient and professional, but my mind was tangled in the words she\u2019d thrown at me\u2014words that hurt more than I wanted to admit. I could feel the pressure building, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. If I called her now, I\u2019d be letting my client down. If I walked in and focused on the machine, I\u2019d be letting her down. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, caught between the demands of the man I was supposed to be and the job I was supposed to do."}
