It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s here?\u201d My heart thudded. Jamie had always been there for me, and I knew how much this trip meant to her. But I glanced around the apartment\u2014the living room still cluttered, dust bunnies lurking under the couch. My supervisor had been clear: today\u2019s inspection was important, and I couldn\u2019t afford another warning. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Jamie needed me, but so did my job. My hands trembled as I stared at the half-cleaned counter, torn between the loyalty of friendship and the responsibility of work, knowing that whatever I chose, something would be left undone."}
