My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another passenger, impatient, sending message after message: \u201cWhere are you? Please hurry!\u201d As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be prompt and professional, never keep a customer waiting. But just as I rounded the corner, I spotted Sam, an old acquaintance from college, walking toward me. We hadn\u2019t seen each other in years. I could see the recognition in his eyes, the expectation of a friendly hello, maybe even a quick chat. As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be warm, approachable, not just rush past. But the pressure from my waiting passenger weighed on me. My heart pounded as I slowed, torn between stopping to greet Sam and dashing past to get to my car. I could feel both roles pulling at me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
