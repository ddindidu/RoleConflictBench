The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate\u2014she\u2019s elderly, and her plants are her pride. But as I\u2019m about to knock on her door, my phone buzzes: the atmospheric sensors at the lab are reading perfect conditions. This is the rare window I\u2019ve been waiting for, maybe the only chance before the funding review. My team is counting on me to run the experiment, gather the data, and prove our hypothesis. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to the community, and my duty to science. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demand my immediate attention. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between knocking on Mrs. Patel\u2019s door and racing to the lab, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
