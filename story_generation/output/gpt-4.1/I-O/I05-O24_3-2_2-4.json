As a mentor, my mentee had just come to me, anxious and hopeful, seeking guidance on a career move that could define their future. They needed my full attention, a careful roadmap, and honest advice\u2014something I prided myself on providing. Yet, as a judge, the clock was ticking. The bench trial I\u2019d just concluded was complex, and the parties were waiting for my written judgment. The law demanded clarity, precision, and timeliness; the court expected my findings within thirty days. I could feel the expectations from both sides: my mentee\u2019s trust in my wisdom, the legal community\u2019s reliance on my impartiality and diligence. My mind raced, torn between the urge to pour over my mentee\u2019s options and the obligation to craft a thorough, just opinion. Each role called for my undivided focus, but I had only one self to give. The conflict gnawed at me, and I stared at the blank page, paralyzed by the impossibility of meeting both demands at once."}
