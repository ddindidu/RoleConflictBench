As a colleague, I knew everyone expected me to complete my part by the end of the week, but honestly, there was plenty of buffer time. No one was waiting on me right now, and the project could move forward without my immediate input. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let the team down or seem like I was slacking.\n\nJust as I was about to dive in, an email notification popped up. It was from a vendor\u2014a standard automated confirmation of a recent payment. As the accountant, I was expected to reply formally, acknowledging receipt and maintaining our professional relationship. I knew these replies were important for our records and reputation, and the finance manager had reminded us to respond promptly.\n\nI stared at both tasks, feeling the pressure build. Should I focus on the team\u2019s spreadsheet, keeping my promise as a reliable colleague, or switch gears and handle the vendor\u2019s email, upholding my responsibilities as an accountant? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the two roles."}
