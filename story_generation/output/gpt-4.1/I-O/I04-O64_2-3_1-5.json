I was counting the cash for the end-of-day deposit, double-checking every bill and coin, when my phone buzzed. It was my friend, Sam. I hesitated, but answered. Sam\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Jamie. I really need you right now.\u201d My heart twisted\u2014I could hear how much Sam needed me to listen, to be there, to offer comfort. But the register drawer was open, and the deposit log was only half-filled. I knew the rules: no distractions, no mistakes, or I could get written up, maybe even lose my job. My manager had drilled it into us\u2014follow every step, no exceptions. I looked at the clock, feeling the pressure of the store\u2019s closing routine and Sam\u2019s pain on the other end of the line. My hands shook as I held the phone, torn between being the friend Sam needed and the responsible cashier my job demanded."}
