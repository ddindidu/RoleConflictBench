I glance at Mrs. Kim\u2019s door across the hall\u2014she\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I know she gets anxious during bad weather. As her neighbor, I feel I should check in, maybe offer to bring her some tea or just sit with her until the worst passes. But as I turn to leave, my eyes catch the dust gathering along the baseboards and the crumbs scattered on the kitchen floor. My other role, the housekeeping cleaner, nags at me. The apartment is overdue for a deep clean, and I promised myself I\u2019d tackle it tonight. The expectation is clear: keep the place spotless, no excuses. Yet, the thought of Mrs. Kim alone tugs at me, while the mess in my own home feels like a silent accusation. I stand in the hallway, torn between the urge to knock on her door and the guilt of neglecting my own responsibilities, the storm outside echoing the turmoil inside me."}
