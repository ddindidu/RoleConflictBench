My boyfriend sits beside me, his hand resting on mine, his eyes searching my face for reassurance. It\u2019s our last weekend together before he leaves for months, and I promised him we\u2019d spend every moment making memories. But my phone buzzes again\u2014a passenger, booked through the app, is waiting across town, sending urgent messages about catching a flight. I feel the weight of my uniform, the responsibility to be reliable, professional, to not let someone down who\u2019s counting on me. My boyfriend squeezes my hand, his voice soft, \u201cLet\u2019s just stay a little longer, please?\u201d But the app flashes red, the passenger\u2019s impatience growing. I can almost hear my boss\u2019s voice reminding me about ratings and reliability. My chest tightens as I look between the man I love and the phone demanding my attention, torn between being the girlfriend he needs and the driver I\u2019m expected to be."}
