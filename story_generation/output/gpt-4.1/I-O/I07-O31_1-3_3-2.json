The deadline wasn\u2019t tight\u2014there was plenty of buffer, and my colleagues could keep moving without my part for a bit. Still, I knew they expected me to pull my weight, to be reliable and not let things pile up. Just as I was about to dive in, my police radio crackled to life. An armed robbery, just blocks away. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent\u2014shots fired, people in danger. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was sworn to protect, to respond without hesitation when lives were at stake. But as a colleague, I was supposed to be present, dependable, not the one always running out and leaving others to pick up the slack. I stared at my half-finished report, then at my badge. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different, each impossible to ignore."}
