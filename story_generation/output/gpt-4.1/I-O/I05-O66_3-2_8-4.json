My mentee, Sarah, sat in the back seat, her laptop open, voice trembling as she rehearsed her pitch for the biggest project of her young career. She needed reassurance, a final pep talk before we reached her office. As her mentor, I wanted to give her every ounce of encouragement, to help her believe she could do this. But as a taxi driver, the slick roads and erratic drivers demanded my full attention. The wipers struggled to keep up, and every car that swerved into my lane sent a jolt of anxiety through me. Sarah\u2019s eyes met mine in the mirror, silently pleading for guidance. I felt torn\u2014should I risk a quick, heartfelt word to boost her confidence, or keep my focus locked on the treacherous road, knowing that even a moment\u2019s distraction could put us both in danger? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction as we sped toward the intersection."}
