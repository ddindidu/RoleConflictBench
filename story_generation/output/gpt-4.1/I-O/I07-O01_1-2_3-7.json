As a colleague, I knew the task wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014there was plenty of buffer time, and the rest of the team could move forward without my input for now. But as the architect, I was also juggling calls from the contractor, who needed my immediate feedback on a structural detail to avoid holding up the construction crew. The pressure to keep the project moving was intense; any delay on my part could throw off the entire schedule. I felt torn\u2014if I focused on the contractor, I\u2019d be letting my team down by not meeting the internal deadline. But if I prioritized the team\u2019s task, I risked stalling the build and damaging my reputation for efficiency. My mind raced, weighing the expectations from both sides, feeling the tension tighten in my chest as I tried to decide which role to serve first."}
