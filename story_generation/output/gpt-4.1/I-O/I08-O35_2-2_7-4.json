She almost delayed the whole line. Management\u2019s not happy.\u201d I felt a twinge of discomfort. I\u2019ve always believed in not speaking ill of others, especially when they\u2019re not around to defend themselves. But Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting me to join in or at least nod in agreement.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled to life. \u201cAttention, all operators: there\u2019s a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please respond immediately.\u201d My heart skipped. As a subway operator, my priority is always passenger safety. I\u2019m expected to act quickly, reassure everyone, and follow protocol. But Mark was still watching me, waiting for my response about Lisa. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014one demanding my loyalty to a colleague\u2019s reputation, the other demanding my immediate attention to a potential safety threat. My mind raced, torn between the urge to uphold my values as an acquaintance and my duty as a subway operator."}
