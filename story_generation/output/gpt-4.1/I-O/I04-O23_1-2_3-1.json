I\u2019m lost with these furniture instructions.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in his voice. Sam had always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me to help him out, especially since he\u2019d just moved in and was trying to make the place feel like home. But as I glanced at the stack of legal documents on my desk, my heart sank. The purchase agreement deadline was looming, and my client was relying on my expertise to catch any issues before filing. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my friend needing a lifeline, my client needing my focus. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I felt toward Sam and the professional responsibility that demanded my undivided attention. I could feel the tension building in my chest, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
