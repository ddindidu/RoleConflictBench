My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had messaged again, reminding me about her package deliveries while she was away. She was worried about the planned power interruption in our building, and I\u2019d promised to check in on her apartment. I knew how much she relied on me, especially since she lived alone. But as I stepped into the operator\u2019s cabin, the radio crackled\u2014there was a minor signal delay ahead. I needed to adjust the train\u2019s speed carefully, keeping everything on schedule and ensuring passengers\u2019 safety. My mind raced: if I left the train for even a moment, I\u2019d risk delays and compromise safety, but if I didn\u2019t check on Mrs. Kim\u2019s apartment soon, her deliveries might spoil or get stolen. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible subway operator."}
