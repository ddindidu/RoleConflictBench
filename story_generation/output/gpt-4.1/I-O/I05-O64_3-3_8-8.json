But my mind was with my mentee, who was about to present their first big project\u2014one that could make or break their career. They needed my encouragement, my advice, right now. I could almost hear their nervous voice, see their trembling hands. Yet here I was, expected to be the model of calm, to resolve this customer\u2019s anger with grace. My heart pounded as I juggled the demands: be the steady mentor, be the perfect cashier. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
