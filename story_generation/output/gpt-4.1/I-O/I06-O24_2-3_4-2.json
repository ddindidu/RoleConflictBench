As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor about this technical hurdle\u2014I\u2019d promised to communicate any roadblocks right away. But just as I started drafting the email, my phone buzzed. An emergency motion had landed on my desk. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail of the case file before the hearing, and this one required a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. If I paused to message my mentor, I\u2019d lose precious minutes needed to analyze the motion thoroughly. But if I ignored the technical issue, I\u2019d be failing my mentor\u2019s trust and possibly jeopardizing my project. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, each with consequences for delay. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two urgent responsibilities, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which expectation to meet first."}
