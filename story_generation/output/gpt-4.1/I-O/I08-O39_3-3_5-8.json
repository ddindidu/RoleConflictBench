I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months, was calling. I answered, and his voice was shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on the old Mill Road. Can you come? There\u2019s no one else nearby.\u201d I looked around; my crew was already dropping tools, heading for the muster point as the evacuation protocol demanded. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed, \u201cNo exceptions\u2014everyone out, now!\u201d I felt the weight of my hard hat pressing down, sweat prickling my neck.
