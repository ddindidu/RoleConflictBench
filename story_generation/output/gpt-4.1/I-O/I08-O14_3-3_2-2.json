The weather outside was perfect\u2014clear, stable, exactly the conditions I\u2019d been waiting months for. If I missed this window, my experiment would be delayed for another year, and with the funding review looming, I couldn\u2019t afford that. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Jamie, an old friend from undergrad. She was sitting on a bench, shoulders shaking, tears streaming down her face. Instinctively, I slowed, torn. As an acquaintance, I knew I should stop, offer comfort, listen to whatever had her so upset. She looked up, eyes pleading for connection, and I felt the weight of her expectation: to be present, to care. But the scientist in me screamed that this was my only chance, that my entire project\u2014and maybe my career\u2014depended on getting to the lab right now. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the urge to sit beside her and the pull of the experiment waiting for me, both roles demanding more than I could give at once."}
