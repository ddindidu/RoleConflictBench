My mentor\u2019s office hours had just started, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of them this week. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to show up on time and respect her availability, especially since she\u2019d carved out these hours just for us mentees. I hurriedly packed my notes, ready to head out, when my work phone buzzed. It was a customer, asking about the status of their delivery. I knew the company expected me to respond quickly and professionally\u2014every interaction reflected on our service, and I\u2019d already been reminded to keep customers updated.\n\nI stared at the two screens in my hands, feeling the pressure build. If I ignored the customer, I risked a complaint and possibly a warning from my supervisor. But if I took the time to answer, I\u2019d be late for my mentor, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disrespectful or uncommitted. My mind raced, torn between the need to be a reliable mentee and a responsible delivery person, both roles demanding my immediate attention. I took a shaky breath, caught in the middle, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
