My heart clenched; I knew it was probably another message from my boyfriend. He\u2019d lost his brother just two days ago, and every part of me wanted to be by his side, holding him, listening, just being there. But right now, I was at the salon, and my client\u2014a first-time visitor\u2014was staring at her reflection, her lips pressed tight in disappointment. She hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected.\u201d I could see the hope in her eyes that I\u2019d fix it, that I\u2019d make her feel beautiful. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to my boyfriend, to be the comfort he needed, and the professional responsibility to reassure my client, to address her concerns with patience and care. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, hands trembling, caught between two worlds that needed me in completely different ways."}
