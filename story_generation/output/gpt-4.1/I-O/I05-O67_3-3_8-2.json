She was about to present her findings to the board, a moment that could launch her career. She needed reassurance, a final pep talk, and I knew how much my encouragement meant to her. As her mentor, I\u2019d promised to be there, to help her believe in herself when it mattered most. Just as I started typing a reply, the radio crackled: \u201cAll units, multi-vehicle collision, Highway 17, possible fatalities. Immediate response required.\u201d My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, every second counted. Lives depended on my speed and focus. But Sarah\u2019s trembling words echoed in my mind, her future hanging in the balance. I stared at the screen, torn between the duty to save lives and the promise to guide someone who trusted me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
