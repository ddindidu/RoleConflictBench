I glanced down and saw it was Jamie, my oldest friend. The text read: \u201cSOS! Can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with these IKEA instructions.\u201d I knew Jamie had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there whenever she needed me. But Mrs. Lee was sitting in my chair, smiling patiently, trusting me to get her fringe just right. She\u2019d just asked for a tiny adjustment, and I could see how much it mattered to her. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to focus on the hair in front of me, but my mind kept drifting to Jamie, probably surrounded by planks and screws, waiting for my help. I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me now, but so did my client. Both expected me to be present, attentive, and reliable. My heart pounded as I weighed their needs, feeling the pressure of being pulled in two directions at once."}
