The line snakes down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cKeep the line moving, no mistakes.\u201d But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s her. She lost her father last night, and I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d answer if she needed me. I can almost hear her crying, needing comfort, needing me. But I can\u2019t stop. The next customer sighs loudly, and I force a smile, fingers trembling as I count change. My mind is split\u2014half here, counting bills, half with her, wishing I could hold her, say something, anything. The register drawer slams shut, and I glance at my phone, heart pounding. I\u2019m supposed to be the steady one for her, but right now, I\u2019m just a cashier with a line of people and a girlfriend who needs me more than ever."}
