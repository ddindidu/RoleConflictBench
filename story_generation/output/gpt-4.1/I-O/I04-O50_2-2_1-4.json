The last service window had already slipped by, and now a few of them were running hotter than they should. I knew if I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we could be looking at a full breakdown\u2014something my supervisor had warned me about more than once. But when I answered, it was my friend, voice trembling, asking if I had a minute. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner and needed someone to talk to. I could hear the tears in her voice, the way she tried to steady herself, and I knew she was counting on me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised I would. My mind raced, torn between the machines that needed my hands and the friend who needed my heart. I could almost feel the heat from the machines seeping into my own chest, the pressure mounting as I stood there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
