Wanting to make a good impression, I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I ran into them. As I balanced the cake in one hand and my phone in the other, an urgent email notification flashed across the screen. The merger contract I\u2019d been waiting for had arrived, and the client\u2019s message was clear: review it immediately, as a single overlooked clause could cost them dearly.\n\nJust then, I heard footsteps. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, appeared, smiling warmly. She looked delighted to see me, and I knew this was the perfect moment to introduce myself and offer the cake. But my mind raced with legal jargon and liability clauses, the weight of my client\u2019s trust pressing on my shoulders. I felt torn\u2014should I pause and be the friendly neighbor I wanted to be, or retreat to my apartment and dive into the contract, risking a cold first impression? My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, unsure which role to honor first."}
