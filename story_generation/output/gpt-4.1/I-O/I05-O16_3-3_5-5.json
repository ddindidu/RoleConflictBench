As a mentor, I was supposed to guide Dr. Patel, a resident, through the process of breaking bad news\u2014a skill that could define her career. She looked at me, eyes wide with anxiety, waiting for my advice on how to approach the family in Room 312. I knew I should walk her through every step, share my experience, and let her take the lead, even if it meant she might stumble. But as a doctor, I felt the weight of the family\u2019s grief pressing through the closed door. They deserved clarity, compassion, and the steady hand of someone who had done this countless times before. I could hear their muffled voices, desperate for answers, and I knew that a single misstep could deepen their pain. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to take over, to shield both Dr. Patel and the family from the consequences of inexperience. I hesitated, caught between my duty to teach and my responsibility to heal, uncertain which role should guide my next step."}
