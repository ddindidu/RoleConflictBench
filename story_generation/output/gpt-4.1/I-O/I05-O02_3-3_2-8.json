As a mentor, I knew Maya was waiting for me in the conference room, anxious about her upcoming career move. She\u2019d asked for my guidance, hoping I could help her navigate the crossroads she faced. I\u2019d promised her my full attention, to walk her through every option, to help her see the bigger picture. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the project manager. The client was growing impatient, and the contract couldn\u2019t be signed until I delivered my effort estimates. The team was counting on me to be precise, to avoid overcommitting or underselling our capabilities. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I focused on Maya, the project could stall, risking our reputation. If I dove into the estimates, I\u2019d let Maya down at a crucial moment. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide a young engineer and the duty to my team and client. The pressure built inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which role to serve first."}
