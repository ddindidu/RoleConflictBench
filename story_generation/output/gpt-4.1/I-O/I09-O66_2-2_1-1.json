I baked a small cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. As I was about to step out with the cake, my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. The pickup was just around the corner, and the passenger\u2019s note said, \u201cPlease hurry, my train leaves in 30 minutes.\u201d I glanced at the cake in my hands, then at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d have to skip meeting the neighbors, but if I waited, I\u2019d risk making my passenger late for their train. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me to be a good neighbor, but I also knew how much people relied on me to get them places on time. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warm welcome I wanted to offer and the responsibility I felt behind the wheel."}
