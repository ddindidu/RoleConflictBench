A few colleagues were dissecting the latest decisions made by our mutual friend, Mark. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking ill of others, but the group\u2019s laughter and pointed remarks made it hard to stay silent. Just as I was about to excuse myself, my phone buzzed\u2014a customer had arrived at my workshop with a broken wooden toy. As a carpenter, I was expected to assess the damage and provide a fair repair quote, but my mind was still tangled in the uncomfortable chatter I\u2019d just left behind. I felt pulled in two directions: the pressure to fit in with my peers without betraying my values, and the responsibility to focus on my craft and treat my customer with the attention they deserved. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t fully be present in either role, caught between the demands of social loyalty and professional duty."}
