She\u2019d carved out these hours just for mentees like me, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and commitment. But as I tucked my phone away, the cabin door slid open. My supervisor, clipboard in hand, stepped in with a curt nod. \u201cPerformance audit. Immediate.\u201d My heart thudded. I\u2019d heard stories\u2014operators written up for the smallest slip. Every protocol, every announcement, every stop had to be flawless. I gripped the controls, feeling the weight of a hundred passengers and the supervisor\u2019s gaze. My mind raced: if I left the cabin, I\u2019d disrespect Dr. Kim and possibly lose her trust. If I stayed, I risked a poor audit and disciplinary action. The train rumbled forward, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my undivided attention."}
