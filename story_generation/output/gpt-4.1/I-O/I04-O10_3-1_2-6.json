I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort she needed. I knew she was counting on me to be there, to listen, to help her feel less alone in the darkness.\n\nBut as I tried to focus on her words, my work phone chimed with a new email. I glanced at it\u2014an automated payment confirmation from a vendor, the kind that required a prompt, formal reply. My boss had reminded me just yesterday how important it was to maintain timely communication with vendors, especially this one. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectation to be the reliable accountant who never lets a detail slip.\n\nMy friend\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, desperate for support, while the email notification glared at me, demanding professionalism and promptness. I felt torn, my mind racing, caught between being the friend she needed and the accountant my job demanded."}
