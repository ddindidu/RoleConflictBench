The team meeting was about to start, and my manager had stressed how crucial this final discussion was\u2014our input would shape the project\u2019s future. I knew my colleagues expected me to be there, to speak up and help finalize our decisions. My phone buzzed, and I saw the emergency call: a patient nearby, chest pain, suspected heart attack.
