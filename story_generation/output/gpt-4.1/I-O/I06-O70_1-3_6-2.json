As her mentee, I knew how rare it was for her to have open hours, and she\u2019d made it clear: \u201cIf you want to grow, show up. My time is limited.\u201d I\u2019d been preparing questions all week, eager to make the most of her availability. But just as I was about to leave, my work phone buzzed\u2014a medical supply delivery, urgent, for the hospital\u2019s cardiac unit. The package had to be there within the hour, no exceptions. I could picture the patients waiting, the nurses counting on me. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind, but so did the dispatcher\u2019s: \u201cLives depend on this.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014respect Dr. Lee\u2019s time, or ensure the hospital got what it needed. I felt pulled in two, the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
