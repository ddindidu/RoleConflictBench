I wrapped it carefully, hoping to make a good impression and maybe spark a friendly conversation in the hallway. But as I was about to leave for my shift as a subway operator, I saw Mrs. Kim, the neighbor from across the hall, locking her door. This was the perfect moment to introduce myself and offer the cake. \n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the transit authority: a supervisor would be riding with me today for an unannounced performance audit. My heart pounded. I knew I had to be at the station early, check every protocol, and maintain absolute professionalism. There was no room for error or delay. Yet, Mrs. Kim was right there, and I could see she was about to leave. If I missed this chance, I might seem unfriendly or uninterested, the opposite of what I wanted as a new neighbor. I stood frozen in the hallway, cake in hand, torn between the expectations of being a warm neighbor and the demands of my job as a subway operator."}
