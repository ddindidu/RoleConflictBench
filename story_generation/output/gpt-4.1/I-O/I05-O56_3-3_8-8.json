My mentee, Sarah, sat in the waiting area, nervously scrolling through her phone. She\u2019d asked for advice before her big presentation\u2014one that could launch her career. I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to help her rehearse and boost her confidence. But in my chair sat Mrs. Patel, her hair thick with product, the tangles stubborn and unyielding. She expected me to work my usual magic, to wash and condition until her hair was silky and ready for the cut she\u2019d been looking forward to all week.\n\nAs I massaged shampoo into Mrs. Patel\u2019s scalp, I could see Sarah\u2019s anxious glances in the mirror. My mind raced: if I rushed the wash, I\u2019d risk damaging Mrs. Patel\u2019s hair and my reputation. If I took my time, Sarah might lose her nerve, feeling abandoned at her most vulnerable moment. Both needed me, both trusted me, and I felt myself pulled apart by the demands of being a mentor and a hairdresser, wishing I could split in two."}
