My partner sits on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the muted TV. I can tell he\u2019s had one of those days\u2014nothing catastrophic, just the slow grind of work wearing him down. I want to sit beside him, ask about his day, offer a hug, maybe just listen. That\u2019s what he needs from me, and I want to be there for him.\n\nBut my break is almost over. The telemarketing compliance system is ruthless; if I\u2019m even a minute late logging back in, it\u2019ll flag me. Too many flags, and I could lose my job. My supervisor\u2019s already warned me once. I glance at the clock, heart pounding. I can\u2019t be late, but I can\u2019t just walk past him either. He looks up, searching my face for comfort, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I hover in the doorway, torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
