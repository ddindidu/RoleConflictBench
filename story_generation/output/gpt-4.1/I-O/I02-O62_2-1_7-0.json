My girlfriend sat on a bench nearby, arms crossed, her eyes red from our latest argument about money. I knew she wanted to talk, to finally resolve the tension that had been building all week. She kept glancing at me, her expression pleading for a moment alone, a chance to fix things before they got worse. But my job demanded my full attention\u2014every few minutes, I noticed swimmers drifting toward the deep end, nothing urgent, but enough to keep me alert. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the boyfriend who should be there, listening and making things right, and the lifeguard who couldn\u2019t afford to look away, not even for a second. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor, feeling the pull of both expectations, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy them at the same time."}
