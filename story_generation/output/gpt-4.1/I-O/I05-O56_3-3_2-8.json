My mentee, Sarah, sat across from me, her eyes wide with anxiety as she waited for my advice on whether to accept a job offer that could change her life. She needed my full attention, my careful guidance\u2014every word mattered. But in the next chair, my client\u2019s hair was a matted puzzle, thick with product and impossible to cut until I washed and conditioned it thoroughly. The salon was busy, and my manager expected me to keep appointments on time. I could see my client\u2019s impatience in the mirror, her fingers drumming on the armrest. My mind raced: Sarah\u2019s future or my client\u2019s hair? I felt torn, my heart pounding as I tried to be present for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
