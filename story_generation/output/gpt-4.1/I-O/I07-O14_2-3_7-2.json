They needed my input on the project plan, and I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified a key point. As a colleague, I was expected to be responsive, to keep the workflow smooth and the team connected. But just as I started typing a reply, I glanced at the weather monitor on my desk. The atmospheric conditions were perfect\u2014something that happened maybe once a year. As a scientist, this was my chance to run the experiment that could make or break my research before the upcoming funding review. Every minute I delayed risked losing the window. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent pings of my colleagues and the silent, pressing call of the lab. My mind raced, weighed down by the knowledge that whichever role I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
