My mentee was counting on me to guide her through the final steps before the big project deadline. I\u2019d promised a clear, structured session\u2014she needed my experience now more than ever. Just as I was about to start, my phone rang. It was a customer, one I recognized from countless calls. His voice was sharp, accusing. He demanded to know why our latest offer seemed misleading, pressing for details and explanations. As a telemarketer, I was expected to stay calm, address every objection, and keep him satisfied. But the clock was ticking, and my mentee was waiting, relying on me to help her succeed. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my mentee and the obligation to resolve the customer\u2019s concerns. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
