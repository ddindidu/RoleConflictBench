She smiled warmly, expecting our usual friendly exchange. I managed a quick hello, but my mind was already at the pool, replaying the image of the broken lane rope I\u2019d spotted during my early shift. As a neighbor, I knew I should stop, ask about her garden, maybe help her with the groceries she was juggling. But as the lifeguard, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix that rope before the swim lessons started, the kids\u2019 safety and the whole schedule would be at risk. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the polite neighborly chat and the urgent repairs waiting for me. I could see the disappointment flicker in her eyes as I hesitated, caught between the expectations of being a good neighbor and the demands of my job."}
