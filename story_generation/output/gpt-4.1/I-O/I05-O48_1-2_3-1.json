As her mentor, I wanted to give her a thorough answer, sharing the little tips I\u2019d learned over the years. But just as I started explaining, my pager buzzed\u2014Mrs. Carter in 312 needed help getting dressed after her surgery. As a nursing assistant, I knew she couldn\u2019t wait; her incision was fresh, and she was anxious about moving alone. I glanced at Emily, her eyes eager for guidance, and then at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to be the mentor who never brushed off a question, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore a patient who depended on me for safe, gentle care. My mind raced, torn between the urge to nurture Emily\u2019s growth and the responsibility to ensure Mrs. Carter\u2019s comfort and safety. The hallway outside was quiet, but inside, I felt the clamor of conflicting expectations, each demanding my full attention."}
