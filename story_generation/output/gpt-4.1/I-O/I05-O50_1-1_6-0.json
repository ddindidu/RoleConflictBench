She\u2019d missed another project deadline, and I could see the frustration in her eyes. As her mentor, I wanted to help her find strategies to manage her time better, to encourage her growth and confidence. I started to ask gentle questions, hoping to guide her toward a solution, when my phone buzzed insistently. The maintenance supervisor\u2019s name flashed on the screen. \n\nA rarely used machine on the floor was acting up again\u2014an intermittent glitch, nothing catastrophic, but enough to halt production if left unchecked. As the only one familiar with its quirks, I was expected to drop everything and diagnose the issue immediately. I glanced at Jamie, who looked at me, waiting for advice, for support. My mind raced between the two demands: the expectation to be present and nurturing as a mentor, and the urgent responsibility to keep the machines running smoothly. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between helping Jamie grow and fulfilling my duty as the go-to repairer."}
