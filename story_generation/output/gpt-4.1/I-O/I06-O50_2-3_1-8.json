My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI want to see your approach to this problem next time.\u201d Three days. I had to prove I was learning, that I was worth their time. But just as I started typing, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the factory floor. The new staff were about to run a batch on the old press, and I knew they hadn\u2019t been trained on the safety protocols. If I didn\u2019t step in, someone could get hurt. But if I left my code now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, and I doubted I\u2019d finish before the deadline. My mentor expected commitment and progress; the staff needed my expertise to stay safe. I felt pulled in two directions, my chest tight with anxiety. I couldn\u2019t let my mentor down, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the risk on the floor. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between responsibility and obligation, as the minutes ticked by."}
