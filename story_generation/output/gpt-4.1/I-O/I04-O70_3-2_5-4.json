It was a frantic call from my best friend, Jamie. Her voice trembled as she explained her car had broken down on the side of the highway, miles from anywhere, and she was scared. She begged me to come get her right away. My heart twisted\u2014I knew how anxious she got in situations like this, and I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and rush to her side.\n\nBut in my other hand, I held a moderately valuable package, the last one of the night. The customer had been clear: they needed it tonight, and I had to get a signature to confirm delivery. If I left now, I\u2019d risk losing my job or at least getting a serious reprimand. My boss had already warned me about missed signatures. I stared at the package, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My friend needed me, but so did my job. My mind raced, torn between loyalty and responsibility, as I stood frozen on the curb, unable to move."}
