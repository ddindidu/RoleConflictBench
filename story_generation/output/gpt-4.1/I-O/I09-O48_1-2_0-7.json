She smiled and greeted me warmly, expecting the usual friendly exchange. I managed a quick hello and a polite smile, but my mind was already at the hospital, thinking about Mr. Carter, my patient recovering from surgery. He\u2019d been anxious and scared yesterday, and I knew he\u2019d need extra reassurance and companionship today. As Mrs. Lee lingered, hoping for a bit of small talk, I felt the pressure mounting. I wanted to be the good neighbor she expected, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a nursing assistant. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the friendly conversation in the corridor and the anxious patient waiting for me at work. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between being present for my neighbor and rushing to provide the emotional support my patient desperately needed."}
