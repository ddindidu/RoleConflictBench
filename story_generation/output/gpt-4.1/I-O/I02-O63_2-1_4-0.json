She\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014she even made my favorite pasta. I promised her I\u2019d be present, no distractions, just us. But as I\u2019m setting the table, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my supervisor: \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed. Can you cover the telemarketing line for an hour? Most calls are easy, just follow the script.\u201d I know the job isn\u2019t hard, and I could probably handle a few calls while Mia watches TV, but I see the hope in her eyes. She wants me here, not half-listening, not sneaking off to answer questions I\u2019ve answered a hundred times before. My mind races\u2014do I let my team down, or do I let Mia down? The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the knot in my stomach as I stand frozen, phone in hand, caught between being the boyfriend she deserves and the reliable employee my team needs."}
