My boyfriend\u2019s words from our argument still echoed in my mind\u2014accusations, doubts, the threat of breaking up hanging in the air. He wanted me to come over, to talk things through, to prove that I cared enough to fight for us. At the same time, my pager vibrated with a message from the hospital: my patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis and her family was waiting for me to explain what it meant for her future. They needed clarity, reassurance, and patience\u2014qualities I prided myself on as a doctor. But my heart was pounding, torn between the urge to rush to my boyfriend and the duty to be present and compassionate for my patient. Both needed me, both expected me to be fully there, and I felt myself pulled apart by the weight of their needs. I stared at the dashboard, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
