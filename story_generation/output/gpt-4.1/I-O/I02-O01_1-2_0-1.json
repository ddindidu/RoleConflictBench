She offers a small, tired smile, but I can see the tension in her shoulders. I want to sit beside her, listen to her day, and be the boyfriend she needs\u2014someone who can help her unwind, maybe make her laugh, or just hold her hand until the stress melts away.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with another email from the site manager. The subject line\u2014\u201cUrgent: Safety Review\u201d\u2014makes my stomach clench. I know the project is at a critical stage, and if I don\u2019t review the plans tonight, construction could continue with those risky elements in place. As an architect, I\u2019m responsible for every person who steps onto that site. The weight of that expectation presses on me, demanding my immediate attention.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn. Mia glances up, her eyes searching mine for comfort. My phone vibrates again. I can feel the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding more than I have to give."}
