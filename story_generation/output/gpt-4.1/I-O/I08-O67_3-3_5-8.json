The siren\u2019s wail barely cut through the roar of the thunderstorm. In the back, the paramedic shouted updates about the patient\u2019s dropping blood pressure. My phone buzzed in the cupholder. Glancing down, I saw the name: Mark. He was an old friend, more of an acquaintance now, but I remembered his easy laugh. I answered on speaker, my voice tense. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Mark\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cMy car broke down. I\u2019m stuck on Old Mill Road. Can you come get me? There\u2019s no one else around.\u201d I could hear the rain pelting his car, the fear in his voice. My mind raced. As an acquaintance, I should help him\u2014he was alone, vulnerable. But as an ambulance driver, I was responsible for the life in the back, for driving safely through the storm. The patient\u2019s monitor beeped urgently. Mark pleaded, \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My heart pounded, torn between the desperate voices on both ends, knowing I couldn\u2019t be what both needed at the same time."}
