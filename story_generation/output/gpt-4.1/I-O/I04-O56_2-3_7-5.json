My heart sank. She\u2019d misunderstood my last text, and I knew I needed to call her right away to clear things up. That\u2019s what friends do: talk things out, don\u2019t let hurt feelings fester. But just as I reached for my phone, Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice cut through the salon. She was glaring at her reflection, her voice rising, \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for at all!\u201d The other stylists were already packing up, and the clock was ticking toward closing time. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to listen, stay calm, and fix things\u2014no matter how tired or distracted I felt. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, Jamie\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the friend who needed reassurance and the client demanding my full attention. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from all sides."}
