My partner lay beside me, eyes red and distant, barely speaking since the call about his brother. He needed me\u2014needed my arms around him, my words, my presence. But the hospital project was at a critical stage. The city inspector was coming in two hours, and I was the only one who could walk the team through the final safety checks. If I missed something, lives could be at risk. My mind raced with checklists and code requirements, but my heart ached for him, for the way his hand reached for mine in the dark. I felt torn in two, the weight of his grief pressing against the responsibility I owed to hundreds of future patients. I wanted to be everything he needed, but the world outside our room demanded a different kind of vigilance. My chest tightened as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
