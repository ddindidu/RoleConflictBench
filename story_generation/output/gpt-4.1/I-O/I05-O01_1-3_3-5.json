Every line I drew had to be perfect\u2014lives would depend on it. My phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, with another question about structural loads. She\u2019d caught me in the break room earlier, and I\u2019d promised to help her whenever she needed. I wanted to be the mentor I never had, someone who shared knowledge freely, even in the small moments between tasks. But now, as her messages kept coming, I felt the pressure mounting. If I paused to answer, I\u2019d lose my train of thought on the design, risking a critical oversight. If I ignored her, I\u2019d fail her trust and the promise I\u2019d made to support her growth. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the young architect seeking guidance, and the patients who would one day walk these halls. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor, caught between the demands of teaching and the weight of responsibility in my hands."}
