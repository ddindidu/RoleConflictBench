As a mentor, I prided myself on nurturing growth, always ready to listen and guide. Just this morning, I noticed my mentee, Jamie, seemed frazzled, her calendar a mess of overlapping meetings. I wanted to help her find balance, to encourage her to prioritize and breathe. But as the clock struck noon, I switched roles\u2014now, I was a telemarketer, my job to sell, to stick to the script, to handle objections with practiced ease.\n\nThe calls came fast. Prospects peppered me with technical questions about our new service, questions the script barely touched. I felt the urge to go off-script, to explain, to teach\u2014just as I would with Jamie. But my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script. Don\u2019t get sidetracked.\u201d I felt torn, the mentor in me itching to help, the telemarketer in me bound by rules. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor, caught between the urge to nurture and the demand to perform."}
