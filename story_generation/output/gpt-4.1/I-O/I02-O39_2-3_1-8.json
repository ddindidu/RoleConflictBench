She\u2019d just gotten some harsh feedback from her boss, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. My chest tightened\u2014I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to tell her she was brilliant and that her boss didn\u2019t see her worth. I glanced at the clock, knowing I had only a few minutes before I had to get back to the site. Suddenly, the shrill site alarm blared, echoing across the yard. My foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, shouting for everyone to evacuate. I knew the rules: drop everything, no exceptions, safety first. But Mia\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, \u201cCan you just stay with me for a minute?\u201d My heart pounded as I looked at the streaming crowd of workers heading to the muster point.

I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between the urgent demands of the site and the desperate need in my girlfriend\u2019s voice."}
