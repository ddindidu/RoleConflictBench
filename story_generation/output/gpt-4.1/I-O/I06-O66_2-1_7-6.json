Sorry, that\u2019s all I have today.\u201d I knew how rare these windows were\u2014he was always busy, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never waste his time. But as I pulled up to the curb, my last passenger stepped out, leaving behind a mess: spilled coffee pooling on the seat, napkins crumpled on the floor. I had another ride request already pinging, and if I didn\u2019t clean up, my rating\u2014and reputation as a professional taxi driver\u2014would take a hit.
