Physical fitness wasn\u2019t just about looking good; it was about being able to protect people, to do my job right. Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my old friend. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this furniture. The instructions make no sense.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his voice. He\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me now, even for something as small as this. But I also knew that skipping my workout meant letting down my duty to stay sharp and ready for the job. My mind raced\u2014should I be the friend Sam needed right now, or the officer my community expected? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between two worlds."}
