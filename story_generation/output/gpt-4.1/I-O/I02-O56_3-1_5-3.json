It was Saturday afternoon, the last weekend before Mia left for her new job in Berlin. We\u2019d planned a special evening\u2014her favorite restaurant, a walk by the river, just us. She\u2019d been dropping hints all week about how much this time meant to her, and I promised I\u2019d be there, no distractions. But as I was finishing up my last client, Mrs. Patel, she peered into the mirror and smiled apologetically. \u201cCould you just trim a little more off the fringe? It\u2019s almost perfect, but I trust you to get it right.\u201d She was always so kind, and I knew how much she valued her appointments with me. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014Mia, checking if I was on my way. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down: the boyfriend who should never be late tonight, and the hairdresser who never rushes a client. My scissors hovered, my mind torn, as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this moment."}
