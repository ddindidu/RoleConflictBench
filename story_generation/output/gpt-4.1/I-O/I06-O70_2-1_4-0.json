My mentor had always emphasized the importance of reaching out early if I hit a wall, but I kept thinking I could fix it myself. The clock ticked closer to noon, and my phone buzzed\u2014a notification from the delivery app. A package had just arrived at the depot, later than scheduled, but still within the day. I was supposed to deliver it immediately to stay on track. My mentor expected transparency and timely updates, but my delivery job demanded punctuality and reliability. If I messaged my mentor now, I\u2019d risk being late with the package. If I left for the delivery, I\u2019d delay communicating my technical hurdle, possibly letting my mentor down. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tug-of-war between my responsibilities."}
