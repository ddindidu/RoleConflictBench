My headset crackles with the voices of fellow controllers, each of us juggling a dozen flights, coordinating handoffs, and trying to keep the airspace safe. I glance at my phone\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I answer, and her voice is shaky, desperate. Her car\u2019s broken down on the highway, it\u2019s pouring rain, and she\u2019s scared. She begs me to come get her right away. My heart twists. I want to be there for her, to drop everything and help, but the storm outside is chaos in here too. Planes are stacking up, pilots are anxious, and my team is counting on me to keep things running smoothly. I can feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my friend\u2019s fear and my colleagues\u2019 trust, and I don\u2019t know how I can possibly choose between them."}
