As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to listen and contribute, especially since today\u2019s meeting would cover crucial project updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. But as the only cashier on duty, I was in the middle of processing a string of high-value transactions. The end-of-shift rush had begun, and every bill, every receipt, demanded my full attention. If I made a mistake now, it could mean a major financial discrepancy, something my manager had warned me about just this morning.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting. I could picture my teammates waiting, expecting my input. At the same time, the line at my register grew longer, customers shifting impatiently. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the duty to my job at the register. I felt the pressure mounting, my hands trembling slightly as I counted out change, wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
