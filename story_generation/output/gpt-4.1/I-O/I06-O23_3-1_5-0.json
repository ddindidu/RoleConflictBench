As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out, to be honest about the chaos, but I hesitated. I didn\u2019t want to seem incapable or unprepared.

My mind raced, torn between drafting an email to my mentor admitting the project was off track, or diving into the contract review to maintain my professional standards. I could feel the anxiety building, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they demanded at the same time."}
