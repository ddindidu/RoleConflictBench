I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve been fighting about money all week, and I know he expects me to help fix things, to be the understanding girlfriend who smooths things over. But right now, I\u2019m behind the wheel, focused on the road, my passenger in the back humming along to the radio, relaxed, in no rush. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m supposed to be calm, attentive, and get them to their meeting safely and on time. I can\u2019t let my personal life bleed into my work, but my mind keeps drifting back to Alex\u2019s words, the tension in his voice. I grip the steering wheel tighter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I want to pull over and call him, to try and make things right, but I also have a responsibility to my passenger. The city blurs past, and I\u2019m caught between the demands of love and duty, unsure which to answer first."}
