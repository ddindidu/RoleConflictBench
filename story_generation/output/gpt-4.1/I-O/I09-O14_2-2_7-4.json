Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, lives alone just down the hall. I know she relies on me for small things\u2014picking up her mail, checking in when the weather turns bad. Tonight, the advisory warns of possible power outages and delays. I feel a tug of responsibility; I should check on her, maybe offer to bring her some groceries or just reassure her.\n\nBut my laptop screen glows with unfinished graphs and half-written notes. The departmental meeting is tomorrow morning, and my advisor expects a clear, accurate summary of my latest findings. I can\u2019t fudge the data or skip details; my reputation as a scientist depends on it. The clock ticks, and I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014Mrs. Kim\u2019s safety and comfort, the integrity of my research. My mind races, torn between the warmth of neighborly duty and the cold precision of scientific expectation. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, uncertain which door I\u2019ll open first."}
