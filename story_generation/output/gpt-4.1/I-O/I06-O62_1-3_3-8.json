It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew my mentor expected me to communicate openly, not let things pile up. I started typing a quick message, trying to phrase it so I didn\u2019t sound clueless. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a child drifting into the deep end, where swimming wasn\u2019t allowed. The child\u2019s strokes were frantic, splashing more than swimming. My training screamed at me to act immediately, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. But my mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind, and my thumb hovered over the send button. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I tried to balance the responsibility to my mentor with the urgent duty to the pool. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I froze, caught between the need to communicate and the need to protect."}
