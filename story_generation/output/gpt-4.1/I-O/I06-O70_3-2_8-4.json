My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, right before catching a flight. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cI only have this hour, so let\u2019s make it count.\u201d I felt honored, and a little anxious not to waste her time. But as I was about to log in, my work phone buzzed. A moderately valuable package needed to be delivered\u2014now. The customer was waiting, and company policy demanded I get a signature, no exceptions. If I delayed, the customer might refuse the package, and I\u2019d be held responsible. My mind raced. If I left my mentor waiting, I\u2019d disrespect her effort and possibly lose her trust. But if I skipped the delivery, I\u2019d risk my job and let down a customer. My hands trembled as I weighed the two demands, both urgent, both important, and completely incompatible in this moment."}
