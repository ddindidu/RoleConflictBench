As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor about this technical hurdle\u2014I\u2019d been stuck for hours, and the project deadline was looming. My mentor always emphasized open communication, and I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let problems fester. Tell me as soon as you hit a wall.\u201d But just as I was about to draft an email, my phone buzzed. The external inspector was back, and his tone was urgent. As the engineer on duty, I was responsible for ensuring every safety and regulatory box was checked. Now, he\u2019d found a compliance issue that could shut us down if not fixed immediately. My mind raced. If I focused on the inspector, I\u2019d be ignoring my mentor\u2019s trust and risking the project\u2019s progress. But if I reached out for help now, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to keep the site safe and operational. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between two roles that demanded all of me at once."}
