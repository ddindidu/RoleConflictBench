They were waiting for my input on a crucial detail before moving forward, and I knew the expectation: respond quickly, keep the workflow smooth. But as I closed the door behind me, my focus shifted. The patient in front of me, a young woman with a sore throat and fever, looked anxious. As her doctor, I was expected to listen carefully, examine her, and prescribe the right treatment\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions. I could feel the pressure from my colleagues, picturing them refreshing their inboxes, growing impatient. At the same time, I saw the trust in my patient\u2019s eyes, her health in my hands. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, a sharp reminder of the world outside this room. I took a breath, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
