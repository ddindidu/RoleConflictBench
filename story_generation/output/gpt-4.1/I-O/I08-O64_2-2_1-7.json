My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep things moving, but be friendly.\u201d I smiled at each customer, making small talk, but my eyes kept darting to the end of the line. That\u2019s when I saw her\u2014Maya, a friend of a friend I\u2019d met at a party last week. She looked even more nervous now, clutching her basket and glancing around, clearly uncomfortable in the crowd.\n\nAs she reached my register, I remembered how she\u2019d barely spoken at the party, and how I\u2019d promised myself to be more welcoming if I saw her again. I wanted to take a moment, ask how she was, maybe help her feel at ease. But the impatient huffs from the line behind her reminded me of my duty to keep things moving. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the friendly acquaintance Maya needed, or the efficient cashier my job demanded. I opened my mouth, caught between two roles, unsure which words would come out."}
