My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had left her potted plants and a shoe rack in the corridor again. I knew the rules\u2014nothing should block the emergency exit. As her neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, not the one who tattles or moves her things without asking. But if the inspector saw them, she could get fined, and the whole floor might get a warning.\n\nJust then, my regular client, Jamie, settled into my chair. She smiled and asked if I could trim her fringe just a bit more. She\u2019s always so easygoing, but I could tell she wanted it perfect this time. I wanted to give her my full attention, make sure she left happy. But my mind kept drifting to the corridor, picturing the inspector\u2019s clipboard, the plants, the shoe rack. Should I excuse myself for a moment and risk seeming unprofessional, or focus on Jamie and risk letting my neighbor down? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
