On one, my mentee\u2019s project plan blinked with highlighted questions and requests for feedback. She was struggling, and I\u2019d promised to help her navigate this tricky phase, offering regular check-ins and guidance. On the other tab, the compliance checklist for the upcoming audit waited. The audit was still weeks away, but I knew from experience that updating the documentation was a meticulous process\u2014one that demanded my full attention to ensure every safety and regulatory standard was met.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my mentee: \u201cCan we meet this afternoon? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d I glanced at the calendar. If I spent the afternoon with her, I\u2019d lose precious time on the audit prep. But if I focused on the documentation, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my mentee counting on my support, the company relying on my diligence as an engineer. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between being the mentor she needed and the engineer my team depended on."}
