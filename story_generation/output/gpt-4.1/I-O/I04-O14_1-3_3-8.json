It was Sam, my oldest friend, his message popping up: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with these furniture instructions.\u201d I could picture him, surrounded by planks and screws, frustration written all over his face. Normally, I\u2019d drop everything to help him out\u2014he\u2019s always been there for me, especially during my rough patches.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, a shrill alarm blared from the corner of the lab. The gas chromatograph was flashing red, warning of a possible leak. My heart pounded. As the scientist on duty, it was my responsibility to check the seals and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. The protocols were clear: no distractions, immediate action.\n\nI stared at my phone, Sam\u2019s call request blinking, while the equipment\u2019s alert pulsed insistently. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed me and the lab that depended on me. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my hands trembling as I hovered between answering Sam and rushing to the equipment."}
