I felt the weight of expectation pressing down on me; I couldn\u2019t let them down. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the lab\u2019s maintenance checklist, due soon. As the designated scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was checked and every safety protocol followed, even if nothing seemed amiss. Skipping or delaying the checklist could risk safety and my professional integrity. My mind raced, torn between the immediate demand of my mentor and the looming responsibility of lab safety. I could feel my chest tighten, anxiety creeping in as I tried to figure out how to meet both expectations. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being a good mentee and a responsible scientist."}
