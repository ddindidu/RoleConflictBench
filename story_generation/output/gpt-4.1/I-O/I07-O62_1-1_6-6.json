I glanced at the pool, scanning for any signs of trouble. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a group of kids edging into the shallow end, giggling and splashing, no adult in sight. My training kicked in\u2014no unsupervised swimmers, especially kids. I was about to blow my whistle when my phone buzzed again. It was a message from a colleague, just an update about a project. \u201cNo immediate action required,\u201d she\u2019d written, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond quickly, show you\u2019re engaged, be a team player. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I didn\u2019t reply soon, would I seem uncommitted? But if I looked away from the pool, even for a moment, what if something happened? My mind raced, torn between the silent expectations of my office and the urgent responsibility of the water. I gripped my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
