The HOA had sent out reminders\u2014nothing should block the emergency exit, especially with the inspection tomorrow. As her neighbor, I wanted to be understanding; she loved those plants, and they brightened our otherwise drab hallway. But as an architect, I couldn\u2019t ignore the risk. I\u2019d spent weeks designing a hospital wing where every inch of corridor was carefully measured for safety and accessibility. I knew how crucial it was to keep emergency routes clear. Yet, as I stood there, I felt torn. Should I gently remind Mrs. Lee, risking our friendly rapport, or let it go and hope the inspector would overlook it? My mind raced with images of both a failed inspection and Mrs. Lee\u2019s disappointed face. The weight of my professional standards pressed against the neighborly kindness I wanted to show. I lingered in the hallway, caught between the demands of my two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
