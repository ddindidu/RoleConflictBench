We\u2019re all waiting.\u201d As a colleague, I knew the team couldn\u2019t move forward until I responded. They expected me to be prompt, to keep the workflow smooth. But the request from the assistant still sat unread in my inbox\u2014she wanted access to the client files, saying it would help her prepare the next report. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality; I couldn\u2019t just hand over sensitive documents, especially to someone not directly involved. The pressure built as unread messages stacked up, each one a reminder of my colleagues\u2019 impatience. I felt torn\u2014if I delayed, I\u2019d let the team down, but if I responded too quickly, I risked breaching my ethical duty. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing between loyalty to my team and my responsibility to my client."}
