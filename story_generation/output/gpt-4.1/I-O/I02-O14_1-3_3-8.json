I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smile, picturing her excitement, and for a moment, I let myself imagine a carefree evening\u2014just the two of us, laughing over dinner, no distractions. But then my work email pings, and my heart sinks. The lab\u2019s gas chromatograph is sending out warning alerts again. If I don\u2019t check it soon, there\u2019s a real risk of a hazardous leak. The safety protocols are clear: immediate attention is non-negotiable. \n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mia\u2019s been looking forward to this, and I promised her we\u2019d make time. But the lab depends on me; if something goes wrong, it\u2019s not just data at stake\u2014it\u2019s people\u2019s safety. My mind races, torn between the warmth of her anticipation and the cold, clinical urgency of my responsibilities. I want to be the boyfriend who keeps his promises, but I\u2019m also the scientist who can\u2019t ignore a warning sign. My thumb hovers over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019ll have to disappoint."}
