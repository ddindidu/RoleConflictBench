The HOA inspection is today, and I know anything blocking the hallway could get us all in trouble. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate\u2014she\u2019s elderly, and moving things isn\u2019t easy for her. But the rules are clear, and I don\u2019t want the whole floor to get cited. I glance at my watch; my shift as a taxi driver starts in twenty minutes. I pride myself on being punctual and following every traffic law, never rushing or cutting corners, even when the roads are clear like today. If I take the time to help Mrs. Lee move her rack, I\u2019ll be late for my first fare, and that means either speeding or disappointing a customer. My mind races between being the good neighbor everyone expects and the reliable, law-abiding driver my passengers count on. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, torn between two roles that both matter to me."}
