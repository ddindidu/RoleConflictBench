As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor about the escalating conflict with my teammates. The tension was threatening our project deadline, and I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice urging me to communicate early, not let things fester. But the police radio crackled at my side, snapping me back to the present. I was on duty, standing at the edge of a busy intersection where a traffic accident had just occurred. My responsibility as a police officer was clear: protect the people milling around, direct traffic, and keep the scene safe. Every second I spent thinking about my team\u2019s issues felt like a betrayal of my badge, but every moment I delayed contacting my mentor made the knot in my stomach tighter. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both uniforms\u2014one visible, one invisible\u2014pressing down on me."}
