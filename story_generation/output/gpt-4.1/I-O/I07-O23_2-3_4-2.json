As a colleague, I knew my part of the project was due by noon, and any delay would stall the entire team. I could already imagine the frustration in my teammate\u2019s voice if I missed the deadline\u2014her work depended on mine. But as a lawyer, the merger contract demanded my full attention. The clauses were dense, and I\u2019d spotted language that could put our client at risk if I didn\u2019t review it thoroughly and quickly. My manager had just emailed, stressing the urgency. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to not let my team down and the responsibility to protect our client from a costly oversight. I felt my chest tighten, the weight of both roles pressing in. I glanced at the clock, knowing I had to choose where to focus, but unable to shake the feeling that whichever I picked, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
