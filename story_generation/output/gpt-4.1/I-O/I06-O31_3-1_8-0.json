My mentor had squeezed in this session just before catching a red-eye flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her effort and commitment. We were deep in conversation, her advice finally helping me see a way forward in my career, when my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. A noise complaint, late-night party, neighbors upset. As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to keep the peace and enforce the law. But if I left now, I\u2019d waste my mentor\u2019s rare availability and possibly damage our relationship. If I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty, letting down the community and my colleagues. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
