As a mentor, I was supposed to meet with Priya in ten minutes\u2014she was nervous about her upcoming interview, and I\u2019d promised to help her prepare. She looked up to me, expecting guidance and encouragement, especially now, with her big opportunity on the line. But my telemarketing shift overlapped, and the new product launch meant every call was a minefield. Prospects kept firing technical questions that the script barely covered, and my supervisor expected me to stick to the script, handle objections, and keep call times short. I could hear Priya\u2019s footsteps approaching, her trust in me palpable, while my phone blinked with another incoming call. My mind raced: should I risk a longer call to genuinely help a customer, or cut it short to be there for Priya? The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet."}
