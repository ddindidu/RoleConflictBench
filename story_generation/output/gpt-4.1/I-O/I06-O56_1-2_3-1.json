It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to show I was engaged and learning. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCheck in with your mentor today.\u201d I glanced at the clock, thinking I could send a quick message before my next client. Just then, the door chimed and a woman stepped in, clutching her purse, eyes darting around the salon. She looked lost and anxious. I knew I was supposed to greet her warmly, help her feel at ease\u2014first impressions mattered so much in this job. But my mind tugged back to my mentor\u2019s expectation: communicate promptly, don\u2019t let questions pile up. I felt my heart race, torn between dashing off a quick message and giving my full attention to the client. Both roles demanded something of me in that moment, and I stood frozen, caught between the urge to be a good mentee and the responsibility to be a welcoming hairdresser."}
