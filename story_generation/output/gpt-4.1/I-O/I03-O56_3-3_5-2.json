It was the last weekend before Alex left for his new job overseas, and we\u2019d promised ourselves a day just for us\u2014no distractions, just memories to hold onto. He smiled at me over breakfast, his hand warm in mine, and I felt the weight of time slipping away. But as I was about to leave for the salon, my phone buzzed: the bride and her bridesmaids had arrived early, nerves fraying, desperate for reassurance and a calming touch. My boss texted, \u201cWe need you now. They\u2019re anxious.\u201d I looked at Alex, who was already planning our day, and then at my uniform, hanging by the door. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the girlfriend he needed, to soak up every last moment. But I was also the hairdresser, expected to greet my clients with a smile, to make their special day perfect. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, torn between love and duty, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
