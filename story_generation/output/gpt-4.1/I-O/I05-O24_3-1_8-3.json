My mentee, Sarah, had just called, her voice trembling as she described the pressure of her first major project\u2014a presentation that could open doors for her career. She needed guidance, reassurance, and time. As her mentor, I felt compelled to help her navigate this challenge, to encourage her growth and confidence. But the clock on the wall reminded me of my other duty: as a judge, I had a scheduling order to draft for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. The court expected clarity and precision, and any delay could ripple through the docket, affecting attorneys and litigants alike. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support Sarah and the obligation to uphold the court\u2019s standards. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at the blinking cursor, heart pounding, caught in the tension of choosing which expectation to meet first."}
