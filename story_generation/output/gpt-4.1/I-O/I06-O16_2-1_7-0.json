My mentor had managed to squeeze in a brief meeting for me between her surgeries\u2014a rare opportunity I knew I shouldn\u2019t waste. She\u2019d made it clear how valuable her time was, and I wanted to show her I respected that, to prove I was serious about learning. But just as I was about to leave for her office, a patient arrived for a routine check-up. He looked tired, sniffling, and mentioned a sore throat and cough. It sounded like a common cold, but I knew I couldn\u2019t just brush it off. As a doctor, I was expected to be thorough, to listen carefully, and to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything more serious. My mind raced: if I rushed, I might overlook something important; if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my mentor, risking her disappointment. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the patient waiting in the exam room and the mentor waiting upstairs, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
