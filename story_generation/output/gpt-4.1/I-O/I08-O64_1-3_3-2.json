The store was quiet, but the pressure was high\u2014any mistake could mean hours of searching for a missing dollar, or worse, suspicion from my manager. Just as I was double-checking the totals, I heard my name. It was Jamie, someone I knew from my apartment building. She smiled and leaned on the counter, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for her visiting parents. I felt the pull of two worlds: as an acquaintance, I wanted to be friendly and helpful, to offer a thoughtful suggestion and maybe even chat for a minute. But as the cashier, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus, not with the register open and the numbers needing my full attention. My hands hovered over the bills, my mind racing between the urge to help Jamie and the responsibility to finish my work without error."}
