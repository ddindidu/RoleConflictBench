Glancing down, I saw a message from Sam: \u201cRough day. Just need someone to talk to.\u201d I could almost hear the heaviness in his words, and I knew he counted on me to listen, to be there when things got tough. But the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the safety briefing. Attendance wasn\u2019t optional\u2014missing it meant risking a write-up, or worse, putting the team in danger. I felt the weight of my phone in one hand and my gloves in the other, torn between being the friend Sam needed and the reliable worker my crew depended on. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, wishing I could split myself in two. The seconds ticked by, and I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
