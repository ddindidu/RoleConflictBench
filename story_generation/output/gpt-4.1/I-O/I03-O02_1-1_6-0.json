I\u2019d been so caught up in brainstorming ideas for the new project at work that I\u2019d forgotten to confirm our plans. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk it out, and smooth over the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. But my laptop screen glowed with the notes from today\u2019s meeting, and my mind buzzed with possible technical solutions for the project. My team was still tossing around ideas, and I wanted to be ready with a solid proposal when we regrouped. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Alex expecting me to be present and attentive, my team expecting me to be innovative and prepared. My thumb hovered over the call button, but my eyes kept drifting back to my sketches and notes. The urge to resolve things with Alex battled with the drive to keep working, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which role needed me more right now."}
