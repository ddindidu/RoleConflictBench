I could tell right away from the curt reply that something was wrong. Scrolling up, I realized my last text\u2014meant as a joke\u2014must have come across as harsh. Jamie\u2019s words stung: \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d say something like that.\u201d My chest tightened. I knew I had to call and clear things up before the misunderstanding grew, but I glanced at the clock\u2014only an hour left in my shift. My sales numbers were still below target, and my manager had already warned me about my performance this week. Every call I made now mattered. If I didn\u2019t hit my quota, I risked losing my bonus, maybe even my job. But Jamie was my friend, and I couldn\u2019t let them think I\u2019d hurt them on purpose. My headset felt heavier than usual as I stared at my phone, torn between dialing Jamie\u2019s number and making another sales call. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, caught between being the friend Jamie needed and the employee my boss expected."}
