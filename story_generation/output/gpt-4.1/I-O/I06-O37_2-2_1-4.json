My mentor had been clear: finish the sample before our next meeting in three days. I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. But as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about my housekeeping job. The client\u2019s floor cleaner was almost gone, and I was supposed to manage supplies. If I didn\u2019t buy more before the next cleaning, I\u2019d be letting them down. I could already hear their disappointment, see the sticky floors, feel the guilt. My mind spun between debugging loops and shopping lists. I knew both roles mattered\u2014my future depended on my mentor\u2019s guidance, but my present relied on keeping my cleaning clients happy. The pressure built in my chest, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I sat frozen, torn between the code on my screen and the empty bottle in the supply closet, unsure which demand to answer first."}
