The salon was nearly empty, but Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice echoed off the mirrors as she berated the unevenness of her bangs. I tried to soothe her, apologizing and offering to fix it, all while keeping my tone calm and professional. My mind, though, kept drifting to the row of trash bins outside my apartment building. Tomorrow was pickup day, and I knew my neighbor, Mr. Lee, always expected everyone to wait until the bins were full before dragging them to the curb. They were only half-full tonight, but I had a bag of hair clippings and salon waste that needed to go out. If I waited, the salon would smell, but if I took the trash out now, I\u2019d risk Mr. Lee\u2019s disapproving glare and a possible note on my door about \u201cshared responsibility.\u201d Mrs. Carter\u2019s complaints grew louder, demanding my full attention, but my thoughts tugged in two directions\u2014toward the expectations of a good neighbor and the demands of a professional hairdresser. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
