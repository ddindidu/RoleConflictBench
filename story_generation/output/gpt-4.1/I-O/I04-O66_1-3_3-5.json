The construction had squeezed the road into a single lane, and just ahead, a school zone sign flashed. Kids clustered near the curb, some darting dangerously close to the street. My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014my friend\u2019s name lit up the screen. He\u2019d texted earlier, panicked about assembling his new bookshelf, and now he was calling for a quick video chat. I knew he was struggling, probably surrounded by scattered screws and half-built shelves, counting on me to help him out of his jam. But as a taxi driver, I couldn\u2019t risk even a glance at my phone, not with children so close and the road so tight. My friend expected me to be there for him, to drop everything and help, but my responsibility to my passengers and the kids outside demanded my full attention. My heart pounded as the phone vibrated again, torn between the urge to answer and the duty to keep everyone safe."}
