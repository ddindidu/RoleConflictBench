I know it\u2019s the team chat\u2014everyone\u2019s waiting for my clarification on the project specs before they can move forward. I promised I\u2019d be responsive, and I can almost hear the frustration building with every minute I don\u2019t reply. But as I reach the ICU, the nurse\u2019s urgent wave pulls me in. The life-support device is flashing red, alarms blaring, and I can see the patient\u2019s family through the glass, faces pale with worry. My mind races: I need to focus, diagnose the fault, and fix it\u2014lives could depend on it. Yet, the pressure to be a reliable colleague tugs at me. I picture my teammates, stalled and waiting, maybe even doubting my commitment. My hands hover over the machine\u2019s panel, but my phone vibrates again. I\u2019m torn, heart pounding, caught between the immediate, tangible crisis in front of me and the invisible, mounting expectations from my team."}
