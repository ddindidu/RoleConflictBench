My partner had just texted, \u201cRough day. Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I knew he needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. That\u2019s what he expected\u2014what I wanted to give. But as I set my phone down, I caught the uncertain look of my new client in the mirror. She hesitated, running her fingers through her freshly coloured hair, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIs it\u2026 too warm?\u201d she asked quietly. My heart squeezed. I needed to reassure her, to fix it if she wasn\u2019t happy, to uphold my reputation as a professional who cares. But my mind kept drifting to my partner, waiting for me to come home and be his safe place. I felt split in two, torn between the urge to rush through the appointment and the duty to give my client the attention she deserved. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the colour chart, my thoughts tangled in the impossible choice between being the girlfriend he needed and the hairdresser she expected."}
