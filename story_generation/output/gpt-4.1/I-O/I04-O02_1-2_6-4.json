He\u2019s waiting for me to confirm where we\u2019re meeting tonight, but I\u2019m knee-deep in documentation for the new product release. The updated safety standard just dropped this morning, and my manager expects a full compliance report before the end of the day. I know how important it is to get this right; a single oversight could mean a costly recall or worse, a safety incident. But Sam\u2019s last message sounds worried, \u201cAre we still on for tonight? I\u2019m not sure where to go.\u201d I promised him we\u2019d talk things out after our recent misunderstanding, and I can\u2019t let him down again. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between drafting the compliance evidence and sending Sam the reassurance he needs. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can feel my chest tighten as I try to decide which role I can afford to disappoint less."}
