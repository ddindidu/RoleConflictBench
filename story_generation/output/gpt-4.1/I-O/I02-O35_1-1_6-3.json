Why don\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve been trying to spend more time together, and I promised I\u2019d be more attentive. I want to call her, to explain, to fix this before it grows into something bigger. But just as I reach for my phone, the intercom crackles. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop is closest to the museum?\u201d a passenger\u2019s voice asks, uncertain and a little anxious. I know I\u2019m expected to answer promptly, to keep everyone safe and informed. My hand hovers between the intercom and my phone, my mind torn. I can\u2019t ignore her, not again, but I can\u2019t neglect my duty to the passengers either. The seconds stretch, my heart pounding, as I wrestle with the impossible choice between being the boyfriend she needs and the operator these people rely on."}
