My mentor had squeezed in our session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her effort and commitment. But as I listened to her advice, my phone buzzed with a message from the pharmacy counter: a patient was waiting for their prescription, and the technician needed my final check. It was a routine cold medication, something I could verify in seconds, but accuracy was everything. One slip could mean the wrong drug, the wrong dose. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectant gaze on the video call, the patient\u2019s trust in my professional judgment. My mind raced, torn between honoring my mentor\u2019s time and upholding my responsibility as a pharmacist. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
