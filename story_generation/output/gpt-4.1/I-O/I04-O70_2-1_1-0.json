It was Jamie, my best friend, and her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears in her words. I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to be there. But as I glanced at the address label in my hand, my heart sank. This package was already running late, and my supervisor had reminded me just this morning about the importance of on-time deliveries. If I stopped now, even for a few minutes, I\u2019d risk being behind for the rest of my route and possibly getting a warning. Jamie\u2019s pain tugged at me, but so did the weight of my job\u2019s expectations. I stood there, phone pressed to my ear, torn between being the friend she needed and the reliable delivery person I was supposed to be."}
