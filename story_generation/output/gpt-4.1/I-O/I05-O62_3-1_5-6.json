She was eager, asking questions about emergency response, and I felt the familiar pride of sharing my experience. My role as a mentor demanded patience and thoroughness\u2014this was her first time shadowing a lifeguard, and I wanted her to understand every detail, especially since a single mistake could mean disaster. As I explained the importance of constant vigilance, my eyes flicked to the water. A group of kids had slipped into the shallow end, giggling, clearly unsupervised. The rules were strict: no one in the water without a lifeguard present. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Should I interrupt this crucial teaching moment to enforce the rules, or trust that my mentee would learn more by watching how I handled the situation? Both roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding I protect, the other insisting I teach. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, caught between the urge to act and the need to guide."}
