The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and this was the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for months. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about the team\u2019s direction. But as the shift\u2019s cashier, I was staring at a stack of bills and receipts, the end-of-day deposit looming. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be counted, logged, and double-checked before I could leave. The manager had drilled it into us\u2014no shortcuts, especially with large deposits. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I rushed the deposit, I\u2019d risk mistakes and break policy. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the meeting, letting my team down. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, and I could almost hear my teammates\u2019 voices, waiting for my input. My hands trembled as I sorted the bills, torn between the demands of the register and the conference room, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
