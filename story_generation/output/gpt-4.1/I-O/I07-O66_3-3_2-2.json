This was the final team discussion before we locked in the project decisions, and my manager had stressed how important everyone\u2019s input was. I was supposed to be logged in, camera on, ready to speak up. But the steering wheel was cold in my hands, and the snow outside was coming down harder by the minute. My passenger in the back seat kept glancing at his watch, anxiety etched on his face. He had to catch an international flight, and the airport was still miles away. Every red light, every slow-moving car, made my heart pound faster. I knew my colleagues were expecting me to be present and engaged, but right now, someone else was depending on me to get him to the airport safely and on time. My phone buzzed again\u2014messages from both worlds, both demanding my attention. I gripped the wheel tighter, torn between the meeting I couldn\u2019t miss and the passenger I couldn\u2019t let down, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me as the snow kept falling."}
