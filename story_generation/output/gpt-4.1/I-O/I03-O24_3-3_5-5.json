Just us.\u201d My heart aches a little\u2014this is our last weekend before he leaves for months. I promised him we\u2019d make every moment count, no distractions. But as I\u2019m about to leave the courthouse, my clerk rushes in, files in hand. \u201cJudge, the bail hearing just ended. The defendant can\u2019t be released until you draft and sign the order. He\u2019s waiting in custody.\u201d I know the law is clear: the order must be detailed, precise, and immediate. Someone\u2019s freedom depends on my words, and the court expects nothing less than my full attention. But Alex is waiting, bags packed for our getaway, hoping for memories to hold onto while he\u2019s gone. My mind spins between duty and love, the weight of both pressing down. I sit at my desk, pen in hand, torn between the man I love and the oath I swore."}
