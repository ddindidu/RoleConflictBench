My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mia. She\u2019d lost her brother last night, and I could still hear her voice, raw and trembling, asking me to stay on the line. She needed me, needed my words, my comfort. But the intercom crackled, and a passenger\u2019s voice came through, asking for directions to the hospital stop. I glanced at the monitor, saw the anxious face waiting for my answer. My job demanded calm, clear instructions, a steady hand to keep everyone safe. But my heart was with Mia, aching to be there, to say something that might ease her pain. The train sped on, the tunnel lights flickering past, and I felt myself split in two\u2014torn between the duty to hundreds of strangers and the desperate need of the one person I loved most."}
