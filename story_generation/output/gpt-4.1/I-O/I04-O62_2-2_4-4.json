It was Jamie, my best friend, her voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. My flight\u2019s in two hours. Can you check and bring it to me at the airport?\u201d I could hear the desperation in her voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to her. As her friend, I wanted nothing more than to help, to drop everything and race to her rescue.\n\nBut as I hung up, I noticed the broken lane rope floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the class would be thrown into chaos. As the lifeguard, it was my responsibility to make sure everything was safe and ready. The kids and instructors were counting on me.\n\nI stood at the edge of the pool, phone in hand, heart pounding. Jamie needed me, but so did everyone here. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding I put them first."}
