The reading wasn\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed. My phone buzzed\u2014a new delivery assignment. I glanced at the time. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the customer\u2019s address before the window closed. I stuffed the printout into my bag, rehearsing polite greetings in my head. The customer had left a note: \u201cPlease call before you arrive.\u201d I knew how important it was to be courteous, to represent the company well. But as I hurried down the stairs, my thoughts kept circling back to the reading. Should I skim a few more pages before leaving, risking being late and possibly rude? Or should I drop everything and focus on the delivery, knowing my mentor might notice my lack of preparation later?
