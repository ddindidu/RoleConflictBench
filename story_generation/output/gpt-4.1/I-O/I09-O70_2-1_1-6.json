I wrapped it carefully, hoping to make a good impression. As I stepped into the hallway, I saw Mrs. Kim, the neighbor from across the hall, coming toward me. At the same moment, my phone buzzed\u2014a delivery notification. I was on the clock, and the next package was for Mrs. Kim herself. \n\nI hesitated, cake in one hand, package in the other. As her neighbor, I wanted to greet her warmly, introduce myself, and offer the cake. But as her delivery person, I was supposed to be professional, brief, and keep the interaction focused on the delivery. My mind raced\u2014should I hand her the package first, or the cake? Should I introduce myself as her neighbor, or keep it strictly business? I could feel my smile faltering as I tried to balance the friendliness expected of a neighbor with the professionalism required of a delivery person. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both at once, at least not in this moment."}
