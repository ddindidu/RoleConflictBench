She slid into the back seat, sighing, her shoulders tense. I wanted to reach back, squeeze her hand, and ask about her day, to be the boyfriend she needed\u2014someone who listened, who cared. But as a taxi driver, I had to keep things professional, especially with the divider up and the rules about not letting passengers ride up front. My mind raced: should I break protocol and let her sit beside me, maybe even let her eat the snack she pulled from her bag, risking crumbs on the seat? Or should I keep the cab spotless, maintain my reputation, and treat her like any other passenger? I could see her eyes in the rearview mirror, searching for comfort, while I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the man she needed and the driver I was supposed to be."}
