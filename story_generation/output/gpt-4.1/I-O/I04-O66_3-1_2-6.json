My best friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I answered to the sound of her sobs. She could barely speak, her words tumbling out between gasps\u2014her father had just passed away. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there, to offer comfort. But as I sat up, I remembered my other responsibility: my taxi shift started in thirty minutes. I had to get the cab ready, make sure it was spotless for the first customer, and keep up the professional standards my boss expected. My friend\u2019s pain pulled at me, but so did the knowledge that if I didn\u2019t show up, I could lose my job. I gripped the phone, torn between the urge to stay and listen, to be the friend she needed, and the pressure to fulfill my duty as a reliable taxi driver. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in on me."}
