Can you talk?\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to let him vent about his endless meetings and the monotony of his job. I wanted to be there for him, to offer the comfort and understanding a good friend should. But as I typed out a reply, my mind kept drifting back to the tense call I\u2019d just had with opposing counsel. They\u2019d been relentless, pushing for details about my client\u2019s case\u2014details I was bound by law and ethics to protect. The pressure was suffocating; one slip could ruin everything for my client. I felt torn, my friend\u2019s needs pulling me one way, my professional obligations anchoring me in another. I stared at Jamie\u2019s message, guilt gnawing at me for not being fully present, while anxiety about the case twisted in my gut. How could I be the friend Jamie deserved when my mind was consumed by secrets I couldn\u2019t share and responsibilities I couldn\u2019t escape?"}
