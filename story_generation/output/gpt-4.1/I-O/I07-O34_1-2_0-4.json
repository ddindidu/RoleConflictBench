As a colleague, I\u2019m expected to show up, contribute, and keep the camaraderie alive, even if today\u2019s agenda is just a routine catch-up. The meeting will be recorded, but I know my absence will be noticed. My phone buzzes with a reminder, and I sigh, feeling the weight of expectation.\n\nBut out the window, the sky is changing fast. As an air traffic controller, I see the cloud tops rising on the radar, higher than forecasted. Several pilots are already checking in, waiting for revised climb instructions. My headset crackles with their voices, each one relying on me to keep them safe, to make the right call in real time.\n\nMy heart pounds as I hover between screens. My team expects my presence and participation, but the pilots expect my undivided attention and expertise. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure from both sides tightens in my chest. I stare at the blinking cursor, torn, knowing I have to choose which role to let down\u2014at least for now."}
