The team meeting was starting in five minutes, and I was supposed to join in, even if it was just a routine catch-up. My phone buzzed with reminders from my colleagues, and I could already imagine the friendly teasing if I missed it. But as I was about to step away, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few dollars off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still, it was there. Store policy was clear: every discrepancy, no matter how small, had to be reported and investigated immediately. I could hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, stern and unwavering about the rules. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my team down, but if I stayed to sort out the register, I\u2019d be breaking the trust of my colleagues. My hands hovered over the keys, my mind racing, caught between the demands of being a good colleague and a responsible cashier."}
