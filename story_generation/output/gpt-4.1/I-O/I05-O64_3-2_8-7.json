She was about to present her high-stakes project, the one we\u2019d spent weeks preparing for, and she needed a last-minute pep talk. As a mentor, I knew how much my encouragement meant to her\u2014this moment could shape her entire career. But as a cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving, smile, and make each customer feel welcome, especially during the lunch rush when tempers ran short. My manager\u2019s watchful eyes reminded me that any delay could mean complaints. I could hear Maya\u2019s anxious voice in my head, needing reassurance, while the customers in front of me grew restless, expecting quick, friendly service. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to step away and call Maya, knowing I\u2019d let down the people right in front of me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between being the mentor Maya needed and the cashier my customers expected."}
