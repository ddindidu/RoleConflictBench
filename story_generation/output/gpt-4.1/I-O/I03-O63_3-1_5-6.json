My supervisor said we could be flexible today, but I know I\u2019m still expected to stick to my scheduled hours. \n\nBut then I look over at my boyfriend, sprawled on the couch, scrolling through photos of apartments in Berlin. This is our last weekend together before he leaves for months, and he\u2019s been hinting all morning that he wants to go out, maybe take a walk or grab coffee at our favorite spot. I promised him we\u2019d spend real time together, not just sit in the same room while I work. \n\nMy heart twists as I weigh the expectations\u2014be the reliable employee, or the loving girlfriend who makes these last hours count. I can feel his eyes on me, waiting, hoping. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind, but so do his. I stare at my phone, torn, not sure which role I\u2019m supposed to choose."}
