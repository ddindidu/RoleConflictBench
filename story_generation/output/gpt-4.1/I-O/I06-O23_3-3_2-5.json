As a mentee, I owed so much to my mentor\u2014she had guided me through the maze of legal practice, and now she\u2019d entrusted me with a critical research assignment. She needed my report before tomorrow\u2019s upper management evaluation, and I could sense her faith in me riding on this. But as a lawyer, my phone buzzed with reminders: the jury trial was about to begin, and my client\u2019s future depended on my undivided attention. There was no room for delay; the stakes were enormous, and my presence in court was non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I felt toward my mentor and the duty I owed my client. I could feel the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I tried to focus on both tasks, knowing that excelling in one meant risking failure in the other.
