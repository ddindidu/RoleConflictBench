As a judge, I owed it to both parties to review every detail, every argument, to ensure a fair hearing. The final briefs were dense, and the stakes were high\u2014my focus couldn\u2019t waver. But my phone buzzed again. Another message from my colleague in leadership, marked urgent. They needed my confirmation on details for an external partner, and the email had already been sitting in my inbox for over an hour. I knew the team was counting on me to respond quickly, to keep the project moving. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to my colleagues, who expected prompt communication, and the responsibility to the court, which demanded my undivided attention. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, feeling the pressure mount, torn between the immediate needs of my team and the gravity of the case files before me."}
