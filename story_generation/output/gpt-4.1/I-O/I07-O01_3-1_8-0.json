I glanced at the clock; it was already 11:30. But as I opened the building plans to double-check the details, my architect\u2019s eye caught a few minor inconsistencies in the fire exit placements. They weren\u2019t glaring errors, and honestly, they probably wouldn\u2019t cause any immediate issues. Still, my training screamed at me to ensure every detail was safe and compliant. If I flagged the inconsistencies now, it would delay my response and possibly frustrate my team. If I ignored them, I\u2019d be letting my standards as an architect slip, risking safety for the sake of speed. My inbox pinged again, the pressure mounting. I sat at my desk, torn between the urgency of my colleagues\u2019 expectations and the quiet, persistent voice of my professional responsibility."}
