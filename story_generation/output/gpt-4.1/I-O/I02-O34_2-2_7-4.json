We\u2019ve argued about money every night this week, and she\u2019s expecting me to call during my break, to finally talk things through. I know she wants reassurance, a plan, some sign that I\u2019m listening. But right now, I\u2019m staring at the radar, watching cloud tops surge higher than forecasted. Three pilots are waiting for my revised climb instructions, their voices tense over the radio. I can\u2019t afford a mistake\u2014one wrong call and lives are at stake. My headset presses into my ears, the room humming with static and clipped voices. My heart pounds, torn between the urgent blinking of my phone and the blinking lights on my screen. Mia needs me to be present, to fix what\u2019s broken between us. The pilots need me to be precise, to keep them safe. I grip the edge of the console, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
