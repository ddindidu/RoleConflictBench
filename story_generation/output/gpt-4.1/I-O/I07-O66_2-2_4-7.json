My colleague had already messaged, \u201cWill you have it ready by noon? I need it to start my part.\u201d I knew any delay from me would throw off the whole team\u2019s schedule. But my phone buzzed\u2014my taxi app flashing a new ride request. Two travelers, standing outside with a mountain of suitcases, waving at me through the window. They looked desperate, and I knew the route: airport runs were good money, and they\u2019d need help loading all that luggage. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt, courteous, and helpful\u2014especially with travelers splitting a fare. I could see their anxious faces, but my mind was back at my desk, picturing my teammate waiting, the project stalling if I left now. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands: loyalty to my team, or my responsibility to my passengers. The pressure built inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I would let down."}
