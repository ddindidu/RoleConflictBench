The beach was packed, and the tide was higher than usual, making every second of vigilance crucial. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Jamie, my best friend. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with these furniture instructions and about to give up.\u201d I knew Jamie had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there whenever needed. But right now, my job demanded my full attention; even a brief distraction could mean missing someone in trouble. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the duty to keep people safe and the urge to help my friend who was reaching out in frustration. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
