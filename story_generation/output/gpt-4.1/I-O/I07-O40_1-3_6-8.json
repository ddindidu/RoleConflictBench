My phone buzzed with a new email from a colleague\u2014just an update, nothing urgent, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond promptly, show you\u2019re engaged. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. At the same time, my mind kept drifting back to the house I\u2019d just visited, where termite damage had eaten through the main support beam. The homeowners\u2019 anxious faces flashed in my memory; they needed a repair plan, and fast. Every minute I spent at my computer felt like a minute stolen from the urgent work waiting at the house. I could almost hear the wood creaking, the structure weakening. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the expectation to be a reliable colleague and the responsibility to act quickly as a carpenter. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
