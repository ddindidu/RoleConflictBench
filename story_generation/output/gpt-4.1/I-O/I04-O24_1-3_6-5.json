I\u2019m lost.\u201d I know he\u2019s been anxious about our plans, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, especially after last week\u2019s misunderstanding. As a friend, I should reply right now, clear things up, and make sure he feels heard. But in front of me sits a stack of files, and the bail hearing just ended. The defendant\u2019s family waits anxiously outside, and the law is clear\u2014I must draft and sign the release order immediately, with every condition spelled out precisely. If I delay, someone\u2019s freedom hangs in the balance, and the court\u2019s integrity is at stake. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between the duty to my friend and the responsibility of my robe. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can feel my heart race as I wrestle with which role to honor first."}
