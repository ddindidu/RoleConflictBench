My manager had reminded me twice already\u2014this report was the linchpin for our client\u2019s delivery, and any delay would throw the whole project off track. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the workshop: a customer had just arrived, clutching a small, splintered wooden train. The child\u2019s eyes were wide with hope, and the parent asked if I could give a repair quote right away. As a carpenter, I knew how much these toys meant, and I prided myself on being there for customers in moments like this. But as a colleague, I was expected to be at my desk, focused, and reliable. My heart pounded as I looked between the blinking cursor on my screen and the message on my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
