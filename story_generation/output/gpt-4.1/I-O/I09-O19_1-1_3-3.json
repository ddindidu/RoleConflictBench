She looked over and smiled, clearly hoping I\u2019d help her out. As her neighbor, I knew I should be considerate\u2014maybe offer to combine our trash since both bins were half-empty, saving space on the curb and making things easier for her. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my shift at the pharmacy started in fifteen minutes. \n\nWhen I arrived at work, a patient approached the counter, asking about over-the-counter pain relief. I was expected to provide thorough counseling, but my mind kept drifting back to Mrs. Kim and the trash bins. I felt torn\u2014should I have stayed longer to help her, or was it right to rush off to fulfill my professional duties? The expectation to be a good neighbor clashed with my responsibility as a pharmacist. My chest tightened as I tried to focus on the patient\u2019s question, but the weight of both roles pressed down on me, leaving me uncertain about what I should have done."}
