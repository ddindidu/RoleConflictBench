It was Mina, an old acquaintance from college, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby. She was in the area for a meeting and trusted my taste. I could almost hear her voice, expecting a quick, thoughtful reply. I started typing out a suggestion, wanting to be helpful, not wanting to seem distant or uninterested. Just then, a loud beep echoed through the control panel\u2014a critical alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I report and stop the train immediately, no distractions allowed. But Mina\u2019s message lingered on my screen, her trust in me clear. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My fingers hovered over my phone, caught between the urge to help a friend and the duty to ensure the safety of hundreds of passengers. The seconds stretched, my mind racing, as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
