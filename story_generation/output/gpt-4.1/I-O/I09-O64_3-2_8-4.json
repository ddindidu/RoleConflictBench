As a neighbor, I\u2019d promised Mrs. Lee I\u2019d keep an eye on her apartment while she was away. She was worried about her fridge during the planned power outage and asked if I could check her place and let her know if anything seemed off, especially if any packages arrived. I agreed, knowing how much she relies on me for these little things.\n\nBut at the store, my other world took over. I was behind the register when a customer came in, flustered, trying to return a blender without a receipt. Our policy is strict\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. The customer pleaded, saying the power outage ruined the appliance, and she needed the refund to buy groceries. I could feel her desperation, and it reminded me of Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in me to help her out. Yet, as a cashier, I was expected to follow the rules, no exceptions.\n\nStanding there, I felt torn. The urge to help, to bend the rules just a little, clashed with the clear expectations of my job. My mind raced, caught between being the helpful neighbor and the by-the-book cashier, unsure which part of me should win."}
