She was nervous about her big interview tomorrow and wanted to talk through her presentation. As a mentor, I knew how much this moment meant for her career, and I felt the weight of her trust in me. But right now, I was a cashier, and a small line was forming. I smiled at the next customer, scanning their groceries, making small talk about the weather, trying to keep my tone warm and welcoming. My phone buzzed again in my pocket. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s anxious voice, needing reassurance and guidance. I wanted to step away, to give her my full attention, to encourage her and help her grow. But the customers expected quick, friendly service, and my manager was watching from the end of the aisle. My heart pounded as I juggled the competing demands, feeling the tension rise with every beep of the scanner and every vibration from my phone."}
