He gave me a small wave, and I felt the familiar tug to smile and greet him warmly, to show I\u2019m approachable and friendly, just as people expect from an acquaintance. But my mind was still tangled in the memory of my morning shift as a taxi driver. I\u2019d just navigated a tricky construction detour that funneled traffic into a single lane right by a school zone. Kids darted near the curb, and I was hyper-aware of every rule\u2014slowing down, scanning for sudden movement, keeping my hands tight on the wheel. The pressure to keep everyone safe was intense, and I couldn\u2019t let my guard down for a second. Now, as Mark waited for my response, I felt the strain between the warmth expected in this quiet hallway and the lingering vigilance from the road. My body tensed, caught between the urge to be open and the instinct to stay guarded, unsure which role to let guide me in this moment."}
