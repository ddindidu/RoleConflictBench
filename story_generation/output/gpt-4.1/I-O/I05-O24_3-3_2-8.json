My mentee, Sarah, sat in the front row, shadowing me for her law school practicum. She\u2019d asked for guidance on navigating high-stakes moments, and I\u2019d promised to show her how to handle the unexpected with composure and clarity. As I began to deliver the jury instructions\u2014meticulously prepared, rooted in established precedent\u2014my clerk slipped me a note. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was citing. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to halt, reassess, and ensure the law was correctly applied, no matter the disruption. But as a mentor, I felt the weight of Sarah\u2019s expectant gaze, waiting for the steady, structured guidance I\u2019d promised. I could sense her anxiety, her need for reassurance. I was torn\u2014should I pause the proceedings and risk appearing uncertain, or press on and risk misguiding both the jury and my mentee? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the incompatible demands, caught between the duty to uphold the law and the responsibility to guide."}
