As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk it through, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what she expected from me\u2014someone who doesn\u2019t let small issues fester.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a reminder: the safety audit at work. It wasn\u2019t for another month, but as the lead engineer, I was responsible for making sure every document was flawless, every protocol up to date. My manager expected me to be proactive, to never let compliance slip, even if the deadline was far off. I could use this quiet evening to get ahead, to double-check the new safety logs.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I called Mia now, I\u2019d lose my momentum at work. If I focused on the audit, I\u2019d leave her waiting, maybe feeling unimportant. Both roles pulled at me, each demanding my attention, and I sat frozen, torn between the person I loved and the job I took pride in."}
