My mentor had just messaged, squeezing in a quick meeting between back-to-back appointments. I knew how rare this was\u2014she\u2019d made it clear her time was precious, and I was determined to show respect by being prompt and prepared. But as I loaded the last package into my van, my delivery app pinged: the next stop required a signature for a moderately valuable item. The recipient\u2019s address was across town, and the window for delivery overlapped almost exactly with the meeting. Company policy was strict\u2014no signature, no delivery, and I\u2019d be held responsible if anything went wrong. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between my commitment to my mentor and my duty as a delivery person. My mind raced, weighing the consequences of disappointing my mentor against the risk of failing at work. I stared at the clock, anxiety twisting in my stomach, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
