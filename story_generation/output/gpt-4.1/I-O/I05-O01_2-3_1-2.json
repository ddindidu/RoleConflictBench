As an architect, I knew the hospital project demanded my undivided attention\u2014every line and calculation could mean the difference between safety and disaster. The city\u2019s new regulations were strict, and I was expected to double-check every detail before tomorrow\u2019s inspection. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She was struggling with her own project, and I\u2019d promised to guide her through the final stages. She relied on my regular check-ins and honest feedback, and I could hear the anxiety in her voice during our last call. I wanted to be there for her, to help her grow, but the hospital\u2019s safety review loomed over me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect future patients and the commitment to support Maya\u2019s development. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension build, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they deserved at the same time."}
