She was hunched over, shoulders shaking, clearly crying. As an acquaintance, I felt a pull to go over, offer comfort, and show her she wasn\u2019t alone. I knew she\u2019d expect me to be friendly, to listen, maybe even give her a hug. But at the same time, my eyes kept darting back to the pool. One swimmer, a young boy, was floundering near the middle, his strokes growing weaker. As a lifeguard, I was supposed to keep my focus on the water, ready to jump in at any sign of trouble. My supervisor always reminded us: \u201cNever let your attention drift, not even for a second.\u201d I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the supportive friend Sarah needed and the vigilant lifeguard everyone depended on. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between two roles, each demanding my full attention."}
