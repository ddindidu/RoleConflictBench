As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a wall, but this technical hurdle felt like something I should be able to solve on my own. I didn\u2019t want to seem incapable or needy. At the same time, as a software developer, I was getting pinged by QA about a minor UI glitch. It wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could easily work around it\u2014but the expectation was clear: fix bugs quickly, keep the product clean. My inbox was filling up with reminders, but my mind kept circling back to the bigger problem I couldn\u2019t crack. I felt torn\u2014should I admit my struggle to my mentor and risk looking incompetent, or push through and risk letting the bug linger longer than it should? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, unable to decide which expectation to meet first."}
