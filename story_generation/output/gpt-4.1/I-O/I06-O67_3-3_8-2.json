My mentor, Dr. Patel, had carved out this precious hour for our session, squeezing it in just before her flight overseas. She\u2019d made it clear how important it was to her that I show commitment and respect her time. I wanted to make the most of every minute, to prove I valued her guidance. My phone buzzed, and I saw the emergency alert: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported. As the on-call ambulance driver, I was expected to respond immediately\u2014lives depended on my speed. My heart pounded as I looked at Dr. Patel, who was just opening her notebook, and then at my phone, the dispatcher\u2019s voice urgent in my ear. I felt torn in two, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
