The team meeting was about to start, and I knew this one was important\u2014project updates that wouldn\u2019t be recapped later. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show I was part of the team. But just as I was about to join, an email notification popped up: a client had sent over a contract for review. It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, and technically, I had plenty of time before it was due. Still, as the team\u2019s lawyer, I felt the pressure to be thorough and prompt, to get ahead of my workload and reassure the client that their needs were my priority.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down. If I joined the meeting, I\u2019d be distracted, thinking about the contract. If I started reviewing the contract, I\u2019d miss out on critical project details and let my colleagues down. My chest tightened as I hovered between the two, torn by the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
