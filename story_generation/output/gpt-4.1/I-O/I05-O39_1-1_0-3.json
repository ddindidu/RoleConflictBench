The broom leaned against the wall, waiting for me to start the usual sweep-up. My supervisor expected the area spotless, no exceptions. As I reached for the broom, I heard footsteps behind me. It was Jake, the new guy, looking uncertain. \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d he said, voice low. He wanted advice about whether to take a night class that might help him move up, but he was worried about the cost. I knew he looked up to me, and I\u2019d always tried to be there for the younger guys, offering guidance when they needed it. But the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t get the area clean, I\u2019d be letting the crew down\u2014and risking a warning from the boss. My hands tightened on the broom handle as I tried to listen to Jake, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to help him, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility to the team. The seconds slipped by, and I stood there, torn between being the mentor Jake needed and the reliable worker my crew depended on."}
