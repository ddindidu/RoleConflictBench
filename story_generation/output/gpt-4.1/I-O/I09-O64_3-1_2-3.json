She\u2019s my neighbor, always quick with a smile, but today her lips were pressed tight. The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I felt the pressure to be extra friendly, to smooth things over. I asked about her garden, complimented her new scarf, all the while sensing her suspicion\u2014was she wondering if I was the one making noise? I wanted to reassure her, to be the good neighbor everyone expects.\n\nLater, at the store, I slipped into my cashier role. The register was off by a few dollars, nothing major, but store policy is clear: every discrepancy must be reported. As I counted the bills, I realized Mrs. Lee was next in line, her eyes meeting mine. If I reported the error, it might delay her, maybe even embarrass her if she thought I suspected her. But if I let it slide, I\u2019d be breaking the rules. My mind raced, torn between being the friendly neighbor and the responsible cashier, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
