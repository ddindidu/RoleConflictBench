Our last weekend together for a while.\u201d My heart aches a little, knowing how much this means to both of us. I promised we\u2019d have a special evening, just us, before he leaves for months. But as I tuck my phone away, the intercom crackles\u2014my supervisor\u2019s voice reminds me it\u2019s time for the routine pre-departure check. The train isn\u2019t leaving for another hour, and the systems I need to check aren\u2019t critical, but protocol is protocol. I know the city counts on me to keep the subway running safely and on time. If I rush or skip steps, I risk passenger safety and my job. If I take my time, I\u2019ll miss our dinner reservation, and I can already imagine the disappointment in his eyes. My chest tightens as I stand between the train and my phone, torn by the weight of two worlds that refuse to meet."}
