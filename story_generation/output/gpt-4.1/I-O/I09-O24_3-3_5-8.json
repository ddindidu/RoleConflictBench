The HOA inspection was scheduled for tomorrow, and I knew anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, maybe just remind her gently, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the one who complained. I was still mulling it over when, in court, I began instructing the jury. Suddenly, my clerk rushed over, whispering that the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent my instructions relied on. I had to stop, reassess, and ensure I was up to date\u2014my duty as a judge demanded it. My mind raced between the courtroom\u2019s pressure and the neighborly dilemma waiting at home. Both roles expected me to act decisively and responsibly, but I felt paralyzed, torn between the urge to maintain harmony in my building and the obligation to uphold the law in my courtroom."}
