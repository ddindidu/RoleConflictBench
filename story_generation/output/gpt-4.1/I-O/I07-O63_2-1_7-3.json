They needed my input on the new project proposal before they could move forward, and I knew they were waiting for my clarification. As a colleague, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the workflow smooth and show that I valued their time. But my phone kept buzzing with reminders from my telemarketing manager\u2014every call I made brought me closer to smashing my sales target for the week. I was on a roll, and if I kept up this pace, I could finally earn that bonus I\u2019d been chasing for months. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing out the detailed response my team needed and dialing the next number on my call list. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me: the guilt of holding up my colleagues, the thrill and expectation of exceeding my sales goals. My mind raced, caught in the tug-of-war between being a reliable teammate and a top-performing telemarketer, unsure which demand to answer first."}
