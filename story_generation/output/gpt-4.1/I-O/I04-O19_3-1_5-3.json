His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on the highway, miles from home, and he needed me to pick him up right away. My heart raced\u2014I knew how anxious he got in situations like this, and I could hear the desperation in his voice. At the same moment, a customer approached the counter, clutching a bottle of ibuprofen, her face etched with concern. \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me if this is safe with my blood pressure medication?\u201d she asked. As a pharmacist, I knew I had a duty to provide careful, thorough counseling, especially when it came to drug interactions. But Sam was waiting, scared and alone, counting on me to be there for him. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention. My mind raced, caught between the urge to rush to my friend\u2019s side and the responsibility to ensure my patient\u2019s safety."}
