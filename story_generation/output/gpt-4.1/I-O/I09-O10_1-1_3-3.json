As a neighbor, I always tried to be considerate\u2014never overfilling the bins, making sure the lids closed, and waiting until the evening before trash day to put them out. Today, though, the bins were only half-full, and I knew my next-door neighbor, Mrs. Lee, preferred we wait until they were fuller to avoid cluttering the sidewalk. \n\nBut as an accountant, I\u2019d just received an email about a last-minute seminar on upcoming tax law changes. It was scheduled for the same evening, and I knew how important it was to stay updated for my clients\u2019 sake. If I left for the seminar, I\u2019d have to put the bins out early, going against the unspoken agreement with my neighbors. If I waited, I\u2019d miss the seminar and risk falling behind on crucial information. \n\nI felt the tension knotting in my stomach, torn between being the reliable neighbor everyone appreciated and the diligent accountant my clients depended on."}
