But my desk was already covered in spreadsheets and receipts. The quarterly filing deadline was today, and as the accountant, I was responsible for making sure every number matched, every document was in order. If I let the financial records slide, even for an hour, I risked making a costly mistake. But if I ignored the email, I\u2019d be letting my team down, possibly delaying a crucial partnership. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between opening the email and double-checking the last batch of invoices. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed which expectation to meet first, knowing that either choice would leave something undone."}
