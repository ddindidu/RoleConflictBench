The address was only a few blocks away, but the package had arrived later than usual, and I knew the customer would be watching the clock. As I hurried to my bike, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from my boyfriend: \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I could almost hear the fatigue in his words, and my heart ached to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like he always did for me.\n\nBut the package in my bag felt heavier than usual, a silent reminder of my responsibility. My boss had been clear: late deliveries meant complaints, and complaints meant fewer shifts. I wanted to call my boyfriend, to let him know I cared, but I also needed to get this delivery right. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to his side and the pressure to do my job well. I stood on the sidewalk, phone in one hand, package in the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
