Last weekend together!\u201d My heart aches a little\u2014she\u2019s leaving for months, and I promised her this evening would be just for us. But as I look up, the radar blips multiply. The weather\u2019s changing fast; cloud tops are rising, and pilots are calling in, waiting for my instructions. My headset crackles with urgency, and I know every second counts for their safety.
