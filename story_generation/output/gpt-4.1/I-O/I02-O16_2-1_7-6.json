We\u2019d been fighting all week about money\u2014her frustration at my long hours, my defensiveness about our budget. I knew she expected me to call during my lunch break, to apologize, to try and fix things before the tension grew any worse. But just as I reached for my phone, a nurse knocked and ushered in my next patient\u2014a teenager with a sore throat, her mother anxious beside her. As a doctor, I was expected to focus, to listen carefully, to prescribe the right treatment. But my thoughts kept drifting back to Mia, to the look on her face as I left. I felt pulled in two directions: the need to be present for my patient, and the pressure to resolve things with Mia before the day slipped away. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my voice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
