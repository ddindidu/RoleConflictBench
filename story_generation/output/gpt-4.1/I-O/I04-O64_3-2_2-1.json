The line stretched down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently, some glancing at their watches. My manager had already reminded me twice to keep things moving. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down and saw my best friend\u2019s name flashing on the screen. It was 11:30 p.m.\u2014she never called this late. My heart skipped. I answered quietly, and her voice came through, choked with sobs. She could barely get the words out, telling me about the terrible news she\u2019d just received about her family. I wanted to drop everything, to listen, to comfort her, to be the friend she needed right now. But the line in front of me grew restless, and I could feel the weight of their stares, the expectation that I keep their evening moving. My mind raced, torn between the desperate need in my friend\u2019s voice and the responsibility in front of me. I gripped the phone tighter, caught between two worlds, not sure which one I could let down."}
