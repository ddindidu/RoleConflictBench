The prototype for the new project was nowhere near ready, and the stakeholders had just sent another urgent email\u2014approval depended on seeing something tangible by tomorrow. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Sarah, an old acquaintance from another department. She was sitting on a bench, shoulders shaking, tears streaming down her face. Instinctively, I slowed, remembering how we\u2019d always exchanged friendly words in the break room. I knew she\u2019d expect me to stop, to offer comfort, to be that approachable, supportive presence. But every second I spent here was a second stolen from debugging, from designing, from the relentless pressure of my engineering role. My heart twisted with guilt and anxiety, torn between the urge to sit beside her and the knowledge that my team\u2014and the entire project\u2014was counting on me. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from all sides."}
