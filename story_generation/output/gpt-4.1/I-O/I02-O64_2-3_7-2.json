We\u2019d fought about money again\u2014how much I spent, how little I saved. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, apologize, and try to fix things before the day ended. But right now, I was a cashier, and the end-of-shift rush was in full swing. My manager expected me to process every transaction perfectly, especially with these high-value payments. One mistake could mean hours of paperwork or even a write-up. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014probably Mia, wanting to talk. My hands trembled as I handed a customer their change, my mind split between the register and the unresolved tension with her. I felt pulled in two directions: the pressure to be a responsible employee and the need to be a caring boyfriend. The line grew longer, my phone kept buzzing, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding my attention, forcing me to choose which expectation to meet first."}
