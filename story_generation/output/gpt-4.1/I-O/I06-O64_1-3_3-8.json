The holiday rush was in full swing, and the woman in front of me was growing more agitated with every beep, her voice rising as she complained about a coupon that wouldn\u2019t scan. I could feel the eyes of the people behind her, impatient and tired. I forced myself to stay calm, to keep my voice friendly and my smile steady, just as my manager expected.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the email I needed to send my mentor. I had a question about a term in the project brief\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew I was supposed to communicate any confusion right away. My mentor always emphasized openness, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her. Yet, with the chaos around me, I couldn\u2019t find a moment to type out even a quick message. The pressure to be the perfect mentee tugged at me, clashing with the demand to be the ever-patient cashier. My chest tightened as I wondered which expectation I should meet first."}
