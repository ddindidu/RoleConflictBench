My mentor had managed to squeeze in a rare fifteen-minute meeting for me, despite her packed schedule. I knew how much she valued punctuality and preparation, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But as I gathered my notes, the charge nurse called out\u2014one of my patients, Mr. Lee, was in critical condition. His blood pressure had been unstable all morning, and I was responsible for checking his vitals every few minutes. If I left him even briefly, something could go wrong. I felt torn in two directions: the mentee desperate to show respect and gratitude, and the nursing assistant who couldn\u2019t abandon her patient. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations, anxiety tightening in my chest as I stood frozen between the staff room and Mr. Lee\u2019s bedside, unable to move."}
