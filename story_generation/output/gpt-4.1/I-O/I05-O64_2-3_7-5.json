My mentee, Sarah, had just texted, anxious about her big interview tomorrow. She needed guidance, reassurance\u2014my encouragement to help her step into the next phase of her career. As her mentor, I wanted to be present, to listen, to help her believe in herself. But the store manager had just handed me the deposit bag, reminding me of the strict protocol for end-of-shift cash handling. Every bill had to be counted, logged, and double-checked, no shortcuts, no distractions\u2014especially after last month\u2019s audit scare. I could see Sarah waiting by the break room, her eyes searching for me, while the deposit slip and stacks of bills demanded my undivided attention. My phone buzzed again. I felt torn, the urge to support her clashing with the pressure to follow every rule to the letter. My heart raced as I stood between the register and the break room, caught in the impossible space between being the mentor she needed and the cashier the store expected."}
