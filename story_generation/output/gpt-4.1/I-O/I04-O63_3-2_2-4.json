It was almost midnight, and I was behind on my sales target\u2014three more to go, and only an hour left in my shift. I hesitated, but when I saw it was Jamie, I answered. Her voice was shaky, barely more than a whisper, and I could hear her sobbing. She told me her father had just been rushed to the hospital. My heart twisted; Jamie had always been there for me, and now she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be the friend she could lean on.\n\nBut as she spoke, my eyes darted to the clock and the list of potential customers on my screen. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers tonight.\u201d If I didn\u2019t make those sales, I\u2019d miss my bonus and maybe even face a warning. I tried to focus on Jamie\u2019s words, but my mind kept drifting to the calls I still had to make. I wanted to be the friend she deserved, but the pressure to perform at work pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
