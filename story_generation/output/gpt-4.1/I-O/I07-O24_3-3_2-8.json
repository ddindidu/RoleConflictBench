As a colleague, I was expected to contribute, to help shape the outcome, and my absence would be noticed. My phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from my clerk. I was also presiding over a trial, and the jury was waiting for my instructions. The message was clear: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent my instructions relied on. As a judge, I was expected to be up-to-date, to ensure justice was served according to the latest law. My heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t ignore the team, but I couldn\u2019t risk giving outdated instructions to the jury. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I felt the weight of incompatible expectations pressing in, my mind racing as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
