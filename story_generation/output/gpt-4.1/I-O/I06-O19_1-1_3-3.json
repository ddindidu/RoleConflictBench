A patient approached, asking which option would be best for a mild headache. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder to check in with my mentor. I\u2019d been told to communicate any challenges or questions, no matter how small, but the terminology I was unsure about wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out, even for minor things.\u201d \n\nThe patient waited, expecting a thorough answer and reassurance. I felt the weight of my white coat, the responsibility to provide clear, careful counseling. But my mind kept drifting to the message I should send my mentor, wondering if I\u2019d be seen as bothersome for such a minor question. My hands hovered over the pain relief options, my thoughts split between the patient in front of me and the expectation to be a proactive mentee. The pressure built as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
