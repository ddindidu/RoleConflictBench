It\u2019s the last weekend before Mia leaves for her fellowship in Paris, and we\u2019d planned a quiet day together\u2014her favorite brunch spot, a walk by the river, just us. She\u2019s been counting down, and so have I. But as I\u2019m about to leave the hospital, a nurse rushes over. There\u2019s a new patient, a young woman with a baffling mix of symptoms\u2014fever, joint pain, a strange rash. The team is stumped, and they want my input. I know how much it means to Mia that I\u2019m present today, but I also know the weight of my responsibility here. If I leave, I might miss a crucial clue that could help this patient. If I stay, I\u2019ll break a promise to the person I love most. My mind races, torn between the duty of care I owe my patient and the commitment I made to Mia. I feel the pressure mounting, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, and I stand frozen, unable to move in either direction."}
