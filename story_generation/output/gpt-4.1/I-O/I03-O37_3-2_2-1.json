He hadn\u2019t spoken much since the call about his uncle. I wanted to be there for him, to listen, to hold him, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I stroked his shoulder, my gaze drifted to the coffee table\u2014crumbs scattered, a mug ring staining the wood. The kitchen sink was piled with dishes, and dust clung to the baseboards. My mind raced with the list of chores I was supposed to finish today. The agency expected spotless results, and I knew a surprise inspection could happen any time. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. If I left Alex\u2019s side to clean, I\u2019d be abandoning him when he needed me most. But if I stayed, the mess would grow, and I\u2019d risk my job. My heart ached as I weighed the demands, feeling pulled in two directions, unsure which role needed me more."}
