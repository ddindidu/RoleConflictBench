She smiled, but I could see the tension in her eyes. The noise complaint about her apartment had been the talk of our floor all week. As her neighbor, I felt the pressure to be friendly, to keep things light and polite, especially in these awkward moments. She started to apologize, her voice low, and I nodded, offering reassurances that everyone understood\u2014these things happen.\n\nBut as a police officer, I\u2019d just received a summons to testify in court about the very complaint. My duty demanded honesty and fairness, no matter who was involved. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the neighbor who should offer support, and the officer who must uphold the law without bias. My stomach twisted as Mrs. Kim looked at me, searching for some sign of judgment or forgiveness. I smiled, but inside, I was torn, caught between the expectations of kindness and the demands of justice, unsure how I could possibly satisfy both."}
