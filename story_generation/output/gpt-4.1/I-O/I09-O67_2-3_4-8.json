He barked loudly, his voice bouncing off the walls, and I cringed, knowing how much Mrs. Lee next door hated the noise. She\u2019d asked me so many times to keep him quiet, especially at night. I wanted to be a good neighbor, to respect her peace, but my shift as an ambulance driver was about to start, and I barely had time to calm him down before leaving.\n\nLater, rain hammered the windshield as I gripped the steering wheel, the ambulance swaying in the wind. The patient in the back was barely conscious, and every second counted. Dispatch urged me to hurry, but the roads were slick, visibility almost zero. My training screamed at me to slow down, to keep everyone safe, but the paramedic\u2019s anxious voice reminded me of the patient\u2019s fragile pulse. I felt torn\u2014between the neighbor who needed quiet, the patient who needed speed, and the rules that demanded caution. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
