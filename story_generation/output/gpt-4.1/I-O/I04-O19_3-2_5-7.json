It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on the highway. It\u2019s dark, and I\u2019m scared. Can you come get me?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d miss the workshop on the new prescription guidelines, something my manager had stressed was mandatory for all pharmacists. I knew how important it was to stay updated, not just for my job, but for the safety of my patients. But Sam was alone, vulnerable, and counting on me. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities: the expectation to be a reliable friend in a crisis, and the professional demand to keep my knowledge current. I felt my heart pounding, torn between the loyalty I owed Sam and the duty I owed my patients and colleagues. I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to reconcile."}
