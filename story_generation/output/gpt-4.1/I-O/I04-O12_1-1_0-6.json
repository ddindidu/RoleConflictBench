Can I vent for a sec?\u201d I glance at the clock\u20144:57 p.m. I\u2019m still at my desk, staring at the bug report that just came in. The UI glitch isn\u2019t critical, but QA flagged it again, and my manager wants it fixed before tomorrow\u2019s release. I know it\u2019s a quick fix, but I also know Jamie. When she reaches out, she needs someone to listen, not just a quick \u201cthat sucks.\u201d I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I ignore Jamie, I\u2019m a bad friend. If I ignore the bug, I\u2019m a careless developer. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between opening the code editor and typing a supportive reply. My heart pounds as I try to decide which role to step into first, feeling the tension of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
