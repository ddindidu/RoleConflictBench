As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break now\u2014supervisors were lenient today since the call volume was light, but they still expected us to stick to our scheduled times. Yet, as a colleague, I knew our team meeting was about to start. This wasn\u2019t just any meeting; it was the one where crucial project updates would be discussed, updates that wouldn\u2019t be summarized or sent out later. My teammates counted on my input, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But if I skipped my break or shifted it, I risked setting a bad example and possibly getting a warning from my supervisor. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the rules of my telemarketing job. I could feel the pressure mounting, my hands hovering over the keyboard, uncertain which expectation to meet."}
