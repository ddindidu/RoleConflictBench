She\u2019d been struggling with the new data analysis software, and I\u2019d promised to walk her through the final steps before her deadline. My phone buzzed\u2014her anxious message: \u201cAre you free now? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d I started typing a reassuring reply, but the intercom crackled, summoning me back to the control room. A major route closure had just been announced; dozens of flights were now circling, waiting for instructions. My headset felt heavier than usual as I slid it on, the radar screen already a blur of blinking lights. I knew every second counted for those pilots, but I also knew how much my mentee depended on my guidance.
