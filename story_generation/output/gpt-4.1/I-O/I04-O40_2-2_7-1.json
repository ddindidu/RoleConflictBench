I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Jamie, my best friend. The words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me.\u201d My heart dropped. I realized my last text must have come across all wrong. Jamie was clearly hurt, and I knew I should call right away to clear things up, just like we always promised to do\u2014no letting misunderstandings fester.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I looked around at the scattered nails and wood scraps littering the floor. The foreman had just reminded us that a messy site was an accident waiting to happen, and I was already behind on cleanup. If I left it now, someone could trip or get hurt. My hands shook as I weighed the phone in one hand and the broom in the other, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the responsible carpenter my crew depended on. The pressure built in my chest, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose first."}
