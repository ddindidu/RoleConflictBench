My teammate, Priya, had already messaged twice, reminding me that my numbers were due by noon so she could finalize her section. I knew if I missed the deadline, the whole team\u2019s work would be delayed, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But as I reached for my coffee, the radio crackled\u2014another flight requesting a reroute due to the thunderstorm cells rolling in from the west. The radar was a mess of red and yellow, and the handoffs between sectors were coming faster than I could process.
