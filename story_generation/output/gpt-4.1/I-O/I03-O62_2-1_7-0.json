My phone buzzed in my bag below\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money, and I knew he expected me to text back, to resolve things, to show I cared. But my job demanded my full attention; I was supposed to watch every swimmer, every second, no exceptions. A couple of kids drifted toward the deep end, not in danger yet, but I kept my eyes on them. My mind, though, kept drifting back to Alex\u2019s words, the tension in his voice, the way he\u2019d said, \u201cYou never make time for us.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my duty to keep these swimmers safe, and my responsibility to fix things with Alex before the rift grew wider. My heart pounded as I stared at the water, torn between the whistle around my neck and the phone in my bag, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both the girlfriend he needed and the lifeguard these swimmers depended on, not at the same time."}
