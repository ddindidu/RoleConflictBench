They were waiting for my clarification on the new workflow, and I knew the project couldn\u2019t move forward until I replied. At the same time, I was crouched beside the main production unit, tools scattered around me, sweat beading on my forehead. The machine had been down for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s anxious glances made it clear how urgent this repair was. I could almost feel the pressure radiating from both sides: my colleagues needed my input to keep the project on track, but the factory floor was at a standstill until I could diagnose the sensor error. My mind raced, torn between grabbing my phone to type out a quick response and focusing on the tangled mess of wires in front of me. Each second that ticked by seemed to amplify the demands from both roles, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
