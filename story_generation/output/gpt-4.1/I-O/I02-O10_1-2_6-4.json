She\u2019s upset because I forgot about our brunch plans this Saturday, and now she thinks I don\u2019t care. I want to call her, to explain, to fix this before it grows into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does\u2014he listens, he resolves misunderstandings, he makes her feel valued. But my laptop screen is filled with spreadsheets and tax forms, and the quarterly filing deadline is looming. As the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m expected to ensure every number is perfect, every regulation followed. If I mess this up, it\u2019s not just my job on the line\u2014it\u2019s the company\u2019s reputation. My heart pounds as I glance between my phone and the endless rows of figures. I can\u2019t focus on both at once. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, and I don\u2019t know which role to answer first."}
