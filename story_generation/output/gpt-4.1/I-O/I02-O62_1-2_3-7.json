We picked tonight because the pool was usually quiet, and I could keep an eye on things while still being with her. She smiled, her hand brushing mine as we walked along the poolside, talking about everything and nothing. I wanted to give her my full attention, to make her feel special, like she was the only person in the world.\n\nBut then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a group of teenagers laughing and daring each other to dive off the shallow end, right next to the big, bold \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My training kicked in immediately\u2014someone could get hurt, and it was my job to stop it. But Mia was mid-sentence, her eyes searching mine for a response, expecting me to be present, to listen, to care. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the duty to keep everyone safe and the promise I\u2019d made to Mia for an uninterrupted evening together."}
