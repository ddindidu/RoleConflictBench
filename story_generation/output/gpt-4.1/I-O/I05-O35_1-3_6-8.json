She was overwhelmed, deadlines piling up, and she needed advice. As her mentor, I felt a responsibility to guide her, to help her untangle her schedule and encourage her growth. But just as I started to type a supportive reply, the cabin door slid open. My supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp\u2014an unannounced audit. My heart thudded. As a subway operator, I was expected to be flawless: every protocol followed, every announcement precise, every second accounted for. I tucked my phone away, but my mind raced.
