As the architect, I know every inch must serve a purpose\u2014each workspace needs to be functional, comfortable, and efficient. My mind races with possibilities, calculating square footage and natural light angles. But a small question nags at me, a term in the project brief I\u2019m not entirely sure about. As a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to communicate any challenges or uncertainties to my mentor right away. Yet, this question isn\u2019t blocking my progress; I can keep designing for now. Still, I hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that even minor misunderstandings can snowball later. If I pause to reach out, I\u2019ll break my creative flow and lose precious time on the floor plan. If I don\u2019t, I risk missing an important detail. The expectations tug at me from both sides\u2014be proactive and transparent, but also deliver a flawless, functional design. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between sending a quick message and pushing forward with my work, the tension between my roles tightening in my chest."}
