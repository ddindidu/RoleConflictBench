The line of customers was growing, and I knew I had to stay sharp\u2014every bill, every coin, every receipt had to be perfect, especially now, at the end of my shift when the drawer would be counted. My manager expected nothing less than flawless accuracy, and I could already feel my pulse quicken with the pressure.\n\nBut just as I handed a customer their change, I caught sight of Jamie, my mentee, lingering by the break room door. She looked frazzled, clutching her planner, eyes darting between her phone and the clock. I remembered our last check-in, how she\u2019d admitted to feeling overwhelmed, struggling to juggle her coursework and her hours here. As her mentor, I was supposed to help her grow, to encourage her, to be present and supportive. She needed guidance, maybe just a few words to help her breathe easier.\n\nYet, the register beeped insistently, and the line didn\u2019t shrink. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014toward the numbers in my till and the anxious face of someone counting on me for more than just change."}
