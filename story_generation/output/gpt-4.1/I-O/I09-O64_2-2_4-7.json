Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, had already left a note on my door last week, politely asking me to keep my dog quiet in the hallway, especially during the day when she worked from home. I felt guilty every time I heard the barking echo, knowing I was supposed to be a considerate neighbor and respect our shared spaces. But today, I had no time to calm my dog before heading out\u2014I was already late for work.\n\nAt the store, the lunch rush was in full swing. The line stretched past the bakery, and I forced a smile for every customer, greeting them warmly and making small talk, even as my mind wandered back to my apartment. Was my dog still barking? Was Mrs. Lee trying to take a call? The expectation to be friendly and attentive as a cashier clashed with the nagging worry that I was failing as a neighbor. My heart pounded as I scanned groceries, torn between the demands of both roles, unsure which one I was letting down more."}
