I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend, Jamie, had replied to my earlier text, but the message was curt and hurt. I realized instantly that my joke hadn\u2019t landed, and now Jamie thought I was upset with him. I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. But the foreman\u2019s voice cut through the chaos, shouting for everyone to drop their tools and head to the muster point. Site rules were strict: no calls, no delays, just move. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need to reassure my friend and the non-negotiable demand to follow safety protocols. I could already feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, my hand frozen between my pocket and my hard hat, as the crowd surged toward the exit."}
