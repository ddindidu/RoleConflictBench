My girlfriend\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about her uncle\u2019s passing, and I could hear the pain in every word. She needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my arms around her. I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and rush to her side, to be the boyfriend she deserved in this moment of heartbreak.\n\nBut I was in the middle of my shift as a housekeeping cleaner, standing in a client\u2019s kitchen, staring at an empty bottle of the specialized cleaner I needed for the next job. My supervisor had made it clear: no substitutions, no excuses. The client expected everything spotless, and I was responsible for managing supplies. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking my job.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, torn between the desperate need in my girlfriend\u2019s voice and the professional duty pressing down on me.
