It was Mark, someone I knew from the gym, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for his anniversary dinner. He sounded a bit desperate\u2014he wanted it to be special, and I could tell he was counting on me. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help, maybe even call a place to get him a reservation. But the lab was tense; the safety audit was in an hour, and I\u2019d already been warned about a couple of minor equipment issues. As the scientist in charge, I was expected to make sure everything was perfect, to keep my focus on safety and protocol. My mind raced, torn between wanting to be helpful and friendly, and knowing that even a few minutes away from the lab could mean missing something crucial. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
