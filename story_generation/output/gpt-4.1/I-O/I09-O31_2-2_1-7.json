That morning, I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I saw them. As I stepped outside, cake in hand, I noticed a commotion at the corner\u2014two cars had bumped into each other, and the drivers were arguing. Instinctively, I walked over, my badge tucked away but my sense of duty sharp. One of the drivers was Mrs. Kim, the woman who lived next door, whom I\u2019d hoped to greet with a smile and a slice of cake. She looked at me, relief and expectation in her eyes, clearly hoping I\u2019d take her side. The other driver, a stranger, eyed me warily, perhaps sensing my connection to Mrs. Kim. I felt the weight of my uniform, invisible but heavy, pressing against the warmth of neighborly intentions. I wanted to be friendly, to reassure Mrs. Kim, but I also knew I had to be fair, to listen to both sides impartially. My heart pounded as I stood between them, cake growing heavier in my hand, torn between kindness and duty, unsure which role I should let guide me."}
