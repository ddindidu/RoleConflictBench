Glancing at the screen, I saw it was Jamie, my best friend. I hesitated, but answered quietly, \u201cHey, Jamie, what\u2019s up?\u201d Her voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Alex. I really need you right now.\u201d I could hear her sniffling, and my heart ached to be there for her, to listen and comfort her like I always do. But as I looked through the glass, I saw Mrs. Lee waiting, her chart reminding me that her vitals were overdue. I knew the nurses and doctors depended on my timely reports to keep patients safe. My mind raced\u2014if I stayed on the phone, I\u2019d be letting my team and Mrs. Lee down. If I hung up, I\u2019d be abandoning Jamie when she needed me most. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the nursing assistant my patient depended on."}
