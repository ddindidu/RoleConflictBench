She\u2019d asked me to keep an eye out while she was away, especially with the power outage scheduled for tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d check her fridge and make sure nothing spoiled, and I meant it\u2014she\u2019s always been a good neighbor, watering my plants when I\u2019m gone. But as I glanced at my phone, the sales dashboard flashed: I was just a few calls away from crushing my monthly quota. Management had been clear\u2014this was the week to push, to prove myself. Every minute spent away from my headset felt like a missed opportunity, a potential sale slipping through my fingers. Yet, the thought of Mrs. Kim\u2019s food spoiling, or her packages sitting in the dark, gnawed at me. I could hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to stay focused, but I also remembered Mrs. Kim\u2019s grateful smile. My hands hovered between the phone and her spare keys, heart pounding as I weighed which responsibility to answer first."}
