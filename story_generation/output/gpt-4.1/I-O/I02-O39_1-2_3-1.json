I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smile, picturing her excitement, but my hands are already rough from hauling lumber since dawn. The foreman\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, \u201cHey, the carpenter\u2019s waiting! We need that lumber now!\u201d I wipe sweat from my brow, feeling the weight of the boards and the weight of her expectations. Mia wants us to pick a night, to finally have that uninterrupted evening together. She\u2019s been patient, always understanding when I\u2019m late or too tired, but I know she\u2019s hoping for more this time. At the same moment, I see the carpenter tapping his foot, tools in hand, waiting for me to keep the job moving. If I slow down, the whole crew feels it. My phone buzzes again in my pocket, but my gloves are caked with dust. I stand there, torn, the demands of the site and the hope in Mia\u2019s message pulling me in opposite directions."}
