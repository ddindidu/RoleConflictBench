My girlfriend, Emma, was in the passenger seat, her eyes red from crying. She\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback she got at work, and I could see how much it hurt her. I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to tell her everything would be okay, to just be her boyfriend right now.\n\nBut as I pulled up to a familiar street, I spotted a car parked illegally. It was a minor infraction, and I knew the owner\u2014a single mom who always struggled to make ends meet. My duty as a police officer was clear: act with integrity, treat everyone fairly, and issue the ticket. But Emma looked at me, silently pleading for a moment of kindness, maybe hoping I\u2019d let it slide just this once. I felt torn, the weight of my badge and her trust pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I reached for my ticket book, caught between the man I loved being for her and the officer I was sworn to be."}
