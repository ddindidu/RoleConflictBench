My phone buzzes again\u2014another message from Mia. She\u2019s upset because I forgot about our brunch plans this weekend, and now she thinks I don\u2019t care. I know I should call her, talk it out, reassure her that she matters more than any calendar mix-up. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does: resolves conflicts, listens, makes things right. But the financial records in front of me demand my full attention. If I make a mistake, it could mean hours of extra work, or worse, a reprimand from my boss. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014Mia\u2019s need for reassurance and my responsibility to keep these records flawless. I can\u2019t do both at once, but both feel urgent, both feel important.
