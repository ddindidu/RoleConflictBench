As a police officer, I knew my duty was clear: testify truthfully, uphold the law, act with unwavering integrity. But as a mentor, things were never so black and white. Just last week, one of my mentees, Jamie, had come to me for advice about a minor career move. I\u2019d given my usual casual guidance, not realizing it would tie into a case now under scrutiny. Jamie\u2019s decision, influenced by my words, had become a point of contention in the investigation. Now, I was expected to provide testimony that could impact Jamie\u2019s future. The department expected me to be impartial, but Jamie looked to me for support and understanding. My stomach twisted as I thought about the conflicting demands: the badge on my chest, the trust in Jamie\u2019s eyes. I wanted to do right by both, but the path forward felt impossibly narrow. The courtroom loomed ahead, and I was caught between the roles I\u2019d chosen and the people who depended on me."}
