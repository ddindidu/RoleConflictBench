She was waiting for my advice on whether to accept a new position\u2014one that could change her entire career path. She trusted me to help her weigh the risks, to offer the kind of structured, thoughtful guidance that had shaped my own journey. But just as I started to type a response, I noticed the patient\u2019s chart: his temperature and pulse were creeping up, not dangerously high, but enough to warrant close monitoring. My supervisor expected me to be thorough, to record every detail and alert the nurse if anything changed. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my mentee needed me now, but so did my patient. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide a future nurse and the immediate duty to care for someone vulnerable. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect."}
