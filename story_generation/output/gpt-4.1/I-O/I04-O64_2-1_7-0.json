I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Jamie, my best friend. The words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me.\u201d My heart dropped. I realized Jamie had misunderstood the joke in my earlier text. I knew I should call right away, explain my tone, and clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate openly, fix things before they fester.\n\nBut I was at work, and even though it was a slow afternoon, there were still a few customers waiting in line. As a cashier, I was expected to stay focused, process transactions accurately, and not get distracted by personal matters. My manager was nearby, watching. I could feel the pressure from both sides\u2014my friend needed me, but so did my job. My hands trembled as I handed a receipt to the customer, my mind racing. Should I step away and call Jamie, risking trouble at work, or stay at my post and let my friend think I didn\u2019t care? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between them."}
