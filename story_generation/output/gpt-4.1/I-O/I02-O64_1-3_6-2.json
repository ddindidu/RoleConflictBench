A string of messages from Mia flashes on the screen, her words sharp with disappointment. She thought I\u2019d promised Saturday for her, but I\u2019d picked up an extra shift. I want to call her, to explain, to smooth things over before the misunderstanding grows. But the line at my register is long, and the end-of-shift transactions are piling up\u2014hundreds of dollars in cash, credit slips, and receipts that need to be counted and logged with absolute precision. My manager expects no errors, especially now, when the store is busy and mistakes could mean hours of reconciliation. My hands tremble as I scan items, my mind split between Mia\u2019s hurt and the numbers blurring on the screen. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mia\u2019s need for reassurance, my duty to keep the register flawless. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure builds as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
