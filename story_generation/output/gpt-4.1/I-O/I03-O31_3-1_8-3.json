I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My heart pounded, the words echoing in my mind as I laced up my shoes for my shift at the gym. As a police officer, I was expected to keep myself in top shape, ready for anything. But as a girlfriend, I was supposed to be present, to resolve conflicts, to fight for us when things got tough. Now, our argument had spiraled out of control, and he was questioning if we should even stay together. I knew I should go to him, talk things through, try to fix what was breaking. But duty called\u2014I had to be at the gym, to train, to be the protector my badge demanded. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the uniform in my closet and the love slipping through my fingers."}
