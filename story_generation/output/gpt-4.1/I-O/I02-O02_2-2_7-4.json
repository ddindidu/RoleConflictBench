The updated safety standard was non-negotiable; if I didn\u2019t gather the evidence and update the documentation before tomorrow\u2019s review, the release would be delayed, and the whole team would be on the line. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia. We\u2019d argued three times this week about our finances, and I knew she was waiting for me to call, to talk things through, to show her that I cared enough to resolve it. I could almost hear her voice, frustrated but hopeful, expecting me to step up as her partner. But the clock was ticking, and my mind kept drifting back to the checklist, the risk of missing something critical. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my team counting on me to get this right, Mia needing me to be present and supportive. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of the job I loved and the person I loved even more."}
