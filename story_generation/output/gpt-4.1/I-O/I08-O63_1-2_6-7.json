My scheduled ten-minute break had just started, and I knew management was watching every second. The phone queue was packed, and I could almost feel the pressure to get back to my desk early. But I wasn\u2019t alone\u2014three coworkers, all acquaintances, were gathered around the table, whispering about a recent decision made by our mutual colleague, Sarah. They looked at me, expecting me to join in, maybe share my own thoughts or inside information. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but their expectant faces made it hard to stay silent. At the same time, I was painfully aware that if I cut my break short to escape the conversation, management would notice and possibly reprimand me for not following the strict schedule. My stomach twisted as I weighed the pressure to fit in with the group against the rules of my job, feeling trapped between two sets of expectations that seemed impossible to satisfy."}
