I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My heart pounded. Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. I knew I had to call her, to try and fix things, to be the boyfriend she needed\u2014someone who could resolve conflicts, not run from them. But just as I reached for her contact, my work phone buzzed. Another lead. Another potential sale. I was already ahead of my sales quota for the week, but management\u2019s expectations were clear: keep pushing, keep closing, don\u2019t let up. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that top performers never slow down. My thumb hovered between the two calls, my mind torn. If I called her, I\u2019d lose precious time and maybe a big sale. If I made the sale, I might lose her for good. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the boyfriend who fixes things and the telemarketer who never lets an opportunity slip away."}
