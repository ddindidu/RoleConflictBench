The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate and not make her feel unwelcome, but I also worry about the safety and the rules we all agreed to follow. I hesitated at her door, rehearsing how to gently bring it up.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the hospital. Mr. Lee, my patient, had just received news of his chronic illness. His daughter was anxious, asking if I could come by and explain the treatment plan. As a doctor, I know how much clarity and compassion matter in these moments. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the neighbor who should address a safety issue delicately, and the doctor who must be present and empathetic for a family in distress. My mind raced, torn between the corridor and the hospital, between being a good neighbor and a good doctor, unsure which need should come first."}
