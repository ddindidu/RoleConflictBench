As a colleague, I was expected to be present\u2014this was the final discussion before our project\u2019s direction was set. My team counted on my input, and missing it would mean letting them down. But as I glanced at the back seat of my cab, my heart sank. A passenger had just spilled coffee everywhere, and the next fare was already waiting outside. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless and providing a professional experience. If I let the next passenger in now, I\u2019d risk a complaint and a bad rating. If I took time to clean, I\u2019d miss the meeting. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my two worlds. Both roles expected my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t give it to both at once. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of incompatible expectations pressing in, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
