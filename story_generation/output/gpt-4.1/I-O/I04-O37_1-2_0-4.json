It was Mia, my best friend, texting, \u201cUgh, today was endless. I just need someone to talk to.\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But as I glanced at the cleaning cart, I noticed the floor cleaner was nearly empty. My client, Mrs. Patel, expected everything spotless for her next visit, and I was responsible for making sure all supplies were stocked. If I didn\u2019t act now, I might forget, and that would mean letting her down. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014Mia\u2019s need for comfort, Mrs. Patel\u2019s trust in my reliability. My thumb hovered over my phone, torn between sending a supportive reply and rushing to jot down a supply list before I forgot. The pressure built inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood there, caught between being a good friend and a responsible cleaner, unsure which demand to answer first."}
