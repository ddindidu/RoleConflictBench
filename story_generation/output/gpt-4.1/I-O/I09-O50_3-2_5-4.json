The HOA inspection was tomorrow, and I knew anything blocking the hallway could get us all in trouble. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, maybe remind her gently or even help her move the stuff. But my phone buzzed: a message from work. Three machines in the shop were running hot, overdue for maintenance. If I didn\u2019t get there soon, we risked a breakdown, maybe even a fire. My boss expected me to drop everything and get those machines cleaned and serviced immediately. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn. If I left now, the corridor would stay blocked, and we\u2019d all face fines or worse. If I stayed to help, the machines could fail, and I\u2019d be letting down my team. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with real consequences. I hesitated, heart pounding, caught between being a good neighbor and a responsible repairer, unsure which demand to answer first."}
