As a delivery person, I knew the drill: leave the package at the doorstep, snap a photo, and move on. But as a neighbor, I also knew the HOA was doing their inspection today, and anything left in the corridor\u2014even for a few minutes\u2014could get cited for blocking the emergency exit. I glanced at the empty hallway, picturing the stern notices that would follow if the inspector saw this box. But if I didn\u2019t leave the package, I\u2019d fail my delivery, and the customer would complain. My mind raced with the expectations: my job demanded proof of delivery, but my role as a neighbor urged me to keep the hallway clear and avoid trouble for everyone. I stood there, package in hand, heart pounding, torn between doing what was right for my neighbor and what was required for my job."}
