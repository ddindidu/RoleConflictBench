As her friend, I wanted to clear things up, to be there for her, to make sure she didn\u2019t feel lost or forgotten. But right in front of me, my client was waiting, hair damp with sweat from her gym session, looking expectantly at me. As her hairdresser, I was supposed to wash and condition her hair before starting the cut, no distractions, no delays. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottle, but my mind was split. If I paused to text Mia, I\u2019d be neglecting my client\u2019s experience and professionalism. If I focused on my client, Mia might get frustrated or feel like I was ignoring her. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, caught in the impossible space between being a good friend and a dedicated hairdresser."}
