As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to sit beside her, offer comfort, and just listen\u2014she clearly needed someone to talk to. But as I glanced over at the filtration system, I noticed the warning light blinking red. My training as a lifeguard kicked in; I knew that if the system failed, the water could become unsafe for everyone in the pool. I was expected to act fast, check the equipment, and possibly close the pool until it was fixed. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the supportive friend Jamie needed and fulfilling my duty to keep everyone safe.

The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
