I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smiled, picturing her excitement. We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and I knew how much she valued our time together. I wanted to make it special, to show her she was my priority. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard a soft cough from the exam room. My next patient, a young woman with a sore throat, waited for me. I scanned her chart\u2014classic strep symptoms. She looked anxious, hoping for quick relief. I knew she expected me to listen carefully, prescribe the right medication, and reassure her.\n\nAs I washed my hands, my mind tugged in two directions. Mia\u2019s hopeful message replayed in my head, but so did the patient\u2019s need for my full attention.
