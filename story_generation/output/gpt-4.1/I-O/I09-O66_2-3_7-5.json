As I passed Mrs. Kim\u2019s door, I remembered the storm advisory. She\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I know she relies on neighbors for small things\u2014like checking in or making sure she\u2019s safe during emergencies. I hesitated, thinking I should knock and offer to help if the power went out, but my phone buzzed: a ride request, and I was already running late.\n\nMinutes later, behind the wheel, rain started to fall. My route took me through a school zone, where kids in bright raincoats clustered near the curb, the road narrowed by orange cones and flashing signs. I felt the pressure to drive carefully, to obey every law, especially with children so close. But my mind kept drifting back to Mrs. Kim, alone in the storm, maybe needing help. I gripped the wheel, torn between the responsibility to my passengers and the silent expectation from my neighbor. The weight of both roles pressed on me as I slowed for the school zone, heart pounding, unsure which duty should come first."}
