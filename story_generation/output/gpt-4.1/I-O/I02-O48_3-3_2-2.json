She needed me\u2014her texts were raw, full of pain after her brother\u2019s sudden passing. I could almost hear her crying, and I knew she expected me to be there, to hold her, to listen, to help her through the worst days of her life. But just as I started to type a reply, the call light blinked for Mr. Harris in room 204. He was struggling again, his arthritis flaring so badly he could barely lift his spoon. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be at his side, helping him eat, making sure he felt cared for and not alone in his pain. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward Emily, who needed my comfort, and toward Mr. Harris, who depended on my hands. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, the guilt of possibly letting one down if I chose the other. My mind raced, torn between love and duty, as I stood frozen, unable to move."}
