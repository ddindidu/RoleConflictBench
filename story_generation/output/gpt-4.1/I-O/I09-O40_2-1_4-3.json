I knew Mrs. Lee from next door would be annoyed\u2014she\u2019d already mentioned how the noise startled her when she passed our shared door. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, maybe even keep my dog inside or train him better, but my mind was already tangled with the new furniture order that had just come in. The client wanted a custom oak bookshelf, and I needed to estimate the materials and place the order before the supplier\u2019s deadline. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount.

The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, standing in the middle of my workshop, uncertain which role to answer first."}
