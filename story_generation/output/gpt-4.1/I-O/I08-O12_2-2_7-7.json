No wonder users are complaining.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but Mark\u2019s words hung in the air, almost demanding a response. At the same time, my phone buzzed with notifications\u2014another round of bug reports from users, all pointing to the same intermittent errors that had been plaguing the system since yesterday. As a software developer, I knew I needed to focus, troubleshoot, and fix these issues quickly. But Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting me to join in or at least acknowledge his comment. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: the urge to maintain a positive, respectful atmosphere, and the professional demand to address the technical crisis. My mind raced, torn between the need to uphold my values as an acquaintance and the responsibility to dive back into the code as a developer."}
