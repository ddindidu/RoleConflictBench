I can see the excitement in her eyes, and I know how much it means to her that we spend this time together. But as I\u2019m getting ready, my phone buzzes: the clerk has just delivered a case file to my chambers. It\u2019s for a procedural hearing in two weeks, nothing complicated, but the chief judge expects us to be meticulous, to never let anything slip through the cracks. I know I should at least skim the file tonight, get a sense of the issues, so I\u2019m not caught off guard later. The weight of both expectations presses on me\u2014Mia\u2019s hope for a perfect evening, the court\u2019s demand for diligence.
