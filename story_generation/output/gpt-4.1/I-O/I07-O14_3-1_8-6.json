As a colleague, I knew leadership was waiting for my reply\u2014an external partner needed confirmation on a project timeline, and I was the point of contact. The email had come in just as I was about to start the routine maintenance checklist for the centrifuge, a task I took seriously as a scientist. Safety protocols were non-negotiable, and while there hadn\u2019t been any malfunctions, the checklist was due soon. My phone buzzed again, a reminder from the lab manager about the importance of timely equipment checks. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I delayed my email response, I risked letting down my team and possibly jeopardizing the partnership. But if I put off the maintenance, I\u2019d be cutting corners on lab safety, something I prided myself on never doing. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the quiet, persistent responsibility of my scientific role."}
