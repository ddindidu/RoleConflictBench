In ten minutes, our team meeting would start\u2014one of those rare ones where the manager promised to share project updates that wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about the team\u2019s progress. But right in front of me sat my next client, hair damp and greasy from a gym session, waiting for a wash and cut. As a hairdresser, I knew I couldn\u2019t skip the wash; it was part of the service, and she\u2019d expect to leave feeling fresh and confident. My phone buzzed with a meeting reminder. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the duty to my team and the promise I\u2019d made to my client. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could sense the disappointment that would follow whichever expectation I failed to meet. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the shampoo, my mind racing with the impossible choice ahead."}
