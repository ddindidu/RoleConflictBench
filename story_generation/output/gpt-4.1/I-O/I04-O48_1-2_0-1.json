I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Jamie: \u201cUgh, today\u2019s been endless. Can you talk?\u201d I knew she needed me to listen, to be the friend who always made time, who never brushed her off. But Mr. Carter was struggling, his hand trembling as he tried to pull on his hospital gown. I could see the frustration in his eyes, and I knew he was counting on me to be patient, gentle, and attentive. My mind raced\u2014if I replied to Jamie, I\u2019d be distracted from my patient, but if I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed support. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing there with my phone in one hand and Mr. Carter\u2019s sleeve in the other, caught between being the friend Jamie needed and the nursing assistant Mr. Carter depended on."}
