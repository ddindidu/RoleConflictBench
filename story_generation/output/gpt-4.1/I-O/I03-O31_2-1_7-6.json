The car parked in front of me belonged to Alex\u2014my boyfriend. We\u2019d argued all week about money, about how I never seemed to understand his struggles. Now, here I was, in uniform, expected to act with integrity and fairness, to treat everyone the same. But as his girlfriend, I was supposed to help resolve our conflicts, not make things worse. If I gave him the ticket, it would only add fuel to our arguments. If I let it slide, I\u2019d be betraying my duty as a police officer. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between the person I loved and the oath I\u2019d sworn."}
