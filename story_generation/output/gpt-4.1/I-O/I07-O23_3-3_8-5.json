Leadership needed my confirmation on a contract detail for an external partner, and they were waiting for my reply to move forward. As a colleague, I knew how important it was to be responsive, to keep the workflow smooth and show that I was reliable. But my briefcase was already packed, and the courthouse was only a few blocks away. In less than an hour, I\u2019d be standing before a jury, representing a client whose future depended on my focus and preparation. The trial was high-stakes, and any distraction could cost dearly. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my colleagues and the gravity of my duty as a lawyer. I felt the pressure mounting, my inbox pinging while my heart pounded with the weight of responsibility. I glanced at the clock, knowing I had to choose where to direct my attention, but unable to silence the anxiety of letting someone down, no matter what I decided."}
