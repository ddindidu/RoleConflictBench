Safety is everything here\u2014one missed check, and someone could get hurt. As I reached for my toolbox, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my closest friend. His voice trembled, barely holding back tears. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d he said, mentioning a fight with his partner. I could hear the pain in his words, and I knew he expected me to listen, to be there for him like I always am.\n\nBut my hands were already on the drill, and I hadn\u2019t checked the blade on the saw yet. If I put this off, I\u2019d be risking not just my own safety, but everyone\u2019s on site. My mind raced\u2014Sam needed me, but so did my crew. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, wishing I could split myself in two. The weight of both roles settled on my shoulders as I stood there, phone in one hand, wrench in the other, caught between being the friend Sam needed and the carpenter my team depended on."}
