My mind kept drifting back to the spreadsheet I\u2019d left open on my desk at the station. The team was counting on me to finish the quarterly report, and even though the deadline wasn\u2019t for another week, I knew my colleagues expected me to keep things moving smoothly. I prided myself on being reliable, the one who never let the team down.\n\nBut now, as the shift change approached, I was behind the wheel of the ambulance, responsible for getting it safely to the satellite location. The roads were slick from a sudden rain, and I could feel the tension in my shoulders. I wanted to pull over, open my laptop, and knock out a few more lines of data\u2014just to ease the pressure from work. But I also knew that my duty as a driver was to focus entirely on the road, to ensure the vehicle and everyone around me stayed safe.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and the responsibility of the road."}
