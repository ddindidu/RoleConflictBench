My phone buzzes with another message from her\u2014she\u2019s still upset about our argument last night, the third one this week about money. As a boyfriend, I know I should go to her, talk things through, and try to resolve the tension between us. She expects me to listen, to help us find a way forward. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I see the mess piling up, the neglected chores that are my responsibility. The agency expects spotless results, and I know if I let things slide, I\u2019ll get complaints. My mind races, torn between grabbing the mop or sitting down with her to talk. Each role pulls at me, demanding my full attention, and I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in. I can\u2019t seem to do right by either, and the stress knots in my stomach as I stand frozen, unsure which role to answer first."}
