She kept texting me ideas for our date: a new restaurant, a movie, maybe just a walk in the park. I could hear the excitement in her voice, and I wanted to make it special, to show her she\u2019s my priority. But as I stood on the construction site, sweat trickling down my back, my mind was split. I was scanning the area, making sure everything was in order, when I noticed a coworker heading straight under a suspended load. My heart jumped into my throat. I knew I had to act fast, shout, do something\u2014safety was on me, and one mistake could mean disaster. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014her name lighting up the screen, probably asking about tonight. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on me, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either down, but realizing I might have to choose which role to answer first."}
