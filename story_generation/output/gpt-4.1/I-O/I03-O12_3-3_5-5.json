Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the last weekend before he leaves for months, and I promised we\u2019d make every moment count. But my laptop pings again\u2014Slack messages piling up, architects from three teams waiting for my input. The launch date was just moved up, and everyone\u2019s blocked until I help define the new features. My manager\u2019s email is clear: \u201cWe need your decisions ASAP.\u201d I feel my chest tighten. I want to be present, to hold his hand and laugh over coffee, to make memories before he goes. But I also know the team is counting on me, and any delay could ripple through the project. My mind races, torn between the warmth of his smile and the cold urgency of deadlines. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both need me now."}
