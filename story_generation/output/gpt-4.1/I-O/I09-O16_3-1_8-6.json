She was traveling for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her package, especially since the building\u2019s power would be out for a day. I\u2019d promised her I would, knowing how much she worried about her deliveries. As I walked to the clinic, my mind was already on my first patient\u2014a young woman with a sore throat and fever, likely strep. She needed a careful exam and the right prescription, and I knew my attention had to be undivided. But as I sat down with her, my phone buzzed: a delivery alert for Mrs. Kim\u2019s package, scheduled to arrive during my shift. I felt a knot in my stomach. My neighbor was counting on me, but my patient needed my focus. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
