She\u2019s staring at her reflection, lips pressed tight, and I can sense her disappointment even before she says a word. I know I need to check in, ask her what\u2019s wrong, and fix it\u2014her satisfaction is everything, especially for a new client. But then I glance at my phone and see a message from my friend, who\u2019s clearly confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet after my shift. We\u2019ve had a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be clear this time, to avoid any more misunderstandings. My hands freeze, brush hovering over the foil. I can\u2019t step away from my client now, not when she needs reassurance, but if I don\u2019t reply to my friend immediately, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m ignoring her again. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel my heart race as I try to figure out who needs me more in this moment."}
