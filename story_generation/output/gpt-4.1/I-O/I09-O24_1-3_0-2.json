The courthouse was only a few blocks away, but every minute counted; I needed to review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. As I rounded the corner, I nearly collided with Mrs. Patel, my neighbor from across the hall. She smiled warmly, her arms full of groceries. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she said, her eyes expectant, waiting for the usual friendly exchange. I knew she valued these brief moments of neighborly connection, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or dismissive. But the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus, not with someone\u2019s safety possibly at stake. I forced a smile, feeling the tension between the polite neighbor I was expected to be and the impartial, diligent judge I had to become. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between offering a few kind words and rushing past to fulfill my duty."}
