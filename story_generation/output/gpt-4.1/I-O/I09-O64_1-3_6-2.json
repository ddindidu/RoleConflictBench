My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had texted me earlier, asking if I could receive her package since she\u2019d be at work. She\u2019d done the same for me last month, and I knew how much she worried about missed deliveries. I promised her I\u2019d help, but now, as my shift at the grocery store stretched into overtime, I was stuck behind the register, counting out the day\u2019s final transactions. The manager hovered nearby, watching every move, reminding me how crucial it was to avoid mistakes, especially with the large sums of cash and credit slips piling up. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014probably the delivery driver. I felt torn, my mind racing between the expectation to be a reliable neighbor and the pressure to be a flawless cashier. If I left the register, I\u2019d risk a costly error or my boss\u2019s anger. If I stayed, Mrs. Lee\u2019s package might be lost again. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, caught between two roles that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
