I glanced at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashed, and when I answered, her voice was shaky. Her car had broken down on the highway, and she was stranded, scared, and needed me right away. My heart lurched; of course, I wanted to drop everything and go to her. But as I hung up, the bell above the salon door jingled. A young woman stepped in, eyes wide and uncertain, clutching her purse. She was my next client, a first-timer, and I could see the anxiety in her posture. I knew how important it was to greet her warmly, to make her feel safe and welcome, especially since she\u2019d confessed over the phone how nervous she was about getting her hair cut. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent need of my friend and the professional promise I\u2019d made to this client. My mind raced, guilt and worry tangling together as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
