My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Jamie. I glance at the screen and my heart sinks. \u201cWhy would you say that? I thought we were closer than that.\u201d I realize my last text must have come off cold, and now Jamie\u2019s hurt. I know I should call right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grows. That\u2019s what a good friend would do\u2014communicate, fix it, not let it fester.\n\nBut right in front of me, a customer is frowning, arms crossed, complaining about a missing discount. The line behind her is restless, and I can feel the pressure to stay calm, smile, and keep things moving. My manager is watching from the end of the aisle. I\u2019m supposed to be the friendly, unflappable cashier, even when customers are upset.\n\nMy phone vibrates again. I can\u2019t ignore Jamie, but I can\u2019t abandon my post either. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014be a good friend, be a good employee. I grip the scanner, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
