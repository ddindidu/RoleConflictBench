She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly exchange. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she chirped, pausing as if hoping for a bit of small talk. I knew she valued these moments, and I always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014polite, present, never in too much of a hurry. But my mind was already tangled in code and deadlines. The design documents for our new feature were due by noon, and the other teams were waiting on my technical input to move forward. I could almost feel their Slack messages piling up, the pressure mounting with every minute I delayed. I wanted to be the neighbor who stopped and chatted, but I also needed to be the developer who delivered on time. My heart thudded as I stood there, torn between a simple hello and the urgent demands of my job, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
