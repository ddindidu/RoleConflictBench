As a colleague, I was expected to be reliable, to answer quickly, especially when external partners were involved. But just as I started typing, I glanced through the window and saw a group of teenagers at the pool\u2019s edge, laughing and edging dangerously close to the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My heart skipped. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for enforcing safety rules, and I could see the risk escalating by the second. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I left the email, I\u2019d let my team down and possibly delay an important deal. If I ignored the pool, I\u2019d be failing my duty to keep everyone safe. My hands hovered between the keyboard and the door, torn between two worlds, each demanding my immediate attention."}
