My girlfriend came in, her eyes red, shoulders slumped. She dropped her bag and sighed, \u201cI got that feedback from my boss. It was\u2026 not great.\u201d I could see she needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her that she\u2019s more than her job. I reached for her hand, but just then, my phone buzzed. A vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol demanded a prompt, formal reply. My manager always stressed the importance of timely communication, especially with vendors. I could almost hear his voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let these things sit. It\u2019s about professionalism.\u201d My girlfriend looked at me, waiting, vulnerable. My inbox blinked with urgency. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the woman I love, the other toward the job that pays our bills. I hesitated, caught between the warmth of her need and the cold necessity of my work."}
