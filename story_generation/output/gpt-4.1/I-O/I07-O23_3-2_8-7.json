As a colleague, I knew the team counted on me to be responsive, to keep things moving. I started drafting my reply, but then an email popped up from an internal assistant. She wanted access to the client files I was working on, saying it would save her time if she could just look through them herself.\n\nAs a lawyer, I felt the weight of my responsibility. Client confidentiality wasn\u2019t just a rule\u2014it was a promise. I couldn\u2019t just hand over sensitive documents, even to someone on our team, without proper clearance. But as a colleague, I didn\u2019t want to seem unhelpful or slow things down. My inbox pinged again\u2014leadership was following up. I stared at the screen, feeling the pressure build, torn between the need to be a supportive teammate and my duty to uphold the ethical standards of my profession."}
