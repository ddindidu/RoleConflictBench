They waved me over, asking if I could help them load their bags and take them to the airport. I glanced at my watch\u2014if I helped them, I\u2019d be right on time for my first fare. But as I stepped into the corridor, I saw my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, frowning at the pile of boxes I\u2019d left outside my door. The HOA inspection was today, and anything blocking the hallway could get us all in trouble. I knew I should move my things immediately, but the travelers were already struggling with their luggage, expecting me to be the helpful, professional driver they needed. My mind raced\u2014should I risk upsetting my neighbors and possibly getting cited, or let down my customers who were counting on me to be prompt and reliable? I stood there, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good neighbor and a dependable taxi driver."}
