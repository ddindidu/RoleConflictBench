It was Jamie, a new nursing assistant, looking anxious. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d she whispered, glancing nervously at my patient. I knew she\u2019d been struggling with whether to apply for a new position, and she wanted my advice. As a mentor, I felt the pull to step aside, listen, and offer her the guidance she needed. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, her oatmeal cooling, her hands trembling as she tried to hold her spoon. I could see the expectation in both their eyes\u2014Jamie\u2019s hope for support, Mrs. Lee\u2019s need for care. My mind raced, torn between the urge to nurture Jamie\u2019s growth and the immediate responsibility to assist Mrs. Lee. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of the person before me and the one at my side."}
