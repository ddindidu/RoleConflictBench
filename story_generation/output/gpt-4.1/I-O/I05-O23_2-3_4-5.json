As a mentor, I had promised my team a comprehensive session to walk them through the critical skills they\u2019d need for the upcoming project. They were counting on me to guide them, to share the hard-earned lessons that could make or break their success. My notes were ready, slides prepared, and I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for clarity and direction.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the jury trial was set to begin in less than an hour. As a lawyer, my client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014hung in the balance. The court date was immovable, the stakes immense. My client expected my undivided attention, my sharpest arguments, my presence in the courtroom.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, pulled in two directions by people who depended on me for entirely different reasons. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the duty to my client. The weight of their expectations pressed down, and I found myself frozen, unable to choose which role to let down."}
