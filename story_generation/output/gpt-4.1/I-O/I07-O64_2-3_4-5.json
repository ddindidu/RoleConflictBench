As a cashier, I knew the end-of-shift deposit was non-negotiable\u2014every bill counted, every form signed, no shortcuts. The store manager had drilled it into us: one mistake, and the whole audit could be thrown off. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder from my teammate at my other job. The report I\u2019d promised to finish tonight was due in an hour, and she needed it to start her own work. If I missed the deadline, the whole project would stall, and I\u2019d let the team down. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my hands trembling as I sorted the cash, my mind racing with unfinished sentences and spreadsheets. I wanted to be a reliable colleague, but I couldn\u2019t rush the deposit without risking my job. The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, knowing I had to choose which rule to break."}
