It was Jamie, my best friend, sounding frazzled. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in these furniture instructions.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014swim lessons would start in half an hour. As I walked past the pool, I noticed the lane rope was snapped, floating uselessly in the water. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the lessons would be a mess, and the supervisor would definitely have words for me. But Jamie\u2019s voice in my head tugged at me\u2014he\u2019d helped me through so much, and I knew he was counting on me. My hands shook as I weighed the wrench in one hand and my phone in the other, feeling the pressure of being a good friend and a responsible lifeguard at the same time."}
