My mind raced with calculations\u2014how to optimize the emergency routes, where to place the operating rooms for maximum efficiency. Every detail mattered; lives could depend on my choices. Just as I was finalizing the layout, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Alex: \u201cCan we talk? Had a rough day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014he\u2019d be home soon. I knew he\u2019d need me, someone to listen, to reassure him after the harsh feedback he\u2019d gotten at work. But the deadline for the design loomed, and I couldn\u2019t afford mistakes. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for him, to hold him and tell him it would be okay. But the hospital project demanded my full attention. I stared at the door, torn between the person I loved and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
