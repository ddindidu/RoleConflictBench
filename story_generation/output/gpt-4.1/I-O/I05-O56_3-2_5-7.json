My apprentice, Mia, stood beside me, scissors in hand, her eyes wide with anticipation. She was about to attempt her first precision cut\u2014a style that demanded absolute focus and skill. As her mentor, I was expected to guide her through every step, ensuring she understood the gravity of each snip. One wrong move, and the client\u2019s look could be ruined, her confidence shaken.\n\nBut as I turned to greet our client, I noticed her hair was damp and greasy, clearly fresh from a workout. As a hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before styling, ensuring a clean canvas and a pleasant experience. Yet, Mia was already poised, waiting for my instruction, her nerves barely contained. If I paused to wash the client\u2019s hair, I\u2019d disrupt Mia\u2019s flow and possibly undermine her confidence. If I let her proceed, I\u2019d be neglecting my professional standards and risking a poor result.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between my duty to mentor and my responsibility as a hairdresser, the expectations of both roles clashing in the small, steamy salon."}
