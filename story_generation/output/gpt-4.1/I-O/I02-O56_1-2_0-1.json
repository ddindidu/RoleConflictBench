Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her, like a good boyfriend should. But just as I was about to reply, the bell above the salon door chimed. A woman stepped in, clutching her purse, eyes darting around. She looked lost, maybe even a little scared. As a hairdresser, I knew how important first impressions were. I was supposed to greet her warmly, make her feel at ease, show her she was in good hands. But Mia\u2019s message tugged at me\u2014I could picture her waiting, needing comfort. My mind raced: Should I text Mia back right away, or focus on welcoming the new client? Both needed me, both expected something only I could give. I stood there, caught between the gentle pull of love and the professional duty to a stranger, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
