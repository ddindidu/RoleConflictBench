He barely looked up as I set my bag down. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, trying to sound gentle. He nodded, muttering something about his boss and endless meetings. I wanted to sit beside him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014just be his girlfriend, the one who makes things a little easier.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the parking ticket I\u2019d issued an hour ago. The car was parked illegally, but the driver had a genuine emergency. I could have let it slide, but the rules were clear. As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity, to treat everyone the same. Still, I wondered if I\u2019d been too rigid, if a little compassion would have been fairer.\n\nNow, as Alex vented about his day, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. He needed me to be present, to care. But I couldn\u2019t shake the guilt and doubt from work. I sat there, torn, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
