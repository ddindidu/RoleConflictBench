My headset pressed tight against my ear as I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch in my head. The pressure from management was intense; missing the target meant another warning, maybe even losing my weekend hours. As the phone rang, I heard a commotion outside my apartment door. Peeking out, I saw my neighbor\u2019s stroller and a pile of shoes cluttering the corridor. The HOA had sent out a notice: anything blocking the hallway during tomorrow\u2019s inspection would be cited. I knew I should remind my neighbor, maybe even help move the stuff, but if I left my desk now, I\u2019d lose precious calling time. My neighbor always expected me to be considerate, to look out for our shared space, but my job demanded every minute of my focus. I felt the tension knotting in my stomach, torn between being a good neighbor and a reliable employee, the phone still ringing in my hand as I hesitated."}
