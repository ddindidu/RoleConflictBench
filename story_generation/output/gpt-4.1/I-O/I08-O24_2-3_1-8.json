As an acquaintance, I felt a pull to approach, to offer a warm smile and draw them into the conversation, to be the friendly face that made their evening easier. But just as I took a step forward, my phone buzzed urgently. My clerk\u2019s message flashed: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of the jury instructions I was about to deliver in court. As a judge, I was expected to be immediately aware of such changes, to halt proceedings and ensure the law was followed precisely. My mind raced\u2014should I excuse myself abruptly, risking the new person feeling even more isolated, or stay and fulfill my social role, knowing my courtroom awaited a critical update? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
