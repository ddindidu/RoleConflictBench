I glanced up to see a woman standing uncertainly at the entrance, her eyes darting from the reception desk to the row of stylists. She looked nervous, clutching her purse tightly. I was about to greet her with a warm smile when I checked my phone\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. \u201cI think I left my passport at home! Can you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours!\u201d My heart pounded. As a friend, I knew how much this trip meant to her, and she was counting on me in her panic.
