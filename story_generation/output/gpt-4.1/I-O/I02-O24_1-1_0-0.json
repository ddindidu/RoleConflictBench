She glances up, offers a tired smile, and I can tell something\u2019s off. As her boyfriend, I know I should sit beside her, ask about her day, listen to whatever\u2019s weighing on her mind. She deserves my attention, my comfort. But in my other life, the one that follows me home, a thick manila folder sits in my bag\u2014the new case file for a procedural hearing. It\u2019s not urgent, but I pride myself on being thorough, and the expectation is clear: review early, prepare well, never let details slip. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I focus on her, I risk falling behind on my judicial duties. If I open the file, I\u2019m neglecting the person I love. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, and I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the demands of boyfriend and judge colliding in the quiet of our living room."}
