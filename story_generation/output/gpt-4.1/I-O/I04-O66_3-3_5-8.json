It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, and he was stranded in the dark. \u201cCan you come get me? Please, I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he pleaded. My heart twisted; I knew how anxious he got in situations like this. But as I hung up, my taxi app pinged again. My passenger, already waiting, sent another message: \u201cWhere are you? I need to get to the hospital\u2014please hurry!\u201d \n\nI gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down. As a friend, I was supposed to drop everything and help Sam, especially in an emergency. But as a taxi driver, I had a duty to my passenger, who was counting on me for a safe, timely ride\u2014maybe even something urgent. My mind raced, torn between loyalty and responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
