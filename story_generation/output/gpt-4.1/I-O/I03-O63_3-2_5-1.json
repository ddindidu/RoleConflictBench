He\u2019s waiting in the living room, our favorite movie queued up, his hand patting the couch, eyes hopeful. I promised him this day, just us, no distractions. But my phone buzzes again. My manager\u2019s message flashes: \u201cWe need you on the line. High-value prospects today. Handle all objections, answer every question.\u201d I slip into the bedroom, headset on, laptop open. The calls come fast. Customers want details about the new service\u2014technical specs, compatibility, things my script barely covers. I fumble for answers, my mind half with Alex, half with the insistent voices in my ear. Guilt gnaws at me. I hear Alex laugh at the TV, then go quiet. I want to be there, to soak up every minute before he\u2019s gone, but the pressure to perform at work is crushing. My heart pounds as I stare at the closed door, torn between the person I love and the job that needs me."}
