As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to sit beside her, offer comfort, and listen to whatever was weighing on her heart. I knew she\u2019d recently lost her job, and I wanted to be the friendly, supportive face she needed. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was also responsible for making sure the house was ready for the next visit. I\u2019d just noticed the floor cleaner was almost gone, and if I didn\u2019t mention it now, the floors wouldn\u2019t get cleaned next time. I could already hear Mrs. Lee\u2019s disappointment if I failed to manage the supplies properly. My mind raced\u2014should I interrupt Emily\u2019s grief to talk about cleaning products, or should I ignore my work duties to be the friend she needed? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between compassion and responsibility."}
