I really need your advice before my big interview tomorrow.\u201d As a mentor, I knew how much this moment meant for her. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I wanted to be there, to help her find the confidence she needed. But as I looked around the house, the reality of my other role pressed in. The checklist from my supervisor was taped to the fridge: \u201cDeep clean every room today. No exceptions. Inspection at 3 PM.\u201d The kitchen still needed scrubbing, and the bathrooms were only half done. I could already hear the echo of disappointment if I failed to meet the cleaning standards. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support my mentee and the obligation to deliver spotless results. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of letting someone down, no matter which path I chose."}
