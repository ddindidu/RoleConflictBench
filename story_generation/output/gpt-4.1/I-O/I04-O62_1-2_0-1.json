My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Jamie. \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d I knew what he needed: someone to listen, to care, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what friends do. I wanted to text back, to give him the support he deserved. But my eyes caught a sudden splash\u2014someone in the middle of the pool was flailing, their strokes uneven. My training screamed at me: never look away, never get distracted. Every second counted. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Jamie needed me, but so did the swimmer. My heart pounded as I gripped my phone, torn between the urge to comfort my friend and the duty to keep everyone safe. I stared at the screen, then back at the water, caught in the impossible pull of being both a good friend and a vigilant lifeguard."}
