My phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cNeed your confirmation for the partner meeting\u2014please reply ASAP.\u201d I glanced at the clock. I had promised to check my emails during my break, but the pool was busy, and I was the only lifeguard on duty. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a group of kids edging into the shallow end, unsupervised. My heart pounded. If I left my post for even a minute to send that email, I\u2019d be breaking the cardinal rule of lifeguarding\u2014never leave swimmers unattended. But if I didn\u2019t reply, I\u2019d be letting my team down, risking the partnership we\u2019d worked so hard to build. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent ping of my phone and the watchful gaze I owed the pool."}
