My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had mentioned she was expecting an important package today and would be at work. She\u2019d asked if I could keep an eye out, and I\u2019d promised I would. Just as I was about to head to the door, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my regular client, Jamie, was due in five minutes for a quick trim. Jamie was always cheerful and easy, but last time she\u2019d hinted her fringe wasn\u2019t quite right. I knew she\u2019d want it perfect today, and I prided myself on making sure my clients left happy.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I waited for the delivery, I might keep Jamie waiting, which could make her feel unimportant. But if I started Jamie\u2019s haircut, I might miss the delivery, letting Mrs. Kim down after she\u2019d trusted me. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the attentive hairdresser, both roles pulling me in opposite directions. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, scissors in the other, heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do next."}
