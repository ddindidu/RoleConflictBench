She\u2019d asked if I could keep an eye out, since she\u2019d missed the last two deliveries and was worried about porch theft. As her neighbor, I wanted to help\u2014after all, we\u2019d always looked out for each other. But just as I was about to settle in by the window, my phone buzzed with a reminder: a patient was coming in for counseling on a new medication. As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to give my full attention, to explain side effects and answer every question. My mind raced. If I left to help Mrs. Lee, I might be distracted during the counseling session, risking a mistake. But if I focused on my patient, I\u2019d let down my neighbor, who was counting on me. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. I stood in the hallway, torn, heart pounding, unable to decide which role to honor first."}
