As an air traffic controller, the pre-dawn hours were usually calm\u2014just a few cargo flights, no holding patterns, no urgent reroutes. But today, I was also a mentor. I\u2019d promised my new trainee, Maya, a structured session before her first big project. She was counting on me to share the tricks and lessons I\u2019d learned over years in the tower. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides and scenarios, determined to give her the confidence she needed.\n\nBut as I glanced at the radar, a new flight plan pinged in\u2014unexpected, but not urgent. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways be ready, even when it\u2019s quiet.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Maya\u2019s session was supposed to start in five minutes. She\u2019d be waiting, nervous and eager. But the airspace, though calm, demanded my vigilance. I could feel my chest tighten, torn between the responsibility to guide Maya and the duty to keep the skies safe, even in the stillness before dawn."}
