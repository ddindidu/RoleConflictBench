The others laughed and speculated, nudging me for my opinion. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t join in or say anything negative, but their expectant eyes made it hard to stay silent. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a notification from the taxi app. My next passenger, already waiting, sent another urgent message: \u201cAre you close? I really need to get there fast.\u201d As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt and professional, but leaving abruptly would seem rude to the group and might make them think I was avoiding the conversation. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014one demanding my loyalty and discretion, the other my punctuality and service. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, caught between the urge to escape the gossip and the responsibility to my passenger."}
