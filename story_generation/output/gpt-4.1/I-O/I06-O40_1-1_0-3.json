My phone buzzed with a reminder: the optional reading my mentor suggested last week. The deadline wasn\u2019t for a while, but I knew she expected me to be proactive, to show initiative and come prepared for our next meeting. I glanced at the stack of lumber, mentally calculating how much more I\u2019d need to order before the supplier\u2019s cutoff time. If I didn\u2019t get the materials sorted today, the whole project would be delayed, and my client was already eager for updates.\n\nBut the reading\u2014if I put it off, I\u2019d risk disappointing my mentor, who had invested so much in my growth. I could almost hear her voice, encouraging me to dig deeper, to not just do the minimum. My hands hovered over the wood, torn between the immediate demands of my craft and the quieter, persistent pull of my mentor\u2019s expectations. The clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each asking for more than I seemed able to give."}
