It was Mina, an old friend from college. Her voice trembled, \u201cMy car broke down on Oak Lane. Can you help? I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d I glanced at the taxi meter ticking away and the app flashing another message: \u201cPassenger waiting. Please hurry.\u201d The passenger, a businesswoman in the back seat, tapped her watch and sighed loudly. She\u2019d already told me she had a flight to catch. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get her to the airport on time, no excuses. But as an acquaintance, I knew Mina was stranded and counting on me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my passenger and the urge to help a friend in need. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, caught between two roads I couldn\u2019t travel at once."}
