I could feel the tension in my chest, the urge to call him and smooth things over, to explain that I\u2019d misunderstood, that I wanted to fix it. But the line at my register was long, and the drawer was full of large bills\u2014end-of-shift, high-stakes counting. My manager expected perfection, no errors, especially now. I tried to focus on the numbers, but Alex\u2019s message echoed in my head, guilt mixing with anxiety. I wanted to be the girlfriend who resolved things right away, who didn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But I also needed to be the cashier who didn\u2019t make mistakes, who didn\u2019t let personal drama interfere with work. My hands trembled as I handed back change, torn between the urge to grab my phone and the responsibility to finish my shift without error."}
