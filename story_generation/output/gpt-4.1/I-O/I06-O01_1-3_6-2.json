As a mentee, I was expected to respect Dr. Lee\u2019s time\u2014she\u2019d made it clear her open office hours were for quick, focused questions, not lengthy discussions. But as the lead architect on the new high-rise hospital, I\u2019d just discovered a potential flaw in the fire escape design. If I didn\u2019t clarify the regulation\u2019s wording with Dr. Lee today, the entire project could be delayed, or worse, someone\u2019s safety could be at risk.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cMentor\u2019s office hours end in 10 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew Dr. Lee disliked last-minute, complex queries, and I didn\u2019t want to seem unprepared or disrespectful. Yet, the weight of my responsibility as an architect pressed on me\u2014lives could depend on this decision. I hovered over the \u201cJoin Meeting\u201d button, torn between my duty to respect my mentor\u2019s boundaries and my obligation to ensure the hospital\u2019s safety."}
