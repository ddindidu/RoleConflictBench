They needed my input on a project, and the last message was clear: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until you clarify this point.\u201d I knew they were waiting, probably watching the inbox, expecting a quick reply so the work could continue. I started typing a response, trying to focus, but my radio crackled to life, the dispatcher\u2019s voice sharp and urgent, \u201cUnit 3, stand by for possible cardiac arrest call.\u201d My heart raced. As an ambulance driver, I had to be ready to jump into action at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014lives depended on it. But as a colleague, I was expected to be present, responsive, and reliable for my team. I stared at the half-written email, my fingers frozen above the keyboard, torn between the responsibility to my coworkers and the duty to the next emergency. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt the tension rising as I waited for the next call or the next message, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
