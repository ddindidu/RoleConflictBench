Today, as I walked down the quiet hallway at work, I spotted someone I recognized\u2014an acquaintance from that party last month. I felt the familiar tug to smile, say hello, and maybe even stop for a quick chat, just to keep up that approachable image everyone expects from me.\n\nBut as I reached the end of the hallway, I glanced at my watch. My cashier shift was about to start, and the holiday rush was in full swing. The moment I clocked in, I was met with a line of impatient customers, one of whom was already raising their voice about a pricing error. As a cashier, I\u2019m supposed to be endlessly cheerful and patient, no matter how frazzled I feel inside.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I pause to greet my acquaintance and risk being late, or rush past and risk seeming cold? And once behind the register, could I really summon the energy to be the perfect cashier after the awkward hallway encounter? My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being friendly in both roles, but knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
