As a machine repairer, I knew the big shutdown was next week\u2014my chance to finally get ahead on maintenance. The machines had been running hot, and I\u2019d already made a list of parts to clean and replace. But my mind kept drifting to the email from my mentor. She\u2019d suggested some articles to read, not urgent, but she always noticed who took her advice seriously. I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed to learning, even if the deadline was weeks away. \n\nBut every time I tried to focus on the reading, I\u2019d remember the machines\u2014how a missed detail now could mean a breakdown later. Yet, if I put off the reading, would my mentor think I wasn\u2019t dedicated? The expectations tugged at me from both sides, each role demanding my attention, each with its own consequences. I stared at the unread articles and the maintenance checklist, feeling the pressure build, unsure which responsibility to tackle first."}
