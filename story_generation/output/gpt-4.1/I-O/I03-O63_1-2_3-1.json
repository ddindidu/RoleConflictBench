I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smile, picturing his hopeful face, but my mind is already racing. At work, my headset feels heavier than usual. The new service we\u2019re selling is complicated, and every call is a minefield of technical questions. The script barely scratches the surface, and customers grow impatient when I can\u2019t answer specifics. My supervisor expects me to keep call times short and conversions high, but I\u2019m stuck on the line, fumbling for answers, feeling my confidence slip.\n\nAlex wants me present, laughing and relaxed, not distracted or exhausted. But every evening I consider for our date, I remember the stack of product manuals I promised myself I\u2019d study, hoping to handle tomorrow\u2019s calls better. I want to be the attentive girlfriend he deserves, but I also need to be the competent telemarketer my job demands. My heart aches as I stare at Alex\u2019s message, torn between the warmth of his company and the pressure to prove myself at work."}
