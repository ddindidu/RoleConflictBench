My mentor\u2019s voice crackled through my phone, \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of this hour\u2014I board soon.\u201d I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this session, determined to show respect for her time, to listen and learn. But just as she started sharing her insights, a passenger slid into my backseat, breathless. \u201cPlease, the station\u2014my train leaves in thirty minutes!\u201d he pleaded, urgency in his eyes.\n\nI gripped the wheel, torn. As a taxi driver, I owed him a safe, swift ride across the city. But as a mentee, I couldn\u2019t cut my mentor short, not when she\u2019d squeezed me in before her flight.
