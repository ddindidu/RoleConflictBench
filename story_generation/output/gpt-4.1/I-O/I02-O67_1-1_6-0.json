She was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten we were supposed to visit her parents this weekend. I tried to explain that my schedule was unpredictable, but she was hurt, her words sharp and disappointed. I wanted to call her, to smooth things over, to be the boyfriend she needed, the one who could fix misunderstandings before they grew into something bigger. But just as I started typing a reply, the radio crackled to life: \u201cUnit 3, emergency call, possible cardiac arrest, respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew every second counted for someone out there, and my team was counting on me to be ready, focused, and fast. I stared at my phone, Mia\u2019s last message hanging in the air, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, couldn\u2019t be everything to everyone, and for a moment, I just sat there, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the silent ache of someone I loved."}
