The HOA inspection is today, and anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate\u2014she loves those plants, and I know they brighten her day. But the rules are clear, and I can already imagine the email from the HOA if I don\u2019t say something or move them.\n\nJust as I\u2019m debating what to do, my phone buzzes. At the control center, thunderstorms are forcing flights to reroute, and the handoffs between sectors are piling up. My team expects me to be sharp, focused, and ready to coordinate every detail. There\u2019s no room for distraction; one mistake could ripple across the entire airspace.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn. If I leave the plants, I risk trouble with the HOA and my neighbors. If I deal with them now, I\u2019ll be late for my shift, letting down my team when they need me most. My mind races, heart pounding, as I weigh the demands pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension tighten with every passing second."}
