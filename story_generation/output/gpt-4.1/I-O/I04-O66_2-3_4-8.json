It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d I glanced at the app: my passenger was already waiting, sending anxious messages about being late for an important meeting. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be reliable, to get people where they need to go on time. But as a friend, I\u2019m supposed to be there in moments like this, to help when it really matters. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency in Sam\u2019s voice against the professional obligation pressing on me from the app. I could almost see both of them\u2014Sam, desperate at the airport, and my passenger, checking their watch, growing more impatient by the second. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between loyalty and duty, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
