As a mentee, I knew I was expected to finish the code sample before our next meeting in three days\u2014my mentor had emphasized how important it was for my growth. But as an engineer, the pressure was mounting; stakeholders were pushing for a working prototype, and their approval was crucial for the project\u2019s future. My inbox pinged with a reminder from my mentor, while a message from my manager popped up, asking for an update on the prototype. My mind raced, torn between wanting to prove myself to my mentor and not letting my team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in my chest. I knew I couldn\u2019t give less than my best to either, but time was slipping away, and I had to choose where to focus my energy."}
