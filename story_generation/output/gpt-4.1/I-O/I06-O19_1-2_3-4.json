She looked anxious, so I spoke slowly, making sure she understood the side effects and what to do if she missed a dose. In the back of my mind, though, a small question about a term in the new protocol gnawed at me. As a mentee, I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I had uncertainties, no matter how minor. But this question wasn\u2019t urgent, and I didn\u2019t want to interrupt my mentor\u2019s busy day with something that wasn\u2019t blocking my work. At the same time, I felt the weight of my responsibility as a pharmacist\u2014my patient needed my full attention, and I couldn\u2019t let my mind wander. I felt torn, caught between the expectation to be a proactive mentee and the immediate demand to be a present, attentive pharmacist. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to prioritize in this moment."}
