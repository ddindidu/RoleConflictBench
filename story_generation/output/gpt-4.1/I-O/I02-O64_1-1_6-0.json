My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s Mia. We\u2019d just had a text argument about our weekend plans, a silly misunderstanding, but I can feel her frustration through the screen. As her boyfriend, I should call her, clear things up, reassure her that I care. That\u2019s what she expects, and honestly, I want to fix it too.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m a cashier. There are three customers waiting, their baskets full, and I can\u2019t afford to make mistakes. My manager expects me to stay focused, process each transaction accurately, and keep the line moving. I glance at the clock, wishing for a break, but it\u2019s still twenty minutes away.\n\nMy mind races between the register and my phone. If I ignore Mia, the tension will grow. If I lose focus here, I could mess up someone\u2019s order or shortchange them. I feel the pressure building, pulled in two directions, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands move automatically, but my thoughts are tangled, caught between the beep of the scanner and the buzz in my pocket."}
