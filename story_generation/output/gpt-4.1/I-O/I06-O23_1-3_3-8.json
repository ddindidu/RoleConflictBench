As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how minor. Today, I stumbled over a term in a contract\u2014nothing urgent, but I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice: \u201cAlways ask, even if it feels small.\u201d Yet, my phone buzzed with an email from opposing counsel, pressing for details that brushed dangerously close to privileged information. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, the weight of my client\u2019s trust heavy on my shoulders. I could almost feel the pressure of both roles squeezing me\u2014my mentor expecting transparency, my profession demanding silence. Should I risk appearing incompetent by bothering my mentor with a trivial question, or should I risk ethical missteps by navigating this alone? My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urge to reach out and the duty to protect."}
