I knew it was probably my team at the office\u2014they\u2019d been waiting for my input on the new project plan all morning. I could almost hear the impatience in their messages, the way progress stalled without my clarification. But my hands were covered in dust, and the workbench was cluttered with tools and scraps. I remembered the safety briefing: keep the area tidy, don\u2019t let distractions pull your focus. One careless move, and I could end up with a nasty injury. Still, the pressure to be a good colleague gnawed at me. If I didn\u2019t respond soon, I\u2019d be letting the team down, but if I stopped now, I\u2019d be breaking every safety rule I\u2019d drilled into my crew. My mind raced, torn between the pinging phone and the mess at my feet, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
