I wanted to make a good impression, to be the friendly, approachable neighbor everyone likes. As I stepped into the hallway with the cake, I ran into the woman from 3B\u2014someone I recognized from the salon where I work as a hairdresser. She smiled, and I smiled back, but I couldn\u2019t help noticing her hair looked a bit greasy, probably from a gym session. \n\nAs a neighbor, I wanted to be warm and welcoming, to offer her cake and chat about the building. But as a hairdresser, I felt the urge to mention the importance of washing and conditioning hair before any styling, especially after sweating. I could almost hear my boss\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me to uphold professional standards and gently educate clients. My mind raced\u2014should I just be the friendly neighbor, or should I bring up her hair, risking embarrassment? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, cake in hand, caught between what I should say and what I wanted to say."}
