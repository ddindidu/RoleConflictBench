My headset feels heavier than usual, the pressure from management\u2019s daily reminders echoing in my mind. I know if I don\u2019t hit my numbers, I\u2019ll be called in for another \u201cperformance review.\u201d But my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my mentee. She\u2019s panicking about her big project presentation tomorrow, the one we\u2019ve been working toward for weeks. She needs guidance, reassurance, maybe even a last-minute pep talk to steady her nerves. I can almost hear her voice trembling through the text. I want to be there for her, to help her grow and succeed, just as I promised when I took on the mentor role. But every minute I spend with her is a minute I\u2019m not dialing, not selling, not inching closer to that target. My chest tightens as I stare at the blinking cursor, torn between the expectations of being a supportive mentor and the relentless demands of my sales job."}
