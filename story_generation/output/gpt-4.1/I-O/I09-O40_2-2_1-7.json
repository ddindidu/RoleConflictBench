I wanted to be the kind of neighbor who smiled in the hallway and remembered birthdays. As I stepped out, cake carefully balanced, my phone buzzed. It was a homeowner from across town\u2014her deck was in bad shape, and she needed it fixed before her family gathering that evening. As a carpenter, I knew the job would take hours, and she was counting on me to restore the deck\u2019s safety and charm. I stood in the corridor, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to meet my new neighbors and offer the cake, risking coming off as unfriendly or uninterested. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let down a client who trusted my skills and reliability. The cake felt heavier in my hands as I wrestled with the expectations of being both a good neighbor and a dependable carpenter, unsure which role to honor first."}
