My mentor had always told me to reach out immediately if anything threatened our project\u2019s timeline, and now, with my teammates at each other\u2019s throats, the deliverable was at real risk. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded faster. The pre-shift briefing for subway operators was about to begin\u2014today\u2019s was mandatory, covering new safety protocols. Missing it could mean disciplinary action or, worse, putting passengers at risk. My supervisor expected unwavering professionalism and punctuality, especially with so many eyes on us after last week\u2019s incident. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the mentee who must be transparent and proactive, the operator who must be present and reliable. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to communicate with my mentor and the equally urgent demand to be at my post, ready to absorb every detail of the new procedures. I stood frozen, phone in hand, the train\u2019s departure time ticking closer, my responsibilities pulling me in opposite directions."}
