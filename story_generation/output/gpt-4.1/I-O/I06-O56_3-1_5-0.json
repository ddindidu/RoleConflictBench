The argument with my teammates this morning still echoed in my mind, and our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, ask for advice. But just as I started typing, the salon door chimed. Mrs. Lee, my regular, walked in, her smile expectant. The receptionist was chatting idly, leaving the greeting to me. I wiped my hands on my apron, forcing a cheerful tone as I welcomed Mrs. Lee and led her to my chair. My mind raced\u2014should I excuse myself for a moment to message my mentor, risking Mrs. Lee feeling neglected? Or should I focus on making her comfortable, as she always expects, and delay the conversation with my mentor? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
