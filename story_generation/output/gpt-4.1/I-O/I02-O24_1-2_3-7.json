I\u2019m free whenever you are.\u201d I smiled, thinking how rare it was for our schedules to align so perfectly. She\u2019d been hoping for more time together, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d make it happen. But as I set my phone down, a thick file on my desk caught my eye. The attorney in tomorrow\u2019s case had just emailed, referencing a new appellate decision from last week. I hadn\u2019t read it yet, and as a judge, I knew I needed to be fully prepared\u2014missing a key precedent could mean a flawed ruling. My mind raced: if I spent tonight with her, I\u2019d have to rush through the legal opinion tomorrow, risking a mistake. But if I stayed in to study, I\u2019d be letting her down again, after so many rain checks. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, torn, unable to choose."}
