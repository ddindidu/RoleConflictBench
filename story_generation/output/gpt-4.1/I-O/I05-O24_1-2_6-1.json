As a judge, I knew the expectation: impartiality, diligence, and a thorough review of every argument before I stepped into the courtroom. The weight of the case pressed on me, and I could feel the clock ticking down the hours until the hearing. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, Sarah. She\u2019d been struggling with time management, and our casual check-ins had become a lifeline for her. As her mentor, I was supposed to encourage her growth, help her find her footing, and be present when she needed guidance. She wanted to talk\u2014tonight, if possible. \n\nI stared at the phone, torn. The judge in me demanded focus and preparation; the mentor in me urged compassion and support. Both roles were important, but tonight, their demands collided, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I weighed what to do next."}
