It was a message from my colleague, just a quick update about the project timeline. She\u2019d written, \u201cNo rush, just FYI,\u201d but I knew our team valued quick responses, even for non-urgent things. I started typing a reply, wanting to show I was attentive and reliable. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a small splash in the deep end\u2014where kids weren\u2019t supposed to be. A child was flailing, clearly out of their depth. My heart pounded. I knew the rules: as a lifeguard, my focus had to be on the pool, enforcing safety, ready to act in an instant. But the pressure to be a good colleague tugged at me, the expectation to always be reachable, always responsive. My thumb hovered over the send button, my eyes darting between the screen and the struggling child. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my attention in that critical moment."}
