The hospital was busy as always, and I knew I had to stay on schedule\u2014patients depended on me to monitor their health, and my supervisor expected accurate, timely records. Just as I reached Mrs. Lee\u2019s door, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my best friend. He\u2019d just moved into his new apartment and was struggling to assemble his bed. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost,\u201d he texted, sounding desperate.
