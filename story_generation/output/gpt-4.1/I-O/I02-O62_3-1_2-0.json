She leaned into me, her hand gripping mine tightly, and I knew she needed me to be fully present, to listen, to comfort her as she mourned her brother. Every few minutes, though, my gaze flickered to the water. I was on duty, the only lifeguard for this stretch of sand, and a handful of swimmers were drifting farther out than I liked. No one seemed in trouble, but I couldn\u2019t ignore them. Mia\u2019s voice trembled as she spoke, and I wanted nothing more than to wrap her in my arms and shut out the world. But my training screamed at me to keep scanning the waves, to be ready for anything. I felt torn in two\u2014Mia\u2019s pain anchoring me to the shore, my responsibility pulling me toward the water. My heart pounded as I tried to be both the boyfriend she needed and the lifeguard everyone depended on, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either role what it truly demanded in that moment."}
