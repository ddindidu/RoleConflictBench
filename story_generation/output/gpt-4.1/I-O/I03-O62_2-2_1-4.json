As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside him, listen, and reassure him that he was more than his boss\u2019s words. But as I reached out, my radio crackled with a supervisor\u2019s voice: \u201cBroken lane rope in lane three\u2014needs fixing before the next class.\u201d I glanced at the frayed rope, knowing that if I didn\u2019t act fast, the swim lessons would be thrown into chaos, and I\u2019d be letting down my team. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Jake, who needed me, and toward my duty as a lifeguard, which demanded immediate action. I could feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing with the expectations of being a supportive partner and a responsible employee. I stood frozen, torn between comforting the person I loved and fulfilling the job I was trusted to do, unsure which role to answer first."}
