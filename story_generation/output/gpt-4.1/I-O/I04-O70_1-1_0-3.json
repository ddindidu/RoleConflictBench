It was Mia, my best friend, texting, \u201cUgh, today\u2019s been endless. Can you talk?\u201d I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like always. But as I read her message, I glanced at the package in my passenger seat, double-checking the address. The instructions were clear: leave it at the doorstep, take a photo, and make sure it\u2019s safe. The neighborhood wasn\u2019t the best, and I\u2019d been warned about porch pirates. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Mia expected me to reply right away, to give her my full attention, but my job demanded I focus on the delivery, secure the package, and move on quickly. My thumb hovered over my phone, torn between sending a comforting reply and doing my job by the book. I could almost hear Mia\u2019s voice in my head, needing me, while my supervisor\u2019s reminders echoed just as loudly. My heart pounded as I stood at the curb, wrestling with what to do next."}
