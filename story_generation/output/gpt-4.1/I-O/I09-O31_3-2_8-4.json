With the power cut, I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll be left in the hallway,\u201d she asked, her eyes hopeful. I assured her I\u2019d help, feeling the familiar warmth of neighborly trust. But as I was locking my door, my radio crackled\u2014there\u2019d been a bad accident at the intersection nearby. Dispatch needed all available officers. My duty as a police officer surged to the front of my mind: protect the public, respond quickly, keep the streets safe.
