As a colleague, I knew everyone was counting on me to deliver my part by the end of the day. The project manager had reminded me twice already\u2014my task was the linchpin for the client\u2019s delivery, and any delay would throw the whole schedule off. But my phone kept buzzing with reminders from the sales manager: \u201cPush for more calls, you\u2019re on track to break your record this week!\u201d As a telemarketer, I was expected to keep dialing, keep selling, keep chasing that target. The thrill of being ahead of quota was real, but so was the pressure to keep the momentum going. My inbox pinged with a message from a teammate: \u201cAre you almost done? The client\u2019s getting anxious.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. If I focused on the spreadsheet, I\u2019d lose precious sales time. If I kept calling, I\u2019d let my team down. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phone and the unfinished task, unable to choose which expectation to meet first."}
