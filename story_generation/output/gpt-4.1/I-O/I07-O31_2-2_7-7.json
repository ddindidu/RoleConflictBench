As a police officer, I was expected to remain calm, listen to both sides, and act with fairness\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions. But the vibration reminded me of my other life: my team at the office, waiting for my response to a crucial email. They couldn\u2019t move forward with the project until I clarified a detail only I knew. I could almost picture their anxious faces, refreshing their inboxes, hoping I\u2019d reply soon. Yet here, on the roadside, I couldn\u2019t just step away. Both drivers looked to me for a decision, and my badge demanded I give them my full attention. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of my colleagues\u2019 needs and the responsibility to uphold fairness in my duty as an officer."}
