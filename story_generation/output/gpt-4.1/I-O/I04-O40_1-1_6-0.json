My friend\u2019s message blinked on the screen: \u201cWhere are we meeting again?\u201d I could sense the confusion in her words, and I knew how easily misunderstandings could spiral between us. We\u2019d promised to be more open, to clear things up before they turned into arguments. I wanted to reply right away, to reassure her and make sure we didn\u2019t end up in different places, frustrated and alone.\n\nBut the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the work area. As a carpenter, I was expected to be there on time, ready to follow every safety protocol. No phones, no distractions\u2014just focus, precision, and respect for the rules that kept us all safe. If I stopped to text, I\u2019d be late, and I\u2019d be setting a bad example. But if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be letting my friend down, risking another misunderstanding.\n\nMy thumb hovered over the screen, torn between the urgent need to reply and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
