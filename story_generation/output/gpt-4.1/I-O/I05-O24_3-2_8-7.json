As a mentor, I promised to guide my mentee through the biggest project of their career. They\u2019d just sent a frantic email, desperate for advice before tomorrow\u2019s presentation. I could hear the anxiety in their words, and I knew how much my encouragement meant. But as a judge, I had a duty to stay current with the law. An attorney in my courtroom had cited a brand-new appellate decision, and I needed to read and analyze it before the morning session. The legal community expected me to be thorough and impartial, to weigh every precedent carefully. My mentee expected me to be present, supportive, and wise. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My heart ached with the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down. I stared at the unopened case file and the blinking cursor on my reply, torn between the two paths, unable to move."}
