It was Sam, my oldest friend, his name flashing with a video call request. \u201cHey, can you help me? These instructions make no sense and I\u2019m about to lose it,\u201d he texted, sounding desperate. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and I wanted to be there for him\u2014just a few minutes, I thought, to walk him through the steps and calm him down.\n\nBut before I could answer, the radio crackled: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a possible fracture, Main and 5th, moderate traffic.\u201d My heart skipped. I was expected to be on the road in seconds, sirens blaring, someone in pain waiting for me to arrive as fast as possible. My hands hovered over my phone and the ignition, torn between the duty to my friend and the responsibility to a stranger in need. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just sat there, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
