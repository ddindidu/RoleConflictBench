My girlfriend sat curled up at the other end, her eyes red and distant, barely speaking since the news of her brother\u2019s passing. I knew she needed me\u2014someone to hold her, to listen, to just be there. But every time I glanced at the mess, I felt the weight of my other job pressing down. The agency expected spotless surfaces and gleaming floors, even in shared spaces. I was already behind on my checklist, and my supervisor had warned me about slipping standards. My heart ached for her, but my mind raced with anxiety about the cleaning I hadn\u2019t done. I wanted to be the boyfriend she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the pressure to keep the house in order. I stared at the vacuum in the corner, torn between picking it up and sitting back down beside her, feeling the tension knot tighter inside me."}
