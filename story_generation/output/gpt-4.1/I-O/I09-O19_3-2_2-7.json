As I hurried home from the pharmacy, my mind was still buzzing with the new prescription guidelines I\u2019d learned at the workshop. I knew I needed to review my notes before tomorrow\u2019s shift\u2014patients depended on my accuracy. But as I stepped into the lobby, I saw Mrs. Kim, my neighbor from down the hall, waiting with a tense smile. The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I could feel the unspoken expectation to be extra friendly, to smooth things over with a warm word or a joke. She greeted me, clearly hoping for reassurance and camaraderie. I wanted to be the good neighbor, to linger and chat, to show I cared about our community. But the clock was ticking, and the weight of my professional responsibility pressed on me. I stood there, torn, my neighbor\u2019s hopeful eyes on me, my mind racing with drug interactions and counseling points, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions at once."}
