I baked a small chocolate cake, hoping to introduce myself to the neighbors and make a good impression. As I was about to step out with the cake, my phone buzzed\u2014a new delivery order had come in. The address was just two buildings over, and the customer had left a note: \u201cPlease deliver within the next 30 minutes\u2014groceries needed for dinner guests tonight!\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I could deliver the groceries on time, but I\u2019d miss the perfect window to catch my neighbors at home. If I waited to meet them, I\u2019d risk being late and disappointing a customer who was counting on me. I stood in the hallway, cake in one hand, delivery bag in the other, torn between being the friendly new neighbor and the reliable delivery person. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to put first."}
