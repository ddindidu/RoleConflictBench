His reply was curt, almost cold\u2014he\u2019d clearly misread my earlier text. I could feel the tension in his words, and my chest tightened with worry. I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: communicate, fix things before they fester.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my work email pinged. An assistant from another department was asking for access to confidential client files, insisting it would help speed up a project. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable, no matter how convenient it might be for a colleague. I couldn\u2019t just hand over sensitive information, even if it meant being seen as uncooperative.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. Sam needed me to be a good friend, to call and explain. My firm needed me to be a good lawyer, to uphold my ethical duties. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, but I couldn\u2019t do both at once. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pressure mount from both sides."}
