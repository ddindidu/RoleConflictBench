They needed my input on a project detail before they could move forward, and I knew they were waiting for my response. At the same time, I stared at the splintered beam in front of me, the wood eaten through by termites. The homeowner\u2019s anxious face flashed in my mind\u2014she\u2019d called me in a panic, desperate for a repair plan before the damage got worse. My hands were covered in sawdust, and my mind raced. If I stopped now to answer emails, I\u2019d lose precious daylight and risk leaving the house exposed. But if I ignored my colleagues any longer, I\u2019d be holding up the entire team. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each demanding my immediate attention. I could feel frustration and guilt building inside, torn between the urgent needs of the house and the waiting eyes of my coworkers."}
