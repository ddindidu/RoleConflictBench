It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent\u2014his car had died on the highway, miles from anywhere, and he needed me. I glanced at the clock: 11:30 p.m. My laptop screen glowed with the unfinished prototype, the one my manager had reminded me\u2014twice today\u2014needed to be ready by morning for the stakeholders\u2019 review. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours, maybe miss the deadline, and risk the project\u2019s future. But Sam was alone, scared, and counting on me. I could hear the cars rushing past him, the anxiety in his voice. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed rescuing and the engineer who couldn\u2019t afford to fail.
