I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smile, picturing us laughing over dinner, finally having time just for each other. But as I look up, the next customer steps forward, groceries piled high. I force my attention back to the register, fingers moving automatically over the buttons. My manager expects me to be focused, to process every transaction without error, especially during these slow afternoons when mistakes are more noticeable. But my mind keeps drifting\u2014should I pick Wednesday, when I know I\u2019ll be tired after a double shift, or Friday, when I might be asked to cover for a sick coworker? I want to text him back right away, to show him he\u2019s my priority, but the beep of the scanner and the expectant faces in line remind me I can\u2019t. My chest tightens as I juggle the urge to be the attentive girlfriend he deserves and the reliable cashier my job demands. I stare at my phone, torn, as the next customer waits."}
