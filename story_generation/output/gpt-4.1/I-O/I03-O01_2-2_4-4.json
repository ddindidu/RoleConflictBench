He\u2019s been looking forward to it, dropping hints about a cozy dinner and maybe a movie at home. I want to be present, to laugh and talk and make him feel cherished. But my laptop sits open on the coffee table, the floor plan for the new office glowing on the screen. My client\u2019s email is marked urgent\u2014she needs revisions by tomorrow morning, and I know the layout isn\u2019t quite right. I keep picturing the cramped break room, the awkward hallway, the way the desks don\u2019t quite fit. My mind races with solutions, but every time I reach for my laptop, I see Alex watching me, his smile faltering. I feel torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the attentive girlfriend he deserves, the other unable to let go of the responsibility to design a space that truly works. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I sit frozen, heart pounding, caught between the warmth of his hand and the cold glow of my screen."}
