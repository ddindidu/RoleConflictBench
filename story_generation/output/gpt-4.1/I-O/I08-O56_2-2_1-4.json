I\u2019d tried to make her feel welcome then, and now, as her hairdresser, I wanted her to feel comfortable again. She barely met my eyes as I finished rinsing the dye, and when she caught her reflection, her lips pressed into a thin line. I could sense her disappointment, but she hesitated to say anything. As her acquaintance, I wanted to be warm and reassuring, to put her at ease and not make her feel awkward. But as her hairdresser, I knew I had to address her dissatisfaction directly, ask her what she didn\u2019t like, and offer solutions. I could feel the tension in my chest\u2014should I gently coax her to open up, risking making her uncomfortable, or keep things light and friendly, possibly leaving her unhappy with her hair? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I hesitated, unsure which part of myself to show her first."}
