As a mentor, I was supposed to help Priya prepare for her upcoming interview\u2014a chance that could define her career. She needed my guidance, my time, and my encouragement. She\u2019d already sent me her draft presentation, waiting for my feedback. But as a scientist, I was also responsible for the lab\u2019s safety. The maintenance checklist was due tomorrow, and though everything seemed fine, skipping or delaying it was against protocol. The expectation was clear: safety first, no exceptions. Yet, Priya\u2019s anxious message blinked on my screen, asking if I could meet her this afternoon. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I focused on Priya, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the lab. If I prioritized the checklist, I\u2019d be letting her down at a crucial moment. My mind raced, torn between the urge to nurture her growth and the obligation to uphold the standards that kept us all safe."}
