We\u2019d met a few times at mutual friends\u2019 parties, so I greeted her with a smile. She grinned back, then leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here? I\u2019m meeting someone after this and want to impress them.\u201d As her acquaintance, I wanted to help, to rattle off my favorite spots and make her feel welcome.\n\nBut as her hairdresser, I noticed her hair was damp and a little greasy from her workout. I was already running behind, and the next client was waiting. The salon policy was clear: I had to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting, especially when it looked like this. I could sense Jamie\u2019s embarrassment as she caught me glancing at her hair, and I felt a pang of guilt. Should I focus on making her comfortable as a friend, chatting about restaurants and ignoring the state of her hair? Or should I gently insist on a thorough wash, risking awkwardness but upholding my professional standards? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, unsure which to prioritize."}
