It was Sam, my oldest friend, texting in all caps: \u201cHELP! IKEA NIGHTMARE. CAN YOU VIDEO CALL?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014prime calling hour. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cKeep up the momentum, you\u2019re on track to break your record!\u201d I could almost taste the bonus, the recognition, the relief of finally not worrying about rent. But Sam\u2019s message tugged at me. We\u2019d always been there for each other, especially in moments like this, when frustration threatened to boil over. I imagined her surrounded by planks and screws, fighting back tears or laughter, hoping I\u2019d pick up. My headset felt heavier. If I paused now, I might lose my rhythm, maybe even fall short of the week\u2019s target. But if I ignored Sam, would I be letting her down when she needed me most? My thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding, torn between the friend I wanted to be and the employee I was expected to become."}
