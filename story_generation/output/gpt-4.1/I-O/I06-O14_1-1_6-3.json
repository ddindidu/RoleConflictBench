It was Thursday afternoon, and Dr. Patel\u2019s office hours had just started. As her mentee, I knew how much she valued punctuality and initiative\u2014she always said her door was open, but her time was precious. I\u2019d been struggling with a data analysis problem all week, and this was my chance to get her insight. But on my desk, the latest batch of cell culture results blinked on my laptop, waiting to be logged. As a scientist, I prided myself on keeping meticulous records, and I knew the importance of documenting findings while they were fresh. The logs could technically wait until tomorrow, but I felt uneasy about letting them pile up. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between respecting Dr. Patel\u2019s availability and upholding my own standards for scientific rigor. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I took a deep breath, feeling the tension coil in my chest, and tried to decide which responsibility I owed more in this moment."}
