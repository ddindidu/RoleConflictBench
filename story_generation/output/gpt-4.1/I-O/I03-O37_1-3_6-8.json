He thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with him, but I\u2019d only said I\u2019d try. Now he was upset, and I could feel the tension in every message. I wanted to call him, to clear things up before it grew into something bigger, but I was already late for my cleaning round. My supervisor had just reminded us\u2014no exceptions on safety protocols. Gloves, mask, sanitizer, every room, every time. I couldn\u2019t risk a warning or, worse, losing my job. But my phone kept buzzing in my pocket, and I knew he was waiting for an answer, expecting me to fix things like I always did. My hands shook as I sprayed disinfectant, torn between the urge to step out and call him, and the strict rules I was expected to follow. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
