He was moving to a new apartment this weekend and needed help with a few heavy boxes. \u201cCould you spare a couple of hours?\u201d he asked. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014helping out was the right thing to do, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call on. But as I read his message, my calendar notification chimed: the national continuing education program for pharmacists was scheduled for the same day. It was a rare, in-person event, crucial for maintaining my licensure and staying current with new treatments. My manager had emphasized its importance, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014Mark\u2019s hope for support, my professional duty to stay updated. I stared at the two commitments, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between being a helpful friend and a responsible pharmacist."}
