He leaned against the doorway, watching me work, and then casually remarked, \u201cDid you see the mess Sarah made of the last project? I don\u2019t know how she keeps her job.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but Mark was waiting for a response, expecting me to join in or at least nod in agreement.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a new furniture order. I needed to estimate the materials and place an order for supplies before the end of the day, or the project would be delayed. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to maintain a positive, respectful atmosphere with Mark and the urgent demands of my carpentry work. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention in a different way, and I stood there, caught between the unfinished cabinet and Mark\u2019s expectant gaze, unsure which responsibility to address first."}
