The line at the checkout stretched almost to the door, customers shifting impatiently, their baskets overflowing. As a cashier, I knew I had to stay focused\u2014scan each item, count the change, smile, and keep the line moving. Any mistake could mean a complaint or a loss for the store. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that my mentor\u2019s open office hours were about to end. She had emphasized how important it was to respect her time, to show up when she made herself available. I wanted to prove I was committed, that I valued her guidance. But I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post; my manager was already eyeing the line nervously. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to my job and the promise I\u2019d made to my mentor."}
