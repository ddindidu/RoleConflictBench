He grinned and called out, \u201cHey! Do you know any good places to eat around here?\u201d I could see he was hoping for a real conversation, maybe even a little catch-up. At the same moment, Mrs. Lee, one of my most loyal customers, walked in. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee always expected a personal greeting from me\u2014she said it made her feel special, and I knew it was part of why she kept coming back.\n\nI felt my stomach twist. Mark was waiting for my answer, his eyes bright with expectation, and I didn\u2019t want to brush him off. But Mrs. Lee was already looking around, searching for my face, and I knew she\u2019d be disappointed if I didn\u2019t greet her right away. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the helpful acquaintance Mark remembered and the attentive hairdresser Mrs. Lee counted on. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to be both at once, but I knew I couldn\u2019t give them both what they wanted in that moment."}
