I need your advice before I sign the offer.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew how much this decision meant for her, and as her mentor, I was expected to provide thoughtful, structured guidance\u2014especially now, when her entire career path could shift. But as I pulled up to the customer\u2019s address, the package on the seat beside me, I remembered the other expectation: to deliver with a smile, to be polite and professional, no matter what. The customer was already waiting at the door, checking their watch, clearly in a hurry. My phone buzzed again, her anxiety seeping through the screen. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my mentee needed my undivided attention, but so did my customer. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hand hovered over the phone, my other gripping the package, torn between the guidance I owed and the professionalism expected."}
