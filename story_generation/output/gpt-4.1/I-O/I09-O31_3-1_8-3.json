Physical fitness isn\u2019t just a personal goal; it\u2019s a job requirement. Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Kim, my neighbor. She was out of town and worried about her package deliveries, especially with the planned power interruption in our building. She asked if I could keep an eye out and maybe store any packages for her.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to the gym before my shift. But if I waited for the delivery, I\u2019d miss my workout, and that would mean showing up to work less prepared than I should be. As a neighbor, I wanted to help Mrs. Kim\u2014she\u2019s always been kind, and I know how stressful it is to be away. But as a police officer, I felt the weight of my duty to stay fit and ready for anything. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood in my hallway, torn, keys in hand, unable to move."}
