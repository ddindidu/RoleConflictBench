She leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cDid you see Mark\u2019s latest report? Total mess. I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d I felt a knot in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak badly about Mark, but Lisa\u2019s expectant look made it hard to just brush her off.\n\nMy phone buzzed\u2014my telemarketer shift was about to start. I braced myself for the calls ahead. Lately, prospects had been grilling me with technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely covered. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, but I often felt unprepared and exposed.
