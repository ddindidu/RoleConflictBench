The stakes were high\u2014my client\u2019s future, my reputation, and the pressure from the firm all weighed heavily on me. Just as I reached the elevator, I spotted Jamie, an old acquaintance from college, sitting on a bench, shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. Instinctively, I slowed down. Jamie looked up, eyes red and desperate, and managed a weak, \u201cHey, can we talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d\n\nAs a friend, I wanted to sit beside Jamie, listen, and offer comfort. I could see the expectation in their eyes, the silent plea for support.
