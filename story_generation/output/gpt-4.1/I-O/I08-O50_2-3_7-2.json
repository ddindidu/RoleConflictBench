He leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you hear about Dr. Patel\u2019s mistake last night? I can\u2019t believe they let that slide. Makes you wonder if she\u2019s really up for this job.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort\u2014gossip wasn\u2019t something I wanted to be part of, especially about someone\u2019s professional competence. But before I could respond, my pager buzzed urgently. The ICU needed me\u2014one of the life-support machines was flashing critical fault codes. My mind raced. As a machine repairer, I was expected to drop everything and diagnose the issue immediately; lives could depend on it. But Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting me to engage or at least acknowledge his comment. I felt torn, caught between the pressure to maintain professional integrity as an acquaintance and the urgent responsibility to fix the machine. My heart pounded as I stood there, wrestling with the weight of both expectations."}
