It was Sam, my closest friend, his name lighting up the screen. I answered, and immediately heard his shaky voice, thick with tears. He could barely get the words out\u2014something terrible had happened in his family. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort he needed.
