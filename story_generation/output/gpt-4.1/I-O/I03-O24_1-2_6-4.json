Why do you always change things last minute?\u201d My chest tightens. As his girlfriend, I know I should call him, talk it through, and smooth things over before the misunderstanding grows. He expects me to listen, to care, to resolve this quickly so we can enjoy our weekend together.\n\nBut my laptop screen glares at me, the blank document waiting for my judgment in the Martinez case. The trial ended yesterday, and the parties are anxious for a decision. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to write a clear, thorough opinion\u2014findings of fact, conclusions of law, every detail precise. The court expects professionalism and timeliness; the attorneys are already emailing for updates.\n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I call Alex now, I\u2019ll lose my focus and precious writing time. If I ignore him, the rift between us might widen. My mind races, torn between the demands of justice and the needs of my relationship, wishing I could be fully present for both."}
