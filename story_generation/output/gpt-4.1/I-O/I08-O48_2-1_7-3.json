As I entered Mrs. Lee\u2019s room, I found her chatting with another staff member, Carla, who I knew only as an acquaintance from the break room. Carla glanced at me and, with a conspiratorial tone, whispered, \u201cDid you see how sloppy Mark was with the medication cart yesterday? I don\u2019t know how he still has this job.\u201d I felt a jolt of discomfort. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but as a nursing assistant, I was expected to stay on schedule and record Mrs. Lee\u2019s vitals promptly. Carla\u2019s words hung in the air, waiting for my response, while Mrs. Lee looked at me expectantly, ready for her blood pressure check. My mind raced, torn between the urge to deflect the gossip and the pressure to remain professional and efficient in my duties. I could feel my face flush as I wrestled with what to do next."}
