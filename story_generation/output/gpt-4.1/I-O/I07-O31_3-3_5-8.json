As a colleague, I knew the task I was working on was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it by tomorrow, the whole team would miss the client\u2019s delivery. My manager had already reminded me twice how much was riding on this. But then my phone buzzed: a message from the precinct. I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on months ago. As a police officer, I couldn\u2019t ignore the summons; my testimony could make or break the case, and I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, no matter what. My stomach twisted. If I went to court, I\u2019d let my team down and risk the client relationship. If I stayed to finish the task, I\u2019d be shirking my duty as an officer. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I sat frozen, torn between loyalty to my colleagues and my oath as a police officer, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
