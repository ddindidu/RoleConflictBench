I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d My chest tightened. I knew she was right\u2014we\u2019d been circling the same fight about money all week, and I owed it to her to finally listen, to try and fix things between us. But just as I was about to reply, my supervisor\u2019s voice crackled through the intercom. \u201cHey, can you check the old press? It\u2019s acting up again. We can\u2019t afford downtime, even if it\u2019s slow.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I started troubleshooting now, I\u2019d be late getting home, and Mia would be waiting, probably angrier than before. But if I left the machine, the glitch might get worse, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations\u2014Mia needed me to be present, to resolve our conflict, but my job demanded my focus and expertise right now. I felt pulled in two directions, the pressure building as I stood frozen, phone in one hand, toolbox in the other, not sure which role needed me more."}
