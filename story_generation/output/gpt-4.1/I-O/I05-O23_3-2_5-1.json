The deadline for filing was just hours away, and every clause demanded my full attention. As a lawyer, I knew the stakes\u2014one overlooked detail could cost my client dearly. But just as I began to mark up the indemnity section, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, waiting in the conference room for our scheduled session. She was struggling with a critical task, one I\u2019d promised to guide her through. She needed my experience, my insight\u2014mistakes here could set her back months. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My client expected a flawless review, but Maya expected my mentorship. Both roles pulled at me, each demanding my undivided focus. My heart pounded as I weighed the consequences, torn between the urgent needs of my client and the responsibility I felt toward Maya\u2019s growth."}
