The blueprints for the custom cabinetry were spread out before me, and I could hear the distant hum of other tradespeople working on the site. The deadline loomed, and the contractor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need to finish by Friday, or we lose the client.\u201d Every joint, every measurement mattered, and I was the one everyone looked to for answers.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014my mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our call. She was preparing for her first big interview, nervous and full of questions. As her mentor, I was supposed to help her grow, to be present and encouraging, to give her the confidence she needed. She depended on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nI stared at the unfinished cabinet, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The team needed my expertise on the job site, but Sarah needed my guidance now. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the demands of my craft and the promise I\u2019d made to help someone else find their way."}
