I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My chest tightens. We\u2019ve argued about money every night this week, and I know he expects me to fix things, to smooth it over, to be the understanding girlfriend who can resolve our mess. But right now, I\u2019m staring at a radar screen, watching cloud tops surge higher than forecasted, and three pilots are waiting for my revised climb instructions. My headset crackles with their voices, each one depending on me to keep them safe, to communicate clearly and quickly. I glance at my phone, then back at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Alex wants answers, reassurance, a sign that I care. The pilots need precision, calm, and my undivided attention. My heart pounds as I try to steady my breathing, torn between the storm outside and the storm at home, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
