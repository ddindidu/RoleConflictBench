She was leaving for London on Monday, and I wanted every moment to count. We planned a picnic in the park, her favorite spot, and I could see how much it meant to her as she packed our basket with care. But as I drove us there, I spotted a car parked illegally near a fire hydrant. My uniform weighed heavier on me than usual. I knew the owner\u2014a single mother who worked two jobs and usually parked there only for a few minutes. Technically, I could let it slide, but I also knew my duty: fairness and integrity, no exceptions. Mia squeezed my hand, sensing my hesitation. \u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d she whispered, her eyes pleading for normalcy, for time uninterrupted by my badge. But the expectations of my job pressed in, demanding I act. I stood there, torn, the picnic basket in one hand and my ticket book in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me apart."}
