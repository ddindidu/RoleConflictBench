She\u2019s lived next door for years, and we\u2019ve shared countless small talk moments\u2014weather, groceries, the usual. I pride myself on being a good neighbor, always polite and approachable. But now, sitting at my desk, headset on, I hear her voice on the line. She\u2019s not Mrs. Lee from next door; she\u2019s Mrs. Lee, the frustrated customer, questioning every detail of the offer I\u2019m supposed to sell. Her tone is sharp, her patience thin. My job demands I stay professional, persuasive, and unyielding, but my mind races with the memory of her kind smile just an hour ago. I feel the pressure to defend the company, to push back against her objections, but I can\u2019t shake the worry that tomorrow, in the corridor, things will be different. My roles are colliding, and I\u2019m caught between being the friendly neighbor she expects and the persistent telemarketer my boss demands. My heart pounds as I prepare to respond, torn between two worlds that suddenly feel impossibly far apart."}
