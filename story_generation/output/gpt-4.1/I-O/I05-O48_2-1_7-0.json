As a mentor, I was supposed to meet with Sarah, my mentee, to help her prepare for her upcoming interview\u2014a chance that could change her career. She was counting on me to review her presentation and offer advice, and I knew how much this meant to her. At the same time, my duties as a nursing assistant pressed in. Mrs. Lee, one of my regular patients, needed help with her morning routine. She depended on me for bathing and dressing, and any delay would leave her feeling anxious and neglected. I could feel the weight of both expectations: Sarah\u2019s hope for guidance and Mrs. Lee\u2019s need for compassionate care. My phone buzzed with a reminder about Sarah\u2019s meeting, just as Mrs. Lee called out for help. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between nurturing a future nurse and caring for someone who needed me right now."}
