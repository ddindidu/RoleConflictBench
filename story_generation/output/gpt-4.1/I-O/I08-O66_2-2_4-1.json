It was Mark, an old acquaintance, asking if I could help him move some boxes into his new apartment. He sounded desperate\u2014his friends had bailed, and he was counting on me. I glanced at the rearview mirror; my current passenger was anxiously checking her watch. She told me her train was leaving in less than half an hour, and the station was all the way across town. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to get her there safely and on time. But as an acquaintance, I felt the pull to help Mark, especially since he rarely asked for favors. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my passenger and the urge to support a friend in need. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
