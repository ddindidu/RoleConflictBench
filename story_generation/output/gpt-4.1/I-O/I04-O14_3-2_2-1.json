It was 2:13 a.m. I squinted at the screen\u2014Sam. I answered, and immediately heard sobs. Through broken words, Sam told me about the accident, the hospital, the uncertainty. My heart clenched. I knew what I was supposed to do: listen, comfort, be present. But as I murmured soothing words, my eyes darted to the clock. In less than four hours, I needed to be at the lab. The mass spectrometer, booked months in advance, was finally available for my experiment. If I missed this window, my research would be set back for weeks, maybe months. I tried to focus on Sam\u2019s pain, but my mind kept drifting to calibration protocols and data sheets. I felt torn in two\u2014one part aching to be the friend Sam needed, the other gripped by the pressure of my scientific responsibilities. My hands shook as I held the phone, caught between the urge to stay and the knowledge that I might have to leave."}
