I glanced at the address\u2014just a few blocks away, but traffic was crawling. As I typed a courteous reply, my mentee, Sarah, called. She sounded anxious, asking for advice about whether to accept a new project at work. I knew she valued my guidance, even on small career choices, and I wanted to be there for her. But the customer was waiting for an update, and I was expected to respond quickly and professionally. My mind raced, torn between giving Sarah the thoughtful advice she deserved and maintaining the prompt, polite communication my job required. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations from both sides pulling me in opposite directions. My fingers hovered over my phone, unsure which message to send first."}
