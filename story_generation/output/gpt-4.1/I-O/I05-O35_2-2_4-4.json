My mentee, a new recruit, was counting on me to guide them through the safety protocols before their first big project. I\u2019d promised a thorough, structured session\u2014something I never had when I started. I wanted to give them the confidence and knowledge to succeed, to be the mentor I wished I\u2019d had.\n\nJust as I was about to begin, my radio crackled. \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart thudded. As a subway operator, passenger safety was my top priority. I was expected to respond quickly, assess the risk, and coordinate with security if needed. Every second counted.\n\nI looked at my mentee, their hopeful eyes fixed on me, waiting for guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my responsibility to teach, and my duty to protect. The demands clashed inside me, each urgent, each important. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
