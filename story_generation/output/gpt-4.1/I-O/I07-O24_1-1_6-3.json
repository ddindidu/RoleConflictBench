One message from a colleague caught my eye\u2014just an update, no action needed, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond promptly, show you\u2019re engaged. At the same time, a thick file sat open beside me, the new case I\u2019d been assigned as judge. The scheduling order wasn\u2019t complicated, but it required careful wording and attention to detail. The deadline loomed at the end of the week, and I could already feel the pressure to produce a clear, thorough order. My mind tugged in two directions: the expectation to be a responsive, reliable colleague, and the duty to uphold the standards of my judicial role. I stared at the blinking cursor in my inbox, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my time and focus, each unwilling to wait."}
