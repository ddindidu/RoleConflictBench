My best friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and as soon as I answered, I heard her sobbing. She could barely get the words out\u2014her father had been rushed to the hospital. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be the friend she needed, offering comfort and a steady voice. But as I listened, my mind drifted back to the pool. Earlier that evening, I\u2019d noticed a few chairs out of place. As a lifeguard, I was supposed to keep everything in order, even after hours. My supervisor had been clear: safety and order were non-negotiable, and I\u2019d already been warned once about leaving things untidy. Now, I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me, raw and vulnerable, but the nagging thought of those chairs and the possible consequences if I ignored my duty gnawed at me. I gripped the phone tighter, caught between the urge to rush to the pool and the need to stay present for my friend, my chest tight with the weight of both responsibilities."}
