As a neighbor, I knew how important it was to keep the peace, to respect the quiet that everyone expected in our building. I tried to hush him, feeling the weight of annoyed glances from behind closed doors. Just as I managed to coax him inside, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch was calling. There was a noise complaint in my building, a late-night party that had gotten out of hand. As a police officer, it was my duty to respond, to enforce the law and restore order, even if it meant confronting people I saw every day in the elevator. The thought of knocking on their door, badge visible, while knowing I struggled with my own dog\u2019s noise, twisted my stomach. I felt torn, caught between being the considerate neighbor everyone wanted and the officer everyone expected. My hand hovered over my badge as I stood outside the party door, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself I could satisfy."}
