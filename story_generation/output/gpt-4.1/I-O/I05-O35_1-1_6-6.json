It\u2019s optional, but I know management values those who participate. I should respond soon, but my mind drifts to my mentee, Jamie. During our last check-in, Jamie admitted to feeling overwhelmed, missing deadlines, and struggling to balance work and study. As a mentor, I want to help Jamie develop better time management skills, maybe even send a few resources or set up a meeting. But the train schedule is tight, and I\u2019m expected to maintain strict adherence to operational protocols\u2014no distractions, no delays. The control room expects my full attention, and any lapse could mean safety risks or disciplinary action. My phone buzzes again, Jamie asking for advice. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the urge to support Jamie\u2019s growth, and the duty to uphold the standards of my job. My fingers hover over the screen, torn between replying to Jamie, responding to the seminar email, or putting my phone away entirely. The train\u2019s departure signal blares, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, heart pounding, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
