The project\u2019s falling apart. Can you call me now?\u201d My heart clenched. I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide them through every hurdle, and I knew how much this project meant for their future. But just as I started to type a quick reply, a shrill alarm blared from the control panel. The brake system warning light flashed red\u2014protocol demanded I report it immediately and prepare to halt the train at the next station. Passengers\u2019 safety depended on my focus and swift action. My mind raced, torn between the urgent responsibility to hundreds of commuters and the commitment I\u2019d made to my mentee.
