As an acquaintance, I\u2019d always believed in keeping people\u2019s secrets safe, never fueling gossip or tarnishing someone\u2019s name. But now, as a police officer, I\u2019d been called to testify in court about a case that involved someone I knew\u2014someone whose reputation could be shattered by what I\u2019d learned. The information I held was sensitive, something I\u2019d stumbled upon in confidence, and I knew it could be twisted and used against them. My duty as an officer demanded integrity and fairness, to tell the truth under oath, no matter who was involved. But the thought of being the reason for someone\u2019s downfall, especially someone I\u2019d shared laughs and stories with, made my stomach twist. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding loyalty in a different way. I closed my eyes, torn between protecting a friend and upholding the law, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be lost."}
