She texted me this morning, asking if I could sign for it since she\u2019s always missing deliveries. I agreed, knowing how much she relies on me for these little favors. But just as I\u2019m about to settle in, my phone buzzes\u2014my taxi app pings with a ride request. It\u2019s a busy time, and I need the extra fare. I grab my keys and head out, hoping the delivery will be late.\n\nOn my route, a construction detour squeezes traffic into a single lane right by the elementary school. Kids are everywhere, darting along the sidewalk, and the crossing guard waves us through slowly. I feel the pressure to keep moving\u2014my passenger is already late, and the other drivers behind me are impatient. But as a taxi driver, I know I can\u2019t rush, especially here. My mind keeps drifting back to the package, wondering if the delivery truck is already at my door, and to the kids, knowing I can\u2019t risk their safety. I grip the wheel, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the responsible driver, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
