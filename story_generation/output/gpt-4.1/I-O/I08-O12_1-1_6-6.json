A few colleagues were dissecting the latest changes to our project, and someone brought up the minor UI glitch that had been reported. As a software developer, I knew the bug well\u2014it was harmless, with a simple workaround, and I had a long list of more urgent issues to tackle. Still, the group\u2019s tone shifted, and soon they were criticizing the colleague who had made the decision to prioritize other fixes over this one.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to steer the conversation away from negativity. I didn\u2019t want to join in or encourage gossip, especially since I knew how hard that colleague worked. But as a developer, I also felt the unspoken expectation to defend the technical choices and perhaps even explain why the bug hadn\u2019t been fixed yet. My mind raced, torn between wanting to protect a peer\u2019s reputation and feeling the pressure to justify my own work. The group looked at me, waiting for my input, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet."}
