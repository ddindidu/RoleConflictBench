The store was quiet, just a few customers left, and I smiled as I scanned their groceries, making small talk as expected. My manager always reminded us to be extra friendly, especially on slow nights. But my mind kept drifting to my apartment building, where Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone. The storm advisory had been all over the news, warning of power outages and flooding. I knew she\u2019d be anxious, maybe even scared, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check on her if anything like this ever happened.\n\nBut here I was, stuck behind the counter, my shift not ending for another hour. I felt torn\u2014my job demanded I stay cheerful and attentive, but my conscience nagged at me to be a good neighbor, to make sure Mrs. Lee was safe and not sitting in the dark, worried and alone. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, my smile more forced, as I wrestled with the pull of both roles, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
