The words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that about me in front of everyone.\u201d My stomach dropped. I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt Jamie, but I could tell from the message that I had. As a friend, I knew I needed to call Jamie right away, to apologize and explain myself before the misunderstanding grew any worse. But as I looked around the pool deck, I noticed a few chairs were out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standards I was expected to maintain as a lifeguard. My supervisor had been strict lately, reminding us that even small lapses could lead to bigger problems. I felt torn, the phone heavy in my hand. Jamie needed me now, but so did my job. The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the urge to fix things with my friend and the responsibility to keep the pool in order."}
