I could sense the tension in her words, and I knew she expected me to clear things up, to be the boyfriend who smooths over these little bumps before they become bigger. But just then, my next client sat in my chair, her hair still damp and smelling faintly of her own shampoo. \u201cI washed it right before I came,\u201d she said, smiling. The salon policy was clear\u2014every client gets a wash and condition before a cut, no exceptions. My boss was strict about it, and I\u2019d been warned before. But her hair was spotless, and I could tell she\u2019d be annoyed if I insisted. I felt the pressure mounting: Mia waiting for reassurance, my client expecting a quick start, my boss expecting rules to be followed. My mind raced, torn between being the attentive boyfriend and the reliable hairdresser, knowing I couldn\u2019t please everyone at once."}
