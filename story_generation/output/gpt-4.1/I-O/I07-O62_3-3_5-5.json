As a colleague, I knew the report I was working on was crucial\u2014my manager had reminded me twice that it was the linchpin for our client\u2019s delivery. The deadline was today, and everyone was counting on me to finish. But as I glanced out the window toward the pool, I remembered the grinding noise I\u2019d heard from the filtration system during my morning rounds. The manual was clear: any malfunction had to be addressed immediately to keep swimmers safe. My heart pounded as I imagined the risk if I ignored it, but if I left my desk now, I\u2019d miss the deadline and let my team down. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice between my duty to my colleagues and my responsibility as a lifeguard."}
