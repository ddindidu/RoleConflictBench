It was Jamie, an old friend from college, her voice shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on Maple Road. Can you help? There\u2019s no one else nearby.\u201d I glanced at the dashboard clock\u2014fifteen minutes until I had to deliver urgent medical supplies to the hospital. The instructions from my supervisor echoed in my mind: \u201cThis delivery is critical. Patients are waiting.\u201d I could picture the hospital staff anxiously awaiting the supplies, and the consequences if I was late. But Jamie sounded desperate, stranded and alone. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help her, offer comfort, maybe even a ride. Yet as a delivery person, I was bound by duty, expected to be reliable and punctual, especially with something so important. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the pull of friendship and the weight of responsibility, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
