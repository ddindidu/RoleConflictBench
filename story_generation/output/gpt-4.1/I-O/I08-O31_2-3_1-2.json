He barely spoke, eyes darting around, clutching his drink like a lifeline. I kept my tone light, asking about his job, his hobbies, anything to draw him out. I could tell he appreciated the effort, even if he only managed a few words at a time. Suddenly, my radio crackled at my hip\u2014an armed robbery, just a few blocks away. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to protect lives and restore order. But as an acquaintance, I was supposed to be present, approachable, and supportive, especially for someone as anxious as Eli. I saw his face pale at the sound of my radio, and I knew leaving abruptly might make him feel even more isolated. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I stood frozen, torn between duty and compassion, the party noise fading as I wrestled with what to do next."}
