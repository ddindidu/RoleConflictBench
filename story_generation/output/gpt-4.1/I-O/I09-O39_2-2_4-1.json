Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a look\u2014her usual silent plea for peace and quiet. I tried to hush my dog, feeling the weight of her expectation that I keep the hallway calm and respectful for everyone. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: a text from the site foreman. The carpenter needed the next load of lumber, and I was already running behind. If I didn\u2019t get back soon, the whole crew would be waiting, and I\u2019d be letting them down. My mind raced, torn between calming my dog to keep the peace with my neighbor and sprinting back to the site to keep the job moving. I could feel the pressure from both sides, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stood frozen in the hallway, caught between the expectations of home and work, not sure which way to turn."}
