She was nervous, and I could hear the anxiety in her voice. I knew how important it was to be patient, to share every bit of knowledge I had so she wouldn\u2019t make a costly mistake. Just as I was explaining a crucial detail, my work phone buzzed with a message from a customer. They wanted an update on their delivery\u2014something I was responsible for as well. The company expected me to respond quickly, always polite and professional, no matter how busy I was. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I ignored the customer, I risked a complaint. If I rushed my mentee, she might miss something vital. My mind raced, torn between the need to be a supportive mentor and the demand to be a reliable delivery person. My heart pounded as I weighed which expectation to meet first, knowing that either choice would leave someone disappointed."}
