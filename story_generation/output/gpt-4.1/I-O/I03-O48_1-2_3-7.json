Just us.\u201d I smile, thinking about how we\u2019ve both been so busy, and how rare it is to have a stretch of free evenings like this. He\u2019s been looking forward to some real time together, and honestly, so have I. But as I tuck my phone away, I catch sight of Mrs. Carter, my patient, sitting quietly by her window. She\u2019s just had surgery, and I can see the worry in her eyes, the way her hands tremble when she thinks no one\u2019s watching. She\u2019s asked if I could stay a little longer tomorrow, maybe just to talk or play cards. I know how much it means to her\u2014she\u2019s told me how lonely the nights can get. My heart tugs in two directions: Alex\u2019s hopeful anticipation, Mrs. Carter\u2019s silent plea. I feel the weight of both their needs pressing on me, and I can\u2019t help but wonder how I\u2019m supposed to choose between being the girlfriend Alex deserves and the nursing assistant Mrs. Carter needs."}
