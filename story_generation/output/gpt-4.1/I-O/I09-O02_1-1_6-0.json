I have to be out, and it\u2019s important.\u201d I nodded, knowing she often missed deliveries and counted on me for these small favors. I glanced at my laptop, where a half-finished technical proposal blinked on the screen. My team was waiting for my input on a new design approach, and though the project was still in early discussions, I felt the pressure to contribute something innovative before the afternoon meeting.\n\nI promised Mrs. Lee I\u2019d help, but as the clock ticked closer to the delivery window, my mind raced. If I stepped away from my desk to watch for the courier, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and risk missing the chance to shape the project\u2019s direction. But if I focused on work, I might let down a neighbor who trusted me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself torn, heart pounding, between being the reliable neighbor and the dedicated engineer."}
