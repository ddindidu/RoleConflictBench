I wanted to be the kind of neighbor who was friendly and approachable, someone who made a good first impression. As I stepped into the hallway, cake balanced carefully, my phone buzzed with an urgent notification. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk\u2014one that demanded my immediate attention as a judge. The expectation was clear: I needed to review the case files thoroughly and make a ruling within the hour. \n\nStanding there, I could hear voices from the apartment next door, the perfect opportunity to say hello. But the weight of the case pressed on me. If I delayed, someone\u2019s safety could be at risk. If I ignored my neighbors, I might come across as cold or unfriendly, undermining the sense of community I hoped to build. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the cake in my hand and the files waiting on my laptop, wrestling with the impossible demands of both roles."}
