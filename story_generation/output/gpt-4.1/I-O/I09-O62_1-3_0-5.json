As I rounded the corner, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor. She smiled warmly, expecting our usual friendly exchange. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she chirped, pausing as if she wanted to chat. I managed a quick hello and a strained smile, but my thoughts were elsewhere. Just before leaving my apartment, I\u2019d received a message from the pool maintenance team: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed before the pool opened, swimmers could be at risk. As a lifeguard, I knew I had to get there immediately to inspect the equipment and possibly close the pool. But as a neighbor, I felt the tug of guilt for not stopping to talk, for not being as friendly as Mrs. Lee expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding urgency for safety, the other expecting warmth and connection. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the two, heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do next."}
