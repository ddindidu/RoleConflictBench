I could tell from the way he barely glanced up that work had worn him down again. As his girlfriend, I wanted to sit beside him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014maybe even make his favorite tea. But my shift as a housekeeping cleaner had just ended, and I could still feel the faint stickiness of cleaning chemicals on my hands. I\u2019d only worn gloves for the toughest jobs, not all of them, and the protocols at work echoed in my mind: always wear gloves, always wash thoroughly, never bring germs home. \n\nMark looked up, his eyes searching for reassurance, and I hesitated. Should I go to him, risking that I might not be as clean as I should be? Or should I keep my distance, wash up again, and risk making him feel even more alone? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, torn between the urge to comfort and the need to protect."}
