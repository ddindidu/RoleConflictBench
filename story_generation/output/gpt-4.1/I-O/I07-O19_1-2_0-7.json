In ten minutes, our weekly team meeting would start\u2014a routine catch-up where my presence as a colleague was expected, even though the meeting would be recorded for anyone who couldn\u2019t make it. I knew my manager valued active participation, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged or unreliable to my teammates.\n\nBut at the same time, I had registered for a local workshop on updated prescription guidelines, scheduled to begin at the exact same time. As a pharmacist, staying current with the latest recommendations was crucial for patient safety and effective counseling. Missing this workshop meant falling behind on important changes that could impact my practice.\n\nI stared at my calendar, feeling the pressure mount from both sides. My colleagues expected me to be present and involved, while my professional responsibility demanded I keep my knowledge sharp. The two roles pulled at me, each with their own set of expectations, and I felt caught in the middle, uncertain which obligation should take priority."}
