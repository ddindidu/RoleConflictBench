My phone buzzed with another message from my manager: \u201cNeed your estimates by noon.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours left. My mind raced through project dependencies, resource bottlenecks, and the pressure to get it right. But behind me, I heard quiet sobs. My girlfriend was curled up, clutching a pillow, her eyes red and swollen. She\u2019d lost her brother just days ago, and every moment felt raw and heavy. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I wanted to hold her, to listen, to be the anchor she could lean on. But the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. If I missed this deadline, the whole project could slip. My heart ached as I looked between her and the glowing screen, torn by the impossible choice between being the partner she deserved and the engineer my team relied on."}
