As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was part of the team. The meeting was routine, nothing urgent, and I knew it would be recorded for anyone who missed it. Still, I felt the unspoken pressure to be present, to show I cared about the group.\n\nBut as an air traffic controller, my headset buzzed with a different kind of urgency. An aircraft was approaching the boundary of our sector, about to cross into the neighboring airspace. Coordination was standard, but it required my full attention\u2014one misstep could disrupt the flow and put lives at risk. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of seamless handovers.\n\nI felt the tug-of-war inside me. My team expected my presence and participation, but the pilots and passengers depended on my focus and precision. My hand hovered over the mouse, torn between clicking into the meeting and staying glued to the radar. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
