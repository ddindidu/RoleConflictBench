The assignment was due in three days, and I knew she expected me to not only finish it but also understand every part. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the factory floor. The operator was having trouble with the new press, and from the photos, I could see the material waste piling up. I was supposed to guide him, make sure he learned the right settings, but every time I explained, he\u2019d try something different and make it worse. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTake initiative, show me you can handle complex tasks.\u201d But the operator needed me now, and if I didn\u2019t help, the waste would keep growing. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me desperate to prove myself as a mentee, the other knowing I couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility of guiding the operator. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between debugging my code and composing another message to the floor, my chest tight with the weight of both expectations."}
