My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen. It was Mia. I hesitated, but the message preview flashed: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m upset about this weekend.\u201d My chest tightened. We\u2019d had a mix-up about our plans, and I knew she expected me to call and sort it out, to be the boyfriend who could smooth things over before it grew into something bigger. But the foreman was making his rounds, and I still had tools scattered everywhere. If I left the area messy, someone could trip, or worse. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014Mia needed me to be present and attentive, but the job demanded my focus and responsibility. My hands shook as I weighed the phone in my palm, torn between the urge to call her and the duty to keep my site safe."}
