We\u2019d met a few times at community events, so when he waved me over, I smiled and walked his way. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here?\u201d he asked, rubbing his stomach. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling off lately, but I\u2019m starving and want to try something new.\u201d\n\nAs his acquaintance, I wanted to be friendly and helpful, maybe suggest the Italian place down the street. But as a doctor, I couldn\u2019t ignore the way he looked\u2014pale, a bit sweaty, and the way he mentioned feeling \u201coff.\u201d My mind immediately started running through possible diagnoses, especially since I\u2019d seen a few patients today with odd, overlapping symptoms that didn\u2019t fit any textbook illness. Should I just recommend a restaurant and keep things light, or should I probe further, risking overstepping our casual relationship? The expectations of being a supportive acquaintance clashed with my responsibility as a doctor to notice and act on potential health issues. I stood there, torn, unsure which role should guide my next words."}
