Glancing at the screen, I saw a string of messages from my girlfriend: \u201cCan you talk? Bad day. Need you.\u201d My heart clenched. She\u2019d just gotten some tough feedback at work, and I knew she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the boyfriend she could lean on. But right in front of me, my new client was frowning at her reflection, her lips pressed tight. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not quite what I pictured,\u201d she said, voice trembling with disappointment. I could see her trying to be polite, but her eyes darted to the brassy highlights. I wanted to fix it, to make her happy, to prove myself as a professional. My mind raced\u2014should I step away for a moment and call my girlfriend, or focus on my client and risk my partner feeling abandoned? Both needed me, both expected me to be present, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, the weight of their needs pressing down on me as I stood there, scissors in hand, heart pounding."}
