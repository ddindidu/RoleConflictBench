I\u2019d always told my mentees I\u2019d be there for them, even for small things, so I started typing a thoughtful reply. Just then, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? And we want to split the fare,\u201d one said, already looking impatient. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be efficient and courteous, helping with luggage and making sure the ride goes smoothly. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my mentee was waiting, probably anxious about their decision. I felt torn, caught between the urge to provide guidance and the immediate demand to deliver professional service. My hands hovered, one on the phone, the other reaching for a suitcase, my mind racing with the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
