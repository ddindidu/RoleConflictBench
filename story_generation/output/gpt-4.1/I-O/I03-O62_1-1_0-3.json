He\u2019d just finished a long shift at the hospital, and I could see the exhaustion in his eyes. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside him, listen to his day, and offer the comfort I knew he needed. But as I scanned the pool deck, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. A few pool chairs were out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standards I was expected to maintain. My supervisor had been strict lately, reminding us that even small lapses could reflect poorly on the team. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Jake needed my attention, but so did my job. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the urge to be there for him and the responsibility to keep everything in order. I stood frozen for a moment, caught between the demands of love and duty, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
