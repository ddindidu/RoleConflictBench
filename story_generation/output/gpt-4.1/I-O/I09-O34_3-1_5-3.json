The HOA had sent out reminders about the inspection today, warning that anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited. As her neighbor, I felt responsible to remind her\u2014she\u2019s forgetful, and a violation could mean a hefty fine for her. But as I put my headset on, the radio crackled: \u201cTower, this is Delta 452, requesting altimeter setting.\u201d My heart raced. I knew the pilots depended on me for accurate, timely information, and any delay could compromise safety. Yet, if I didn\u2019t act now, Mrs. Lee might get in trouble, and the whole floor could be at risk during the inspection. I stared at the corridor, then at my console, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
