She tried to smile, but her voice trembled as she told me about the harsh feedback her boss gave her today. I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, hold her hand, and listen\u2014be the boyfriend she needed, the one who could help her feel safe and understood. But my mind kept drifting to the job site. Tomorrow, I\u2019m responsible for the team\u2019s safety, and I haven\u2019t checked the tools yet. If I don\u2019t inspect and maintain them tonight, I risk someone getting hurt, or worse. I could see the expectation in Mia\u2019s eyes, silently pleading for comfort, while the weight of my responsibility as a carpenter pressed on my chest. I stood there, torn, feeling the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding my heart, the other my diligence."}
