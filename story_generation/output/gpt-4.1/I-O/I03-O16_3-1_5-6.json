It\u2019s Saturday afternoon\u2014the last weekend before Alex leaves for his new job in Berlin. We\u2019d planned to spend every moment together, to make memories that would last until he returns. My phone buzzes with his message: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you tonight.\u201d I smile, but the smile fades as I look at the patient chart in my hand. Mrs. Lee sits across from me, her voice raspy, her throat red and swollen. She needs my full attention, a careful diagnosis, and the right prescription. I know she\u2019s counting on me to help her feel better, just as Alex is counting on me to be present, to cherish these precious hours. The weight of both expectations presses on me\u2014my patient\u2019s health, my partner\u2019s heart. I feel torn, wishing I could split myself in two, but knowing I can\u2019t. My mind races, caught between the exam room and the promise of one last evening together."}
