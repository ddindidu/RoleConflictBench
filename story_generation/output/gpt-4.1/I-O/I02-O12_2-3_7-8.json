The production outage is still unresolved, and the root cause is a bug I pushed last night. Customers are locked out, and the pressure to fix it is suffocating. I stare at the error logs, my mind racing, but I can\u2019t focus. My girlfriend sits across from me, arms folded, eyes red from crying. We\u2019ve argued about money every night this week, and she\u2019s waiting for me to say something, to fix things between us. I know she expects me to listen, to apologize, to help us move forward. But my team is counting on me, and every minute the service is down, the stakes get higher. I feel split in two\u2014torn between the person I love and the job I can\u2019t afford to fail at. My heart pounds as I look from my laptop to her, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I have to give."}
