The store is quiet, but my mind is anything but. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another message from Mia. She\u2019s had a rough day, her boss criticized her project, and she\u2019s been texting me, needing comfort. I glance at the screen: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart aches for her, wanting to drop everything and call, to be the boyfriend she deserves, to reassure her that she\u2019s more than her boss\u2019s words.\n\nBut the drawer in front of me is full of cash, and the numbers on the screen have to match exactly.
