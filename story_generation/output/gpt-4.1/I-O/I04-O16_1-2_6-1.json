She\u2019s anxious, searching my face for answers I don\u2019t yet have. I glance at her chart, mind racing through possible diagnoses, but nothing fits neatly. At the same time, I know my friend is waiting for me to confirm our meeting spot. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I promised I\u2019d clear it up. I can almost feel his confusion and disappointment through the unanswered messages piling up on my phone. As a friend, I want to be there for him, to communicate openly and fix things before they get worse. But as a doctor, I owe my patient my full attention, to listen carefully and piece together the clues she\u2019s giving me. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel torn, caught between the urgent needs of someone I care about and the professional responsibility I can\u2019t ignore. My hand hovers over my phone, heart pounding, as I wrestle with what to do next."}
