It was a message from Mia: \u201cCan you talk? I had a terrible day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift had just started, and protocol demanded that I finish the supply check before we could respond to any calls. But I could picture her, sitting on the couch, eyes red, replaying the harsh words from her boss. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. Yet, the weight of my uniform pressed on me, reminding me that if I missed a missing item, it could cost someone their life later. My mind raced between the sterile order of the ambulance and the raw emotion in Mia\u2019s text. I wanted to drop everything and call her, but I also knew the responsibility I carried here. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood frozen, phone in one hand, checklist in the other, heart torn between duty and love."}
