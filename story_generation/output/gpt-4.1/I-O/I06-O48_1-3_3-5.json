As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I had questions, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in the patient\u2019s chart\u2014something minor, but I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cAlways ask, don\u2019t guess.\u201d But as a nursing assistant, my patient in room 204 was in critical condition. I had to check her vitals every few minutes, and she\u2019d just had a worrying dip in her blood pressure. My phone buzzed with a reminder to message my mentor, but I could see the patient\u2019s monitor flashing. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectation to be a diligent mentee against the urgent responsibility to my patient. I felt torn, anxiety prickling at my skin, knowing that whichever role I chose to fulfill in this moment, I\u2019d be letting the other one down."}
