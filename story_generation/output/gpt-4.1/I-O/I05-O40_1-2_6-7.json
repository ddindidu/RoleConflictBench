She confessed she was overwhelmed, deadlines piling up, unsure how to prioritize. As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide her, to help her untangle the knots of her schedule and encourage her to grow through these challenges. I wanted to give her my full attention, to listen and offer advice that might make a difference.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently. The homeowner\u2019s message flashed on the screen: the deck was worse than expected, boards splintered and unsafe. They needed me there now, to assess and start repairs before the weekend gathering. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency\u2014someone could get hurt, and my reputation depended on reliability.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between the expectation to nurture my mentee\u2019s growth and the demand to restore the homeowner\u2019s deck. My mind raced, guilt gnawing at me. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both needed me now. I stared at my coffee, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between who I am and who I\u2019m needed to be."}
