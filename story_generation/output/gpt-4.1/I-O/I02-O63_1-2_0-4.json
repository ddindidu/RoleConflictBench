My girlfriend sits on the couch, her shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the TV but not really watching. I can tell she\u2019s had one of those days\u2014nothing catastrophic, just the slow grind of work wearing her down. I want to sit beside her, ask about her day, listen, maybe make her laugh. That\u2019s what she needs from me, and I want to be there for her.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: only an hour left in my shift, and I\u2019m still three sales short of my weekly target. Management\u2019s been clear\u2014no exceptions, no excuses. If I don\u2019t hit the numbers, I risk losing my bonus, maybe even my job. My headset feels heavier as I glance between her and the phone. She looks up, offering a small, tired smile, and I feel the pull in both directions. I want to be the boyfriend she deserves, but the pressure to perform at work is crushing. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between dialing the next number and sitting down beside her."}
