It\u2019s Jamie, my closest friend, texting: \u201cHad the worst day. Can you talk?\u201d I know what that means\u2014she needs me to listen, to be there, to help her feel less alone. But the supervisor is already calling everyone together, and today\u2019s briefing is about new safety protocols. Missing it isn\u2019t an option; I\u2019m expected to be focused, attentive, and ready to operate the subway safely. My thumb hovers over the screen, torn. If I ignore Jamie, I\u2019ll feel like a terrible friend, but if I text back, I risk being late or distracted, which could have serious consequences. My heart pounds as I stare at the message, caught between the weight of my friend\u2019s need and the responsibility of my job."}
