As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to step out from behind the counter, wrap my arms around him, and tell him everything would be okay. But as the cashier on duty, I had to keep my composure, greet him like any other customer, and follow every store policy to the letter. My manager was watching from the office window, and I knew I couldn\u2019t show favoritism or break protocol, not even for Alex.\n\nAt the same time, I noticed a small discrepancy in my register\u2014just a few cents off, but enough to require me to fill out a report and double-check the receipts. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no exceptions. Alex waited at the counter, his eyes pleading for comfort, while my hands shook as I counted the bills again. I felt torn in two, desperate to be the supportive girlfriend he needed, but bound by the rules of my job. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between what my heart wanted and what my responsibilities demanded."}
