She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries, especially since the building was expecting a power interruption. I assured her I\u2019d help, knowing how much she worries about her online orders. Not long after, I picked up my first passenger, a young man heading to a casual meeting. He seemed relaxed, chatting about the weather, and mentioned he wasn\u2019t in a rush. As we drove, my phone buzzed\u2014a delivery notification for Mrs. Lee. The package would arrive soon, right in the middle of my shift. I felt a knot in my stomach. As a neighbor, I wanted to be reliable, to help Mrs. Lee as promised. But as a taxi driver, I was expected to focus on my passenger, ensuring a safe, uninterrupted ride. The conflicting pull between my promise to Mrs. Lee and my duty to my passenger weighed on me, and I found myself wrestling with what to do next."}
