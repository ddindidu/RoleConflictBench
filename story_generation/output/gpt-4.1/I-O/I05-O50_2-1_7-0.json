My phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, Sarah. She was anxious about her upcoming interview for a team lead position, and she wanted to meet right away to go over her presentation. As her mentor, I knew how much this meant to her. She\u2019d worked hard, and I was supposed to help her grow, to be there when she needed guidance most.\n\nJust as I was about to reply, my supervisor called. The old packaging machine, the one that only ran during peak times, was acting up again. It was a slow day, but the glitch was unpredictable, and if I didn\u2019t catch it now, it could halt production when we needed it most. As the only one who really understood its quirks, everyone expected me to drop everything and fix it.\n\nI stared at my phone, then at the blinking light on my work tablet. Sarah was counting on me to help her seize a big opportunity. The team was counting on me to keep the machines running smoothly. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands, feeling pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
