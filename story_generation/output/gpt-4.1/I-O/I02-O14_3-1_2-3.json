My partner\u2019s quiet sobs drifted from the living room, each one tugging at me. She\u2019d lost her brother just yesterday, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. But the data from this week\u2019s experiment was fresh in my mind, and I\u2019d always prided myself on keeping meticulous records. I could technically log the results later, but the urge to capture every detail while it was clear gnawed at me. I felt the weight of her grief pressing through the walls, and guilt twisted in my chest. Was I a bad boyfriend for even considering my work right now? Or a bad scientist for letting emotion pull me away from accuracy? My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the call of duty and the call of love, heart and mind locked in a silent battle."}
