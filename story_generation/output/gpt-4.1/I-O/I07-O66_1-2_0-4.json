My phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: team meeting in five minutes. As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was engaged, even if it was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my absence would be noticed. At the same time, as a taxi driver, my focus had to be on the slick roads and unpredictable traffic. Cars darted between lanes, brake lights flaring in the downpour. I gripped the wheel tighter, feeling the tension in my shoulders. If I joined the meeting now, even just audio, I\u2019d be distracted\u2014risking my safety and that of my passenger. But if I skipped it, I\u2019d let my team down, maybe even miss something important. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself caught between the demands of being a reliable colleague and a responsible driver, heart pounding as I weighed what to do next."}
