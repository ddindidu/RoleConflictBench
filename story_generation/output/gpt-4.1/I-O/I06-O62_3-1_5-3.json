But as I paced the pool deck, my lifeguard supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the pool area tidy at all times.\u201d I glanced at the row of pool chairs, a few askew from the last swim class. They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, but I knew the expectation\u2014everything in order, always. My mind raced. If I stopped to message my mentor now, I\u2019d be ignoring my duty to maintain the pool area. But if I fixed the chairs first, I\u2019d be delaying the honest communication my mentor expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
