Glancing at the screen, I saw a message from Jamie: \u201cUgh, today was endless. Can you talk?\u201d I knew Jamie needed me to listen, to be the friend who always made time, especially on days like this. But as I started to type a quick reply, my eyes caught a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a couple of dollars off, nothing major, but enough to be noted. Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager always reminded us that even the smallest mistake had to be reported. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Jamie expected me to be present, to care, to listen. The store expected me to be diligent, to follow the rules without question. My fingers hovered over my phone, my mind racing between the comfort my friend needed and the responsibility I owed my job."}
