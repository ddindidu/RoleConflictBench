The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected nothing less than a polished, working solution. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the client meeting for the new office floor plan was tomorrow. As the architect, I was responsible for designing functional spaces that would shape how dozens of people worked every day. The sketches on my desk were rough, the circulation paths unclear, and I hadn\u2019t even started on the breakout areas. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cShow me your best effort\u201d\u2014while my client\u2019s email pressed, \u201cWe need to see your vision.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding my full attention. If I focused on the code, the floor plan would suffer; if I dove into the design, my mentor would be disappointed. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
