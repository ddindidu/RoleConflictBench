The grief in the room was heavy, and I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to listen, to be the comfort he needed. He looked at me with red-rimmed eyes, searching for reassurance, and I reached for his hand, feeling the weight of his pain.\n\nBut my phone buzzed on the nightstand\u2014a reminder from my clerk. The case file for the upcoming procedural hearing had just arrived, and I was expected to review it thoroughly before the hearing in two weeks. It was a straightforward matter, but the expectation was clear: diligence, attention, and professionalism, no matter how routine the case.\n\nI glanced at the thick folder, then back at my partner. My mind raced with the demands of both worlds\u2014one asking for my empathy and presence, the other for my focus and impartiality. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t give my all to both at the same time. I took a deep breath, feeling the tension coil inside me, torn between the robe I wore in court and the love I held in this room."}
