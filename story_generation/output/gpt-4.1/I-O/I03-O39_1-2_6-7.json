It\u2019s Mia\u2014her message pops up, sharp and urgent: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re working Saturday? I thought we had plans.\u201d My stomach twists. We\u2019d talked about this, hadn\u2019t we? Or maybe I forgot. She hates when I leave things hanging, expects me to talk things through, not just brush them off. I want to call her, to fix it before it grows into something bigger. But the foreman\u2019s voice booms across the site, calling everyone to the safety briefing. It\u2019s non-negotiable\u2014if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get written up, maybe even sent home. The guys are already gathering, and I can\u2019t be the one holding things up. My thumb hovers over the call button, heart pounding. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t be the perfect girlfriend and the reliable worker at the same time. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
