Every second counted, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. Just as I rounded the corner, Mrs. Lee from next door stepped out, her arms full of groceries. She smiled warmly and greeted me, expecting the usual friendly hello and a moment of neighborly small talk. I knew she valued these brief exchanges, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or uncaring. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another urgent message from the hospital. My hands itched to get to the machine, to start diagnosing, to do what I was trained for. I stood there, caught between the polite neighbor I wanted to be and the machine repairer I needed to be, my heart pounding as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
