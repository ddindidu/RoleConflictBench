The deadline was generous, and my teammates could keep working without my part for now. Still, I knew my manager expected me to stay on top of things and not let tasks pile up. Just as I was about to dive in, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my next client was arriving soon at the salon where I worked evenings. \n\nWhen she sat in my chair, her hair was still damp, smelling faintly of her own shampoo. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she said, smiling. The salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. My boss insisted it was about quality and consistency. But the client looked uncomfortable at the thought of another wash, and I could see she valued her time. \n\nI felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my colleagues counting on me to be reliable, my boss expecting strict adherence to salon rules, and my client hoping for flexibility. My mind raced, torn between following protocol and respecting her wishes, all while knowing my other job\u2019s tasks were waiting for me."}
