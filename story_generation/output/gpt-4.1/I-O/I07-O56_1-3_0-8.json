As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was engaged, even if it was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my manager appreciated when everyone participated live. Meanwhile, my client sat in the chair, her hair thick with product buildup, the strands clumping together in stubborn tangles. As her hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition her hair thoroughly before I could even think about cutting or styling. If I rushed, I\u2019d risk damaging her hair or giving her a bad experience. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, but my mind was split\u2014should I step away for the meeting and leave her waiting, or focus on her hair and miss the live discussion? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own consequences. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to let down."}
