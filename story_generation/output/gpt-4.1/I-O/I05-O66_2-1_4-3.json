In just thirty minutes, I was supposed to lead a crucial mentoring session for my team, sharing the strategies they needed to finish our project on time. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides and examples, determined to give them the guidance I never had. But right now, I was behind the wheel of my taxi, stuck with a passenger who needed to get across town. The roads were clear, the speed limits reasonable, and I knew I could shave off a few minutes if I pushed the limits just a bit. But as a taxi driver, I was expected to follow every traffic law and drive safely, no matter how tempting it was to hurry. My mind raced with the pressure of being a reliable mentor and a responsible driver. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something different, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty to my passenger and my commitment to my team."}
