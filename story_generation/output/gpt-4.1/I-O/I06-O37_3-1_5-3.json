I needed to update the supply list before the end of my shift, but my phone buzzed with another message from my project group. The argument from earlier still echoed in my head\u2014accusations flying, deadlines threatened. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor, let her know about the conflict before it spiraled further. She always said, \u201cDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late to ask for help.\u201d But the cleaning checklist was strict, and if I didn\u2019t finish the inventory, my supervisor would notice.

My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
