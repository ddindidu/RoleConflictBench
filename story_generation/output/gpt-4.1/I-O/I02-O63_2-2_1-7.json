My phone buzzes with a message from Mia: \u201cCan you talk? I had a rough day.\u201d I look over at her, sitting on the couch, eyes red and shoulders slumped. As her boyfriend, I know she needs me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m painfully aware that my break is strictly timed. Management has been sending reminders all week about sticking to the schedule; the call queue is overflowing, and every minute off the phone is scrutinized. If I take longer than my allotted break, I risk a warning\u2014or worse. My heart aches seeing Mia so upset, but my mind races with the pressure of work expectations. I feel torn, caught between being the supportive partner she deserves and the reliable employee my job demands. The seconds tick by, and I\u2019m paralyzed, unsure which role to honor as my break begins."}
