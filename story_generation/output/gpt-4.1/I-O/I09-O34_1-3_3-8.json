She waved me over, asking if I could put my bin out too, since hers was already at the curb and there was still space in mine for her extra bags. I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t hog the curb or overfill bins, but also help out when you can. I glanced at my watch\u2014my shift as an air traffic controller was about to start, and today was already tense. \n\nAs soon as I logged in, alarms blared: an emergency diversion, a plane with engine trouble, was cutting across three sectors. I was expected to coordinate instantly with two other controllers, reroute traffic, and keep everyone calm. My mind raced between the urgent voices in my headset and the image of Mrs. Patel waiting outside, hoping I\u2019d help her with the trash. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my neighbors counting on me to be considerate and helpful, my colleagues and hundreds of passengers depending on my focus and quick decisions. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the two worlds demanding my attention."}
