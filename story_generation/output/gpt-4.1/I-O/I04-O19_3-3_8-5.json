I replayed the conversation in my mind, realizing too late how my careless joke must have sounded. I knew I needed to call her right away, to explain, to apologize, to be the friend she deserved. But as I reached for my phone, Mrs. Lee arrived at the counter, clutching a bag of new prescriptions. She was on a complicated regimen\u2014blood thinners, insulin, a new heart medication. She looked anxious, and I knew she needed my full attention to understand the risks and how to take everything safely. My mind raced. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t rush this; her health depended on me. But as a friend, I couldn\u2019t let Sarah sit with her hurt, thinking I didn\u2019t care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something urgent, something only I could give. I stood there, torn, the phone in my hand and Mrs. Lee waiting, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
