My break was scheduled in ten minutes, but just then, Maya from the new hires pinged me: \u201cCan I ask you something quick about the sales script?\u201d As her mentor, I knew she relied on me for guidance, especially with her confidence still shaky. I wanted to help\u2014giving advice, even casually, was part of why I liked mentoring. But the telemarketer in me felt the pressure of the compliance system, always watching. If I took even a minute off the phones outside my scheduled break, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d have to explain myself to my supervisor again.
