The speaker was explaining the latest changes in prescription guidelines, and I knew I needed to pay close attention\u2014my patients depended on me to give them the best advice. But my mind kept drifting to the text from my friend, who sounded confused about where we were supposed to meet later. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding last week, and I promised I\u2019d be clear this time. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: as a pharmacist, I was expected to be fully present and absorb every detail; as a friend, I was supposed to communicate openly and not let things fester. My fingers itched to send a quick message, but I worried about missing something important in the workshop. The tension built inside me, torn between the responsibility to my profession and the promise I\u2019d made to my friend."}
