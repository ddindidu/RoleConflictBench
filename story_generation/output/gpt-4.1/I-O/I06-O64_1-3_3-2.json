My mentor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAlways let me know if you\u2019re unsure about something, even if it seems minor.\u201d Earlier, I stumbled over a term in the training manual\u2014nothing urgent, but it nags at me. I know I should message my mentor, just to clarify, but right now, I\u2019m handling the end-of-day rush. Each transaction is high-value, and the pressure to be precise is intense. My manager expects flawless accuracy, especially now, when a single slip could throw off the entire day\u2019s balance. My phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder of my responsibility as a mentee. I feel torn\u2014if I pause to reach out, I risk making a mistake at the register or slowing down the line. But if I wait, I\u2019m not being the proactive mentee my mentor expects. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m about to let someone down, no matter what I choose."}
