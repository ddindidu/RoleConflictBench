The assignment is detailed, and she\u2019s made it clear it must be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. My mind races with her words: \u201cThis is your chance to show upper management your growth.\u201d I want to prove myself, to not let her down. But the clock on my desk blinks 2:55 p.m.\u2014my scheduled break as a telemarketer. The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor has said we can take breaks flexibly, but only within our allotted hours. If I skip my break now to work on the assignment, I\u2019ll be violating company policy and risk a warning. If I take my break, I\u2019ll lose precious time to finish the mentor\u2019s task, and I can\u2019t afford to look unprepared. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my mentor and the rules of my job. The pressure builds in my chest as I weigh which responsibility to let down, knowing either choice will cost me something important."}
