She was about to make a decision that could shape her entire career, and she needed my full attention\u2014my guidance, my reassurance, my experience. I could see the weight of her expectations in the way she clutched her notebook, waiting for my advice. But just as I began to outline the steps she should consider, laughter erupted from the deep end. A group of teenagers, oblivious to the rules, were lining up to dive from the pool\u2019s edge, right beneath the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign.
