I need you.\u201d He\u2019s shattered, his father gone just hours ago, and I ache to be there, to hold him, to say something\u2014anything\u2014that might help. But my headset crackles with urgency. \u201cTower, this is Delta 142, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart pounds. The pilot\u2019s voice is tight, and I know every second counts. My screen is a blur of blips and numbers, and I have to focus, have to keep calm, because lives are in my hands. But Alex\u2019s pain tugs at me, raw and insistent. I want to step away, to be the girlfriend he needs, but I can\u2019t abandon the pilots depending on me. My hands tremble as I juggle the radio and glance at my phone, torn between the person I love and the job I can\u2019t walk away from. The weight of both worlds presses in, and I don\u2019t know how to choose."}
