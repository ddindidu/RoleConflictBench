My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious her time was. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of this hour.\u201d I wanted to show her I respected her effort, that I was serious about learning. But here I was, behind the counter, scanning groceries for the handful of customers who\u2019d trickled in during this slow afternoon. Each beep of the scanner felt like a countdown, every item a reminder that I was supposed to be somewhere else, focused and attentive.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014her message, no doubt, asking if I was ready. I felt the weight of my manager\u2019s expectations too: accuracy, no mistakes, no distractions. I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post, but I also couldn\u2019t let my mentor down. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my job and the rare opportunity to learn. The line inched forward, and I forced a smile, but inside, I was wrestling with the impossible choice looming over me."}
