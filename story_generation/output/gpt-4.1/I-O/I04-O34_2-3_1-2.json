My eyes darted between radar blips, each one a plane circling in the crowded sky, waiting for my instructions. Suddenly, my phone buzzed on the console. It was Jamie. I hesitated, but answered, hearing the tremble in his voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d he said, his words thick with emotion. I knew he\u2019d been struggling after that fight with his partner, and he rarely reached out like this. My heart twisted\u2014I wanted to be there for him, to listen, to help him feel less alone. But in front of me, the airspace was a puzzle on the verge of chaos, every second demanding my full attention. I could hear the tension in Jamie\u2019s silence, waiting for me to respond, while pilots awaited my next command. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed my support and the hundreds of lives depending on my focus.
