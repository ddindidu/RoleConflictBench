He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback he\u2019d received at work, and I could feel his disappointment radiating off him. As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to hold him, listen, and reassure him that he was more than his job performance. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. A patient had just arrived in the ER with a severe infection, and the team needed me to prescribe the right antibiotics immediately. My mind raced. Alex needed me here, to be present and supportive, but my patient\u2019s life could depend on my swift action. I felt my heart twist, torn between the person I loved and the oath I\u2019d taken as a doctor. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just sat there, paralyzed, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
