My heart ached to hold her, to stay by her side and help her through the storm of grief. She needed me now more than ever, and I wanted nothing more than to be her anchor. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab window was about to open. Months of planning, grant money, and my team\u2019s trust all hinged on these next few hours. The specialized instruments were booked months in advance, and if I missed this slot, the experiment would be delayed for half a year. I could almost hear my advisor\u2019s voice, urging me not to waste this rare opportunity. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to comfort the woman I love, the other pulled by the weight of my scientific responsibility. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which world needed me more, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
