Can we talk?\u201d I know she needs me to listen, to be present, to reassure her that everything will be okay. But just as I\u2019m about to call her, my headset buzzes\u2014another customer on the line. This one\u2019s voice is sharp, frustration simmering as he questions every detail of the promotion I\u2019m offering. \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t a scam? Explain it again, from the top,\u201d he demands. My manager expects me to stay calm, persuasive, and thorough, no matter how difficult the call. I feel my chest tighten. Mia\u2019s waiting for comfort, for me to be the boyfriend who listens and cares. But right now, I\u2019m supposed to be the telemarketer who never loses composure, who answers every objection with patience. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the need to support the person I love and the pressure to perform at work. My heart pounds as I try to figure out who needs me more in this moment."}
