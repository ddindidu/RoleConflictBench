She needed me\u2014her boyfriend\u2014to listen, to reassure her that she was more than her boss\u2019s harsh words. I reached for her hand, trying to offer comfort, when my police radio crackled to life. There was a protest downtown, and it was getting out of control. My sergeant\u2019s voice was urgent: all available officers were to report immediately.\n\nMia looked at me, her grip tightening. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go. I just need you here tonight.\u201d But the badge on my chest felt heavier than ever. As a police officer, I was expected to help restore order, to protect the city from chaos. But as her boyfriend, I was supposed to be her safe place, especially now. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between duty and love, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
