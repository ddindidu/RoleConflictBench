My mentor had squeezed in a rare fifteen-minute meeting for me, a gesture I knew I should honor. I\u2019d promised to be there, to show respect for her time, to prove I valued her guidance. But as I pulled up to the curb, a passenger slid into the back seat, breathless and anxious. \u201cPlease, my train leaves in twenty minutes. Can you get me to the station?\u201d His eyes pleaded with me, and I knew what was expected: a safe, swift ride across town, no shortcuts, no risks, but no delays either.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a calendar reminder\u2014meeting in ten minutes. I gripped the steering wheel, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my mentor, maybe lose her trust. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk a passenger missing his train, failing the promise of my job.
