The subject line was routine, and the message itself was just an update\u2014no action needed, but she\u2019d written, \u201cLet me know you\u2019ve seen this when you get a chance.\u201d I knew our team valued quick responses, even for small things. At the same time, I was at my telemarketing desk, headset on, the compliance system tracking every second. My break wasn\u2019t for another hour, and if I stopped to reply, even for a minute, the system would flag me for unscheduled downtime. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding us that every call counts, and that even a minute off the phone could mean a warning. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between being the reliable colleague who always replies promptly and the rule-abiding telemarketer who never risks a compliance infraction. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed the expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
