As a judge, I knew the expectation: my orders must be clear, detailed, and timely. The new case file sat open beside me, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. But my mind kept drifting back to my other role\u2014mentee. My mentor had always emphasized the importance of open communication, especially when facing obstacles. Now, a serious conflict with my project teammates threatened our deliverable timeline, and I knew I should reach out to my mentor for guidance. Yet, every minute spent composing that email or preparing for a difficult conversation felt like time stolen from my judicial duties. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I focused on the order, I risked letting the team conflict fester and disappointing my mentor. If I prioritized the mentee role, I might submit a rushed, subpar order, failing the high standards expected of me as a judge. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between two worlds and unsure which demand to answer first."}
