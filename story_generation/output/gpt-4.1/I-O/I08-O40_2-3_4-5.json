He sounded a bit desperate\u2014his usual helpers had bailed, and he didn\u2019t know who else to ask. As an acquaintance, I felt that familiar tug of obligation; it\u2019s what you do, right? You show up when someone needs a hand, even if you\u2019re not close friends. But as I stared at my phone, my mind kept drifting to the thick stack of blueprints and technical drawings spread across my kitchen table. Tomorrow, I start a big carpentry project\u2014my first time leading a team. I need to go over every measurement, every joint, every detail tonight if I want to avoid mistakes and prove myself. The pressure is mounting from both sides: Mark\u2019s expectation for a simple favor, and my own professional standards demanding focus and preparation. I can feel the stress building, torn between being a helpful acquaintance and a responsible carpenter, knowing I can\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
