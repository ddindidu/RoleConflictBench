He\u2019s leaving for Germany on Monday, and this is our last weekend together for months. I want to be present, to laugh at his jokes, to memorize the way he smiles, but Slack notifications keep popping up\u2014urgent bug reports, users unable to log in, QA tagging me for immediate fixes. My manager\u2019s messages are polite but insistent: \u201cCan you take a look tonight?\u201d I nod along to my boyfriend\u2019s plans for the weekend, but my mind is split, torn between the code that needs patching and the moments I\u2019m supposed to cherish. I feel guilty for even glancing at my phone, but the anxiety of letting my team down gnaws at me. He reaches for my hand, and I force a smile, heart pounding, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
