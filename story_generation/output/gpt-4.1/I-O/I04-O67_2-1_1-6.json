Glancing at the screen, I saw it was my friend, Jamie. I hesitated, but answered on speaker. Jamie\u2019s voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Alex.

I wanted to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and support like a good friend should.\n\nBut as I navigated the busy streets, I felt the weight of my other responsibility.
