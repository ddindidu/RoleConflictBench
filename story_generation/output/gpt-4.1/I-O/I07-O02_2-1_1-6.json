The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I knew how important it was to be present. These meetings were the only place where project updates were shared, and missing one meant being out of the loop. My teammates expected me to show up, contribute, and stay connected. But at the same time, my lead engineer pinged me, asking for my input on the project planning session happening right now. They needed my expertise to estimate timelines, and even though the session was informal and the deadlines weren\u2019t set in stone, I knew my input would shape the next steps. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d let my colleagues down and risk missing crucial information. If I ignored the planning session, I\u2019d delay the engineering team and possibly throw off our workflow. My mind raced, torn between being a reliable teammate and a responsible engineer, wishing I could split myself in two."}
