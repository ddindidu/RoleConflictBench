The team meeting was about to start\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for months. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to speak up, to show I cared about the outcome. But right now, I was behind the wheel, my other role pressing in. My passenger, a nervous woman clutching her ticket, kept checking her phone. Her train was leaving soon, and the station was all the way across town. She looked at me with pleading eyes, expecting me to get her there safely and on time. I felt the weight of both roles crushing me. If I joined the meeting from my phone, I\u2019d be distracted, risking her safety. If I focused on driving, I\u2019d let my team down. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my colleagues and responsibility to my passenger, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet the demands of both."}
