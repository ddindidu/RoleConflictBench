My mentor had squeezed in a session for me, just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious her time was. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of this hour.\u201d I wanted to show her I respected her effort, that I was serious about learning. But here I was, behind the counter, the store unexpectedly busier than usual for a quiet afternoon. \n\nA small line formed. I smiled at each customer, scanning their groceries, making small talk\u2014\u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d\u2014because that\u2019s what a good cashier does. My manager always said, \u201cFriendly service keeps them coming back.\u201d But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that my mentor was waiting on the video call. I felt torn, my mind split between the customers in front of me and the mentor who\u2019d gone out of her way for me. I could feel the pressure building, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
