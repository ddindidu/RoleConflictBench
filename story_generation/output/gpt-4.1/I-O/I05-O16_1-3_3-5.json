She looked eager, notebook in hand, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility to guide her, to share what I\u2019d learned over years of practice. I started to answer, weaving in stories and advice, but my pager buzzed urgently. The family of Mr. Lee, my patient, was waiting for me. I knew what I had to tell them\u2014news that would shatter their world. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, and the clearest explanation I could give. But Sarah\u2019s eyes were still on me, hopeful and trusting, expecting mentorship in this rare quiet moment. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I rush my answer to Sarah, risking her disappointment and missing a teaching moment, or delay facing Mr. Lee\u2019s family, who needed compassion and clarity now more than ever? My heart pounded as I stood between the break room and the hallway, caught in the impossible pull of two people needing me in two very different ways."}
