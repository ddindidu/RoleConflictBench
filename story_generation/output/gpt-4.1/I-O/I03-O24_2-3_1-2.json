He barely looked up as I set my things down. \u201cBad day?\u201d I asked, already knowing the answer. He nodded, voice cracking as he told me about the harsh feedback from his boss. My heart ached to comfort him, to sit beside him and listen, to reassure him that he was more than his job. But my phone buzzed\u2014an alert from the court. An emergency motion had just been filed, and I was the judge on call. I had less than an hour to review the case files and make a ruling that could change someone\u2019s life. Alex needed me, but so did the people waiting for my decision. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mind torn between the urge to hold Alex and the duty to uphold justice. I stood frozen, the expectations of love and law pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
