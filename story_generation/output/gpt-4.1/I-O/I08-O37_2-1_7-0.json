He\u2019s so careless. I don\u2019t know how he keeps his job.\u201d She looked at me, expecting me to agree or add something. As an acquaintance, I always try to avoid gossiping or speaking badly about others, but as the cleaner, I\u2019m expected to keep the place spotless, and Mark\u2019s messes make my job harder. I could easily vent my frustration about the extra work he causes, but I know that would mean talking behind his back. My mind raced\u2014should I stay silent and risk Anna thinking I don\u2019t care about the mess, or should I join in and betray my own values? The rag in my hand felt heavier as I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good acquaintance and a diligent cleaner, unsure which role to let guide my response."}
