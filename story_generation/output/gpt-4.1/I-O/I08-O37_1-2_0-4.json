She smiled, expecting a friendly greeting, and I felt the familiar tug to be warm and approachable. But my mind was racing with worry\u2014I\u2019d just checked the cleaning closet in her apartment, and the floor cleaner was almost gone. The next cleaning was in three days, and I was supposed to keep supplies stocked. If I didn\u2019t mention it now, she might not have time to buy more, and I\u2019d be blamed for not managing the supplies. But if I brought it up here, in this casual moment, it would feel awkward and transactional, not friendly. I could just smile and say hello, keeping things light, but then I\u2019d be neglecting my responsibility as her cleaner. My heart pounded as I approached her, torn between the easy friendliness she expected and the practical, slightly uncomfortable reminder I needed to give."}
