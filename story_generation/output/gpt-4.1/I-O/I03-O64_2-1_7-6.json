The store is quiet, and I greet each customer with a cheerful \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d But my mind is far from here. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019ve argued about money all week, and I know he wants to talk, to fix things before it gets worse. As his girlfriend, I should be there, ready to listen and work things out. But as a cashier, I\u2019m expected to be friendly, focused, and present for every customer. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to an elderly woman, forcing my voice to stay light. Inside, I\u2019m torn. I want to step away, call Alex, and resolve our fight, but I can\u2019t abandon my post. The next customer approaches, and I paste on another smile, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I can give at once."}
