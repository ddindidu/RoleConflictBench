She sat alone at a corner table, fidgeting with her phone, her eyes darting up nervously as I approached. I smiled, trying to seem warm and approachable, remembering how important it was to make her feel comfortable. Just as I was about to introduce myself, my phone buzzed\u2014a delivery notification. I was still on the clock, and the customer was waiting outside for their package. \n\nI glanced at the shy woman, who looked relieved that I hadn\u2019t started a conversation yet, and then at the door, where my customer stood, checking their watch. As a delivery person, I was expected to be prompt, polite, and professional, but as an acquaintance, I needed to be friendly and present. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure the nervous newcomer and the responsibility to fulfill my job\u2019s expectations. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
