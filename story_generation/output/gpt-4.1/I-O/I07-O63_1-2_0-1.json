As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was part of the team\u2014even if today\u2019s meeting was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded for anyone who missed it. But as a telemarketer, my phone was already ringing with prospects curious about our new service. Lately, they\u2019d been asking technical questions that went way beyond my script. My manager expected me to handle these objections smoothly, keep the calls moving, and not let anyone slip away. I felt the pressure mounting: if I joined the meeting, I\u2019d miss live calls and risk losing leads; if I stayed on the phones, I\u2019d look disengaged to my team. My mind raced, torn between being a reliable colleague and a high-performing telemarketer, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
