My team was at each other\u2019s throats, and our project deadline was slipping through our fingers. I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor as soon as problems arose, but my shift as a telemarketer was in full swing. The compliance system tracked every second, and if I took an unscheduled break\u2014even just to send a quick message\u2014I risked being flagged. My supervisor had warned me: one more infraction, and I\u2019d be written up. But if I didn\u2019t tell my mentor about the conflict, I\u2019d be letting my team down and possibly sabotaging our project. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks, feeling the pressure from both sides. I hovered over the \u201csend\u201d button, torn between my responsibility to my mentor and the strict rules of my telemarketing job, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
