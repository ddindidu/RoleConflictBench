The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected me to have it finished and polished. Every few lines, I\u2019d glance up, scanning the pool, counting heads, watching for any sign of trouble. My heart thudded with the pressure\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish the code, I\u2019d disappoint my mentor and fall behind in my learning. But if I let my attention slip from the water, even for a moment, someone could get hurt. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to respond and the weight of my unfinished assignment. I felt the expectations of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I froze, caught in the impossible space between them."}
