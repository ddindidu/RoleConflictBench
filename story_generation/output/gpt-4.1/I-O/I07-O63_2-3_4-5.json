As a colleague, I knew I had to finish my part of the report by noon\u2014if I didn\u2019t, the next person couldn\u2019t start, and the whole team\u2019s timeline would unravel. But as a telemarketer, today was the last day of the quarter, and we were just shy of our sales target. Management had made it clear: if we didn\u2019t hit the number, there\u2019d be no bonuses, and worse, we\u2019d all face a penalty. My phone buzzed with reminders from my sales manager, while my teammate pinged me, asking if I\u2019d be done soon. My stomach twisted. Every minute I spent on calls was a minute lost on the report, but if I ignored the calls, I\u2019d let my sales team down. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
