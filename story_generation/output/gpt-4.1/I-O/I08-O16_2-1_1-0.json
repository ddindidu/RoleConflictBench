As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach, smile, and help them feel at ease. I introduced myself, trying to be warm and inviting, but as we talked, I noticed their voice was hoarse and they kept coughing. Instinctively, my mind shifted to my role as a doctor. I started mentally running through possible diagnoses\u2014was it just a cold, or something more serious? I wanted to ask about their symptoms, maybe even suggest they see a physician, but I worried that would make me seem intrusive or overly clinical in a friendly setting. The expectation to be approachable clashed with my professional urge to assess and advise. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between being the supportive acquaintance and the vigilant doctor, unsure which role should guide my next words."}
