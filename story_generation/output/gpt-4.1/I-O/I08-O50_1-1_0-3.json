The shutdown was carefully scheduled, and I knew how important it was to stick to the plan\u2014any deviation could throw off the whole production schedule. Just then, I spotted Mark, someone I knew from the break room, coming toward me. As an acquaintance, I felt the expectation to smile, maybe stop for a quick chat, or at least offer a friendly greeting. But my mind was preoccupied with the machines, the cleaning protocols, and the pressure to ensure everything would run perfectly after the shutdown. I could sense Mark expecting a warm, approachable gesture, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a repairer, needing to stay focused and not get sidetracked. My heart raced as I approached him, torn between the urge to be friendly and the need to keep my head in the game for the sake of the machines and the team."}
