The sound echoed through the shared corridor, and I winced, imagining Mrs. Lee from next door sighing in frustration. She\u2019d already mentioned how the barking startled her when she came home from work. I knew I should be more considerate, maybe keep my dog away from the door or train him better, but my mind was already tangled in work.\n\nAt the same time, an email pinged: the product team was holding a brainstorming session next sprint. Attendance was optional, but I knew my input would help shape the new features. I also knew that if I didn\u2019t show up, I might miss a chance to collaborate and influence the direction of our project. But the session was scheduled right when my dog usually got restless, and I\u2019d need to keep an eye on him to avoid more hallway incidents.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014my neighbors expected peace and respect for our shared space, while my team expected me to be present and engaged. I sat at my desk, torn between the two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
