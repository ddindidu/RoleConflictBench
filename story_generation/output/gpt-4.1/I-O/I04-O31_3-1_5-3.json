My phone buzzed, and I saw it was Sam, my oldest friend. His voice was shaky, almost frantic. \u201cMy car broke down on the highway. It\u2019s dark, and I\u2019m scared. Can you come get me? Please, man, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nAs a friend, I knew what was expected of me. Sam had always been there for me, and now he needed me. But as a police officer, I also had a duty to myself and the community to maintain my fitness, to be ready for whatever the job threw at me. Missing another workout would set me back, and I\u2019d promised myself\u2014and my captain\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t let my physical standards slip.\n\nI stared at my gym bag, then at my keys. The weight of both uniforms\u2014one of friendship, one of duty\u2014pressed down on me. My heart pounded, torn between the call for help and the call to serve. I stood there, caught in the headlights of my own conflicting roles, unsure which road to take."}
