As a mentor, I\u2019d spent hours preparing a structured session for my team, determined to share the skills they\u2019d need to succeed. My notes were organized, examples ready, and I could almost see the relief on their faces when I\u2019d help them untangle the project\u2019s toughest knots. But my phone buzzed\u2014another shift as a telemarketer. The new service we were selling was complicated, and today, prospects were relentless. They fired off technical questions the script barely touched. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to keep the calls moving, but I felt exposed, improvising answers I wasn\u2019t sure about. My mind kept drifting to my team, waiting for guidance, while my headset tethered me to a world of quotas and call times. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the reliable mentor my team needed and the quick-thinking telemarketer my boss demanded. I stared at my notes, then at the blinking phone, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
