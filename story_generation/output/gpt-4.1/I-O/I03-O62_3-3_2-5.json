He needed me\u2014needed my words, my presence, my comfort. I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to let him know I was here, that he wasn\u2019t alone in his grief. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a message from the pool manager. The filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed now, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. As a lifeguard, it was my responsibility to ensure everyone\u2019s safety, to check the equipment and act fast. But Alex\u2019s pain was raw, and leaving him now felt like abandoning him when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my duty to protect lives at the pool, and my promise to be Alex\u2019s support. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between two worlds, each expecting me to be fully present, fully committed."}
