I knew it was Alex\u2014probably another message about our weekend plans. We\u2019d just had a misunderstanding over text, something about who was supposed to make the reservation. I could sense his frustration, and as his girlfriend, I wanted to fix things right away, to reassure him and smooth things over before it grew into something bigger.\n\nBut the line at my register stretched almost to the door. Customers shifted impatiently, their arms full of groceries, and I was expected to greet each one with a smile, to ask about their day, to make them feel welcome. My manager hovered nearby, watching for any slip in my customer service. I tried to focus on scanning items and making small talk, but my mind kept drifting back to Alex\u2019s messages. I felt torn\u2014my heart tugged toward my phone, desperate to resolve things with him, while my hands kept moving, bagging groceries and forcing a cheerful tone.
