I\u2019m moving apartments and could really use an extra hand.\u201d I stared at the message, feeling a familiar tug. Mark and I weren\u2019t close, but we\u2019d always been friendly, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to ask. I wanted to help\u2014wasn\u2019t that what friends, even distant ones, were supposed to do?\n\nBut my supervisor had just reminded us that we needed to be available for every call, especially since our campaign was going so well.
