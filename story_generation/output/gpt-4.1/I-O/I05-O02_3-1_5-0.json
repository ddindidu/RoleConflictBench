She looked up, her eyes searching mine for clarity. As her mentor, I knew she expected me to share everything I\u2019d learned about this kind of critical task\u2014how to avoid the pitfalls, how to double-check every calculation, how a single oversight could ripple into disaster. She needed my guidance now, and I could see the weight of her uncertainty.\n\nBut as an engineer on this project, I also knew we were still in the early stages. The requirements were shifting, the scope was undefined, and the technical path was far from set. If I gave her a detailed solution now, I might lock us into an approach that could be obsolete by next week. My team expected me to keep things flexible, to encourage creative alternatives, not to dictate a single way forward.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. Should I give Maya the concrete advice she craved, or hold back and risk her feeling unsupported? The expectations of mentor and engineer pulled me in opposite directions, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to guide and the need to explore."}
