The snow was coming down harder now, and every minute lost in traffic felt like a personal failure. My passenger kept checking his watch, his tension filling the cab. I knew he had an international flight to catch, and I was expected to get him there safely and on time. My phone buzzed in the cup holder\u2014a message from my mentor, asking if I had any questions about the new terminology from our last meeting. I did have a small question, nothing urgent, but I remembered her advice: always communicate challenges promptly. I felt the weight of her expectations, the need to show initiative and openness. But my hands were glued to the wheel, my focus demanded by the treacherous road and the responsibility for my passenger\u2019s journey.

I could feel the tension building, torn between being the attentive mentee and the reliable taxi driver, unsure which role to answer first."}
