My heart ached to comfort him, to sit beside him and listen, to offer the reassurance he needed. But just as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Lee\u2019s prescription was due. She depended on me to get her medications right; one mistake could put her health at risk. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. Alex needed me now, but so did my patient. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be the supportive girlfriend he deserved and the responsibility of being a meticulous pharmacist. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to give fully to either."}
