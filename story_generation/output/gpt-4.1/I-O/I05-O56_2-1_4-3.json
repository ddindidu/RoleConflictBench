In ten minutes, my mentees would gather in the back room, expecting the session I\u2019d promised\u2014an organized walkthrough of the skills they\u2019d need for the looming project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides and notes, determined to give them the guidance I wished I\u2019d had. But right now, scissors in hand, I was finishing up with Mrs. Lee, my favorite regular. She smiled at her reflection, then hesitated. \u201cCould you just trim the fringe a bit more? It\u2019s poking my eyes.\u201d Her tone was gentle, but I knew she valued every detail. I glanced at the clock again. If I took the extra time, I\u2019d be late for the session, letting down my mentees. If I rushed Mrs. Lee, I\u2019d risk her trust and satisfaction. My mind spun with the weight of both roles\u2014mentor and hairdresser\u2014each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to deliver. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between sharing my knowledge and ensuring my client left happy, both impossible to do perfectly at the same time."}
