The team meeting was starting in ten minutes, and I knew this one was crucial\u2014project updates that wouldn\u2019t be repeated or summarized. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show I was invested. But right now, I was a taxi driver, responsible for the safety of the passenger in my back seat. The rain made the roads slick, and cars darted unpredictably between lanes, brake lights flaring in the gray morning. I felt the pressure mounting: should I try to make it to a safe spot and join the meeting on my phone, risking distraction from the road? Or should I focus solely on driving, knowing I\u2019d miss out on vital information and possibly let my team down?
