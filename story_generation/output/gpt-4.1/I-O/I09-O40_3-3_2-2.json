She\u2019s always been kind, and as her neighbor, I know I\u2019m expected to be friendly, especially now that a noise complaint has been making the rounds on our floor. She smiled, but I could sense the tension\u2014everyone\u2019s on edge, and I felt the pressure to be extra polite, maybe even reassure her that I\u2019m not the source of the problem. But my mind kept drifting to the job site. As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to be late or distracted; safety protocols demand that I thoroughly inspect my tools before any structural work. If I rush, I risk missing something critical, but if I linger here to smooth things over with Mrs. Kim, I\u2019ll be behind schedule. My stomach twisted as I tried to balance the urge to be a good neighbor with the responsibility to keep my crew safe. I could feel both roles pulling at me, each demanding more than I could give at that moment."}
