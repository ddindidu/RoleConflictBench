I\u2019m really upset about what you said earlier.\u201d My stomach twisted. I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt him, but I could tell from his words that I had. I knew I needed to call him right away, to explain, to apologize, to be the friend he deserved. But as I stepped out of the car, two travelers waved me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019re splitting the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I glanced at my phone, then at the travelers, feeling the weight of their expectant eyes. As a taxi driver, I was supposed to be professional, helpful, focused on the job. But as a friend, I couldn\u2019t ignore Sam\u2019s pain. My mind raced, torn between the urge to dial his number and the responsibility to serve my customers. The pressure built inside me, each role demanding something different, and I stood there, keys in hand, caught between two worlds."}
