It was Mia, her voice trembling, telling me her father had passed away unexpectedly. She needed me\u2014her words barely holding together, asking if I could come over. My heart twisted; I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to be the anchor she needed in this storm. But as I hung up, my pager blared. The hospital\u2019s ICU had a life-support machine flashing critical fault codes. I was the only technician on call, and every second counted for the patient relying on that machine. My mind raced with images: Mia alone in her grief, and a patient\u2019s life hanging by a thread. Both needed me, both right now. I felt split in two, the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, my chest tight with helplessness as I stood frozen, keys in hand, unable to move."}
