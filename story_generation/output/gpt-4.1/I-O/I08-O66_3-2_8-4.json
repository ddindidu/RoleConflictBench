The city lights blurred, and the wipers struggled to keep up. My passenger, an old acquaintance from school, sat in the back, chatting away. Suddenly, she leaned forward, her voice dropping. \u201cDid you hear about Mark? I heard something big\u2014something that could ruin him.\u201d I knew exactly what she was talking about. I\u2019d stumbled upon that secret by accident, and I\u2019d promised myself not to spread it. As an acquaintance, I felt the weight of loyalty and the need to avoid gossip, but her insistent questions pressed at me.\n\nAt the same time, the traffic grew unpredictable. Cars darted between lanes, brake lights flared, and puddles splashed up, making every second behind the wheel tense. As a taxi driver, I was expected to keep my focus, obey the rules, and get my passenger home safely. But her probing words tugged at my attention, tempting me to slip, to say too much, or to lose focus on the road. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect a reputation and the need to protect my passenger."}
