My mind was deep in the flow of function\u2014where the light would fall, how the shelves would fit, the best way to maximize the tiny space. I was so focused on usability that I barely noticed Anna, an old acquaintance, slip into the seat across from me. Her eyes were red, cheeks streaked with tears. She tried to smile, but her voice trembled as she told me about her recent heartbreak.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I knew I should be present, warm, and supportive. She needed someone to listen, to offer comfort, not just polite nods. But as an architect, my mind kept drifting back to the sketch, the measurements, the looming deadline. I felt the tension coil inside me\u2014Anna\u2019s pain pulling me one way, my professional commitment tugging the other. I wanted to be the friend she needed, but the lines on the page seemed to demand my attention just as urgently. My pencil hovered, my heart torn, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
