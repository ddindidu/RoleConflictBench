My mentor had been clear: \u201cHave this ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to prove I was serious about learning. But just as I started to find my rhythm, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling during my scheduled check-in. \u201cHey, could you walk me through the basics of the machine again?\u201d she asked, her voice uncertain. I knew how important it was to make a good impression\u2014clients expected clear, patient guidance, especially when they were new. \n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I spent too long helping her, I\u2019d lose precious time for my assignment. But if I brushed her off, I\u2019d risk her confidence in our service. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be the attentive repairer my clients needed and the diligent mentee my mentor expected. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught between two sets of expectations, unsure which to answer first."}
