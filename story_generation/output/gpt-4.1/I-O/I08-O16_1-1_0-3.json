As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to smile, maybe stop for a quick chat, just to keep things friendly and approachable. But I was on my way to see Mrs. Patel, a patient waiting for her routine check-up. She always had a lot of questions about her health, and I knew she expected me to be clear and empathetic, to give her my full attention. As I passed Mark, he caught my eye and gave a small wave, clearly expecting a moment of recognition. At the same time, I could see Mrs. Patel through the open door, looking anxious and glancing at her watch. I felt a knot in my stomach, torn between the expectation to be a warm acquaintance and the responsibility to be a compassionate doctor. My mind raced, wondering how to balance these two roles without letting either person down."}
