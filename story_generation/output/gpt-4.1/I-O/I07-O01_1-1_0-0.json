As a colleague, I was expected to show up, contribute, and keep the camaraderie alive, even if today\u2019s agenda was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. \n\nBut as I reviewed the building plans on my desk, my architect\u2019s eye caught a few minor inconsistencies. They weren\u2019t urgent, nothing that would cause immediate danger, but I knew that safety and compliance were my responsibility. If I didn\u2019t double-check these details now, they might slip through the cracks. \n\nMy inbox pinged with a meeting reminder. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my team expected my presence, but my professional integrity as an architect demanded my attention elsewhere. I sat frozen, torn between the easy camaraderie of my colleagues and the silent, weighty obligation to the safety of a building yet to rise."}
