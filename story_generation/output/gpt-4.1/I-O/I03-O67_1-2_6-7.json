Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your shift?\u201d I can almost hear the disappointment in her words. I want to call her, to explain, to smooth over the misunderstanding before it grows into something bigger. But the radio crackles\u2014dispatch is sending us out, and I have to focus. The city traffic is thick, horns blaring, and every second I spend distracted could put us all at risk. My hands grip the wheel tighter. I know Alex expects me to be present, to talk things through, to show her she matters. But right now, my team and the patient in need are counting on me to get us there safely. My heart pounds with the weight of both responsibilities, torn between the urge to reach for my phone and the duty to keep my eyes on the road."}
