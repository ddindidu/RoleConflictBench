The line stretched past the magazine rack, customers shifting impatiently, eyes darting to their watches. My manager\u2019s expectation was clear: keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays.

She needed my guidance now, before the deadline passed. I could almost hear her anxious voice, trusting me to help her weigh the risks and rewards. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to the customers in front of me and the promise I\u2019d made to Maya.
