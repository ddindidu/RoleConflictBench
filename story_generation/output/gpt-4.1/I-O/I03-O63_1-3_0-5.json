My partner sits on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the muted TV. I can tell he\u2019s had a rough day\u2014he barely glances up when I enter. I want to drop everything, sit beside him, and ask about his day, offer comfort, maybe just listen. That\u2019s what he needs from me, and I want to be there for him.\n\nBut my phone vibrates with another reminder: it\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and I\u2019m still three sales short of my target. Management\u2019s emails have been relentless\u2014if I don\u2019t close these deals, not only do I lose my bonus, but the whole team faces penalties. I can\u2019t afford to let them down, or myself. My headset sits on the table, a silent demand for my attention.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn. My partner needs me, but so does my job. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, and I can\u2019t ignore either. I take a shaky breath, caught between the urge to comfort him and the pressure to pick up the phone."}
