It was Mia, my closest friend, her voice trembling as she sobbed about her father\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me to listen, to be there, to offer comfort. I sat up, heart pounding, torn between wanting to be the friend she needed and the reality of my early morning housekeeping shift. My supervisor had just warned us: no exceptions, full safety gear, and no distractions. If I didn\u2019t get enough sleep, I\u2019d risk making mistakes\u2014maybe even skipping a step in the cleaning protocol, which could put everyone at risk. But how could I tell Mia I had to go? She was counting on me, and I could hear the desperation in her voice. My mind raced, guilt and worry tangling together. I stared at the clock, phone pressed to my ear, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
