My mentor had managed to squeeze in a rare 30-minute slot for me, sandwiched between her endless meetings. I knew how valuable her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of it. But just as I was about to join the call, a flurry of Slack messages popped up from the product and QA teams. They were waiting for my technical input on the new feature design documents\u2014documents that were due by the end of the day. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. If I missed the mentor meeting, I\u2019d be disrespecting her effort to support me. If I ignored the teams, I\u2019d be holding up the entire project. My mind raced, torn between the urge to honor my mentor\u2019s time and the responsibility to my colleagues. I hovered over the \u201cJoin\u201d button, my hands sweating, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between being a good mentee and a reliable developer."}
