Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, and the threat of breaking up hanging in the air. He wanted to talk, to resolve things, and I knew I should be there, listening, working through the pain together. But at my desk, blueprints sprawled before me, I noticed a few small inconsistencies in the building plan for tomorrow\u2019s inspection. They weren\u2019t urgent, but as an architect, I was responsible for every detail, for ensuring safety and compliance. My supervisor expected perfection, and any oversight could mean trouble for the whole team. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, then at the plans. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to save my relationship, the other unable to ignore the professional duty pressing on my conscience. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I sat frozen, unable to move, caught between the person I loved and the work I was trusted to do."}
