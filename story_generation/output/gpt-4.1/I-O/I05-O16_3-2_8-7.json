My phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, Sarah, who was anxiously awaiting my feedback on her proposal for the hospital\u2019s new patient care initiative. She was on the verge of a breakthrough, and I knew my encouragement could make all the difference in her confidence and career. At the same time, my pager vibrated with an urgent alert: Mr. Patel, my patient with a complex autoimmune disorder, was experiencing a flare-up. His treatment plan was intricate, and any delay in adjusting his medications could have serious consequences.\n\nAs a mentor, I felt the weight of Sarah\u2019s trust in me, her hope that I would guide her to success. As a doctor, I was responsible for Mr. Patel\u2019s health, knowing that my expertise could ease his suffering. The demands pulled at me from both sides\u2014Sarah\u2019s future and Mr. Patel\u2019s present. My mind raced, torn between nurturing growth and providing care, both expecting my full attention. I stared at the two messages, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between who I am to others and who I need to be right now."}
