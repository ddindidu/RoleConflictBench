She looks up and tries to smile, but I can tell something\u2019s off. As her boyfriend, I know I should sit beside her, listen, and help her unwind from whatever happened at work. She deserves my attention, my comfort. But as I hang up my coat, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder about the new appellate court decision the attorney mentioned today. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to be fully prepared, to read and understand every new precedent that could affect my rulings. The next session is tomorrow morning. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. She needs me now, but so does the law. My mind races, torn between the warmth of her presence and the cold, urgent logic of my profession. I stand in the hallway, heart pounding, unable to move, caught between the person I love and the duty I swore to uphold."}
