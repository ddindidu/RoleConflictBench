The deadline for the client delivery loomed, and my part was the bottleneck. My team was counting on me to finish this today\u2014if I didn\u2019t, the whole project would slip, and the client would be furious. But just as I started to focus, my phone buzzed. It was the production floor again. The operator, new and eager but inexperienced, was making the same mistake with the machine settings, and the material waste was piling up. As the designated machine repairer, I was expected to step in, guide him, and prevent further loss. I could hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew the company couldn\u2019t afford more waste. My mind raced: if I left my desk now, I\u2019d fall behind on my critical task. If I ignored the call, the waste would continue, and the operator would feel abandoned. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands\u2014my colleagues\u2019 trust in my reliability, the operator\u2019s need for support, the client\u2019s expectations, and the company\u2019s bottom line\u2014all pulling me in opposite directions."}
