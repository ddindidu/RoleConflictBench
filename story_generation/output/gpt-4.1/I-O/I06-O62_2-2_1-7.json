The deadline was in three days, but I knew he expected quality work, not something rushed. Every few minutes, I glanced up, scanning the pool, reminding myself that safety came first. That\u2019s when I noticed a group of teenagers gathering near the deep end, laughing and edging closer to the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My heart thudded. I knew the rules\u2014no exceptions. I was supposed to enforce them, no matter what. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, and the code would take twice as long. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cShow me you can handle responsibility.\u201d But wasn\u2019t this also responsibility? I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the expectation to be a diligent mentee and the duty to be a vigilant lifeguard. My hands hovered over the keyboard, eyes darting between the screen and the pool, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between two roles that both demanded my full attention."}
