It was from my project team\u2014subject line: \u201cUrgent: Need Clarification Before Proceeding.\u201d I knew they were waiting on my response to move forward, and I could almost feel their impatience through the screen. As a colleague, I was expected to reply quickly, to keep the workflow smooth and show I was a reliable part of the team. But as a telemarketer, today was the final day of the quarter, and every second counted. Management had made it clear: if we didn\u2019t hit our sales target, there would be penalties, and the bonus I\u2019d been counting on would slip away. My headset felt heavier than usual, and my fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing a quick, thoughtful reply and making another call that could tip us over the target. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest, and I stared at the blinking cursor, caught between letting my colleagues down and risking my own performance."}
