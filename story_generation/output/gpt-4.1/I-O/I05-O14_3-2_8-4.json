My mentee, Sarah, had just left my office, her eyes wide with anxiety about the presentation she was preparing for the board. She needed guidance, reassurance, and a careful nudge to help her see her own potential. As her mentor, I felt the weight of her trust, the responsibility to help her grow, to be present and attentive.\n\nBut my inbox pinged with a reminder: the departmental meeting was in two hours. I still hadn\u2019t finished compiling the preliminary data summaries for our latest experiment. As a scientist, I owed it to my team and the integrity of our work to ensure every detail was accurate, every result transparent. The pressure to deliver precise, honest findings was immense\u2014my reputation and the lab\u2019s credibility depended on it.\n\nI glanced at Sarah\u2019s draft on my desk, then at the half-finished data charts on my screen. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help her refine her ideas and the obligation to uphold the standards of my research. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the tightening grip of impossible choices."}
