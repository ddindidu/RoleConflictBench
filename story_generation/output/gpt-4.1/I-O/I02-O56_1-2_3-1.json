She wanted us to pick a night to finally have that long, uninterrupted dinner we\u2019d been talking about. I promised her I\u2019d make time, that I\u2019d be present, not distracted by work or my phone. As I was about to suggest Thursday, the bell above the salon door chimed. A woman stepped in, clutching her bag, eyes darting around the room. She looked lost, maybe even a little scared. I knew that look\u2014first-time nerves. As a hairdresser, it was my job to greet her warmly, help her feel at ease, and show her she was in good hands. But my phone buzzed again\u2014Mia, asking if I\u2019d decided. I felt the pressure mounting: Mia deserved my attention, but so did this client. I stood there, phone in hand, heart tugged in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
