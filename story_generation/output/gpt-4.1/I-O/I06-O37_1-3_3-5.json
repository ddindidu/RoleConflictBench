My next task was the oven, and without that product, I couldn\u2019t do the job properly. I knew my client expected me to keep track of supplies and let them know right away if anything ran out. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.\u201d I did have a small question about a term in the training manual, but it wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, I remembered how my mentor emphasized the importance of open communication, even for minor things. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014should I text my client immediately about the cleaner, or take a moment to message my mentor about the terminology? Both expected me to be proactive, but I only had a few minutes before the client returned, and I didn\u2019t want to seem distracted or unreliable in either role. My mind raced, torn between the demands of being a responsible cleaner and a diligent mentee, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
