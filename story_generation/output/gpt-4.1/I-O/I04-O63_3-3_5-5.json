It was Jamie, my best friend, her voice shaky and urgent. \u201cMy car broke down on the highway. Can you come get me? Please, I\u2019m scared.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20149:45 p.m. Only two hours left in the quarter, and I was still three sales short of my target. The manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hit the numbers tonight, no bonuses. No exceptions.\u201d I could hear the desperation in Jamie\u2019s voice, but I also felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the pressure to perform, the fear of letting everyone down. My headset felt heavier than ever. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the friend who needed me and the job that demanded everything I had left. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, caught between loyalty and obligation, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
