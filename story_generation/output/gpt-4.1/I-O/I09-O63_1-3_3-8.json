My headset itched against my ear as I listened to another customer hang up. The compliance system blinked on my screen, tracking every second I wasn\u2019t on a call. I knew I couldn\u2019t leave my desk, not even for a minute, or risk being flagged again. But then I remembered tomorrow was trash pickup day. The bins outside were only half-full, but my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always appreciated when I helped fill them with the last bits of recycling from our shared hallway. She\u2019d mentioned how much she valued keeping our space tidy and expected everyone to pitch in. I could run out now and take care of it, but that would mean stepping away from my desk unscheduled, risking a warning from my supervisor. If I waited until my break, the bins might already be out on the curb, and Mrs. Lee would notice I hadn\u2019t helped. My stomach twisted as I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between being a good neighbor and keeping my job safe."}
