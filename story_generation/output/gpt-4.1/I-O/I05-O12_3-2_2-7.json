Users were frustrated, and the QA team was escalating the issue\u2014this was the kind of intermittent error that could spiral into a full-blown crisis if I didn\u2019t act fast. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to dive into the logs, but my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: my mentee\u2019s one-on-one was in five minutes. Today, she needed my full attention\u2014she was weighing a job offer that could change her career, and she\u2019d asked for my honest, structured advice.

The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my undivided attention, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
