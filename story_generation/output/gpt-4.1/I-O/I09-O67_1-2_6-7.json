My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had asked me to receive her package since she\u2019d be out all afternoon. She trusts me, and I know how much she worries about missed deliveries. Just as the truck turned onto our street, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. There was a patient with a broken ankle across town, nothing life-threatening, but protocol demanded I respond immediately. I glanced at the clock, then at the delivery van slowing to a stop. My ambulance keys were already in my hand. If I left now, Mrs. Kim\u2019s package would be sent back, and she\u2019d be disappointed. But if I waited, I\u2019d be late to the call, and my duty as an ambulance driver is to respond quickly, even if the injury isn\u2019t critical. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the responsible ambulance driver, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
