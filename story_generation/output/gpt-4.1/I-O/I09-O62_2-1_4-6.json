Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, was walking by, and I could see her tense up at the noise. I knew she expected me to keep the shared spaces quiet and respect everyone\u2019s peace, especially since she\u2019d mentioned her headaches before. I tried to calm my dog, but I was already running late. At the pool, my mind kept drifting back to the hallway incident. As a lifeguard, I was supposed to be vigilant, making sure no one entered the shallow area without supervision. But my phone buzzed with a message from another neighbor, politely asking if I could do something about my dog\u2019s barking.
