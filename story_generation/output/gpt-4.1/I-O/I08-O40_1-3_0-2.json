As a carpenter, I knew how crucial it was to inspect every tool, every piece of equipment\u2014one missed detail could mean an accident. Just as I was mentally ticking off items, I spotted Mark, an old acquaintance, coming from the other end. He smiled, clearly expecting a friendly chat or at least a warm greeting. I felt the pressure to stop, to be approachable and polite, to maintain that easy friendliness people expected from me. But every second spent chatting meant less time for my safety checks, and I could already feel the anxiety building\u2014what if I missed something important? My mind tugged in two directions: the urge to be a good acquaintance, and the responsibility to be a careful, thorough carpenter. I slowed my steps, heart pounding, caught between the demands of both roles, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
