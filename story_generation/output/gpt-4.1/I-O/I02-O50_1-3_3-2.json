For once, both Mia and I had a few free evenings, and she\u2019d been dropping hints about finally having that long, uninterrupted dinner together. She wanted us to pick a night, just the two of us, no distractions. I promised her I\u2019d make it happen, and I could see how much it meant to her\u2014her eyes lit up every time we talked about it.\n\nBut as I was about to text her my suggestion for Thursday, my work phone buzzed. The hospital\u2019s ICU. A life-support device was flashing critical fault codes, and they needed me to diagnose and fix it\u2014urgently. I could hear the tension in the nurse\u2019s voice, the unspoken plea for help. My mind raced: if I went, I\u2019d have to cancel on Mia, again. If I didn\u2019t, someone\u2019s life could be at risk. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, caught between being the boyfriend Mia deserved and the machine repairer the hospital desperately needed."}
