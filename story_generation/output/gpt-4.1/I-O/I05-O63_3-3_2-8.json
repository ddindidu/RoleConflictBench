As a mentor, I\u2019d promised to help Maya navigate her job offer dilemma\u2014she was waiting for my advice before making a decision that could change her life. My calendar reminder flashed: \u201cMaya\u2019s call\u2014now.\u201d I knew she was anxious, counting on me to provide the structured guidance I\u2019d always given. But as I reached for my phone, the telemarketer dashboard chimed a warning: \u201cScheduled break in 30 minutes. Unscheduled downtime will be flagged.\u201d The compliance system was ruthless; even a few minutes off-script could mean a written warning. My heart pounded. If I took Maya\u2019s call now, I\u2019d risk disciplinary action. If I waited, I\u2019d let her down when she needed me most. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest\u2014my mentee\u2019s future on one side, my job security on the other. I hovered over the \u201cpause\u201d button, torn between the expectations of being a reliable mentor and a rule-abiding telemarketer, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding an answer."}
