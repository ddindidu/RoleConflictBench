As a colleague, I was expected to finish the project report by tonight\u2014my part was the last piece before we could deliver to the client, and everyone was counting on me. The pressure was suffocating; I knew any delay would ripple through the team and damage our reputation.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again, this time with an alert from the precinct. A protest downtown was spiraling out of control, and all off-duty officers were being called in. As a police officer, I was sworn to uphold the law and keep the peace, especially when things got dangerous. My badge wasn\u2019t just a job\u2014it was a promise.\n\nI stared at the screen, heart pounding. My team needed me to finish the report. The city needed me to help restore order.
