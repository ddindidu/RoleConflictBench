My acquaintance, Mark, sat beside me, his voice tinged with urgency. \u201cHey, could you help me move a few boxes into my new place? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to say yes, to be supportive, to show I cared. But as we approached his new apartment, a construction detour forced us into a single, narrow lane right by a school zone. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and sudden movements unpredictable. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra cautious, obey every traffic law, and drive defensively\u2014no shortcuts, no rushing, not even for a friend. Mark glanced at me, expecting a quick stop and a helping hand. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help and the responsibility to keep everyone safe. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, caught in the tension of what I should do next."}
