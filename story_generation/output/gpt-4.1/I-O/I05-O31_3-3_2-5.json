I could see the hope in her eyes, the trust she placed in me to guide her through this pivotal moment. I began outlining the pros and cons, determined to give her the structured, thoughtful guidance she deserved.

As a police officer, I was sworn to protect the public, to respond without hesitation when lives were in danger. But as a mentor, I knew how much Jamie needed me right now, how much this conversation meant for her future.
