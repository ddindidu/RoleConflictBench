I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name flashed with a desperate message: \u201cCan you video call? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her voice. As a friend, I knew she counted on me, especially since she\u2019d just moved and didn\u2019t know many people in town. But as a taxi driver, I had two customers waiting, expecting me to help load their heavy bags and get them to the airport on time. They looked impatient, glancing at their watches, and I could feel their expectation for quick, professional service. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency in my friend\u2019s text against the responsibility to my passengers. I felt torn, guilt creeping in no matter which way I leaned. I gripped the steering wheel, caught between the pull of friendship and the demands of my job, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
