My partner was in the kitchen, humming as he made coffee, the sound both comforting and heavy. It was our last weekend together before he moved abroad for months, and I knew how much this time meant to him\u2014how much it meant to us. He\u2019d planned a day out, just the two of us, no distractions. But my mind kept drifting back to the lab, to the data I\u2019d collected yesterday. The results were promising, maybe even groundbreaking, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. The logs could technically wait, but the urge to document everything while it was fresh gnawed at me. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice, reminding me of the importance of accuracy and timeliness. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds\u2014wanting to be fully present with him, but also not wanting to let my research, or myself, down. I closed my eyes, torn, as his footsteps approached."}
