I know they expect a prompt reply\u2014anything less could hold up the project and reflect poorly on our team. At the same time, my IDE flashes another warning. The new feature I\u2019ve been building is almost done, but the code review just flagged performance issues. I can\u2019t ignore it; clean, efficient code is non-negotiable, and I pride myself on delivering quality work. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between switching to my inbox to fire off a quick response and diving back into the code to fix the warnings before anyone else sees them. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my colleagues counting on my communication, my developer\u2019s conscience demanding technical excellence. My heart pounds as I wrestle with which expectation to meet first, knowing that whichever I choose, something important will have to wait."}
