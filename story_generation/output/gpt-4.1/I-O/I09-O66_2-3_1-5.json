I baked a small cake, hoping to make a good impression and maybe even make a friend or two. As I left my apartment, cake in hand, I saw Mrs. Kim from next door waving at me. She smiled warmly, and I felt a surge of hope that I could fit in here.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014my taxi app had assigned me a ride, and I was already running late. I hurried to my car, still holding the cake, and started the engine. As I pulled out, I remembered the expectation to be friendly and polite, to stop and chat, but I also knew I had to be on time for my passenger.\n\nDriving through the neighborhood, I hit a construction detour that funneled all the cars into a single narrow lane right by the school. Children were clustered near the curb, some darting unpredictably. I felt the pressure to drive carefully, to follow every rule, but I also felt the weight of my neighborly duty\u2014should I have stopped to greet Mrs. Kim? Should I slow down even more, risking being late? My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what was expected of me, both as a neighbor and as a taxi driver, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
