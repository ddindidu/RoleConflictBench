She was away for the week and had asked me to keep an eye out for her package, especially since the building was expecting a power interruption. She sounded anxious, and I\u2019d promised to help. But now, the grocery store was packed, the line at my register snaking down the aisle. My manager had already reminded us to keep things moving, and every customer seemed in a rush, tapping their feet and sighing loudly. I felt the pressure to scan items quickly, double-check prices, and handle payments without mistakes. Yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the worry that Mrs. Patel\u2019s delivery might arrive soon, and if I didn\u2019t act, it could be left outside in the heat or lost. My mind raced, torn between my responsibility to my neighbor and my duty as a cashier. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between the expectations of being a helpful neighbor and a reliable employee, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
