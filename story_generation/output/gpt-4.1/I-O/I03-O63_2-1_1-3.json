My partner slumped beside me, eyes red, shoulders hunched. He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback he got at work, and I could feel the weight of his disappointment filling the room. I wanted to reach out, hold his hand, tell him I was here for him, that he was more than his job. But my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014my sales numbers were soaring this week, and my manager had just sent a message: \u201cKeep up the momentum! Every call counts.\u201d I knew if I kept pushing, I could finally be top of the leaderboard, maybe even get that bonus. But every minute I spent dialing was a minute I wasn\u2019t there for him. My heart twisted as I watched him stare at the floor, needing comfort, while my fingers itched to make the next call. I felt torn, the pressure from work and the ache to be a good girlfriend pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to listen to."}
