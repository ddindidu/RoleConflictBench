I glanced at the caller ID\u2014my best friend. I hesitated, but answered, hearing her shaky voice, \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now.\u201d She sounded on the verge of tears, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to help her sort through the mess of her argument with her partner. But as she started pouring her heart out, my eyes darted back to the counter, where Mr. Lee\u2019s medications waited. I remembered how he once told me a single mistake could send him to the hospital. My mind raced, torn between the urge to comfort my friend and the responsibility to ensure every pill was correct. I tried to focus on her words, but the weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give either the care they deserved at this moment."}
