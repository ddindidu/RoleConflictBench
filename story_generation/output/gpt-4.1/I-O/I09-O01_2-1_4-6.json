The sound echoed off the shared walls, and I winced, imagining Mrs. Lee next door sighing in frustration. As a neighbor, I knew I should keep the noise down, especially since our building was notorious for thin walls. But as an architect, my mind was tangled in deadlines and site visits, and I\u2019d been letting things slide\u2014walking the dog at odd hours, sometimes forgetting to hush him when he got excited by footsteps near the shared doors.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder about a project check-in, and I glanced at the clock. I was supposed to be reviewing the contractor\u2019s progress, but all I could think about was the tension in the hallway, the way my neighbors\u2019 eyes lingered on me and my dog. I felt pulled in two directions: the expectation to be a considerate neighbor, and the pressure to keep my projects moving smoothly. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which role needed me more right now."}
