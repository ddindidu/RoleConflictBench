I answer, and his voice is tight with worry\u2014his car has broken down on a deserted stretch of road, and he\u2019s asking if I can come help. I glance at the clock; my next patient is waiting, a woman here for her annual check-up. She\u2019s been anxious about her health lately, and I know she\u2019ll have a lot of questions. As a doctor, I\u2019m expected to be present, attentive, and reassuring, especially during these routine visits. But as an acquaintance, I feel the pull to help Mark, to not let him down when he\u2019s in a bind.
