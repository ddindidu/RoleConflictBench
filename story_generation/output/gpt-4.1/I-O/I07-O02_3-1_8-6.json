They needed me to confirm technical details for an external partner, and I knew they expected a prompt reply. As a colleague, I prided myself on being responsive, never letting messages linger. But at that moment, I was deep in an informal project planning session with my engineering team. We were tossing around ideas, estimating timelines, and I was the only one who could clarify some of the technical dependencies. The session wasn\u2019t set in stone\u2014our timeline could shift\u2014but my input was crucial for accuracy. I felt the pressure mounting: if I stepped away to answer the email, I\u2019d disrupt the flow and possibly miss key points. If I ignored the email, I\u2019d let down my colleagues in leadership, who were counting on me to keep things moving with the partner. My mind raced, torn between the immediate demand for a reply and the responsibility to my team. I stared at my screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
