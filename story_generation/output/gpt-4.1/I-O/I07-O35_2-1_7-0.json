My team\u2019s group chat was lighting up\u2014three new messages, all asking for clarification on the project specs. I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I replied, and the deadline was tight. But as the subway operator, my next task was the pre-departure check. The systems I needed to inspect weren\u2019t critical, but skipping the routine wasn\u2019t an option; safety and punctuality were non-negotiable. My supervisor always emphasized that even minor lapses could add up. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my colleagues expected a quick response, but the train\u2019s schedule and passenger safety demanded my full attention. My phone buzzed again, and I could almost hear the impatience in their words. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
