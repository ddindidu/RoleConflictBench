The line stretched past the bakery, and I could feel the impatience simmering. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a colleague. I glanced at the preview: \u201cNo action needed, just FYI.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond soon, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good teammate. But right now, my hands were full\u2014literally\u2014with produce and receipts, and my mind was split. If I paused to reply, the line would crawl even slower, and the customers\u2019 friendly faces might turn sour. If I waited, I\u2019d risk seeming unresponsive, maybe even careless, to my coworker. I could feel the pressure mounting, my smile tightening as I tried to juggle the expectations of being both a reliable colleague and a welcoming cashier. The next customer stepped forward, and my phone buzzed again."}
