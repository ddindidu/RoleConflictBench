I recognized her from the list of leads I\u2019d been given at work\u2014her name, her number, and the note: \u201cPotential high-value client.\u201d As an acquaintance, I wanted to make her feel comfortable, to be the friendly face she needed in a sea of strangers. I smiled, introduced myself, and tried to put her at ease with small talk, careful not to overwhelm her.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, the pressure from work gnawed at me. Today was the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s reminders about our sales targets echoed in my head. If I didn\u2019t close at least one more deal, the whole team would miss out on bonuses. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 disappointment, feel the weight of letting them down. I knew I could steer the conversation toward our company\u2019s services, maybe even get her interested. But I also saw her nervousness, her need for genuine connection, not a sales pitch. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the supportive acquaintance she needed and the determined telemarketer my job demanded."}
