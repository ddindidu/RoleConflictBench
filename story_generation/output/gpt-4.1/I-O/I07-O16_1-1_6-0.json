A new email notification blinked insistently\u2014my colleague from the admin team had sent a message, marked \u201cinformational, no immediate action required.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule: we\u2019re expected to respond promptly, even if just to acknowledge receipt. I felt the familiar tug of obligation, the sense that I should at least dash off a quick reply before it slipped my mind.\n\nBut just then, my next patient arrived\u2014a young woman with a runny nose and a cough, likely just a cold, but I couldn\u2019t afford to be careless. My role as a doctor demanded my full attention: listen carefully, ask the right questions, rule out anything more serious. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two worlds pulling at me. If I paused to answer the email, I\u2019d be distracted from my patient. If I focused on the patient, I\u2019d risk seeming unresponsive to my colleague. My mind raced, caught between the need to be a reliable teammate and a thorough physician, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
