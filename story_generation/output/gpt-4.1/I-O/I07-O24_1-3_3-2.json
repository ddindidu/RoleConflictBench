As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish my part on time, but with the generous buffer, I\u2019d planned to take my time and double-check everything. My phone buzzed\u2014a notification from the court clerk. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my docket. As a judge, I was expected to drop everything, review the case files thoroughly, and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. If I shifted focus now, I\u2019d lose my momentum on the report and risk letting my team down, even if the deadline wasn\u2019t pressing. But the urgency of the motion weighed on me; someone\u2019s safety could depend on my immediate attention. I stared at the two stacks of papers on my desk, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing in on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own consequences if I failed. My hands hovered over the files, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and the gravity of my judicial responsibility."}
