She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning a cozy dinner and a movie at home. I promised her my full attention, no distractions. But as I\u2019m tidying up the apartment before she arrives, I notice the cleaning supply cabinet is nearly empty\u2014no detergent, barely any sponges, and we\u2019re out of trash bags. As the designated cleaner in our shared space, I\u2019m expected to keep everything stocked and running smoothly. If I don\u2019t restock tonight, the place will be a mess when I get back, and she\u2019ll be frustrated. But if I run out now, I\u2019ll cut into our precious evening together, breaking my promise. I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, her favorite wine in the other, torn between being the attentive boyfriend she deserves and the responsible cleaner our home needs. My heart pounds as I weigh which expectation to let down."}
