She was new, eager to learn, and today I was supposed to guide her through the closing process\u2014a task where accuracy was crucial. As I walked her through each step, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. It was just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions.\n\nSarah looked at me, waiting for my next move. As her mentor, I wanted to use this as a teaching moment, to show her how to handle mistakes and learn from them. But as a cashier, I was expected to follow procedures to the letter, report the discrepancy, and possibly delay closing. My mind raced, torn between demonstrating flexibility and upholding strict policy. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, my responsibility to Sarah clashing with my duty to the store. My hands hovered over the register, heart pounding, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
