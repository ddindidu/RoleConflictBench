After weeks of mismatched schedules, my girlfriend and I finally carved out a single evening together before I\u2019d be away on assignment. She\u2019d planned everything\u2014her favorite movie, takeout from the place we first met, even a playlist of songs that meant something to us. I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for me to be present, to make this night count.\n\nBut as I was about to put my phone on silent, the radio crackled. A violent assault was unfolding downtown, bystanders in danger, backup needed immediately. My training kicked in, adrenaline surging. I knew what was expected of me as a police officer: to protect, to act, to put others\u2019 safety above all else. But as I looked at her, anticipation turning to worry on her face, I felt torn in two. The weight of duty pressed against the promise of love, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the call of the badge and the warmth of her waiting hand."}
