My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my team, waiting for my input on the project. I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified the next steps. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. But my shift as the housekeeping cleaner was about to start, and I was already running late. I hurried to the supply closet, pulling on my uniform and grabbing the gloves. The manager had been strict lately about safety and hygiene, especially after last week\u2019s inspection. I was supposed to wear gloves for every cleaning task, no exceptions. But my phone kept vibrating in my pocket, each buzz a reminder of my colleagues\u2019 expectations. I stood in the hallway, gloves in hand, torn between the urgent emails and the strict cleaning protocols. My mind raced, weighing the demands of both roles, feeling the tension tighten in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
