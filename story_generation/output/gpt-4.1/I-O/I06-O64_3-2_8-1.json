The line of customers snaked past the candy racks, each person shifting impatiently, arms full of groceries. As a cashier, I was expected to keep things moving, double-check every price, and never let my attention slip. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my mentor, who had squeezed me into her schedule just before catching a flight, was waiting for our call in ten minutes. She\u2019d made it clear how precious this window was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. If I left the register, I\u2019d let down my team and the customers. If I stayed, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s generosity. My hands trembled as I scanned another item, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
