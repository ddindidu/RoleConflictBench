As I handed a receipt to the woman in front of me, I noticed Mark, an old acquaintance from college, step up next. He smiled, balancing a basket of groceries, and leaned in a little. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here? I\u2019m meeting someone tonight and want to impress them.\u201d\n\nAs his cashier, I was supposed to keep the line moving, focus on scanning his items, and make sure every transaction was accurate. But as his acquaintance, I felt the pull to help him out, to chat and offer a thoughtful recommendation. The next customer was already unloading their cart, glancing at their watch. My manager was nearby, watching the registers. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I pause and give Mark the advice he wanted, or keep the line moving and risk seeming unfriendly? My hands hesitated over the register, caught between the expectations of my job and the pull of friendship."}
