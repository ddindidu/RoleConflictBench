My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014again. I knew it was Mia. We\u2019d just had a tense exchange about our weekend plans, a silly misunderstanding, but I could feel her frustration through her messages. As her boyfriend, I wanted to fix things right away, reassure her, smooth it over before it grew into something bigger. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t look away from the water, not even for a second. The beach was packed, the tide was high, and every instinct screamed at me to stay alert. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Mia needed me to be present, to care, to respond; the swimmers needed me to be vigilant, to protect, to act. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to check my phone, torn between the girl I loved and the lives I was responsible for."}
