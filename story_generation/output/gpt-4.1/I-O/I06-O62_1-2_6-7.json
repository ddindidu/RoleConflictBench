As her mentee, I knew how rare it was for her to have time for questions, and she\u2019d made it clear that respecting her schedule was part of being a good mentee. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this chance. But just as I was about to leave my post, a group of teenagers started roughhousing near the deep end, laughing as they ignored the bright red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My lifeguard training kicked in\u2014enforcing safety rules wasn\u2019t optional, and I could already picture the consequences if someone got hurt. My heart pounded as I glanced between the pool and my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, but both demanded my full attention. I stood frozen, torn between the responsibility to my mentor and the duty to keep these kids safe, the seconds ticking by as I wrestled with what to do."}
