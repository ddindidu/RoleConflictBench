My phone buzzed with reminders\u2014just an hour left to hit my weekly target, and I was still three sales short. As I rounded the corner, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Kim, my neighbor from across the hall. She smiled, but her eyes flickered with concern. I remembered the noise complaint that had been circulating\u2014someone had been playing loud music late at night, and a meeting was called in the lobby to address it. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, polite, and understanding, especially now. But as a telemarketer, I felt the pressure mounting\u2014every minute spent chatting was a minute lost from making calls and closing deals. My heart pounded as I tried to balance a warm greeting with the urge to excuse myself and rush back to my desk. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I could feel the stress building as I stood there, caught between being a good neighbor and a successful telemarketer."}
