It was Sam, my closest friend, sobbing on the other end. \u201cI just found out my dad\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d he choked out. My heart twisted. I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to stay on the line, to help him breathe through the panic. I wanted nothing more than to be that person for him, to give him my full attention and comfort.\n\nBut as I tried to focus on his words, another notification popped up on my work phone. A package I was supposed to deliver had just arrived at the depot, later than expected but still within the day. My boss\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDeliver ASAP. Customer is waiting.\u201d I was the only one on the night shift. If I didn\u2019t go now, the customer would complain, and I\u2019d risk my job.\n\nI stared at the ceiling, phone pressed to my ear, torn between being the friend Sam desperately needed and the reliable delivery person my job demanded. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
