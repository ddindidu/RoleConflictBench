It was 2:13 a.m., and the airspace was a tangled mess\u2014dozens of flights circling, pilots anxious, my headset crackling with urgent requests. I couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake. But when I saw my friend\u2019s name flash on my phone, I knew something was wrong. I answered, and her voice was raw, trembling\u2014she could barely get the words out. Her father had just passed away. She needed me, needed someone to listen, to anchor her in the storm. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for her, to offer comfort, to let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But in front of me, the radar pulsed with responsibility\u2014hundreds of lives depended on my focus, my decisions. My friend\u2019s sobs filled my ear, while pilots\u2019 voices filled my headset. I felt split in two, torn between the person who needed me most and the job that demanded my undivided attention. My hands hovered, uncertain, as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
