My girlfriend\u2019s text glared at me: \u201cI thought we agreed on Saturday, not Sunday. Why don\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her words. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk it out, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. She expected me to be present, to resolve things quickly, to show I cared.\n\nBut the delivery app pinged again, reminding me of the groceries in my trunk and the customer waiting at the next stop. The order was marked \u201curgent\u201d\u2014they needed everything for dinner, and the time window was closing fast. As a delivery person, I was expected to be reliable, to get packages to the right place on time, no excuses.\n\nI sat in my car, torn. If I called my girlfriend now, I\u2019d risk being late and disappointing a customer who was counting on me. If I kept driving, I\u2019d leave her feeling ignored and uncared for. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, caught between two worlds, both demanding more than I could give at once."}
