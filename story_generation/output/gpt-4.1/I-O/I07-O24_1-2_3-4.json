As a colleague, I knew my team was waiting for my part of the project, but the deadline was still weeks away, and honestly, they could move forward without my section for now. Still, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014no one wanted to be the one holding things up. But then, as a judge, the weight was different. The bench trial had just ended, and now I had thirty days to write the final judgment. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of timeliness; the legal opinion had to be thorough, every fact and conclusion carefully reasoned and articulated. The parties deserved clarity and justice, and the court expected nothing less. My mind kept drifting between the two roles\u2014my colleagues\u2019 friendly reminders, the silent pressure of the court\u2019s expectations. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the urge to be a reliable teammate and the duty to deliver a meticulous, fair judgment. I stared at the blank page, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose where to focus first."}
