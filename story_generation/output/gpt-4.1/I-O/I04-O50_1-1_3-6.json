First, it\u2019s Sam, my friend, her message popping up: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I know she\u2019s been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there if she needed anything. Before I can reply, my work phone rings. It\u2019s Mr. Patel, a new client, calling right on schedule for his check-in. He\u2019s been anxious about using the new machine, and my boss expects me to be patient and thorough, especially with new clients. I can already hear the uncertainty in his voice as he asks, \u201cCould you walk me through the startup process again?\u201d I glance at Sam\u2019s pleading text, then at the blinking call notification. My chest tightens. Both need me, both expect me to be present and helpful, but I can\u2019t split myself in two. I hesitate, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
