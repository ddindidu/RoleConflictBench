My phone buzzed with a calendar alert: team meeting in fifteen minutes. I was supposed to be there, camera on, ready to discuss the latest project updates\u2014updates that wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input, and I knew my absence would be noticed. But here I was, behind the wheel, responsible for getting my passenger across town safely and on time. She seemed relaxed, in no rush, but I couldn\u2019t just pull over and join the meeting. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my team and my responsibility to my passenger. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed my options, heart pounding with the weight of conflicting expectations."}
