Our argument from last night still hangs in the air, unresolved, and now she\u2019s threatening to leave if we can\u2019t talk it out. My chest tightens with guilt\u2014I know I should call her, try to fix things before it\u2019s too late. But I\u2019m standing behind the pharmacy counter, white coat on, prescription in hand. Mrs. Patel is waiting, her chart a maze of medications for her heart, diabetes, and blood pressure. One mistake could put her in the hospital. My mind races, torn between the urge to step outside and call Mia, to be the boyfriend she needs, and the responsibility to double-check every pill, every instruction, for Mrs. Patel\u2019s sake. The phone vibrates again. My hands tremble as I count the tablets, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be let down."}
