My boyfriend sits in my salon chair, slumped and silent, his eyes red-rimmed from the harsh words his boss threw at him this morning. As his girlfriend, I want nothing more than to wrap my arms around him, reassure him, and let him vent. But as his hairdresser, I see the thick, sticky product clinging to his hair, forming stubborn knots that my scissors can\u2019t possibly cut through. I know I need to wash and condition his hair thoroughly, even if it means more time with his head in the sink, less time for gentle conversation. He looks at me, searching for comfort, but I\u2019m torn\u2014do I pause my professional routine to offer emotional support, or do I focus on the job, risking seeming cold when he needs me most? My hands hover uncertainly, caught between the urge to soothe and the duty to cleanse, my heart pounding with the pressure of both roles demanding all of me at once."}
