It was Mark, an old classmate I\u2019d run into a few weeks ago. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m really in a bind,\u201d he texted. As an acquaintance, I felt that familiar tug\u2014people expect you to step up when they ask for help, especially with something as stressful as moving. But at the same time, I could see the carpenter glancing over, waiting for the next load. On site, I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, to be reliable and efficient. If I left, even for a short while, I\u2019d be letting the crew down, slowing the whole project. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a good friend and the responsibility to my team. I could already feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, each demanding my time and loyalty, and I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, not sure which way to turn."}
