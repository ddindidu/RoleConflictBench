I answered quietly, and his voice trembled\u2014he\u2019d just had a terrible fight with his partner and needed someone to talk to. I could hear the pain in his words, the expectation that I\u2019d listen, offer comfort, be the friend he\u2019d always counted on. But as I tried to focus on his story, my clerk rushed over, eyes wide, and handed me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of my jury instructions. I was expected, as a judge, to immediately halt proceedings, review the new ruling, and ensure the law was followed precisely. My heart pounded.

I felt torn in two\u2014my friend\u2019s need for support clashing with my duty to justice, both demanding my full attention, both impossible to ignore."}
