He nodded toward a mutual colleague across the room and muttered, \u201cDid you hear about her latest project? Total disaster, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak ill of others, but Mark\u2019s expectant look made it hard to simply brush him off.\n\nBefore I could respond, another guest, recognizing me as a lawyer, joined our conversation. \u201cHey, you\u2019re representing that big client, right? What\u2019s the real story behind their case?\u201d he asked, his tone casual but his eyes sharp with curiosity. I felt the weight of my professional responsibility\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable, and I couldn\u2019t reveal anything, not even the smallest detail.\n\nCaught between Mark\u2019s expectation of camaraderie through gossip and the other guest\u2019s probing for confidential information, I felt the tension knotting in my stomach. Both roles demanded something of me, but to fulfill one seemed to betray the other. I hesitated, searching for the right words, my mind racing with the possible consequences of each response."}
