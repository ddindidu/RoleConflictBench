As a machine repairer, I knew how crucial it was to get everything serviced during that narrow window\u2014if I missed it, the whole line could be down for days. But right now, my mind was tangled in the argument I\u2019d just had with my boyfriend. Our voices had risen, words sharp and raw, and now he was in the other room, silent, the air between us thick with uncertainty. He wanted me to talk, to resolve things, to prove that we could work through this instead of letting it fester. I could feel his expectation pressing on me, just as the work notifications did. I wanted to be the girlfriend who could fix things, who could make us okay again, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility waiting for me at the plant. My heart pounded as I stared at the closed door, torn between the person I loved and the job that depended on me, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
