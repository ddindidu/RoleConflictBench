I glanced at the screen\u2014Sam, an old friend from college, was calling. I answered, and his voice was tight with worry. His car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed someone to come pick him up. He didn\u2019t know who else to call. I promised I\u2019d see what I could do, but as I hung up, a sharp voice cut through the salon. Mrs. Greene, my last client, was glaring at her reflection, her voice rising as she complained about her haircut. She demanded I fix it immediately, even though we were already past closing time. My manager shot me a look, expecting me to handle the situation with patience and professionalism. I felt my chest tighten. Sam was stranded and counting on me, but Mrs. Greene was furious and my job required me to make her happy. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between being the friend Sam needed and the hairdresser my client and boss expected."}
