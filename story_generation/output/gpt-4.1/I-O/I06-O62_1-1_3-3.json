As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, even the little things like making sure the pool chairs were perfectly aligned. I noticed a few were slightly out of place\u2014not enough to cause a problem, but enough that my supervisor would probably comment if he saw. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: check in with my mentor. I\u2019d been told to communicate any challenges, no matter how small, and I did have a question about a term in the training manual. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew my mentor valued promptness and openness. I felt a tug inside\u2014should I take a moment to message my mentor about the terminology, or should I focus on straightening the chairs before my supervisor noticed? Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the pressure mounting as I weighed which expectation to meet first."}
