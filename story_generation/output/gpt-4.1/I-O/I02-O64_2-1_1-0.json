My girlfriend, Anna, stands at the end of the counter, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She\u2019d come in just after lunch, her voice trembling as she told me about the harsh feedback her boss gave her. I want nothing more than to step away, wrap her in my arms, and tell her it\u2019s going to be okay. That\u2019s what she needs from me\u2014her boyfriend, her support.\n\nBut the line at my register is growing. Mrs. Patel is waiting with her weekly produce, and a young dad is juggling a toddler and a basket of snacks. My manager glances over, expecting me to keep things moving, to be the reliable cashier who doesn\u2019t let personal matters interfere. My hands shake as I scan a carton of milk, torn between the urge to comfort Anna and the responsibility to do my job right. I can feel Anna\u2019s eyes on me, silently pleading, while the customers shift impatiently. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next."}
