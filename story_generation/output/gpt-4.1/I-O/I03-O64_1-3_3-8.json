I miss you.\u201d I smiled, warmth blooming in my chest. We\u2019d both managed to carve out a few free evenings this week, a rare treat. I wanted to pick the perfect night, to give him my full attention, to make up for all the times work had gotten in the way. But as I tucked my phone away and returned to the register, the holiday rush hit me like a wave. The line snaked past the candy displays, and a woman at the front was already raising her voice, frustrated about a coupon. I forced a smile, trying to stay patient and friendly, even as my heart pounded. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo matter how busy, always be cheerful.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be the attentive girlfriend Alex deserved, but also the reliable cashier my job demanded. My mind raced, torn between texting Alex back right away or focusing on the upset customer in front of me."}
