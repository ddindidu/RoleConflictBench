My mentee had just messaged, anxious about the project deadline, asking if I could review her latest draft before her meeting in an hour. As her mentor, I knew how much she depended on my guidance, especially now when she was struggling to find her footing. I started typing a response, determined to give her the feedback she needed.\n\nBut then, from the corner of my eye, I saw Mrs. Lee, one of my patients, sitting alone by the window, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. She had just received news of her diagnosis, and the room felt heavy with her grief. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be there for her, to offer comfort and a listening ear, to sit with her in her pain.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My mentee needed my support to succeed, but Mrs. Lee needed me now, in this raw, vulnerable moment. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which need to answer first."}
