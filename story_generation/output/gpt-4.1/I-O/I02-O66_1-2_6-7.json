Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your shift?\u201d I could sense her disappointment, the kind that lingers and grows if left unaddressed. I wanted to call her, to explain, to smooth things over before it became a real fight. But just then, two travelers approached my cab, arms full of suitcases, their faces flushed from the heat. \u201cCan you help us load these? And we want to split the fare,\u201d one said, urgency in her voice. I knew I had to be professional\u2014help them with their bags, keep the meter running, and make sure their ride was smooth. But Mia\u2019s message burned in my mind. She expected me to be present, to resolve things quickly, not to leave her hanging. My hands hovered over my phone, torn between sending a quick reply and stepping out to help with the luggage. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, caught between the cab and the call."}
