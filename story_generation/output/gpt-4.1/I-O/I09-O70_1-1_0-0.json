She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly hello. I managed a quick nod, but my mind was racing. The address on the package was hers, and I was the delivery person today. The package was supposed to arrive by noon, but it was already past two. As her neighbor, I wanted to be friendly, maybe even joke about running into each other so often. But as the delivery person, I worried about her disappointment, maybe even a complaint about the delay. I could see the expectation in her eyes for a pleasant exchange, but I also sensed her curiosity about the package in my hands. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between wanting to be the good neighbor she knew and the reliable delivery person she expected."}
