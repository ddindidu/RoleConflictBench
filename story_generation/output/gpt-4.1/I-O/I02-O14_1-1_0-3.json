Her eyes flick up, and she offers a tired smile. I can tell something\u2019s off\u2014her shoulders are tense, and she\u2019s quieter than usual. As her boyfriend, I know I should sit beside her, ask about her day, and listen, really listen, to whatever\u2019s weighing on her. She deserves that support.\n\nBut in my bag, my research notebook nags at me. I just finished a batch of experiments, and the data is fresh in my mind. I should log the results while the details are clear, before the numbers blur and the nuances fade. It\u2019s not urgent, but accuracy matters, and I pride myself on my meticulous records.\n\nI hover in the hallway, torn. Maya needs me now, but so does my work\u2014at least, that\u2019s how it feels. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, guilt prickling at the thought of letting either side down. I take a breath, caught in the space between the person I want to be for her and the scientist I strive to be for myself."}
