The store was quiet, but my thoughts were anything but. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d run into Lisa, an old friend from high school, who had shared a secret about our mutual acquaintance, Mark. It was the kind of information that could ruin someone\u2019s reputation if it got out. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or let this slip, no matter how tempting it was to share the juicy detail with my coworkers, who were always eager for the latest scoop.\n\nBut as a cashier, my focus was supposed to be on the numbers in front of me. The drawer had to balance perfectly, especially with these high-value transactions. Any mistake could mean trouble for me and the store. Yet, the urge to talk about what I\u2019d learned gnawed at me, distracting me from the task at hand. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014one demanding discretion, the other demanding precision. My hands trembled as I tried to count the bills again, my mind torn between keeping a secret and keeping my job."}
