My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, was struggling with a heavy bag, and I remembered our unspoken agreement to only put out the bins when they were full, to avoid cluttering the sidewalk. She caught my eye and asked if I could help her take out her trash, even though the bins were only half-full. I hesitated, knowing she relied on me for these small kindnesses, but I was already running late. At the pharmacy, I was scheduled to fill a high-risk chemotherapy prescription\u2014one that required my full attention and absolute precision. The pressure of knowing a single mistake could harm a patient weighed heavily on me. I felt torn between being a good neighbor, respecting our shared space and Mrs. Lee\u2019s needs, and fulfilling my professional duty to dispense medication safely. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of my community and the critical responsibility of my job, unsure which demand should come first."}
