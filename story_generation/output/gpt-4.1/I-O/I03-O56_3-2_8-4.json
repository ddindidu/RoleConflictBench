My boyfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I knew it was about our fight last night\u2014the one where we both said things we couldn\u2019t take back. He wanted to talk, to fix things, but I was at work, scissors in hand, and a new client sat in my chair, frowning at her reflection. She hesitated, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I expected. Can we fix the colour?\u201d My heart pounded. I was supposed to be calm, attentive, and professional, but my mind was tangled in the words from his last message: \u201cAre we even right for each other?\u201d I wanted to step outside, call him, and try to resolve everything before it slipped away. But my client needed me now, expecting reassurance and a solution. I stood there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which voice to answer first."}
