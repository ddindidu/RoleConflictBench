We\u2019ve been arguing for days, and tonight it\u2019s come to a head\u2014he\u2019s questioning if we should even stay together. I know he expects me to drop everything, to listen, to help us find a way through this mess. But my laptop is open, the court file in front of me. The defendant\u2019s family is waiting, the law is clear: I must draft and sign the bail order immediately, or he\u2019ll spend another night in custody. The court expects precision, clarity, and timeliness\u2014no room for distraction or delay. My phone buzzes again, more desperate this time. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mind torn between the man I love and the oath I swore. My hands tremble as I hover between the keyboard and the phone, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left waiting."}
