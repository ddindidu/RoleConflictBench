Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short: \u201cCan you talk? Had a rough day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just past 5 p.m. I knew she\u2019d been anxious about her performance review, and from her tone, it hadn\u2019t gone well. My heart twisted; I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that she was more than her job.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, my manager appeared at my door, face tense. \u201cThe external auditor needs the financial statements now. Can you pull them together immediately?\u201d My stomach dropped. The audit was critical\u2014any mistake could have serious consequences for the company and my reputation as an accountant.\n\nI stared at my phone, then at the files on my screen. Mia needed me, but so did my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between being the supportive boyfriend she deserved and the reliable accountant my team depended on."}
