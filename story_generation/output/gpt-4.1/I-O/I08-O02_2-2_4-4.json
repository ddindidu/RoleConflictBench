He was moving to a new apartment and asked if I could help him move some boxes this weekend. He sounded desperate\u2014his usual moving crew had bailed, and he didn\u2019t have anyone else to call. I felt that familiar tug of obligation; after all, I\u2019d want someone to help me if I were in his shoes. But as I glanced at my work laptop, my heart sank. As an engineer, I was knee-deep in documentation for our upcoming product release. A new safety standard had just been updated, and my manager made it clear: we needed airtight evidence of compliance before the release, or the whole project could be delayed. The deadline was tight, and I was the only one on the team with enough experience to pull the paperwork together. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the stakes. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mark, asking if I could confirm. I stared at the screen, torn between being a good friend and a responsible engineer, feeling the pressure mount from both sides."}
