As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay updated\u2014missing this session could mean falling behind on the latest treatment protocols, something my patients and my license depended on. But as I opened my email, I noticed a reminder from my mentor: \u201cRemember, always reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\u201d I did have a question, a small one about a term I\u2019d come across in my research. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew my mentor valued open communication and expected me to bring up even minor uncertainties. I hesitated, feeling the pressure from both sides. If I emailed my mentor now, I might miss the start of the webinar or lose focus. If I waited, I\u2019d be going against the spirit of transparency my mentor encouraged. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a diligent mentee and a responsible pharmacist, unsure which role to prioritize in this moment."}
