One of them, a new face, looked especially uneasy, fidgeting with her cup and glancing around. I remembered how hard it could be to feel comfortable in a new group, so I tried to be extra warm, asking gentle questions and smiling often. Just as she started to open up, my phone buzzed\u2014my shift as a subway operator was about to start. I hurried to the control room, switching gears in my mind. Moments after the train left the station, a passenger\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, asking for directions. I was supposed to answer promptly and clearly, ensuring everyone\u2019s safety and comfort. But my mind was still half with the shy acquaintance, wondering if I\u2019d left her feeling abandoned. Now, as I reached for the intercom, I felt torn\u2014should I focus on being the reliable operator, or was I still the friendly face she needed? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds."}
