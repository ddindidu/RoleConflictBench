My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI want to see your code sample before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I\u2019d barely started, and every minute at work felt like time stolen from my assignment. The line of customers snaked past the candy racks, and I forced a smile as I greeted the next person. She slammed her items on the counter, her voice sharp and impatient. \u201cWhy is this taking so long?\u201d I apologized, trying to stay calm, but my thoughts kept drifting to the unfinished code waiting for me at home. I knew my mentor expected me to show initiative and deliver quality work, but right now, my manager expected me to be the model cashier\u2014cheerful, patient, unflappable.
