It was a new client, calling during my scheduled check-in. \u201cHey, could you walk me through the basic settings on the machine?\u201d she asked, her tone friendly but expectant. As a machine repairer, I knew I should take the time to guide her\u2014after all, helping clients understand their equipment was part of my job, and I wanted her to feel supported. But as a colleague, I also had my own tasks to finish. The report wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d have it done by the end of the day, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I spent time with the client now, I\u2019d fall behind on my work. But if I brushed her off, I\u2019d be neglecting my responsibility to provide good service. My mind raced, torn between being a reliable teammate and a helpful repairer, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
