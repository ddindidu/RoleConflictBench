It was Mark, someone I\u2019d met at a few gatherings, friendly but not quite a close friend. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this Saturday? I\u2019m moving to a new place and could really use an extra hand.\u201d I stared at the message, feeling a familiar tug. As an acquaintance, I knew the polite, supportive thing would be to say yes\u2014after all, it\u2019s what people do to build connections, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or unhelpful.\n\nBut then I glanced at the calendar on my desk. Saturday was one of the open slots for running my experiment. The experiment wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d been looking forward to getting some preliminary data, and the lab would be quiet\u2014perfect conditions. I felt the pressure of my scientist role, the expectation to seize every opportunity to advance my research, to be diligent and committed.\n\nI sat there, phone in hand, torn between the pull of being a supportive acquaintance and the drive to be a dedicated scientist. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught in the middle, unsure which role to honor."}
