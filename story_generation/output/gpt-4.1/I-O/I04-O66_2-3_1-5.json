I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name. I could hear the strain in their voice even before I answered. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d they said, their words trembling. I wanted to be there for them, to listen and offer comfort, but the road demanded my full attention. Children darted near the curb, and the construction cones forced me into a single, narrow lane.

My heart twisted, torn between the urge to be the friend they needed and the responsibility to keep everyone safe.
