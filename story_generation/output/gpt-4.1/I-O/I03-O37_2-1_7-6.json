This can\u2019t go on.\u201d My stomach twisted. We\u2019d argued about money all week, and I knew he expected me to help resolve things, to be calm and understanding, to listen and find a way forward. But my shift at the hotel had just started, and I was already behind. The supervisor had warned us again about wearing gloves for every cleaning task\u2014no exceptions. I usually slipped them on only for the worst jobs, but today, with inspections looming, I couldn\u2019t risk it. My hands were raw, my mind distracted, replaying our arguments and his disappointed face. Every time I reached for the gloves, I thought about him waiting for me to fix things, to be the supportive girlfriend he needed. But here, I was supposed to be the perfect cleaner, following every rule, no matter how tired or preoccupied I felt. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled apart, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
