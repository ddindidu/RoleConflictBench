She smiled, but I could sense the tension\u2014everyone had heard about the noise complaint, and I knew she expected me to be extra friendly, maybe even apologetic, just to keep the peace. I wanted to reassure her, to be the good neighbor everyone liked, but my mind kept drifting back to my telemarketing job. Just an hour ago, I was on the phone, struggling to answer a barrage of technical questions about our new service. The script was useless, and my supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, never letting my uncertainty show. Now, as Mrs. Kim started chatting about the noise, I felt the pressure mounting. Should I be honest and open, or keep things light and polite? My head spun with the demands of both roles\u2014always calm, always in control, always saying the right thing. I could feel my smile faltering as I tried to balance the expectations, caught between being the perfect neighbor and the unflappable telemarketer."}
