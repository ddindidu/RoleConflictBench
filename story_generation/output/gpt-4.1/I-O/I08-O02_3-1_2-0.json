Instinctively, I wanted to go over, offer a kind word, maybe just listen\u2014after all, that\u2019s what a decent acquaintance should do. But my mind was already racing with ideas from the meeting, technical possibilities for the new project swirling in my head. As an engineer, I felt the pressure to capture those thoughts before they slipped away, to sketch out a few alternative approaches while the concepts were still fresh. I hovered in the doorway, torn. If I sat with Priya, I might lose my train of thought and miss the chance to contribute something valuable to the project. But if I walked away, I\u2019d be ignoring someone in obvious distress, betraying the friendly, approachable person I try to be. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, and I stood there, paralyzed, caught between the urge to help and the drive to create."}
