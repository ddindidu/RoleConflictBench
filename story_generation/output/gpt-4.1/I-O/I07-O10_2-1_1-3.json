The team meeting was scheduled for 10 a.m.\u2014the same time as the tax law seminar. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, and to stay updated on the project\u2019s progress. The agenda made it clear: today\u2019s meeting would cover critical updates that wouldn\u2019t be shared later. Missing it meant falling behind and letting my teammates down.\n\nBut as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew how vital it was to stay ahead of regulatory changes. The seminar promised insights into upcoming tax laws that could impact our business for years. If I missed it, I risked overlooking crucial compliance issues, potentially putting the company at risk.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder for both events. I felt torn, my loyalty to my team clashing with my responsibility to the company\u2019s financial health. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice urging me to be present for the team, while the weight of my accounting duties pressed just as hard. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, each demanding my full attention."}
