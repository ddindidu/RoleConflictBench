The new office build was already a week behind, and I\u2019d promised my project manager I\u2019d be available for any urgent calls this afternoon. As I scrolled through the punch list, a message popped up from Jamie: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could picture her surrounded by planks and screws, frustration written all over her face. She\u2019d helped me through my own rough patches, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t ask unless she really needed it.\n\nBut my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, the contractor. They needed my input on a structural detail, and any delay could mean another day lost. I felt my chest tighten. Jamie was counting on me as a friend, but my team was relying on me as their architect. Both needed me, right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides."}
