It was Sam, my oldest friend. His voice trembled, \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain\u2014he and his partner had been fighting again. As his friend, I knew he needed me to listen, to be present, to help him sort through the mess of his feelings. But as a lawyer, I was staring at a contract with clauses that could cost my client millions if I didn\u2019t catch a loophole before the deadline tonight. My heart twisted. Sam expected comfort and undivided attention; my client expected sharp focus and immediate action. I stared at the phone, guilt and anxiety warring inside me, torn between being the friend Sam needed and the lawyer my client relied on."}
