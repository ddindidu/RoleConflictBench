The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate and not overstep, but I also don\u2019t want the whole floor to get in trouble. I hesitated, thinking about whether I should knock on her door and ask her to move the stuff, or just leave a polite note. \n\nOn the train, my phone buzzed with an email from management\u2014an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. They say it\u2019s not mandatory, but everyone knows the supervisors expect us to show initiative. I should reply soon, but I\u2019m still distracted by the corridor situation. If I don\u2019t act quickly, the HOA could fine us, but if I don\u2019t respond to the email, I might look uncommitted at work. My mind keeps bouncing between being a good neighbor and a responsible subway operator, feeling the pressure from both sides, unsure which demand to meet first."}
