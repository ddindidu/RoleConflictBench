I promised, knowing how much she worries. But as I poured my coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014another reminder from my manager. \u201cFinal push! Every call counts. We need three more sales to hit target.\u201d The pressure is suffocating; if we miss it, my bonus is gone, and the whole team faces penalties. I know the delivery window is soon, but I also know that every minute away from my headset is a lost opportunity. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between dashing downstairs to help Mrs. Lee or staying glued to my screen, dialing number after number, hoping for a sale. I can almost hear her gentle voice thanking me, but I can also feel my manager\u2019s disappointment if I let the team down. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the knot tightening in my stomach as I try to decide what to do next."}
