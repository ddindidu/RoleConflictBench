As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show my commitment to the team. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to let my coworkers down. But just as I was about to log in, my police radio crackled to life\u2014there\u2019d been a traffic accident nearby, and officers were needed to secure the scene and help the injured. My heart pounded. As a police officer, my duty was clear: protect people, respond quickly, and keep order. I could almost hear my sergeant\u2019s voice reminding me that every second counts in emergencies. Yet, I also felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the subtle disappointment if I missed another meeting. Torn between two worlds, I hesitated, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from opposite sides, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
