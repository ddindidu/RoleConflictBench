My screens are clear, the airspace calm, and for a moment, I can breathe. But my phone buzzes\u2014my mentee, Sarah, is panicking. Her big project presentation is in an hour, and she\u2019s doubting herself. As her mentor, I know I should encourage her, help her find her confidence, maybe even step away for a few minutes to talk her through it. She\u2019s worked so hard, and this could shape her entire career.\n\nBut as an air traffic controller, I can\u2019t just leave my post, even if the skies are empty. The expectation is absolute vigilance, no matter how quiet it seems. My supervisor trusts me to keep the airspace safe, and any lapse could have consequences. I stare at the phone, torn. Sarah needs me now, but so does the responsibility of the tower. My heart pounds as I weigh the demands\u2014support her growth, or uphold the safety I\u2019m sworn to protect. The sun is just beginning to rise, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, each expecting everything from me."}
