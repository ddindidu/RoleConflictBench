Every detail mattered; as a judge, I owed it to both parties to be thorough and impartial. The clock ticked past midnight, but I pressed on, determined to finish my review before dawn. Suddenly, I heard footsteps in the corridor. I glanced up, and through the peephole, I saw Mrs. Kim, my neighbor, fumbling with her groceries. She caught my eye and smiled, expecting the usual friendly hello. I hesitated. As a neighbor, I should step out, offer a hand, exchange a few kind words. But every minute away from my files felt like a betrayal of my duty as a judge. My heart pounded with guilt and frustration. I wanted to be the considerate neighbor she expected, but the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed down on me. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of neighborly kindness and the cold demands of justice, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
