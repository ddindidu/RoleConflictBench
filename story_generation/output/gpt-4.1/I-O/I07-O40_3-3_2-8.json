As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute my thoughts before the team finalized our project\u2019s direction. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew my absence would be noticed. But my other phone buzzed with a call from a frantic homeowner. As a carpenter, I was responsible for urgent repairs, and this house had severe termite damage. The client\u2019s voice trembled as she described sagging beams and the fear of collapse. She needed me to assess the damage and provide a repair plan immediately. My mind raced, torn between the conference room where my team waited and the house where my skills could prevent disaster. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, laptop in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
