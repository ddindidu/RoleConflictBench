She\u2019d left her old stroller and a couple of boxes in the corridor again, right outside my apartment. The HOA inspection was tomorrow, and I knew anything left out could get us both fined. As her neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, maybe help her move the stuff or at least remind her gently. But as a cashier, I was expected to focus\u2014especially now, with the safe open and the numbers needing to match exactly. My manager had warned us: one mistake, and the whole drawer would be off. I could feel the pressure building, my phone buzzing with another message from Mrs. Lee, while the register beeped impatiently for my attention. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
