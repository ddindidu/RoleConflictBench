As a new neighbor, I wanted to make a good impression, maybe even spark a friendship or two. I\u2019d seen Mrs. Kim from next door watering her plants, and I told myself I\u2019d bring the cake over as soon as I finished this last bit of work. But my laptop chimed again\u2014another urgent message from my project manager. The team was waiting on my core module, and the build couldn\u2019t move forward until I finished. I could almost feel the weight of their expectations through the screen: the project timeline was tight, and everyone was counting on me to deliver. Yet, the thought of Mrs. Kim going back inside before I could say hello gnawed at me. I wanted to be the kind of neighbor who was present, friendly, and polite, not the one who was always too busy. My hands hovered between the cake and the keyboard, my mind torn between the warmth of a new connection and the cold logic of a looming deadline."}
