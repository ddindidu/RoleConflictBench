It\u2019s Mrs. Lee from next door, looking anxious. \u201cCould you please receive my package today? I have to be out, and it\u2019s important.\u201d I nod, knowing she often misses deliveries and relies on me for these small favors. Just as she leaves, my phone buzzes\u2014an urgent email from our major supplier. They\u2019re threatening to stop all shipments unless I resolve a past-due invoice immediately. My boss expects a quick response, and the company\u2019s operations depend on it. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I step away to help Mrs. Lee, I might miss the supplier\u2019s call or delay the payment process. But if I ignore her request, I\u2019ll let down a neighbor who trusts me. My mind races, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the responsible accountant, each role demanding my attention at the same critical moment."}
