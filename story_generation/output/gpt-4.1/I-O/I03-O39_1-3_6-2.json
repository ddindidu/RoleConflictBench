She\u2019s upset\u2014apparently, I forgot we were supposed to visit her parents this weekend. I can already hear her voice in my head, soft but wounded, asking why I never listen. I want to call her, to explain, to fix this before it grows into something bigger. But right now, the foreman is shouting my name. The crane is swinging a steel beam overhead, and I\u2019m needed\u2014now\u2014to help guide it into place. The guys are counting on me; if I mess this up, the whole crew is delayed, and someone could get hurt.
