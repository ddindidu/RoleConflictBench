It was the end of my shift, and I was handling the final, high-value transactions of the day. My mind was focused on counting bills, double-checking receipts, and making sure every cent matched up. Just then, Mia, my mentee from the training program, approached with a hesitant smile. \u201cHey, do you have a second? I\u2019m stuck on the new returns process,\u201d she whispered, notebook in hand. I knew she relied on me for guidance, and I always tried to be available, even during short breaks. But now, with customers waiting and the pressure to avoid any mistakes weighing on me, I felt torn. If I paused to help Mia, I risked losing focus and making an error that could cost the store\u2014and me\u2014dearly. If I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting her down, failing to live up to the mentor she needed. My hands hovered over the register keys, my mind pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment."}
