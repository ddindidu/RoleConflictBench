As a colleague, I knew my team was counting on me to finish the quarterly report. The deadline was still a week away, and honestly, the others could keep moving without my section for a bit. But as a lawyer, my phone buzzed with a message from the managing partner: the purchase agreement for our client needed urgent review. The filing deadline was looming, and any delay could jeopardize the deal. My team expected reliability and steady progress, but the legal review demanded my immediate, undivided attention. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I focused on the contract, I\u2019d let my colleagues down; if I prioritized the report, I risked missing a critical legal deadline. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my team and my professional duty as a lawyer, the weight of both expectations pressing in as I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen."}
