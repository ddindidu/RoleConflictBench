My neighbor, Mrs. Patel, had just asked if I could wait until her family finished their spring cleaning tonight before rolling the bins to the curb. She hoped to avoid cluttering the sidewalk with extra bags. As her neighbor, I wanted to be considerate\u2014she\u2019d always been thoughtful about our shared fence and even watered my plants when I was away. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse. Tomorrow, I\u2019d be in the thick of a high-stakes jury trial, representing a client whose future depended on my focus and preparation. There would be no time to rush home and deal with trash in the morning, and missing the pickup would mean overflowing bins for another week. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my neighbor\u2019s trust and my client\u2019s reliance. My hands tightened on the bin handle, torn between being the good neighbor and the diligent lawyer, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
