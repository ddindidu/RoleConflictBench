That afternoon, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door in the hallway. She smiled warmly, and I offered her a slice, eager to start things off on the right foot. We chatted about the neighborhood, and she mentioned her niece had just started working at a law firm\u2014coincidentally, the same firm where I worked as a lawyer.\n\nLater that day, back at the office, an internal assistant I barely knew approached me. She asked if I could give her access to some sensitive client files, saying it would make her job much easier. I knew the files were confidential, and granting access without proper clearance would violate my professional ethics. Yet, I also remembered Mrs. Kim\u2019s kindness and her niece\u2019s new job. If I refused, would word get back to my neighbor that I was difficult at work? I felt the pressure of wanting to be a friendly, helpful neighbor while also upholding my duty as a lawyer. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, leaving me torn and uneasy."}
