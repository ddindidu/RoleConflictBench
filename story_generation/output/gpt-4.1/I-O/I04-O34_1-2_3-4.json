But then I see the message from my friend: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m stuck with this furniture and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I remember how she helped me move last month, how she always shows up when I need her. She\u2019s counting on me now, probably surrounded by scattered screws and frustration. My headset crackles with another pilot\u2019s request, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the friend who\u2019s always there, but I\u2019m also the controller who can\u2019t let a single detail slip. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the urgent needs of the sky and the quiet plea from someone who trusts me."}
