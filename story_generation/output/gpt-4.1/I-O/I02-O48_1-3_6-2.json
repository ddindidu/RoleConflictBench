My girlfriend\u2019s text flashes on the screen: \u201cI thought we were spending Saturday together. Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your shift?\u201d I can sense her disappointment, the tension simmering from our last conversation. I know I should call her, talk it out, clear up the misunderstanding before it grows into something bigger. That\u2019s what she expects from me\u2014to be present, to resolve things, to show I care.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m standing in Mrs. Lee\u2019s room. She\u2019s wincing, barely able to lift her spoon. Her pain is etched across her face, and I know she needs me to help her eat, to offer comfort and dignity. My supervisor expects me to be attentive, to put my patients first, to be reliable in their moments of need.\n\nI feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My phone vibrates again, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes meet mine, pleading silently. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I can\u2019t let either of them down. My chest tightens as I stand frozen, caught between the person I love and the person who needs me most."}
