The team meeting was in ten minutes\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for the next year. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. But as a scientist, I couldn\u2019t ignore the gnawing anxiety in my gut. The safety audit was scheduled for the afternoon, and I knew the lab equipment still had minor issues flagged last week. If I didn\u2019t address them now, we risked failing the audit, putting our research and even our funding in jeopardy. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the meeting, while my mind replayed the lab manager\u2019s warning about the importance of safety compliance. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the weight of responsibility\u2014my team counting on my input, my lab depending on my diligence. I stood frozen in the hallway, the clock ticking, feeling the pressure mount as I wrestled with which role I would have to let down."}
