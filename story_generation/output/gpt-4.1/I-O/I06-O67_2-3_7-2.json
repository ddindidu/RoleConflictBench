My mentor had finally carved out fifteen minutes for me\u2014a rare window in her packed schedule. I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this chance, eager to prove my dedication and respect for her time. As I hurried toward the meeting room, my radio crackled to life. \u201cAll units, we have a multi-vehicle collision on Highway 7. Critical injuries reported. Immediate response needed.\u201d My breath caught. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. The expectation was clear: drop everything, get behind the wheel, and save lives. But my mentor was waiting, expecting me to show up, to value her effort in making time for me. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my mentor and the urgent call for help. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me. If I left, I\u2019d let down someone who believed in me. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray the trust of those counting on me for survival. The weight of both roles pressed down, and I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
