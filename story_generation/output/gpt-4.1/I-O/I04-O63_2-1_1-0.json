It was Jamie, my best friend, and I could hear the strain in their voice before they even finished saying hello. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d Jamie said, voice trembling. I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift had just started, and the call queue was already filling up. As a telemarketer, I was expected to be on every call, ready to answer questions and handle objections smoothly, following the script to the letter. But as a friend, I knew Jamie needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort and support. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the importance of every call, every sale. At the same time, Jamie\u2019s words tugged at my heart, making it impossible to ignore their pain. I stared at my headset, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my friend, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
