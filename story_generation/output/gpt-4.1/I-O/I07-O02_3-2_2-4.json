As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show support for the team as we finalized decisions that would shape the next six months of our work. But as an engineer, my mind was elsewhere. The new safety standard had just been updated, and I\u2019d only just received the documentation. If I didn\u2019t review it now and gather the necessary evidence, we risked non-compliance\u2014a mistake that could have serious consequences for both the product and the company.\n\nMy inbox pinged with a reminder: \u201cMeeting starts in 10 minutes.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. My teammates would notice if I wasn\u2019t present, and my absence could be seen as a lack of commitment. Yet, the responsibility to ensure our design met every regulatory requirement weighed heavily on me. I stared at the meeting invite and the stack of technical documents, torn between the immediate expectations of my team and the critical duty of safeguarding our product\u2019s integrity. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
