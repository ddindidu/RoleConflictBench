As a colleague, I knew how important this one was; the project lead had made it clear that today\u2019s updates wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. Missing it meant falling behind, maybe even letting the team down. My phone buzzed. Dispatch: a noise complaint, just a few blocks away. As a police officer, I was expected to respond quickly, to keep the peace and show the community that we take their concerns seriously. I could already picture the annoyed neighbors, the blaring music, the partygoers who might not cooperate. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the meeting and risk disappointing my team. If I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the public. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. My heart pounded as I stared at the meeting invite and the dispatch message, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
