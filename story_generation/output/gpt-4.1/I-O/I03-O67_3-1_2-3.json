My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex. He\u2019d lost his brother last night, and I could almost feel his pain through the screen. He needed me, needed my words, my presence, my comfort. But I was here, in uniform, responsible for making sure every piece of equipment was ready for the next emergency. If I missed something, a patient could suffer. If I ignored Alex, I\u2019d be letting him down when he needed me most. My mind raced between the sterile order of the ambulance and the raw chaos of Alex\u2019s grief. I wanted to drop everything and rush to him, but I couldn\u2019t abandon my post. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stared at the half-checked kit, my phone glowing with unread messages, torn between duty and love, unable to move."}
