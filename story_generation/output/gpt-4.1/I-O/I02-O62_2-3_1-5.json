She\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback she got at work, her voice trembling as she tried to make sense of it. I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around her, listen, and reassure her that she was more than enough. But as I reached for her hand, I caught sight of the pool\u2019s filtration system\u2014its warning light blinking an urgent red. My mind raced. As a lifeguard, I knew a malfunction could put every swimmer at risk, and it was my responsibility to fix it immediately. But Mia needed me, right now, to be her boyfriend, to be present and supportive. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the weight of both roles. I could see the expectation in her eyes, pleading for comfort, while the flashing light demanded my attention as a lifeguard. I stood there, caught between the person I loved and the duty I couldn\u2019t ignore, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
