Ours was only half-full, but I knew Mrs. Patel next door always waited until the last minute to put hers out, and she\u2019d mentioned her son was away this week. As her neighbor, I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I offer to share our bin space so she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about overflow? It seemed like the considerate thing to do, but I hesitated, remembering the awkwardness last time when she seemed reluctant to mix household waste.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the optional brainstorming session for the new product features was tomorrow, right when I usually take out the trash. As a software developer, I knew how important it was to show up and collaborate, even if it wasn\u2019t mandatory. Product valued input from every team, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. But if I missed the window to help Mrs. Patel, I\u2019d feel guilty for not being a good neighbor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the roles I was supposed to play."}
