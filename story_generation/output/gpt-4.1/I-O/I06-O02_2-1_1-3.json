She\u2019d spent time explaining the concepts, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But as I opened my work calendar, a reminder popped up about the upcoming safety audit. The audit was still weeks away, but as the team\u2019s engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every document was up to date and every process compliant. My manager had emphasized the importance of getting ahead, not waiting until the last minute. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust in me, and my duty to my team and company. My mind raced, torn between diving into the code sample and starting the documentation updates. Both roles demanded my best, but I only had so much time and energy. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, wondering which responsibility I should tackle first."}
