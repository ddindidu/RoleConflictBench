My girlfriend lay beside me, her eyes red and swollen from crying. She hadn\u2019t said much since the phone call, just held my hand tightly, as if I could anchor her to something solid. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to hold her, to let her know she wasn\u2019t alone in her grief. But my phone kept buzzing\u2014Slack messages piling up, reminders about the design documents due tomorrow. The product manager was waiting for my technical input, and the other teams couldn\u2019t move forward without it. I could almost hear the impatience in their messages, the subtle pressure to deliver. My mind raced between the two worlds: the quiet, heavy sadness in this room and the urgent, collaborative energy of my team. I felt torn, guilty for even thinking about work, but also anxious about letting my colleagues down. My heart ached for her, but my mind kept drifting to the unfinished diagrams and unanswered questions. I stared at the screen, paralyzed, not knowing which world needed me more right now."}
