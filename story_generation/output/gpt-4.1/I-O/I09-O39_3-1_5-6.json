The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all in trouble. As a neighbor, I feel responsible for keeping the shared space clear and safe, but I also promised my foreman I\u2019d help with the optional training session at the construction site next week. He hinted it could lead to more hours if I showed commitment. I\u2019m torn\u2014if I stay late tonight to clear the corridor, I\u2019ll be exhausted for work and might miss the training. But if I leave it, my neighbors could get fined, and I\u2019ll be the inconsiderate one. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time. I stand in the hallway, staring at the mess, feeling the pressure build as I try to figure out what to do next."}
