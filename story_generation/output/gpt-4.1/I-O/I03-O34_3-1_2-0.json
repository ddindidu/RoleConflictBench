I know why he\u2019s calling\u2014he lost his brother last night, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, no matter what. My heart aches to answer, to be the comfort he needs, but my headset crackles with the voices of pilots checking in.

My supervisor expects unwavering focus, and the pilots trust me to keep them safe. Yet, every second I don\u2019t pick up, I imagine him alone in the dark, needing me.
