As a mentor, I had promised my team a structured session this afternoon, carefully preparing materials to help them master the skills they\u2019d need for our upcoming project deadline. They were counting on me to guide them, to share what I\u2019d learned from years in the field. But just as I was about to gather everyone, my phone buzzed with an urgent email. As the company\u2019s accountant, I was responsible for handling all financial communications, and now a major supplier was threatening to halt shipments unless we settled a significant overdue invoice immediately. My mind raced\u2014if I didn\u2019t address the supplier\u2019s demand, our project could grind to a halt. But if I postponed the mentoring session, I\u2019d let down my team, leaving them unprepared and anxious. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the needs of my team and the demands of our business partners, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
