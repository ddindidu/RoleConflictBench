We\u2019d talked about it for days, planning to pick the perfect night for a long, uninterrupted dinner together. He sent me a message, \u201cHow about tonight? Just us, no distractions.\u201d I could almost feel his excitement through the screen, and I wanted nothing more than to say yes.\n\nBut as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was a notification from the court: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. I was the judge on call. The documents were already in my inbox, and protocol demanded I review everything and make a ruling within the hour. The weight of the responsibility pressed down on me\u2014someone\u2019s safety could depend on my decision.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My boyfriend\u2019s expectations for quality time clashed with my duty to the court. I felt the familiar ache of guilt and frustration, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
