The team meeting was about to start, and as a colleague, I was expected to be there, to listen, contribute, and show support. These meetings were the only place where certain project updates were shared, and missing them meant being out of the loop. But as an engineer, my mind kept drifting back to the new safety standard that had just been updated. The upcoming release depended on our compliance, and I was the one responsible for gathering the evidence. The deadline was tight, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t double-check the documentation now, we could risk a costly delay or even a failed audit. My inbox pinged with a reminder for the meeting, while my desktop flashed with the regulatory checklist. I felt torn, the weight of my responsibilities pulling me in two directions. Should I join my team and risk falling behind on compliance, or focus on the standards and risk missing crucial project updates? My heart pounded as I hovered over the meeting link, caught between the expectations of being a good colleague and a diligent engineer."}
