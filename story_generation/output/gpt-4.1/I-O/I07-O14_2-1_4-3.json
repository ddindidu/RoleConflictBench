As a colleague, I knew my part of the project was due today\u2014if I missed the deadline, the next person in line would be stuck waiting, and the whole team\u2019s timeline would unravel. My phone buzzed with a reminder: update the research logs for the latest experiment. As a scientist, I felt the weight of responsibility to document every detail accurately, even if the logs could technically wait until tomorrow. But if I rushed through the data entry now, I risked missing something important. My mind spun with the pressure\u2014my teammate counting on me to finish, my own standards demanding careful, thorough records. I could feel the tension in my shoulders, torn between letting someone down and compromising my scientific integrity. I hovered over the keyboard, caught in the middle, unsure which role to serve first."}
