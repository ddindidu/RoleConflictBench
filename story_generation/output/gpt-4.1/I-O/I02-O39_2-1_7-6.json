We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014money, always money. She wanted us to talk it out, to finally resolve things instead of letting them fester. I knew she expected me to step up, to be the one who could fix this, to show her I cared enough to try. But at work, a new notice had gone up: an optional training session next week. The foreman said it\u2019d help us work safer, maybe even open up better shifts. The guys were all planning to go, and I knew if I skipped it, I\u2019d look like I wasn\u2019t committed to the team. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my girlfriend needed me to be present, to talk, to make things right, but my job needed me to show up, to be reliable, to keep up with everyone else. My chest tightened as I scrolled through her messages, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
