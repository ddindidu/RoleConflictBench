I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of neighbor who smiled in the hallway and offered a slice of something sweet. But today, I was scheduled for a long shift at the grocery store, and as I tied my apron, I reminded myself to be extra patient\u2014lunch hour always brought a rush. The line stretched past the magazine rack, and I greeted each customer with practiced warmth, scanning items and making small talk, even as my mind wandered to the cake at home. \n\nThen, as I handed change to the next customer, I recognized her\u2014my neighbor from across the hall. She smiled, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I mention the cake now, risking a personal conversation that might slow the line and frustrate waiting shoppers? Or should I keep things strictly professional, possibly missing my chance to connect as a neighbor? My heart pounded as I tried to balance the expectations of friendly service with the hope of a new friendship, caught between the demands of my two worlds."}
