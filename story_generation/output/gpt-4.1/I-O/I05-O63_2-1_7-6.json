As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to take my break now\u2014supervisors are lenient today since the call volume is light. But my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my mentee. She\u2019s anxious, her big interview is tomorrow, and she\u2019s asking if I can hop on a quick call to help her practice. I know how much this means to her; as her mentor, I\u2019m expected to support her growth, especially at moments like this. Yet, I also know that if I don\u2019t take my break now, I\u2019ll be out of sync with the team\u2019s schedule, risking a reprimand or even losing the rare flexibility we\u2019re being offered. My mind races, torn between the urge to be there for Maya and the need to respect my own boundaries at work. The weight of both roles presses on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sit frozen, headset in hand, unable to move."}
