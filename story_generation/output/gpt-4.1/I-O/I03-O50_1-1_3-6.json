He\u2019d been hinting at a movie night, maybe even cooking together, and I could tell he was excited for some real quality time. I promised him I\u2019d keep my evenings open, no last-minute work calls, just us. But this afternoon, as I was wrapping up my last job, a new client called. She sounded nervous, asking if I could walk her through some basic machine operations. It was supposed to be a routine check-in, but she clearly needed more guidance. I could hear the anxiety in her voice, and I knew how overwhelming these machines could be for beginners. My boyfriend texted me just then, asking which night I wanted to spend together. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations\u2014being the supportive girlfriend he deserved, and the reliable expert my client needed. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy either without letting the other down."}
