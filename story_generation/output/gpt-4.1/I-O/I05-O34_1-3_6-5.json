My mentee, Sarah, had just left my side after our usual check-in. She\u2019d confessed, voice tight, that she was drowning in tasks and missing deadlines. As her mentor, I wanted to help her find balance, to encourage her to prioritize and grow. I\u2019d promised we\u2019d talk more after my shift, maybe even review her schedule together.\n\nBut now, my screen flashed: a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through, tense\u2014low fuel, immediate vectors needed. My training as an air traffic controller kicked in, every second critical. The expectation was clear: keep the skies safe, communicate with precision, no room for error or delay.\n\nYet, as I prepared to respond, my mind tugged back to Sarah. Was I failing her by not being available right now? Was I failing the pilot if I let my thoughts drift? The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of mistakes. My heart pounded as I hovered between the two, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at this moment."}
