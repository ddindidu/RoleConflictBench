That morning, I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I ran into anyone. As I left for my shift at the construction site, I tucked the cake into my bag, thinking maybe I\u2019d have a chance to offer it after work. But as I walked out, I saw Mrs. Lee, the elderly woman from next door, struggling with her groceries. She smiled warmly, and I knew this was the perfect moment to introduce myself and offer the cake. \n\nBut just then, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the site manager. The crane was already holding a heavy steel beam in place, and they needed me right away to help guide it before it could be secured. My heart pounded. I could see Mrs. Lee\u2019s hopeful expression, expecting a friendly chat and maybe a slice of cake, but I also knew the crew was counting on me to be there, fast. I stood frozen, torn between being the good neighbor I wanted to be and the reliable worker I was expected to be."}
