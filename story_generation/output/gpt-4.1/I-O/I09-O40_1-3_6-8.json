She\u2019s my neighbor, and she\u2019s asked me to sign for it since she\u2019s working late. I promised her I\u2019d help\u2014after all, we look out for each other on this street. But just as I\u2019m settling in, my phone buzzes with a call from a client. Their voice is tense: the termites have eaten through a support beam, and the house isn\u2019t safe. They need me to come over right away, assess the damage, and figure out a repair plan before nightfall. I can hear the panic in their voice, and as a carpenter, I know how urgent this is. My mind races\u2014if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss the delivery for Mrs. Lee, and she\u2019ll be disappointed, maybe even lose her package. But if I stay, I\u2019m letting down a family whose home could be at risk. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the reliable neighbor and the responsible carpenter, both expecting me to be there when it matters most."}
