Instinctively, I wanted to go over, offer a hug, and listen\u2014just be the friend she needed. But my phone buzzed: a message from the nurse\u2019s station. Mrs. Patel, my patient, was awake from surgery and asking for me. She\u2019d been so anxious about her recovery, and I knew she needed reassurance and a calm presence right now.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between two worlds. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to comfort Jamie, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be by Mrs. Patel\u2019s side, to provide the support she counted on. My heart ached with the weight of both responsibilities, each demanding my presence, each equally urgent in its own way. I could feel the pressure building, my mind racing as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
