Why did you make other plans?\u201d My heart sank. I could sense the disappointment behind his words, and I knew I needed to call him, to explain, to smooth things over before the misunderstanding grew. But just as I was about to dial, my work phone rang. \u201cHello, this is your delivery driver. Can you tell me when my package will arrive?\u201d The customer\u2019s tone was sharp, impatient. I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was almost over, but I still had to finish my route and keep my responses professional. My mind raced, torn between wanting to reassure Alex and needing to stay calm and courteous for my customer.
