As a colleague, I was expected to join, share updates, and show I was engaged, even if it was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my absence might be noticed. Just then, two travelers waved me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. As a taxi driver, I was expected to help them load their bags and provide a smooth, professional ride\u2014especially since they wanted to split the fare, which always took extra attention. My mind raced. If I focused on the meeting, I\u2019d risk giving poor service and possibly losing a tip or a good review. But if I skipped the meeting, I might seem disengaged to my team. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being a reliable colleague and a dependable driver, both roles demanding my full attention at the same time."}
