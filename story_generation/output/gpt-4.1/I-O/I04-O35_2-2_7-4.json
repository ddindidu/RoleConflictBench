It\u2019s a message from Jamie, my best friend, and the words sting: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me.\u201d I scroll up, rereading my last text\u2014meant as a joke, but I see now how it could have sounded harsh. Jamie\u2019s always valued honesty between us, and I know if I don\u2019t call right now, the misunderstanding will fester. But as I reach for my phone, the radio crackles: \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart pounds. I\u2019m responsible for everyone\u2019s safety on this train, and protocol says I need to act fast, alert security, and reassure the passengers. My friend expects me to be there, to clear things up before the hurt grows. My job demands my full attention, to keep hundreds of strangers safe. I stand frozen, phone in hand, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the weighty duty of my uniform, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
