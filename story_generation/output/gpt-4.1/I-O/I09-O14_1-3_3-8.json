Mrs. Patel from next door waved, her usual friendly reminder in her eyes: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we all share the curb space.\u201d I knew the unspoken rule\u2014don\u2019t put out bins unless they\u2019re full, so everyone has room. But my phone buzzed urgently. The lab\u2019s monitoring system was sending alerts: the gas chromatograph was malfunctioning, and if I didn\u2019t get there soon, it could leak hazardous chemicals. My mind raced. As a neighbor, I should respect the shared space and wait until next week. As a scientist, I had a duty to rush to the lab and prevent a safety breach. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me, my hand tightening on the bin\u2019s handle, heart pounding as I looked from the curb to my car keys, torn between the expectations of my community and my profession."}
