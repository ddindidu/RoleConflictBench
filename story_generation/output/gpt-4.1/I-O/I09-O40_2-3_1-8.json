As I walked up the path to my next-door neighbor\u2019s house, I rehearsed a friendly greeting in my head, determined to be the kind of neighbor people liked to see. Just as I reached the porch, I noticed the telltale signs of termite damage along the wooden railing\u2014soft, crumbling wood and faint trails of dust. Instinctively, my carpenter\u2019s eye took over, cataloging the extent of the damage and the urgency of repairs needed. I knew that if left unchecked, the structure could become dangerous. But as a neighbor, I was supposed to be warm and welcoming, not alarming or critical. Should I hand over the cake with a smile and keep quiet, or should I immediately point out the damage and offer my professional help? The expectations of being a friendly neighbor clashed with my responsibility as a carpenter. My heart pounded as I stood at the door, cake in one hand, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which to let guide my next words."}
