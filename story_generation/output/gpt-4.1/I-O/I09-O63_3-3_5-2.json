How do I know this offer is even real?\u201d he snapped. I glanced at the clock\u2014just ten minutes until the HOA inspection. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had left her potted plants and a shoe rack in the corridor again. If the inspector saw them, we\u2019d both get cited for blocking the emergency exit. As a neighbor, I was expected to be considerate, maybe even help her move the items, but as a telemarketer, I couldn\u2019t just hang up. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection, answer every question, and never let a call drop. My heart pounded as I tried to explain the offer\u2019s legitimacy, but my mind kept drifting to the hallway, picturing the inspector\u2019s clipboard and Mrs. Lee\u2019s worried face. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
