The phone queue was endless, and management had sent another reminder about sticking to our scheduled breaks\u2014no exceptions. I glanced at the clock, knowing my next break was still twenty minutes away. Suddenly, through my apartment door, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. I knew immediately what was happening: Mrs. Lee from next door must be coming home, and my dog always got vocal when someone passed by our shared entrance. \n\nAs a neighbor, I felt responsible for keeping the peace, making sure my dog didn\u2019t disturb others. I imagined Mrs. Lee sighing in frustration, maybe even considering a complaint. But as a telemarketer, I couldn\u2019t just step away from my desk\u2014every unscheduled break was tracked, and I\u2019d already been warned about my adherence to the rules. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, torn between the urge to quiet my dog and the pressure to stay glued to my headset, wrestling with the impossible expectations of both roles."}
