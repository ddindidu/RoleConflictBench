Can you come get me? Please, I\u2019m scared.\u201d I could hear the panic in his voice, and my gut twisted. As a friend, I knew what was expected\u2014drop everything, help him out, be there when he needed me most. But I was sitting in my tiny cubicle, headset on, staring at the sales dashboard. I was still three sales short of my weekly target, and there was only an hour left in my shift. If I didn\u2019t hit the number, my manager would be on my case again, and my bonus would slip away. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cWe need you to deliver, or we all fall behind.\u201d My hands shook as I weighed the phone in my palm, torn between the desperate plea of my friend and the relentless pressure of my job. The clock ticked louder, and my heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do."}
