I had a terrible day.\u201d I can almost hear the tremor in her voice, see the way her shoulders slump when she\u2019s upset. I want to be there, to listen, to reassure her that she\u2019s more than her boss\u2019s words. But the clock on the wall is relentless. In ten minutes, the pre-shift briefing starts\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. New procedures are being rolled out, and missing the details could mean risking passenger safety or even my job. My phone buzzes again, her name flashing insistently. I feel the weight of her need, the expectation that I\u2019ll be her anchor. At the same time, the responsibility of hundreds of commuters presses on me, the unspoken demand to be focused, alert, professional.
