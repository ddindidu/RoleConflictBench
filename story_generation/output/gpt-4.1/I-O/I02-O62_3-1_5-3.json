My girlfriend sits across from me at the caf\u00e9, her eyes bright with excitement and a hint of sadness\u2014this is our last weekend together before she leaves for months. I promised her undivided attention, to make every moment count. But my mind keeps drifting back to the pool. As the head lifeguard, I\u2019m responsible for the safety and order of the facility, and I remember noticing earlier that a few pool chairs were out of place. They\u2019re not dangerous, but the rules are clear: everything must be in perfect order before closing. My supervisor expects nothing less. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my girlfriend\u2019s hopeful gaze, the nagging thought of the misaligned chairs. I want to be present, to hold her hand and laugh like nothing else matters, but the lifeguard in me can\u2019t ignore the duty tugging at my conscience. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between love and responsibility."}
