It\u2019s another message from Emily\u2014my girlfriend. Last night\u2019s argument still hangs heavy between us, and her words sting: \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d I know she expects me to call, to fix things before they fall apart for good. But Mrs. Carter is waiting, her frail voice calling out for help. As a nursing assistant, I\u2019m supposed to be present, patient, and gentle, making sure she feels safe and cared for.
