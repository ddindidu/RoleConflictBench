She had that eager look, notebook in hand, ready to ask about the nuances of patient communication. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned over years of practice. But my mind kept drifting back to the patient in exam room three\u2014a middle-aged man with a fever, joint pain, and a rash that didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern. The lab results were inconclusive, and I knew I needed to focus, to piece together the puzzle before his condition worsened. Yet, Sarah\u2019s questions tugged at me; she looked up to me, expecting guidance and wisdom. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the urge to mentor and the duty to diagnose, each demanding my presence in different ways. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between nurturing a future doctor and saving a patient in the present."}
