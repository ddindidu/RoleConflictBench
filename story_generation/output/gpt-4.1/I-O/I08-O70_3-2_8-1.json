She greeted me warmly, but her eyes darted around before she leaned in, whispering, \u201cDid you hear about Mark? I heard something big\u2014something that could really change how people see him.\u201d I knew exactly what she was talking about; I\u2019d accidentally overheard Mark\u2019s private conversation last week. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip, never wanting to be the source of rumors or harm someone\u2019s reputation. But Lisa pressed, her curiosity insistent, and I felt the weight of her expectation to share.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: a customer was anxiously tracking their grocery delivery, messaging that they needed it for dinner in less than thirty minutes. My job as a delivery person demanded punctuality and accuracy, and I could feel the pressure mounting. I stood there, torn between Lisa\u2019s probing questions and the urgent need to get back on the road. My mind raced, caught between the risk of betraying someone\u2019s trust and the responsibility of fulfilling my work commitment. I hesitated, feeling the tension tighten in my chest, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
