The team meeting was in fifteen minutes\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our department for the next year. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. But at the same time, my laptop pinged with a reminder: the national continuing education webinar for pharmacists was about to start. Missing it meant falling behind on the latest treatment protocols and risking my licensure. My manager had emphasized the importance of the meeting, but the pharmacy board was equally clear\u2014professional development wasn\u2019t optional. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations pressing on one shoulder, the responsibility to my profession on the other. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my team and my duty as a pharmacist, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
