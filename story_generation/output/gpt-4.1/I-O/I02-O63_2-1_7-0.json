We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014her frustration simmering, my explanations sounding more like excuses each time. I knew she expected me to step up, to help us find a solution, to be the boyfriend who could resolve things instead of letting them fester.\n\nBut right now, I was at my desk, headset on, dialing the next number on my telemarketer list. The script was easy, the customers mostly polite, their questions predictable. \u201cIs there a contract?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the monthly fee?\u201d I had answers ready, my voice smooth and reassuring. My manager expected me to keep my numbers up, to handle every objection with a smile.\n\nYet, as I listened to a customer ask about cancellation policies, my mind drifted back to my girlfriend\u2019s words. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one voice urging me to focus on the call, the other whispering that I couldn\u2019t keep putting off the conversation at home. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either role what it truly needed from me."}
