The technical hurdle was beyond me, and I knew my mentor expected me to reach out whenever I hit a wall. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t struggle alone\u2014let me help.\u201d My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the urgent message from dispatch: an armed robbery in progress, just blocks away. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was trained to respond without hesitation, to protect lives and restore order. But as a mentee, I was supposed to communicate my struggles, to be open and honest about setbacks. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I call my mentor and admit I was stuck, or rush out the door, badge and gun ready, to face the danger on the street? The expectations clashed inside me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the call for help and the call to duty."}
