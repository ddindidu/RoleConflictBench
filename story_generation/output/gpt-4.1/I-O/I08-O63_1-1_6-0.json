As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but today, the group was dissecting every recent decision our mutual colleague, Sarah, had made. I could feel their eyes flick to me, waiting for my input. My mind flashed to my other role\u2014telemarketer\u2014where I was expected to handle objections and questions with ease, always ready with a script to smooth things over. At work, I was used to addressing concerns directly, even if it meant steering the conversation toward uncomfortable truths. Here, though, the expectation was different. I felt the pressure to join in, to share my own opinions about Sarah, but I also felt the weight of my own values, the need to avoid negativity. My stomach twisted as I tried to reconcile the urge to respond confidently, as I would on a call, with the desire to stay neutral and kind among friends. The group fell silent, waiting for me to speak, and I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between two worlds."}
