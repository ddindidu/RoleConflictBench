She was heading to a casual meeting, and the traffic was light\u2014no rush, really. As I navigated the city streets, she sighed and asked, \u201cDo you think I should take this internship or wait for something better?\u201d I felt the familiar tug of my mentor side, the urge to offer thoughtful guidance, to help her weigh her options. But as a taxi driver, my job was to focus on the road, to get her to her destination safely and on time, not to get distracted by deep conversations. I could sense her expectation for a meaningful answer, but I also knew that even a moment\u2019s lapse in attention could put us both at risk. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with the urge to help and the responsibility to drive, caught between the roles I played and the demands they placed on me."}
