Our last weekend together!\u201d My chest tightens. She\u2019s leaving for months, and I promised her a special evening\u2014just us, no distractions. But as the train glides into the next station, a warning light blinks on the panel. There\u2019s a minor signal delay ahead. Dispatch\u2019s voice crackles in my earpiece, reminding me to adjust speed carefully, keep the schedule tight, and avoid any sudden stops that could jostle passengers. My mind races. If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll miss our dinner reservation, and she\u2019ll be disappointed on a night that means so much. But if I rush, I risk passenger safety and my job. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014her hopeful anticipation, the silent trust of everyone on board. My hands grip the controls, heart pounding, torn between the tracks and the promise I made."}
