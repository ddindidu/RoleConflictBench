It was Mia, my closest friend, her voice trembling through sobs. She\u2019d just gotten terrible news about her dad, and I could hear her heartbreak in every word. I wanted nothing more than to listen, to be the friend she needed\u2014someone who would stay on the line, offer comfort, and let her cry it out. But I was also on the clock, standing in the back room of the salon, prepping for my first client of the day. The woman in my chair had thick, tangled hair caked with product, and I knew if I didn\u2019t start washing and conditioning right away, I\u2019d fall behind schedule and risk a bad cut. My hands shook as I held the phone, torn between the urge to be there for Mia and the professional duty pressing in on me. I could hear her sniffling, waiting for me to say something, while the clock ticked and my client glanced impatiently at her watch. My heart ached, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
