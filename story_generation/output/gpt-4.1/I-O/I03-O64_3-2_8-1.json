The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently. My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently urging me to keep things moving. But my phone, tucked under the counter, vibrates again. It\u2019s him\u2014my boyfriend. Our argument from this morning still burns in my chest. His last message flashes on the screen: \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d My heart pounds. I know I should focus on the register, count the change, smile at the next customer. But my mind is tangled in the fight, replaying every harsh word. I want to call him, to fix things before it\u2019s too late, but the next customer is already unloading their cart. I feel split in two\u2014torn between the duty to my job and the desperate need to save my relationship. The line grows longer, my phone buzzes again, and I\u2019m frozen, caught between the demands of the checkout and the fear of losing him forever."}
