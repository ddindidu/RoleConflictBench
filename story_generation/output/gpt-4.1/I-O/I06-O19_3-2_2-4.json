My mentor\u2019s email glared at me from the screen, reminding me that the assignment\u2014an in-depth drug interaction analysis\u2014was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. I knew how much my mentor valued thoroughness and punctuality, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down, especially with my future prospects on the line. Just as I started typing, the pharmacy bell chimed. A patient approached, prescription in hand, eyes anxious. She was starting a new medication and needed guidance on how to take it and what side effects to watch for. As a pharmacist, I knew my responsibility was to ensure she understood everything, to answer her questions with patience and care. But every minute I spent with her was a minute lost on my assignment. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my mentor and my duty to my patient. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to prioritize, knowing that either choice would come at a cost."}
