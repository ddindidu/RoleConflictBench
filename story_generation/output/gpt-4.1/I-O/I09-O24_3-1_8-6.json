And with the power outage, just check on things if you can.\u201d I nodded, promising to help. That\u2019s what neighbors do\u2014look out for each other, especially when small emergencies pop up. But as soon as I closed my door, I saw the thick envelope on my table: the latest law review journal, just delivered. I\u2019d been waiting for this issue, knowing it held crucial updates on legal theories that could affect my upcoming cases. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay ahead, to read, to be prepared for any argument in court. The planned power interruption loomed, and I realized I\u2019d need to juggle checking on Mrs. Kim\u2019s apartment, possibly in the dark, while also carving out time to study these new legal developments. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each too important to ignore. I stood in my hallway, torn, feeling the tension between being a good neighbor and a diligent judge."}
