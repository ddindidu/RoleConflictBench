I\u2019m panicking about the project presentation.\u201d I knew how much this meant to her\u2014her whole future seemed to hinge on this moment. As her mentor, I was supposed to be her anchor, the one who encouraged her to push through, to believe in herself. I could almost hear her voice trembling, waiting for my reassurance.\n\nBut as I set my phone down, the sharp scent of ammonia reminded me of my other role. I was in the middle of my housekeeping shift, and I\u2019d just discovered we were out of the specialized cleaner Mrs. Patel insisted on for her antique wood floors. She expected me to manage supplies, to never let this happen. If I left now, I\u2019d risk her disappointment, maybe even my job.\n\nMy mind spun between the two worlds\u2014my mentee\u2019s desperate need for guidance, and my obligation to keep this household running smoothly. Both roles demanded my full attention, both expected me to be reliable. I stood frozen, torn between the call of growth and the call of duty, heart pounding as I weighed which expectation I would have to let down."}
