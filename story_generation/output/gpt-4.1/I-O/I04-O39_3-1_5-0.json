It was a frantic call from my friend, her voice shaky as she explained her car had broken down on the side of the highway. She needed me, now, and I could hear the fear in her words. My heart twisted\u2014I knew what it meant to be stranded at night, and I wanted nothing more than to rush to her side. But as I glanced at the stack of unused materials my supervisor had pointed out earlier, reality hit me. He\u2019d been clear: those materials had to be moved before the end of the day, no excuses. I could already imagine his disappointment, maybe even anger, if I left the job unfinished. My hands trembled as I weighed the urgency in my friend\u2019s voice against the responsibility I owed my team. The pressure built inside me, two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, phone in hand, caught between being the friend she needed and the worker I was expected to be."}
