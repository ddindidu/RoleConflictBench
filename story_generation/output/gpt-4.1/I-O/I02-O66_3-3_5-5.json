My girlfriend sits beside me, her hand in mine, her eyes searching my face for reassurance. It\u2019s our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I promised her a day she\u2019d never forget. But as I turn onto Maple Avenue, orange cones force us into a single lane. Up ahead, a cluster of children giggle near the curb, their backpacks bouncing as they chase a soccer ball. The school zone sign flashes, reminding me to slow to a crawl. My phone buzzes with a message from her: \u201cLet\u2019s not waste a second.\u201d I feel her expectation, the weight of our dwindling time together. But behind the wheel, I\u2019m also a taxi driver, responsible for every life on this street. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to hurry, to make the most of our day, and the duty to drive safely, to obey the law. The children\u2019s laughter mixes with her soft sigh, and I grip the steering wheel, caught between love and responsibility, not sure which role to honor in this moment."}
