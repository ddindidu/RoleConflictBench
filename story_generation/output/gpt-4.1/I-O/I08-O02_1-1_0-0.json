As an engineer, I was supposed to be thinking creatively, considering every possible technical solution before we settled on a direction. My head buzzed with ideas and half-formed questions, and I was rehearsing how I might present a new approach in the next meeting. Suddenly, I noticed Mark, an old acquaintance from another department, coming toward me. He smiled, expecting the usual friendly nod or a quick chat. As an acquaintance, I knew I should be approachable, maybe even ask about his weekend or share a laugh. But my thoughts were still wrapped around the project, and I felt a wave of irritation at the interruption. I wanted to be polite, but I also needed to stay focused, afraid that even a brief conversation would scatter my ideas. The hallway felt even quieter as I hesitated, caught between the pressure to be friendly and the urge to protect my mental space for engineering creativity."}
