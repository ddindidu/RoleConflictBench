As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to drop everything, sit beside him, and offer the comfort I knew he needed\u2014maybe a gentle squeeze of his hand, a few whispered reassurances. But just as I took a step toward him, the bell above the door jingled and Mrs. Carter, one of my regulars, breezed in with her usual bright smile. The receptionist was busy on the phone, and I knew it was my job as the hairdresser to greet Mrs. Carter, make her feel welcome, and keep the salon\u2019s warm reputation intact. My heart tugged in two directions: Alex\u2019s silent plea for support, and Mrs. Carter\u2019s expectant gaze. I could feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing as I stood frozen between the man I love and the client who trusts me."}
