As an acquaintance, I was expected to be warm and approachable, especially when I noticed a new face\u2014someone who looked lost and anxious in the corner. I wanted to make them feel welcome, to ease their nerves with gentle conversation and a reassuring presence. But my phone buzzed with a message from the hospital: a family was waiting for me, desperate for answers about their loved one\u2019s condition. As a doctor, I was expected to be clear, compassionate, and strong, even as I prepared to deliver news that would shatter their world. My mind raced between the two roles\u2014one demanding lightness and comfort, the other requiring gravity and empathy. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart torn between staying to help a stranger feel at ease and rushing to fulfill my duty to a family in crisis. I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
