Our argument from last night still hung heavy between us, and his words\u2014\u201cMaybe we\u2019re not right for each other\u201d\u2014echoed in my mind. I knew he expected me to call, to talk things through, to fight for us. But just as I reached for my phone, the call light blinked for Mr. Harris in room 204. He\u2019d just had surgery, and his last set of vitals were a little high. The nurse reminded me, \u201cWe need those vitals now, and keep a close eye on him.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. I wanted to fix things with Alex, to show him I cared enough to resolve our fight. But I also knew Mr. Harris depended on me to monitor his recovery, to catch any sign of trouble. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my relationship teetering on the edge, my patient needing my focus. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the person I loved and the person who needed my care."}
