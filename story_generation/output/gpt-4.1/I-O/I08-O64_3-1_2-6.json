The store was quiet, and I tried to keep my smile warm and my tone friendly, just as my manager expected. Suddenly, I saw Jamie, someone I knew from my apartment building, step into my line. Her eyes were red and puffy, and she clutched a crumpled tissue. As she placed her items on the belt, she avoided my gaze, but I could see she was barely holding it together.\n\nAs her acquaintance, I wanted to reach out, ask if she was okay, maybe even step away for a moment to comfort her. But as the cashier, I was supposed to keep the line moving, greet each customer with the same cheerful professionalism, and not get too personal. The next customer was already waiting, glancing at their watch. My heart twisted as I tried to balance the urge to be a caring friend with the need to do my job efficiently. I could feel both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I hesitated, caught between what I wanted to do and what I was supposed to do."}
