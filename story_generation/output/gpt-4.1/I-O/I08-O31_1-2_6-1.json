The conversation swirled around me\u2014sharp words about a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions, voices rising with judgment and speculation. As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken rule: don\u2019t add fuel to the fire, don\u2019t gossip, keep the peace in small ways. But my mind was only half on the conversation. Just across the street, a protest was gathering momentum, the chants growing louder, the mood shifting from passionate to volatile. As a police officer, I knew my duty: step in if things got out of hand, enforce the law, protect everyone\u2019s safety. My phone buzzed with updates from my unit, tension knotting in my stomach. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me wanting to quietly steer the group away from negativity, the other bracing to intervene if the protest turned chaotic. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I could feel my heart pounding as I weighed which role would demand my action first."}
