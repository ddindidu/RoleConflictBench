The bearing was screeching so loudly it echoed up the stairwell, and I knew if I didn\u2019t fix it soon, the whole system could fail. I grabbed my tools and rushed out, only to run into Mrs. Kim and a few other neighbors in the lobby. They were gathered for a meeting about the recent noise complaints\u2014ironically, probably about the very machine I was supposed to fix. Mrs. Kim smiled and greeted me, expecting the usual friendly chat. I could see the expectation in her eyes: be polite, listen, maybe even apologize on behalf of the building. But my mind was racing with the urgency of the repair. Every second I spent here, the risk of a breakdown grew. I felt torn, caught between being the considerate neighbor everyone expected and the responsible repairer who needed to act fast. My heart pounded as I stood there, tools in hand, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
