As a mentor, I\u2019m supposed to encourage my mentee, Jamie, who\u2019s been struggling with time management. Our casual check-ins have turned into Jamie quietly confessing how overwhelmed they feel, and I know I should sit down with them, help them prioritize, maybe even share some of my own strategies. But as a scientist, I\u2019m painfully aware that the safety audit is just hours away. The lab\u2019s centrifuge has been making a strange noise, and the chemical inventory is overdue for a check\u2014both flagged in the last inspection. My supervisor expects everything to be flawless, and any slip could mean a shutdown. Jamie waits outside my office, hopeful, while my inbox pings with reminders about the audit. I feel torn, my mind racing between the urge to support Jamie\u2019s growth and the responsibility to keep the lab safe. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety of knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
