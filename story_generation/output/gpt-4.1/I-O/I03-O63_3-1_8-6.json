I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d My heart pounds. We just had a fight\u2014our worst yet\u2014and now everything feels like it\u2019s hanging by a thread. I know I should call him, try to fix things before it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do: resolve conflicts, not let them fester.\n\nBut I\u2019m sitting at my telemarketing desk, headset on, the hum of the office in my ears. The call volume is light today, and my supervisor said we could take our breaks whenever. I glance at the clock. Technically, I could step out now, but I\u2019m supposed to stick to my scheduled break. If I leave early, I risk getting a warning, maybe even losing the flexibility I\u2019ve earned.\n\nMy thumb hovers over the \u201ccall\u201d button, torn between the desperate need to save my relationship and the responsibility to my job. The pressure builds in my chest, each second stretching the distance between what I want to do and what I\u2019m supposed to do."}
