She smiled, but her eyes darted to the building manager, who was holding a clipboard. The noise complaint had everyone on edge. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, polite, maybe even offer a reassuring word. I forced a smile, nodding to everyone, trying to seem approachable. But my phone buzzed\u2014my next taxi shift was about to start, and the rain outside was relentless. I knew the roads would be slick, other drivers impatient, and as a taxi driver, I was expected to follow every traffic law, drive defensively, and keep my passengers safe. My mind raced: should I linger and be the good neighbor, smoothing over tensions, or rush out to meet my shift, bracing for the stress of the wet roads and unpredictable traffic? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
