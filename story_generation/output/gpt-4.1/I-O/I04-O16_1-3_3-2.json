The ER was tense\u2014this patient\u2019s symptoms were severe, and the cause was a mystery. I could feel the weight of my responsibility as a doctor: every second counted, and my team looked to me for answers. But the message on my phone was from Sam, my oldest friend. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this furniture. The instructions make no sense.\u201d I pictured Sam, surrounded by scattered screws and planks, frustration written all over his face. He\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me now, even for something as trivial as a bookshelf. My heart twisted. As a friend, I wanted to help, to be the person Sam could rely on. But as a doctor, I was needed here, right now, with a life hanging in the balance. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the call of friendship and the duty of care."}
