My mentor had always told me to reach out immediately if anything threatened our project, and now, with my teammates at each other\u2019s throats, the deadline was slipping through my fingers. But here, behind the register, I was expected to smile, to be patient and friendly, even as the woman in front of me complained about the price of wrapping paper. My mind raced with what I should say to my mentor, how I could explain the mess, but I couldn\u2019t step away. The customer\u2019s voice grew sharper, and I forced myself to nod and apologize, my heart pounding. I knew I was supposed to communicate with my mentor right away, but I also couldn\u2019t abandon my post, not with the holiday rush in full swing. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I stood there, torn, the phone still buzzing, the register beeping, and my own anxiety rising with every second."}
