I\u2019d spent hours preparing this lesson, determined to give them the tools they needed before their big project deadline. They looked to me for guidance, expecting insight and structure, and I felt the weight of their anticipation. Just as I began to explain the first concept, a sudden splash caught my attention. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small child flailing in the deep end\u2014an area strictly off-limits for non-swimmers. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every life in the pool, expected to enforce safety and act instantly in emergencies. But as a mentor, I was supposed to be present, focused, and supportive, especially now, with so much riding on this session. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, my mind racing as I stood frozen between the group of interns and the struggling child."}
