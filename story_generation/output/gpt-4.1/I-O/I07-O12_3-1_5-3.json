As a colleague, I knew the task in front of me was crucial\u2014my part was the linchpin for the client delivery, and everyone was counting on me to finish by Friday. The pressure was mounting; I could almost feel the weight of my teammates\u2019 expectations pressing on my shoulders. But as a software developer, I also felt the pull of the upcoming brainstorming session. Product had invited us to help shape the next big feature, and even though attendance was technically optional, I knew my input would matter. I wanted to be part of the creative process, to have a say in what we\u2019d build next, and to show I was invested in the team\u2019s future. The two roles tugged at me from opposite sides\u2014one demanding focus and speed, the other asking for vision and collaboration. My mind raced, torn between the urgent and the important, knowing that whatever I chose, something would have to give."}
