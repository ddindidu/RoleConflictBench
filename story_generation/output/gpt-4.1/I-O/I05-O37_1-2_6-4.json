She looked exhausted, her planner overflowing with sticky notes. I wanted to encourage her, to help her find balance and grow, but as she spoke about her deadlines, my mind drifted to my other job. I remembered the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner at Mrs. Patel\u2019s house. The next cleaning was in three days, and I was expected to keep her home spotless and well-stocked. I should have picked up supplies after my last shift, but I\u2019d been running late to this very meeting with Jamie. Now, as Jamie waited for my advice, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. I was supposed to be fully present, guiding her through her struggles, but my thoughts kept circling back to the list of things I needed to buy and the risk of disappointing Mrs. Patel. I wanted to be the mentor Jamie needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my housekeeping standards slip. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
