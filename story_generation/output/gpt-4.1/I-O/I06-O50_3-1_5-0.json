My mentor had always told me to reach out at the first sign of trouble, and now, with my teammates at each other\u2019s throats, our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. I knew I should call her, explain the situation, and ask for guidance before things got worse. But just as I was about to dial, the production supervisor rushed in, waving a maintenance ticket. The old packaging machine\u2014one I barely remembered\u2014was acting up again, and even though the line was slow today, any downtime could snowball into bigger issues later. I was the only one on shift with the right experience to diagnose it. My mind raced: if I left the team conflict unaddressed, the project could collapse. But if I ignored the machine, a minor glitch could become a major breakdown. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between being a responsible mentee and a reliable repairer."}
