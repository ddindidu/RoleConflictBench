My mind raced\u2014every word I said from this point on could be legally wrong. I felt the weight of my robe, the eyes of the courtroom on me, and the expectation that I would know exactly what to do. At the same time, I remembered the conversation I\u2019d had with an acquaintance just that morning. She\u2019d confided in me about a sensitive matter involving one of the attorneys in this very case. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t gossip, wouldn\u2019t let that information color my judgment or slip out in conversation. Now, as the room waited for my next move, I felt the pressure of both roles: the judge who must be up-to-the-minute on the law, and the acquaintance who must keep confidences and avoid harm. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads of these expectations, knowing that whatever I did next would define me in both roles."}
