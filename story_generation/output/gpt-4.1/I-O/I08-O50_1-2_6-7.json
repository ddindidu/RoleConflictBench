The conversation had turned to Mark, the operator on the morning shift. People were whispering about his recent mistakes, how he kept changing the machine settings and wasting materials. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to nod along, maybe even add a comment, but I knew gossiping wasn\u2019t right. At the same time, as the machine repairer, I was expected to address these issues directly and guide operators like Mark to prevent further waste. My supervisor had already hinted that I should be more assertive in correcting operator errors. The group looked at me, waiting for my input\u2014wasn\u2019t I the one who knew exactly what was going wrong?
