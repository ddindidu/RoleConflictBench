As a neighbor, I knew how important it was to keep shared spaces clear\u2014especially since the HOA had sent out strict reminders about blocking emergency exits. I noticed a few buckets and tools left by my roommate, who was also a laborer like me, and I made a mental note to move them before the inspector arrived. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a call from the site foreman; they needed me to cover a shift immediately. I rushed to the construction site, still thinking about the corridor.\n\nAt work, I barely had time to put on my hard hat before I saw a coworker step under a crane\u2019s suspended load. Instinctively, I wanted to shout a warning, but I hesitated\u2014if I yelled, I\u2019d break the site\u2019s strict noise protocol, risking a reprimand. My mind raced: as a laborer, I was expected to keep the site safe and orderly, but as a neighbor, I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about the corridor back home. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
