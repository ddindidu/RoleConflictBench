She\u2019s always careful not to overfill it, and I remembered the unspoken rule: don\u2019t crowd the curb with extra bags or use someone else\u2019s space. Our bins were only half-full, but I hesitated, not wanting to seem inconsiderate by putting out more than my share. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a new client, Mr. Patel, was calling. He sounded anxious, asking for some quick tips on his new machine. As a repairer, I\u2019m expected to be patient and thorough, even during routine check-ins. I could hear the stress in his voice, and I knew he needed reassurance. But I was still standing in the driveway, trash bag in hand, aware that Mrs. Lee was watching. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on being a good neighbor, or step away to give my client the attention he deserved? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between the curb and the call, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
