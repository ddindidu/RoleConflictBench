I remembered Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. She always smiled when I brought her mail or checked in after heavy rain. I knew she\u2019d appreciate someone stopping by tonight, just in case the power went out or she needed help. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my team was starting an informal project planning session online. As the lead engineer, I was expected to join, share my insights, and help estimate our timeline. It wasn\u2019t a critical meeting, but my input would shape the week ahead. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure from both sides. Mrs. Kim might need me, but my team counted on my expertise. My mind raced, torn between being a good neighbor and a reliable engineer, the weight of both expectations pressing in as the storm clouds gathered outside."}
