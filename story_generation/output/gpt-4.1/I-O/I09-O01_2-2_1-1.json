As I stepped into the hallway, I spotted Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly, and I felt the pressure to be friendly, to make a good impression. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014earlier that morning, I\u2019d reviewed the renovation plans for the apartment above. As an architect, I\u2019d noticed a glaring safety issue: the contractor had ignored a crucial support beam. If I didn\u2019t intervene, someone could get hurt. Yet, Mrs. Kim was excitedly telling me about her own plans to renovate, asking for my opinion. I could feel the cake trembling in my hands. Should I warn her immediately, risking our budding neighborly rapport and possibly alarming her? Or should I keep the conversation light, as a good neighbor would, and address the safety issue through official channels later? The expectations of being both a friendly neighbor and a responsible architect pulled at me, and I stood there, caught between the two roles, unsure which to honor first."}
