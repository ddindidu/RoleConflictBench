The line of customers snaked past the candy racks, each person shifting impatiently, arms full of groceries. As a cashier, I knew I had to keep the line moving, double-check every price, and make sure no mistakes slipped through. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my mentor had carved out a rare fifteen-minute window for me, squeezed between their own meetings. I\u2019d promised to respect their time, to show I valued their guidance. Now, I was trapped between the expectations of two worlds: the relentless pace of the checkout and the fleeting chance to learn from someone I admired. My hands trembled as I scanned items, my mind torn. If I left, I\u2019d let down my team and the customers. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the meeting and risk disappointing my mentor. The pressure built inside me, a knot of guilt and anxiety, as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
