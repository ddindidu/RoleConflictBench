My phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, desperate for advice on a critical project hurdle. I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide them through these tough moments, and our regular check-in was due in ten minutes. But just as I started drafting my feedback, my assistant rushed in with a thick stack of papers\u2014an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The law demanded my immediate attention; I had to review every detail and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a steady, supportive mentor and my duty as a judge to ensure justice was served swiftly and fairly.
