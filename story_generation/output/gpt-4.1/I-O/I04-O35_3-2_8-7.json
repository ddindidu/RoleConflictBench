Just minutes ago, I\u2019d seen the message from Jamie\u2014my offhand joke at dinner last night had really stung, and now they were hurt and confused. I knew I had to call, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: we talk things out, we don\u2019t let silence fester. But as I reached for my phone, the loudspeaker crackled overhead, calling all operators to the mandatory pre-shift briefing. New procedures, they\u2019d said\u2014attendance was non-negotiable, and missing it could mean disciplinary action. My uniform felt tighter, the weight of responsibility pressing down. I glanced at the clock, then at my phone again. Jamie needed me, but so did my job. I could already hear the supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the standards I was expected to uphold. My thumb hovered over Jamie\u2019s contact, my other hand clutching my operator\u2019s badge, torn between the friend who needed my words and the duty that demanded my presence."}
