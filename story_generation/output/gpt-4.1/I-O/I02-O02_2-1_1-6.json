My partner slumped beside me, eyes red, clutching her phone. She\u2019d just gotten a terse email from her boss\u2014her big project wasn\u2019t good enough, apparently. She needed me, I could feel it in the way she leaned closer, silent but hopeful. I wanted to put my arm around her, to tell her she was brilliant, that her boss was wrong. But the team was waiting for my input. They needed my estimates for the new feature, and I knew if I didn\u2019t speak up now, the whole plan could get muddled. My manager expected me to be precise, to think ahead, even if the session was casual. I could see the chat window blinking, my name tagged. My partner\u2019s hand brushed mine, seeking comfort. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close the laptop and be present for her, and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
