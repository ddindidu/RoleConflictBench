As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish my part of the project by the end of the week. There was plenty of buffer time, and honestly, the others could keep moving without my section for a bit. Still, I didn\u2019t want to be the one holding things up or seem unreliable.\n\nBut as the company\u2019s accountant, I had just received a message from a client, confused about a line item on their latest invoice. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cAlways respond to client inquiries promptly\u2014our reputation depends on it.\u201d I knew this was time-sensitive; the client was waiting, and any delay could affect our relationship.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, torn between being a dependable teammate and a responsive accountant.
