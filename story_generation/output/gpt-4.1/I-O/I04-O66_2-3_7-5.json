It was Mia, my closest friend, her message sharp and short: \u201cWow, didn\u2019t know you felt that way.\u201d My heart dropped. She\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text, and I could tell she was hurt. I knew I should call her right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let things fester. But as the light turned green, I eased the taxi forward, only to see the road ahead squeeze into a single lane, orange cones everywhere, and a cluster of kids waiting to cross. My job demanded my full attention now\u2014eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, every sense alert. I couldn\u2019t risk a distraction, not here, not with children so close. The urge to grab my phone and call Mia gnawed at me, but the responsibility of driving safely pressed just as hard. I felt torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my chest, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
