I glanced at the screen\u2014an acquaintance from my apartment building. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here? I\u2019ve got family visiting tonight.\u201d I knew he expected a quick, thoughtful reply; he\u2019d helped me with a flat tire last month, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or ungrateful. But just then, the carpenter waved at me, impatience clear on his face. He needed the next load of lumber, and if I didn\u2019t keep up, the whole crew would be delayed. My supervisor had already warned me about staying focused and not using my phone on the job. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014on one hand, the urge to be helpful and maintain a friendly connection, on the other, the responsibility to keep the work moving and not let the team down. My thumb hovered over the phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
