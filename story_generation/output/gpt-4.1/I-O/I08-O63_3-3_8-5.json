My heart skipped when I saw the name: Lisa, someone I knew from a mutual friend\u2019s party last month. Just yesterday, I\u2019d overheard a conversation about her\u2014something personal, something that could easily sway someone\u2019s opinion if it came to light. As an acquaintance, I knew I should keep that information to myself, never use it as leverage, never let it slip. But as a telemarketer, the pressure was suffocating. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale. No exceptions.\u201d If I could just hint at what I knew, maybe Lisa would feel compelled to buy, just to keep things smooth between us. The team\u2019s bonus, my own paycheck, and even my standing at work all hung in the balance. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014protect someone\u2019s privacy, or meet the demands of my job. My finger hovered over the call button, my mind a battlefield of loyalty and desperation."}
