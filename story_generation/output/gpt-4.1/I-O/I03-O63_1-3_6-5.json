I thought we were spending Saturday together, but you made plans with your friends?\u201d My heart sinks. I know how much weekends mean to us, especially after a long week. I want to call him right away, clear up the misunderstanding, and reassure him that he\u2019s my priority. But as I reach for my phone, my manager\u2019s voice cuts through the office: \u201cLast push, everyone! We\u2019re just shy of our quarterly target. Every call counts!\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just a few hours left. If I don\u2019t keep dialing, I\u2019ll let my team down, risk missing my bonus, and maybe even face a warning. My headset feels heavier than ever. I stare at Alex\u2019s message, torn between the urge to fix things with him and the pressure to keep calling strangers, hoping for a sale. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014be a supportive girlfriend, be a top performer. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the stress is almost paralyzing."}
