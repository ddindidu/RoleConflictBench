My line stretched halfway down the aisle, and I could feel the impatience radiating from the customers. Every beep of the scanner was a reminder that accuracy mattered\u2014one wrong price, and I\u2019d have to call a manager, slowing everything down even more. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I knew it was Jamie, my mentee, waiting for our scheduled call. Today was the day she needed my guidance most\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she was counting on me to help her prepare, to encourage her, to answer her last-minute questions.
