It was from Mark, an old acquaintance. \u201cHey, could you help me move a few boxes to my new place? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I glanced at the rearview mirror; my passenger, a young woman, was scrolling through her phone, relaxed, heading to a casual meeting with time to spare. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get her to her destination safely and on time, no detours, no delays. But as an acquaintance, I felt the tug of obligation\u2014Mark wouldn\u2019t have asked if he wasn\u2019t desperate. My mind raced: could I quickly swing by and help him, just for a few minutes? Would my passenger mind, or would she be upset at the unexpected stop? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which expectation to honor."}
