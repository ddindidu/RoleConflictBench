My neighbor, Mr. Lee, had asked me earlier if I could wait until the bins were full before putting them out, so we wouldn\u2019t clutter the curb. Our shared bin was only half-full, but I knew if I didn\u2019t take it out tonight, I\u2019d miss the pickup\u2014my shift tomorrow started before sunrise. As a neighbor, I wanted to respect Mr. Lee\u2019s wishes and keep our shared space tidy. But as a cashier, I couldn\u2019t just leave my post; I had to stay focused, make sure every item scanned correctly, and keep the line moving. My mind kept drifting to the bin outside, wondering if I should sneak out during my break or just leave it for next week. The pressure of doing right by Mr. Lee and not letting down my manager or the customers made my chest tight. I could feel the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which expectation I should meet."}
