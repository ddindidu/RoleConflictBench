It was Jamie, frantic\u2014he was on his way to the airport and thought he\u2019d left his passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight!\u201d he pleaded. As his friend, I knew how much this trip meant to him, and I wanted to help, to be there for him like he\u2019d been for me so many times before.\n\nBut as I glanced up from my phone, I saw a small child flailing in the deep end, where swimming was strictly off-limits. My training as a lifeguard kicked in\u2014every second counted, and I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety. I could hear the supervisor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cNever leave your post. Not for anything.\u201d Yet Jamie\u2019s voice echoed in my ear, desperate and trusting.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood at the edge of two worlds, torn between the friend who needed me and the duty that demanded my full attention. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly fulfill them both at once."}
