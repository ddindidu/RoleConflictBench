It was a message from Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, reminding me about her package delivery. She was out of town, and with the planned power outage, she was worried her food delivery would spoil if left outside. She\u2019d asked me to check her doorstep around noon, just when my shift was at its busiest. I glanced at the clock\u2014her delivery window was starting. At the same moment, I noticed a swimmer in the middle lane, their strokes growing uneven, head bobbing awkwardly above the water. My training screamed at me to keep my focus on the pool, to be ready to jump in at any second. But Mrs. Lee was counting on me, and I knew how much she worried about her groceries. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my neighbor and my duty as a lifeguard. I felt the pressure mounting, heart pounding, as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly meet them both at once."}
