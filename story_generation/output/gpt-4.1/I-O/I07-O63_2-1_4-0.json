As a colleague, I knew I had to finish this report by noon\u2014if I didn\u2019t, Priya couldn\u2019t start her part, and the whole project would stall. The deadline was tight, but manageable if I focused. Just as I started to type, my headset beeped. Another call. As a telemarketer, I was expected to answer every call promptly, handle objections, and keep the conversation flowing. The script was familiar, and most callers were easy, but I couldn\u2019t ignore them or let the phone ring out. My manager watched our response times closely.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. If I ignored the call, I\u2019d be letting down my telemarketing team and risking a reprimand. If I took it, I\u2019d lose precious minutes on the report, possibly delaying Priya and the rest of the team. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between two sets of expectations, both urgent, both important. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding my attention, and I didn\u2019t know which to choose."}
