She was already on her way to the airport, trusting me to keep an eye out for her packages during the building\u2019s planned power outage. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014watering plants, collecting mail, exchanging pleasantries in the hallway. But as I glanced at the thick stack of legal documents on my desk, my stomach tightened. The purchase agreement for my client was complicated, and the filing deadline was less than 24 hours away. Missing a detail could cost someone thousands, maybe more. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in: Mrs. Kim\u2019s trust in my reliability, my client\u2019s expectation of my diligence and expertise. I wanted to help her, to be the neighbor she counted on, but every minute away from my desk was a minute closer to missing something crucial in the contract. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of community and the cold precision of my profession, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
