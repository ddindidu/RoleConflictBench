As her acquaintance, I\u2019d always tried to keep things friendly but professional, never prying into her life. Today, though, I overheard a heated phone call\u2014her voice trembling as she mentioned a mistake at work that could cost her job. The words stuck with me, heavy and private. Later, in the staff break room, a couple of other cleaners started speculating about Mrs. Lee\u2019s recent moodiness. They turned to me, expecting me to join in, maybe share something juicy. I felt the pressure to fit in, to be part of the group, but I also remembered the trust that comes with being an acquaintance. At the same time, my supervisor walked in, eyeing my gloves and reminding everyone about the new hygiene protocols. I realized I\u2019d forgotten to change my gloves after handling the trash, distracted by the conversation. My mind raced\u2014should I speak up about Mrs. Lee, risking her reputation, or stay silent and risk being left out? And do I admit my mistake with the gloves, or hope no one noticed? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between what was expected and what felt right."}
