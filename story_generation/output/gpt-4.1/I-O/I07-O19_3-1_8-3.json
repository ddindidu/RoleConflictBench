It was from our department head, marked urgent\u2014leadership needed my confirmation on a detail for an external partner, and they were waiting for my reply. As a colleague, I knew how important it was to respond quickly, especially when the whole team was counting on me to keep things moving smoothly.\n\nAt that moment, a patient approached the counter, looking anxious. \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me which pain reliever is best for a headache?\u201d she asked. As a pharmacist, I\u2019m expected to provide thorough counseling, even for simple questions, making sure patients feel heard and safe with their choices.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting. If I paused to answer the email, I\u2019d risk making the patient feel ignored or rushed. But if I focused on the patient, I\u2019d delay my team and possibly jeopardize our partnership. My mind raced, torn between the competing demands\u2014my responsibility to my colleagues and my duty to my patient. I hesitated, caught in the middle, unsure which role to prioritize in that moment."}
