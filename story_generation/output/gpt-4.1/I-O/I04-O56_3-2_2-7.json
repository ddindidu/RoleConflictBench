I saw it was Jamie, my closest friend, and answered right away. Her voice trembled, thick with tears, as she told me about her father\u2019s sudden illness. I sat up in bed, heart pounding, listening to her sobs, trying to find the right words to comfort her. She needed me\u2014needed someone to just listen, to be there, to help her hold the pieces together. I wanted nothing more than to stay on the line, to let her talk for as long as she needed.\n\nBut tomorrow morning, I had my first client at 7 a.m. She was a regular, always coming straight from her early gym session, hair damp and greasy. She hated waiting, expected me to be ready, cheerful, and professional, to wash and condition her hair just right before her cut. I knew if I stayed up with Jamie, I\u2019d be exhausted, maybe even late, and I\u2019d risk disappointing my client and my boss. My phone pressed to my ear, Jamie\u2019s voice breaking, I felt torn in two\u2014pulled between being the friend she needed and the hairdresser I was expected to be."}
