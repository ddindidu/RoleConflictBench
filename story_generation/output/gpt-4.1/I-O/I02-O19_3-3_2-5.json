She needed me\u2014her texts were raw, her grief pouring through the screen. Her father had passed away suddenly, and I was supposed to be her anchor, the one who held her together when everything else was falling apart. But my pager beeped, reminding me of the patient waiting at the counter. Mrs. Patel was on a complicated regimen, and I was the only pharmacist on duty. If I rushed her consultation, I could miss a dangerous drug interaction. If I left her waiting, I\u2019d be failing my professional responsibility. My heart ached for Mia, but my mind raced with the details of Mrs. Patel\u2019s medications. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my phone, then at the patient profile on the screen, caught in the impossible space between the person I loved and the person I was supposed to be."}
