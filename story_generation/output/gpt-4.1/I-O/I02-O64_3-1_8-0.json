My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014another message from her. We\u2019d fought this morning, voices raised, words sharp. Now she\u2019s texting, saying she can\u2019t do this anymore, that maybe we should take a break. My chest tightens. I want to reply, to fix things, to be the boyfriend who listens and makes it right. But a customer steps up, placing groceries on the belt. I force a smile, scan each item, count change, all while my mind races with her words. The line grows. I know I can\u2019t let my emotions show, can\u2019t make a mistake with the register. But every second I don\u2019t respond feels like another step toward losing her. I\u2019m torn\u2014between the duty to my job and the desperate need to save my relationship. My hands tremble as I hand over a receipt, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019m about to lose."}
