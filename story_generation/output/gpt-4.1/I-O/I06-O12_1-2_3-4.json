I had a question about a term in the new API documentation\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew I was supposed to communicate any confusion right away. That was the expectation: don\u2019t let small misunderstandings pile up. But my inbox was already overflowing with messages from the product and QA teams, all waiting for my technical input on the design documents. The deadline was looming, and I could almost feel the collective impatience of everyone waiting for me to weigh in. If I paused to reach out to my mentor, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk holding up the whole process. But if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be ignoring the guidance I\u2019d promised to follow as a mentee. My mind spun with the pressure of both roles, each tugging me in a different direction, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to ask for help and the need to deliver what my team expected."}
