As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip, believing it only bred negativity. But the group pressed for my opinion, knowing I\u2019d worked closely with Mark. I felt their eyes on me, waiting for a reaction, a comment, anything to fuel the discussion. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the jury trial I\u2019d been preparing for months was about to begin, and my client\u2019s future depended on my focus and presence. The courthouse was across town, and I needed to leave soon to be on time. The group\u2019s expectation for me to join in, to share inside knowledge, clashed with my own values as an acquaintance. Yet, as a lawyer, I was expected to be fully present, sharp, and undistracted for the trial. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to fit in socially and the professional duty that demanded my undivided attention. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each pulling me in a different direction, and I hesitated, caught in the middle."}
