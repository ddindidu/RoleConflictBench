He looks anxious, clutching a crumpled resume. \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d he says, voice low. I know he\u2019s been struggling to decide whether to stick with construction or try for a trade school scholarship. As his mentor, I\u2019m supposed to be there for these moments, to offer guidance, even if it\u2019s just a few words to help him weigh his options. But the foreman\u2019s whistle pierces the air\u2014pre-work safety briefing in two minutes. Missing it means a write-up, maybe even a suspension, and the whole crew is counting on everyone to be present and alert. My mind races: if I stop to talk, I let down the team and risk my own standing. If I walk away, I fail Marcus when he needs me most.
