We\u2019d been arguing for hours, voices raised and words sharp, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. My heart pounded, desperate to fix things, to say the right thing and resolve the conflict before it spiraled further. But the notification on my work phone pulled me back to reality\u2014a customer wanted an update on their delivery. I was supposed to respond quickly, politely, and with a calm professionalism that felt impossible in this moment. My hands shook as I stared at both screens, torn between the urgent need to save my relationship and the expectation to be the reliable, courteous delivery person my job demanded. I could feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing with what to say to him, how to reassure the customer, and how to be both people at once without letting either down."}
