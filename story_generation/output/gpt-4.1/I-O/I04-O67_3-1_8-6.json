My phone buzzed in my pocket, and my heart sank. It was a message from Sam: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that. I thought you understood me.\u201d The words stung. I replayed our conversation from earlier, realizing too late how my careless comment must have sounded. As a friend, I knew I needed to call Sam right away, to apologize and explain, to fix what I\u2019d broken before the misunderstanding grew. But as an ambulance driver, I was responsible for this vehicle, for the safety of everyone on the road. I couldn\u2019t risk a distraction, not even for a second. The urge to pull over and call was overwhelming, but the expectation to keep moving, to get the ambulance to the satellite station on time, pressed down on me just as hard. My mind raced, torn between the friend who needed me and the duty I couldn\u2019t ignore. The phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
