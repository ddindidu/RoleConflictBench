I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of neighbor who\u2019s friendly and approachable. As I wrapped the cake, I glanced at the clock\u2014my telemarketing shift was about to start. Management had been strict lately, watching our break times like hawks because the call queue never seemed to shrink. I knew if I took even a few extra minutes, it would be flagged. Just as I was about to log in, I heard footsteps in the hallway. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, was coming home. This was the perfect chance to introduce myself and share the cake, just as I\u2019d hoped. But my break wasn\u2019t scheduled for another two hours. If I stepped out now, I\u2019d risk a warning at work. If I waited, I might miss the chance to connect with Mrs. Kim, and I didn\u2019t want to seem unfriendly on my first day. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, cake in hand, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible employee."}
