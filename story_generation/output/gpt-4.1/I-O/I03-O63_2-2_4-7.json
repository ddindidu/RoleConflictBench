He\u2019s been looking forward to a quiet dinner, just the two of us, and I promised I\u2019d be present\u2014no distractions, no work talk. But as I\u2019m setting the table, my phone buzzes with a reminder: my telemarketing shift starts in ten minutes. Management has been strict lately, tracking every break and clock-in, and the call queue is always overflowing. If I\u2019m late or take an unscheduled break, I risk a warning or worse. My boyfriend is lighting candles, smiling at me, expecting my full attention. My heart pounds as I glance between him and my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I want to be the girlfriend he needs tonight, but I can\u2019t ignore the demands of my job. The pressure builds inside me, torn between love and responsibility, as I stand frozen, unable to choose."}
