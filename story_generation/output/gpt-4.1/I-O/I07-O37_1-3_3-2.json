As a colleague, I knew the deadline was still a few days away, and the team could move forward without my part for now. Still, I felt the unspoken pressure to keep up, to show I was reliable and committed. But as soon as I glanced at the clock, my mind shifted to my other role. The cleaning supplies waited for me at home, and I remembered the expectation to deep clean every room tonight. The kitchen needed scrubbing, the bathroom tiles had to be sanitized, and every corner dusted. I could almost smell the disinfectant already. My body tensed, torn between staying late to finish the report and rushing home to meet the standards of cleanliness. Both roles demanded my best, but I only had so much energy and time. The weight of these expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which responsibility to prioritize, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
