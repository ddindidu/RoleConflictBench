As an architect, I knew I had to finalize the design for the operating rooms by the end of the day\u2014any delay could set the whole project back. But as an acquaintance, I felt a pull to sit beside her, to offer comfort and a listening ear. My supervisor\u2019s email pinged, reminding me of the looming deadline, while Sarah\u2019s muffled cries grew louder. I could almost hear the expectations clashing in my head: be the reliable architect who delivers flawless, functional spaces, or be the approachable friend who doesn\u2019t turn away when someone is hurting. My heart ached with indecision, torn between the sterile lines of my blueprints and the raw emotion in the room."}
