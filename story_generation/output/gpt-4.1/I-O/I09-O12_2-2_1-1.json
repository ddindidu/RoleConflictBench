I wanted to make a good impression, to be the kind of neighbor who smiles in the hallway and offers a slice of something sweet. As I wrapped the cake, I glanced at my laptop, where the code review window blinked with new comments. My team was waiting for me to address the performance warnings on the feature I\u2019d nearly finished. The expectation was clear: clean, efficient code, no shortcuts. \n\nI heard footsteps in the hallway\u2014my chance to introduce myself, cake in hand. But my mind raced with the demands of my job, the pressure to deliver quality work on time. If I stepped away now, I\u2019d lose my focus and delay the fixes. If I ignored the neighborly moment, I\u2019d risk seeming cold or unfriendly. My heart pounded as I stood between the door and my desk, torn by the weight of both roles, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
