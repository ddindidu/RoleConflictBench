It was the end of my shift, and I knew any mistake now could mean hours of paperwork and a stern talk from my manager. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashed, and I hesitated. I answered quietly, and immediately heard the tremble in their voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d they said, barely holding back tears. My heart twisted. I wanted to drop everything, listen, and be the friend they needed, but a line was forming and the drawer was open, stacks of cash exposed. My manager\u2019s expectation echoed in my mind: no distractions, no errors. I tried to split my attention, but the numbers blurred and my friend\u2019s words faded into the background. I felt torn, guilt rising as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present for either role. The pressure built inside me, and I stood there, caught between the demands of my job and the needs of my friend, unsure which responsibility to honor."}
