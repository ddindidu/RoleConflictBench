We haven\u2019t had a real date in ages, and for once, our schedules actually align. I imagine us laughing over pasta, the city lights outside, his hand in mine. But as I close my laptop, my eyes catch the building plans spread across my desk. There\u2019s a nagging detail\u2014a measurement that doesn\u2019t quite add up. It\u2019s probably nothing, but as the architect, I know even small errors can snowball. My boss expects me to catch these things, to ensure every line and number means safety for future families. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. He wants my time, my undivided attention. My work demands vigilance, responsibility. I want to be present for him, but I can\u2019t ignore the plans. My mind races, torn between the warmth of his arms and the cold precision of blueprints, knowing I can\u2019t give both what they deserve tonight."}
