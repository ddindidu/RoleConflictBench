He\u2019d been dropping hints about a new restaurant, and I could see how much he wanted us to have a real date, just the two of us, no distractions. I promised him I\u2019d pick an evening soon, and he smiled in that way that made me feel like the most important person in his world.\n\nBut as I was about to text him my choice, my pager buzzed. The ER needed me\u2014stat. A patient had come in, barely conscious, with symptoms that didn\u2019t fit any clear diagnosis. The nurses looked to me for answers, and I felt the weight of their expectation. I knew every minute counted; I had to focus, to listen, to piece together the puzzle and maybe save a life.\n\nMy phone vibrated again\u2014Daniel, asking if I\u2019d decided.
