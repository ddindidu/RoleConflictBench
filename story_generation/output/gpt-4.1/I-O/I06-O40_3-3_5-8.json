The tension from my project team\u2019s argument still buzzed in my ears, and I knew I should reach out\u2014my mentor always said to communicate problems early. But my other phone vibrated, and I glanced at the message: \u201cTermite damage worse than we thought. Need urgent repair plan today.\u201d As a carpenter, I was expected to act fast, assess the damage, and reassure the homeowners that their house wouldn\u2019t collapse. I could picture the splintered beams, the anxious faces waiting for my expertise.\n\nBut my mind kept flipping back to my mentee role. If I didn\u2019t tell my mentor about the team conflict now, the project could derail, and I\u2019d be letting everyone down. Yet, if I didn\u2019t get to the house soon, the damage could spread, and I\u2019d be failing as a carpenter. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014one voice urging me to be open and responsible, the other demanding immediate action and technical skill. I felt pulled in two directions, each role pressing on me with its own urgency, and I stood frozen, caught between the calls for help."}
