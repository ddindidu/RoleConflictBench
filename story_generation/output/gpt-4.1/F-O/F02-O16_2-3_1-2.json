My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in twenty minutes, and she had begged me all week to be there. \u201cPlease, Daddy, I want you to see me read my story,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with hope. I promised her I would come, and I could already picture her scanning the classroom for my face.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave the hospital, a nurse rushed in. \u201cDoctor, we have a patient in the ER\u2014severe symptoms, unknown cause. We need you.\u201d The urgency in her voice was unmistakable. As a doctor, I knew my responsibility: to diagnose, to act quickly, to save lives. My colleagues and the patient\u2019s family were counting on me.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between two worlds.

The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
