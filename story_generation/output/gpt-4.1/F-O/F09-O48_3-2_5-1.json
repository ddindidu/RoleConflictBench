My heart pounded as I knelt to his level, remembering all the times I\u2019d told him about honesty and respect. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and firmness. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the hospital. Mrs. Carter, my post-op patient, needed help getting out of bed and dressed. She was anxious and unsteady, and I was the only nursing assistant on her floor this morning. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my son\u2019s wide, worried eyes searching mine for guidance, and the knowledge that Mrs. Carter was waiting, vulnerable and alone. I wanted to be the mother who taught her child integrity, but I was also the caregiver who couldn\u2019t let a patient down. My mind raced, torn between the lesson my son needed and the care my patient deserved, both expecting me to be there, right now."}
