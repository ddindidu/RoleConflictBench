She\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I wanted to show her she mattered, that I respected her enough to make time for her. We\u2019d planned to grab dinner, maybe catch a movie\u2014just the two of us, like old times. As the subway rumbled through the tunnel, I glanced at the clock, calculating if I\u2019d make it on time. Suddenly, a piercing alarm blared on my control panel: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I report it immediately and halt the train, no matter what. Passengers\u2019 safety depended on me. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d be late\u2014again. My sister would see it as another broken promise, another sign she wasn\u2019t a priority. I gripped the controls, torn between the duty to hundreds of strangers and the bond with my own family. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other."}
