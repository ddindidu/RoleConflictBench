It was the store manager, his voice tense: \u201cYour son\u2019s here. He was caught taking snacks without paying.\u201d My heart dropped. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline. But as a carpenter, I was already behind on a big order, and the client expected an estimate by the end of the day. The lumber supplier was closing soon, and if I didn\u2019t place the order now, the whole project would be delayed. My mind raced\u2014my son needed me, needed to see that actions have consequences, but my work demanded my focus and time. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be present, responsible, and unwavering. I stood there, sawdust clinging to my hands, torn between the call of my craft and the call of my child, not knowing which role to answer first."}
