My phone buzzed with another bug report\u2014just the minor UI glitch again, nothing urgent, but QA was persistent. I knew I could fix it in an hour if I focused. Just as I was about to reply, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how she missed Dad, how the house felt too quiet. She looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of support only a son could give. I felt the weight of her need, the expectation to be present, to listen, to reassure her. But my mind kept drifting to the bug, the emails piling up, the silent pressure from my team to keep things running smoothly. I could feel myself being pulled in two directions, my heart aching for my mom, my mind racing with code and deadlines, unsure which world needed me more in that moment."}
