It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet her right away. She needed advice\u2014something serious, she said. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, but as I was about to leave, a call came in: a minor traffic accident just a block away. Duty-bound, I responded, finding two drivers arguing heatedly in the street. As a police officer, I was expected to remain impartial, to listen carefully and act with fairness, no matter how tired or distracted I felt. But my mind kept drifting to my granddaughter, picturing her waiting for me, hoping for the guidance only her grandfather could give. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my wisdom and comfort, the other my integrity and focus. I stood between the feuding drivers, my badge heavy on my chest, my heart torn between the family who needed me and the strangers who depended on my professionalism."}
