I knew she wanted more than a simple \u201cfine\u201d\u2014she wanted me to open up, to share, to let her in. But my mind was still half at work, replaying the moment just before I left: a patient had stopped me as I was closing up, asking about the best over-the-counter pain relief for her persistent headaches. I\u2019d given her a quick answer, barely scratching the surface, because I was already late getting home. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014had I done enough for her? Now, sitting with my wife, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. She deserved my attention, my honesty, but so did my patients. I wanted to be present for her, to communicate openly, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the pharmacy, to the patient who might have needed more from me. I stared at my hands, torn between the expectations of being a good husband and a responsible pharmacist, unsure which part of me to give in this moment."}
