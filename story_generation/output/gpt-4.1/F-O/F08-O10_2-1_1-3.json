The email from my supervisor was clear: attendance was highly encouraged, and missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates. As I scrolled through the seminar details, I heard the soft shuffle of slippers behind me. My granddaughter, Emma, hovered in the doorway, her eyes downcast and shoulders slumped. She\u2019d been quiet all morning, and I could sense the weight she carried, though she hadn\u2019t said a word. \n\nPart of me wanted to close the laptop, pat the seat beside me, and coax her to share what was troubling her. I knew she needed someone to listen, to offer the kind of gentle advice only a grandmother could give. But the seminar was scheduled to start in just fifteen minutes, and I couldn\u2019t risk missing the information that would keep my accounting work compliant and up-to-date. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the granddaughter who needed my wisdom, and the career that demanded my diligence. I sat frozen, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
