It was the store manager\u2014my heart dropped as he explained my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. I rushed to the store, my mind racing with what I should say, how I should teach him right from wrong. As a parent, I knew I had to address this, to guide him, to show him stealing was wrong and help him understand the consequences. But as I stood there, my hands still smelling of bleach, I remembered the mess waiting for me at home\u2014the dust gathering on the shelves, the laundry piling up, the expectation that I keep everything spotless. My boss had already warned me about missing spots. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent need to discipline and comfort my child, and the relentless demand to keep the house immaculate. My chest tightened as I looked at my son\u2019s guilty face, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
