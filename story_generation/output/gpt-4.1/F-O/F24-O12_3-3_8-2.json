The service was buckling under load, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged last night. My phone buzzed with Slack messages\u2014my team needed a fix, and fast. I started rewriting the logic, fingers flying, when I heard the front door creak. My stepbrother, headphones on, was heading out, barely glancing up from his phone. Through the window, I saw him step toward the curb, traffic whirring past. My heart thudded. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially since Mom and Dad weren\u2019t home. But the code\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it now, the whole service could go down, and my team was counting on me. I froze, torn between shouting his name and finishing the critical patch, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
