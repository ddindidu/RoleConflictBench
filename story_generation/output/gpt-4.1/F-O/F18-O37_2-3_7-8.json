Peering out the window, I saw my little brother, helmet askew, dragging his skateboard to the top of the old, cracked ramp. He caught my eye and grinned, calling out that he was about to try a new trick. My heart thudded. As his sibling, I knew I should be out there, making sure he was safe, ready to catch him if he fell or at least to call for help. But as the house\u2019s cleaner, I was supposed to stay inside, keep my gloves on, and never touch anything outside without changing into fresh gear. If I ran out now, I\u2019d break every safety rule I\u2019d been drilled on. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring my brother when he might need me most. I stood frozen, torn between the urge to rush outside and the rules that kept me rooted to the spot, my mind racing with worry and guilt."}
