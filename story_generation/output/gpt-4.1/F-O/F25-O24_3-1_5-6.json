She looked at me with hopeful eyes, reminding me how important it was for me to lead the family ceremony this year, to show that I truly belonged and respected our traditions. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: the latest law review journal had just been released. As a judge, I knew I needed to stay ahead, to read the new articles on emerging legal theories before my next case. My colleagues would expect me to be informed, to set an example of diligence and expertise. I glanced at the ceremonial script in my hand, then at the unopened journal on my screen. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding my loyalty to family, the other to my profession. I felt torn, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down, maybe even myself."}
