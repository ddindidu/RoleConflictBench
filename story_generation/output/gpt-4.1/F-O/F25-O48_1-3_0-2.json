The lunchroom is busy, and I can feel the weight of my responsibility as a nursing assistant\u2014he needs me to be patient, gentle, and present.

I haven\u2019t replied to her last message yet, and guilt prickles at me. I want to be the caring step-child she hopes for, but right now, Mr. Jenkins is struggling, and I can\u2019t just step away.
