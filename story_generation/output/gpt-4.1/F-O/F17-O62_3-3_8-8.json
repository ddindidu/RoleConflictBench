She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I nodded, trying to offer comfort, feeling the weight of her trust settle on my shoulders. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small figure flailing in the deep end\u2014right where swimming was off-limits. My heart lurched. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every life in that pool, expected to act instantly, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. My mom\u2019s hand squeezed mine, her words growing more desperate, but my gaze kept darting to the struggling child. I felt torn in two, the urge to leap up and help battling with the need to stay and support my mom. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I could feel myself stretching thin, caught between the person my mom needed and the lifeguard everyone else depended on."}
