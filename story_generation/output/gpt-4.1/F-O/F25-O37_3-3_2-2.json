Did you eat lunch?\u201d she asked, just like she did every afternoon. I knew she expected a quick, thoughtful reply, maybe even a photo of my meal or a funny story from work. But I was already behind on my cleaning schedule. The manager had just reminded me that every corner of the house needed to be spotless by the end of my shift. I could see dust under the sofa, and the bathroom tiles still needed scrubbing. My gloves were wet, my hands smelled of bleach, and my mind raced between the mop in my hand and the phone in my pocket. If I stopped to text, I\u2019d fall further behind, risking a warning from my boss. But if I ignored my stepmom, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call, and I\u2019d feel guilty for letting her down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the family I wanted to connect with and the job I needed to keep."}
