My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about my stepdaughter\u2019s open class at school. She\u2019d asked me twice if I\u2019d be there, her hopeful eyes searching for reassurance. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d try, knowing how much it meant to her, how much I wanted to be the parent she could count on. But now, as I watched the swimmers, I noticed a boy in the middle of the pool, his strokes growing weaker, his head bobbing just above the surface. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to jump in at any sign of distress. The pool was busy, and my responsibility was clear: every life here depended on my vigilance. Yet, the clock ticked closer to the start of the open class, and I felt the weight of two worlds pulling me apart. My heart pounded with the pressure\u2014my stepdaughter\u2019s trust on one side, the safety of the swimmers on the other. I gripped the whistle, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
