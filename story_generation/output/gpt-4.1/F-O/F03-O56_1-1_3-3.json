Grandma\u2019s expecting you to help with the dumplings.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20145:45. Mrs. Lee, always cheerful, smiled at me in the mirror. \u201cCould you just take a little more off the front? I trust you.\u201d I knew she had a big event tonight and wanted to look her best. My hands hesitated, scissors poised. If I rushed, I might mess up her hair, but if I took my time, I\u2019d be late for dinner, and Grandma would be disappointed. My family always said, \u201cTraditions keep us together,\u201d and missing dinner would let them down. But as a hairdresser, my clients expect my full attention and care. I felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between the warmth of family expectations and the pride I took in my work. I looked at Mrs. Lee\u2019s hopeful eyes, then at the message from my mom, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
