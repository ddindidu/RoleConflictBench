I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and our family was gathering to toast her success. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me, cheering me on, and I wanted to do the same. But as I glanced at the lab schedule, my heart sank. The specialized microscope I needed for my experiment was only available tonight, after weeks of waiting. If I missed this window, I\u2019d have to delay my research, maybe even lose the chance to publish first. My advisor was counting on me, and so was my team. I felt torn in two, the weight of my sister\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, the demands of my scientific work on the other. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out how to be both the supportive sister and the dedicated scientist, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
