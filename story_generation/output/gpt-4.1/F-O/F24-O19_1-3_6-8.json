I\u2019m supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cMake sure he\u2019s safe, always.\u201d My phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder for the live webinar I signed up for weeks ago, part of the national continuing education program for pharmacists. Missing it means falling behind on the latest treatment protocols, something my supervisor warned me about just yesterday. Sam tugs at my sleeve, asking if we can take the shortcut through the alley, but I hesitate. The alley is faster, but not as safe. If I rush home, I might catch the webinar in time, but I\u2019d have to let Sam walk the last few blocks alone. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility of being a good step-sibling against the professional expectation to stay updated. The pressure builds, and I feel torn, standing at the crossroads\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
