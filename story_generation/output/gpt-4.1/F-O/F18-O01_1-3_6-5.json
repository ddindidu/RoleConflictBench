I kept an eye on him, as always, making sure he didn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. That was my job as his older sibling\u2014look out for him, keep him safe. But my mind kept drifting back to the hospital wing design waiting on my desk at home. The plans were due tomorrow, and I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to connect the emergency route to the operating rooms without creating a bottleneck. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my project manager, and I felt a pang of guilt. I should be thinking about the flow of patients and staff, about how every second could save a life. But right now, my brother was telling me about his day, and I could see the trust in his eyes. I felt torn, pulled between the responsibility of keeping him safe and the pressure to create a space that could save countless others. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly do justice to either."}
