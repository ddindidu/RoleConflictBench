It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew it must be important. But just as I was about to step into the break room, a customer approached, clutching a box of painkillers. \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me if this is safe with my blood pressure meds?\u201d she asked, her voice anxious.\n\nAs a pharmacist, I knew I had to give her my full attention, to ensure her safety and provide clear counseling. But as a grandmother, I felt the pull to be there for my granddaughter, to offer the wisdom and comfort she was seeking. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. My mind raced, torn between the patient in front of me and the family member reaching out in need. I could feel the expectations from both sides, and my chest tightened as I struggled to decide who needed me more in that moment."}
