I glanced up to see my younger brother, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp with a wild grin. \u201cWatch this!\u201d he called, skateboard poised for a trick he\u2019d only seen online. As his sibling, I knew I should stop him, make sure he didn\u2019t break an arm\u2014or worse. But the homeowner\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the promise I\u2019d made to fix their deck before the weekend barbecue. My reputation as a reliable carpenter was on the line, and I couldn\u2019t afford to let them down. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of keeping my brother safe against the professional duty pulling me toward my truck. I felt torn, rooted to the spot, unable to move in either direction, the demands of both roles pressing in on me, waiting for me to choose."}
