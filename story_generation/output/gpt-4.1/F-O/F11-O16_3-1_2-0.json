It\u2019s urgent.\u201d He never used that word lightly. My mind raced with worry, but I had a patient waiting\u2014a woman with a runny nose and a mild cough, likely just a cold, but I needed to be thorough. As a doctor, I owed her my full attention, to listen carefully, to not miss anything serious. But as a sister, I felt a pull so strong it almost hurt. My brother and I had always leaned on each other in tough times, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless he truly needed me. I could hear my patient\u2019s voice in the next room, waiting for reassurance, while my brother\u2019s message glowed on my screen, waiting for comfort. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person who needed my care and the family who needed my support."}
