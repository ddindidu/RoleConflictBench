The first was from my son\u2019s school: he\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me immediately. My heart clenched\u2014how could my son do this? I knew I needed to be there, to show him right from wrong, to support him but also hold him accountable. At the same time, my email pinged with a message from opposing counsel, demanding information about my client. The pressure was intense; if I slipped, my client\u2019s case could be destroyed, and my professional integrity would be questioned. I felt torn in two\u2014my son needed his father, but my client depended on my discretion and legal expertise. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wondered how I could possibly be both the father my son needed and the lawyer my client trusted."}
