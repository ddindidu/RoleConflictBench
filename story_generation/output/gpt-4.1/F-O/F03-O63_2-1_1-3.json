They expect it, and honestly, I do too\u2014it\u2019s our ritual. But tonight, my manager\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cPush harder, keep those numbers up.\u201d I\u2019m already ahead of my sales quota, but the pressure to keep dialing, to not let up, is relentless. My headset sits heavy on my ears, the call list blinking on my screen. If I pause now, even for a family call, I might lose momentum, maybe even a big sale. But if I don\u2019t call home, I\u2019ll hear the disappointment in Mom\u2019s voice later, the quiet worry in Dad\u2019s questions.
