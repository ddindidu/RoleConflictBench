My shift was slow today, and my supervisor had just messaged that we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. Just as I was about to log out for a quick cup of tea, my granddaughter, Emma, wandered in, her brow furrowed. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, her voice tentative. She was starting high school next week, and I could see the uncertainty in her eyes. I knew she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of thoughtful guidance only a grandparent could give, the kind I always promised myself I\u2019d provide.\n\nBut the clock on my screen ticked on, reminding me that my break was limited. If I took too long, I\u2019d risk missing calls and possibly upsetting my supervisor, who expected us to stick to our schedules even on slow days. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Emma\u2019s need for wisdom and reassurance, and my obligation to my job. My heart tugged in two directions as I tried to decide what to do next."}
