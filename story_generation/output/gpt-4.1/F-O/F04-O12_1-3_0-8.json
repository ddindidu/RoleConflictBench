Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you!\u201d I smiled, proud of her, knowing how much this meant. As her brother, I wanted to be there, to cheer her on, to make her feel special. But just as I was about to shut down my laptop, a Slack notification popped up\u2014urgent, all caps: \u201cPRODUCTION OUTAGE. Users locked out. Root cause: your last commit.\u201d My heart sank. The expectation was clear: as the developer responsible, I had to fix this, and fast. Customers were already complaining, and the team was counting on me. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my presence, my support. My team and our users needed my expertise, my immediate action. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turned. I sat frozen, caught between the celebration my sister deserved and the crisis my code had caused, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
