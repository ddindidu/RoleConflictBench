My daughter\u2019s voice trembles\u2014my grandson has taken a sudden turn, and the family needs me. I promised I\u2019d be there, to hold hands, to comfort, to be the steady presence I\u2019ve always been. But as I grab my coat, my pager blares. The hospital\u2019s ICU: a life-support machine is failing, and I\u2019m the only technician on call. The codes are urgent, the stakes are life and death. I can picture the nurses\u2019 anxious faces, the patient\u2019s family waiting for hope. My heart aches, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold, humming machines that hold someone else\u2019s loved one between life and death. Both worlds expect me to be their anchor, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands tremble as I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both lives pressing down on me."}
