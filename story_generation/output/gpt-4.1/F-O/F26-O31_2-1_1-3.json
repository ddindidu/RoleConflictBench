As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My shift starts in a few hours, and I need to be at my best to protect the community. Just as I grabbed my gym bag, I noticed my granddaughter, Emma, slouched at the kitchen table, her eyes red and distant. She barely touched her breakfast, and I could sense the weight of something heavy pressing on her young shoulders. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, offer comfort, and share some wisdom from my own tangled journey through life. But the clock ticked on, reminding me of my commitment to the force. The gym was calling, and so was Emma\u2019s silent plea for guidance. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the badge I wear and the love I hold for my family, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
