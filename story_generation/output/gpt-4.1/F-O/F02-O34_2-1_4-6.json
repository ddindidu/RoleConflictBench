I know I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or polite. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from the tower. An aircraft is about to cross into the neighboring sector, and I\u2019m on call, expected to coordinate with the next controller to ensure everything goes smoothly. My mind splits: one part wants to kneel down, look my son in the eye, and guide him gently; the other part is already running through radio frequencies and call signs, picturing radar screens and flight paths. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectation to be a present, guiding father and a vigilant, reliable controller. My heart pounds as I watch my son weave through the crowd, and I grip my phone, torn between the two voices demanding my attention."}
