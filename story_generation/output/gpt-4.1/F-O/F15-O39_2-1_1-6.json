Can you come?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her voice small but expectant. I promised I\u2019d try, but as I walked onto the construction site, the foreman\u2019s new notice caught my eye: an optional training session, same day, same time. \u201cIt\u2019s not mandatory,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019ll look good for anyone hoping for more hours.\u201d I felt the weight of my hard hat grow heavier. My team counted on me to show commitment, to be there, to pull my weight. But my little girl counted on me too, to show up, to be present, to prove she mattered more than bricks and mortar. My mind spun with the pressure\u2014if I missed the training, would I lose out on extra shifts? If I missed the open class, would I see disappointment in her eyes? The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I had to give."}
