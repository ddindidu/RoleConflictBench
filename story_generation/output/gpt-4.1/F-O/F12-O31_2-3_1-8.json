He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance as he explained the impossible choice his boss had given him\u2014either take the fall for a mistake he didn\u2019t make or risk losing his job. He needed me to listen, to comfort him, to help him find the courage to do what was right. I wanted to be there for him, to hold his hand and promise everything would be okay.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the station: I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. My testimony could make or break the case, and I knew I had to be there\u2014my duty demanded it. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My husband\u2019s voice faded into the background as I tried to focus, torn between being the supportive wife he needed and the officer of the law I was sworn to be. My heart ached, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my all to both."}
