I was supposed to be there, sitting with them, catching up and making my mom happy by being present for once. But as I looked up, I caught sight of a group of teenagers at the deep end, daring each other to dive right beneath the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014zero tolerance for rule-breaking, no exceptions, not even for a minute. I felt the weight of my whistle around my neck, the responsibility pressing down on me. My family expected me to be a brother, to join in, to be part of the moment. But the job demanded I act, enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, torn by the pull of family and duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
