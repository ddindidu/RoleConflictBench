My sister wanted to go hiking, my brother suggested a movie, and my mom hoped we\u2019d all have dinner together. They looked at me, expecting me to chime in, to promise I\u2019d be there. As their brother, I knew how much it meant to them that I join in, that I be present and part of these moments. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my taxi shifts. Weekends were busy, and I was expected to be on the road, alert and careful, following every traffic law, especially with the light traffic making it easy to speed without noticing. My boss had warned me: one more ticket and I\u2019d be out. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my responsibility to drive safely and keep my job. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly meet both expectations, knowing I\u2019d have to choose."}
