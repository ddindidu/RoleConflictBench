My parents sat at the kitchen table, their faces drawn and voices hushed. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort\u2014something I\u2019d always tried to do, especially when things got tough. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my housekeeping job. I was scheduled to clean Mrs. Lee\u2019s house in an hour, and I\u2019d just realized she was out of the special wood cleaner she insisted on for her antique furniture. I was supposed to check supplies ahead of time, but I\u2019d been distracted lately. Now, I was expected to fix the problem, maybe by running to a specialty store across town before my shift started. My parents\u2019 eyes met mine, silently asking for reassurance, while my mind raced with the logistics of my job. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure which need was more urgent or how I could possibly meet both at once."}
