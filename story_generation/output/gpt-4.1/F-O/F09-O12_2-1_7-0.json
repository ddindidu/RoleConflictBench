My son\u2019s laughter echoes down the hallway, a reminder of why I push myself so hard. As a mother, I know the bills are piling up\u2014groceries, rent, the electricity bill. My family depends on me to keep us afloat, to make sure there\u2019s always food on the table and a roof over our heads. That\u2019s why I took this job, why I work late into the night.\n\nBut as a software developer, I\u2019m expected to do more than just finish tasks. My manager trusts me to write code that\u2019s clean and maintainable, to set a standard for the team. The deadline for this module is generous, and I could take the time to refactor, to make it something I\u2019m proud of. Yet, the thought of overtime pay tugs at me\u2014I could rush through, deliver something that works, and ask for more hours on the next sprint. The money would help, but the code would suffer. My heart pounds as I stare at the screen, torn between my family\u2019s needs and my professional integrity."}
