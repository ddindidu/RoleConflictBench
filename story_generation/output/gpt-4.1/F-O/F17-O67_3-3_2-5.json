I knew it was my mother\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to know if I\u2019d eaten, if I was safe, if I\u2019d had a good day. She expected a reply, a sign that I was okay, and I always tried to answer quickly, sending her a photo or a few lines about my shift. But tonight, the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cMajor heart attack, male, 54, unresponsive.\u201d My partner was prepping the equipment in the back, and I could already picture the patient\u2019s family waiting, desperate for help. My mother\u2019s message blinked insistently on the screen, her words full of warmth and worry. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014her need for reassurance, my duty to the stranger whose life might depend on every second. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, torn between the comfort my mother sought and the care my patient needed."}
