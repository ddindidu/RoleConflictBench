Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I smiled, feeling proud, but my taxi app pinged at the same time\u2014a passenger had booked a ride across town, and the app flagged it as urgent. The passenger messaged, \u201cPlease hurry, I can\u2019t be late!\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I picked up the passenger, I\u2019d miss the start of my brother\u2019s ceremony. But if I canceled, my rating would drop, and I might lose out on future fares. My brother expected me to be there, cheering him on, just like I always promised. But my job demanded reliability and punctuality, especially for passengers in a rush. My heart pounded as I sat in my car, torn between being the supportive sister my brother counted on and the dependable driver my passenger needed."}
