My stepdad\u2019s message was short: \u201cCan you come home early? Your mom\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past seven. The project deadline loomed, and my team was waiting for my core module to move forward. Every minute I spent away from my screen meant another delay, more pressure from my manager, and disappointed teammates. But the thought of my mom, pale and quiet at the dinner table, haunted me. She and my stepdad had been arguing more, and I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to help lighten the mood, to just be there. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: the engineer who delivers solutions, the step-child who offers comfort. I wanted to be both, but tonight, it felt impossible. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between finishing the code and shutting down my computer to go home."}
