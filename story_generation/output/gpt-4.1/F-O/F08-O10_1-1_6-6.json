My daughter\u2019s message pops up: \u201cMom, can you call tonight? The kids want to talk about the holiday plans.\u201d I smile, picturing their eager faces, and feel the familiar warmth of family traditions. But then, another notification flashes\u2014an email from a vendor, confirming receipt of our payment. The company policy is clear: every confirmation must be acknowledged with a formal reply within the hour. I glance at the clock, heart sinking. If I don\u2019t respond promptly, I risk appearing unprofessional, maybe even jeopardizing our relationship with the vendor. Yet, if I delay the call, I\u2019ll disappoint my family, who count on me to keep our holiday spirit alive. My hands tremble, dusted with flour, as I stare at the phone, torn between the expectations of my work and the love of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
