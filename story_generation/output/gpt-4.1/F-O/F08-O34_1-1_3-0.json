Today is the family gathering I promised my daughter I wouldn\u2019t miss. My grandkids are already awake, their laughter echoing down the hall. I want to be there, to watch them open the board games I bought, to listen to their stories, to be the grandmother they remember as present and loving.\n\nBut my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the tower. There\u2019s a last-minute shift change. Pre-dawn traffic is light, but the supervisor needs me to cover. They trust me to keep the skies safe, even when the radar is nearly empty. I know the responsibility: one mistake, even in a quiet hour, could ripple into disaster. My team expects me to be reliable, focused, unflappable.\n\nI stand in the hallway, the warmth of family on one side, the cold professionalism of the control room on the other. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I close my eyes, torn, the laughter of my grandchildren mingling with the distant hum of engines in my mind."}
