She wanted the whole family there, and her eyes sparkled with hope when she asked if I could come early to help her get ready. My heart swelled with love and pride\u2014these moments were precious, and I knew how much it meant to her. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab\u2019s quarterly maintenance checklist was due tomorrow. No issues had been reported, but as the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was checked and every safety protocol reviewed. The lab depended on my diligence, and skipping or delaying the process could set a bad example for my team.
