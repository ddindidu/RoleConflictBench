My daughter\u2019s message glows on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone\u2019s counting on you to organize the family call for the holiday!\u201d I glance at the calendar\u2014just three days left until our annual family gathering, a tradition I\u2019ve never missed. My grandchildren will be waiting, eager to share stories and laughter. Yet, my laptop screen is filled with data charts and half-written paragraphs. The journal\u2019s submission portal blinks a warning: deadline in 48 hours. My team is relying on me to finalize the report, to ensure every detail is accurate and every dataset is complete. The weight of their expectations presses on me. I want to be present for my family, to nurture those bonds, but the responsibility of my research tugs at me with equal force. My heart aches as I stare between the family group chat and the unfinished manuscript, torn by the demands of love and duty, unsure which role to answer first."}
