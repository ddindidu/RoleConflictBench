The hum of machines was quieter than usual, a reminder that the big shutdown for maintenance was just days away. My supervisor had been clear: every machine needed to be spotless and ready, no excuses. I\u2019d already mapped out the cleaning schedule in my head, but my mind kept drifting to the school parking lot. My kids would be waiting for me soon, their faces pressed against the window, searching for my car. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there on time today\u2014no more late pickups, no more disappointed looks. But the machines demanded my attention, too. If I left now, I\u2019d fall behind, and the team would have to scramble next week. If I stayed, my kids would be the last ones left, again. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I wiped my hands on a rag, heart pounding, caught between the whir of machines and the laughter of my children waiting for me."}
