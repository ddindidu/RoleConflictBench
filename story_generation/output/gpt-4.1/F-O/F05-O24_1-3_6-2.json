She deserved honesty, openness\u2014she always said that\u2019s what made us strong. But as I started to speak, my phone buzzed. An emergency motion had just been filed; I had less than an hour to review the documents and make a ruling. The expectation was clear: as a judge, I had to be thorough, impartial, and swift. My mind raced with legal arguments and the urgency of the case, but my wife\u2019s hopeful expression pulled at me. She needed me present, attentive, not distracted by work. I felt the pressure mounting, the impossible tug-of-war between being the partner she needed and the judge the law demanded. My heart pounded as I tried to find the words, torn between two worlds that refused to wait for each other."}
