The store was finally quiet, but my mind was anything but. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014another message from my granddaughter, who just started her new job. She\u2019d been texting updates all day, her excitement practically leaping off the screen. I knew she wanted me to respond, to share in her joy, to be the supportive grandmother she could always count on. But the deposit procedure was strict; every bill had to be double-checked, every form filled out perfectly. The manager had warned us: no distractions, no shortcuts, or the audit could flag us. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting warmth and attention, my job demanding focus and precision. My fingers hesitated over the bills, my heart tugged toward my phone, torn between the rules of the store and the love of my family."}
