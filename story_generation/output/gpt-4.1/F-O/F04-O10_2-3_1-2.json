It was my sister, her voice trembling as she told me she\u2019d just broken up with her long-term boyfriend and needed me. I could hear her trying not to cry, and my instinct as her brother was to drop everything and go to her. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what.

As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew how critical it was to provide accurate records on time\u2014any delay could raise red flags and put my job at risk.
