A route closure had just been announced, and the airspace was a tangled mess of holding patterns, each blip representing hundreds of lives depending on my focus. My hands hovered over the console, ready to issue new instructions, when my phone buzzed insistently. It was my stepbrother, and the message was short: \u201cCall me. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been waiting for news about our dad\u2019s health, and the timing could only mean it was bad. My heart twisted\u2014he needed me, needed the kind of support we\u2019d promised each other since our families merged.
