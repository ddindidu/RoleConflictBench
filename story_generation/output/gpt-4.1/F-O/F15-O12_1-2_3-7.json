My son sits across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dripping onto the table. \u201cRemember, we keep our eating area clean,\u201d I remind him, trying to sound patient. He looks up, eyes searching mine for approval or disappointment. At the same moment, my phone buzzes\u2014another Slack notification. The QA team has flagged a critical bug, and users are complaining about errors that break their workflow. My manager\u2019s message is terse: \u201cCan you look into this ASAP?\u201d\n\nI glance at my son, who\u2019s now slurping his cereal, and then at the error logs filling my screen. I know he needs my attention, gentle correction, and encouragement to learn these small but important habits. But the pressure from work is mounting; every minute I delay, more users are frustrated, and my team is waiting for answers. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: be the present, guiding parent my child needs, or the reliable developer my team depends on. The two worlds pull at me, and I feel myself caught in the middle, unsure which demand to answer first."}
