He sat quietly, eyes downcast, clutching the candy bar he\u2019d tried to sneak out. As a mother, I knew this was a moment to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and firmness. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab\u2019s quarterly equipment check was due tomorrow. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every protocol was followed, every checklist completed, even if nothing seemed amiss. My team depended on me to keep the lab safe and running smoothly.\n\nI glanced at my son in the rearview mirror, then at the lab\u2019s notification on my phone. My heart twisted with guilt and anxiety. If I took the time to talk to him now, to help him understand why stealing was wrong, I\u2019d be late to the lab and risk missing the maintenance window. If I rushed him home and left, I\u2019d be abandoning my role as a mother when he needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I sat in the car, torn, unable to move."}
