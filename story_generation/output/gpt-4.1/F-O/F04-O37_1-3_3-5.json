My mom chimed in, asking if I could help pack snacks and keep everyone organized. I nodded, feeling the warmth of being included, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my housekeeping client: \u201cPlease make sure to use the allergy-friendly floor cleaner today.\u201d My heart sank. I\u2019d just checked the supply closet and realized we were completely out of that specialized cleaner, and the store that carries it closes early on Fridays. If I didn\u2019t get it now, I\u2019d let my client down and possibly risk their health. But if I left, I\u2019d miss this rare moment with my family, and I knew how much they wanted me there. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my client and the expectations of my family, both pulling at me with equal force."}
