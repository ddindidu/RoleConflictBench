Another message popped up from QA about the same minor UI glitch\u2014nothing critical, just a button that sometimes shifted out of place. I knew the workaround, and so did the users, but the expectation was clear: fix it, make it perfect. My phone buzzed. It was my stepdad, asking if I had a minute to talk. Lately, he and Mom seemed distant, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more, be the supportive step-child they needed. I glanced at the clock. If I called now, I\u2019d lose my focus and probably miss the window to push the fix before the end of the day. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting them down, again. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my team counting on me to keep things running smoothly, my family hoping I\u2019d be there when they reached out. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
