I was so close\u2014just a handful of calls away from not only meeting but exceeding my quota. But then my sister\u2019s message popped up, a photo of the dinner table set for our family gathering. \u201cDon\u2019t be late! Mom made your favorite,\u201d she wrote, adding a string of heart emojis. I could almost smell the food, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of being together. But the clock was ticking, and every minute spent at dinner was a minute lost from calling potential customers. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be a good sister. My job demanded I keep dialing, keep selling, keep pushing. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my phone heavy in my hand, torn between the promise of professional success and the pull of family belonging."}
