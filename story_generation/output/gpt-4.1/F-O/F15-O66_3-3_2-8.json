My heart sank as I read that my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in immediately to discuss the situation. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to understand what happened and show the school I took this seriously. But at the same time, my taxi app pinged\u2014a passenger had booked a ride and was already sending impatient messages, saying they were late for an important meeting and needed me to arrive as soon as possible. I could almost feel their frustration through the screen. I sat in my car, keys in hand, torn between the urgent call of my child and the professional responsibility to my passenger. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together, as I tried to figure out which role I was supposed to put first."}
