The kids miss you.\u201d I promised I\u2019d make it, knowing how much these gatherings meant to my grandchildren. Just as I hung up, my radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling. An elderly woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. I grabbed my keys, heart pounding, picturing my grandkids\u2019 faces and the empty seat at the table if I missed the dinner. But I also imagined the pain and fear of the woman waiting for help, depending on me to ease her suffering. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my patient\u2019s need for care. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn, the engine idling, caught between the pull of home and the call of duty, not yet knowing which road I would take."}
