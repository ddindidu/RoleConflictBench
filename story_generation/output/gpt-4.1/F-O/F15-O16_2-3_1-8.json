It was almost time for my daughter\u2019s open class at school\u2014a day she\u2019d been talking about for weeks, her eyes shining with anticipation every time she reminded me. I promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. But just as I was about to leave the hospital, my pager buzzed urgently. A patient had arrived in the emergency room, feverish and delirious, the infection spreading rapidly. The nurses looked to me, expecting swift, decisive action. I could see the fear in the patient\u2019s eyes, the hope that I would know exactly what to do. My mind raced, torn between the sterile, bright lights of the ER and the colorful classroom where my daughter would soon be searching for my face. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled as I stood frozen in the hallway, caught between the needs of my child and the life of a stranger."}
