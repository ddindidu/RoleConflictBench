My shift as a housekeeping cleaner was almost over, but I noticed the bottle of floor cleaner in the client\u2019s cupboard was nearly empty. I knew my supervisor expected me to keep track of supplies and report when anything was running low, especially since the next cleaning was just a few days away. If I left without saying anything, the job wouldn\u2019t be done properly, and I\u2019d risk a complaint. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was almost time to pick up my kids from school. Today was special\u2014they had been practicing for weeks for the end-of-year assembly, and I promised I\u2019d be there to watch and take them home. I could already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to see me. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my job and the promise I made to my children. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, supply list in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
