She\u2019d asked me twice this morning if I\u2019d be there, her eyes hopeful, her voice small. I\u2019d promised I would. But now, as I scanned the water, I spotted a child flailing in the deep end, right where swimming was off-limits. My training kicked in\u2014no hesitation, no distractions, just action. But my mind raced with the knowledge that if I left now, I\u2019d miss Lily\u2019s class, and she\u2019d be sitting there, searching the crowd for my face. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me: the responsibility to keep every child here safe, and the promise I\u2019d made to the one waiting for me at school. My heart pounded as I gripped the whistle, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet plea of family."}
