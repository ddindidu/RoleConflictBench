Their deck was in bad shape, and they needed it fixed before the weekend. As a carpenter, I knew the job would take hours\u2014maybe the whole afternoon. But across from me, my spouse waited, eyes searching mine. We\u2019d agreed to talk tonight, to finally lay everything out about our finances and the medical bills piling up. They needed me to be present, to listen and share honestly, not distracted or rushing off. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of my trade and the quiet, pressing need for trust at home. I could feel the weight of both expectations\u2014one demanding my hands and skill, the other my heart and honesty. I stared at the phone, then at my spouse, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
