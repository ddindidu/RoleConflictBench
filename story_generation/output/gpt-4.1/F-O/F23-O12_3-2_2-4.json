She\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. I knew how important it was to show up for her, to be present and supportive, especially now. But as I reached for my phone to call the school, Slack pinged with a message from the product manager: \u201cAre you joining the design review? We need your input before we can move forward.\u201d The design documents were due by the end of the day, and the other teams were waiting on my technical feedback. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my stepdaughter needed me to be there for her, to help her navigate this mistake, but my team needed me to keep the project on track. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a reliable step-parent and a dependable developer. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
