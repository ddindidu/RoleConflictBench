I noticed a commotion\u2014someone was in the deep end, flailing, clearly struggling. As a lifeguard, I knew the rules: no one was allowed in the deep end without supervision, and I was trained to act fast in emergencies. But as a sibling, my parents always told me to never leave my brother alone, especially near busy streets. He looked up at me, eyes wide, sensing my urgency. I could see the expectation in his face\u2014he trusted me to keep him safe. At the same time, my lifeguard instincts screamed at me to enforce the rules and help the struggling child. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between my duty to my brother and my responsibility as a lifeguard. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
