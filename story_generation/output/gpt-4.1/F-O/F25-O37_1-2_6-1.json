The house had been messier than usual lately, and as the cleaner, I knew I was expected to keep everything spotless. My supervisor had already commented on the streaks on the windows last week, and I could almost hear her voice in my head, reminding me to be more thorough. But as I passed the living room, I saw my stepmother sitting quietly, her eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I remembered how she\u2019d seemed distant at dinner, and as her step-child, I felt the weight of another expectation: to check in, to ask if she was okay, to offer the support she might need. My mind raced with the demands of both roles\u2014should I put down the mop and sit with her, risking the mess piling up and disappointing my boss, or should I focus on cleaning, ignoring the silent plea for comfort from someone who might need me? The conflicting pull between being a good step-child and a responsible cleaner left me frozen, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
