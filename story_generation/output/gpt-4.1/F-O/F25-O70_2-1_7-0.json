My stepdad sat hunched over bills, and my mom\u2019s eyes were red, her smile forced. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a notification from work. A package had just arrived at the depot, running late but still within today\u2019s delivery window. My manager\u2019s earlier words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo late deliveries, or it\u2019s your job.\u201d I looked at my parents, wanting to sit down, to offer comfort, to be the step-child they needed. But the pressure to be the reliable delivery person tugged at me, reminding me that my job paid for my share of the bills. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the family who needed me and the job that demanded my punctuality."}
