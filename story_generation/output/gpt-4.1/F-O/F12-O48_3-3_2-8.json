He needed me\u2014his words were raw, desperate. He was unraveling after the news about his father, and I was the only one he wanted to talk to. My heart ached to be there, to hold him, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together. But just as I started to type a reply, the call bell rang from Room 204. Mrs. Evans, my patient, had just learned her cancer had returned. When I entered, she was sobbing, clutching the thin hospital blanket, her eyes searching mine for comfort. She needed me, too\u2014needed my words, my presence, my strength. I felt torn in two, the weight of both their pain pressing down on me. My husband\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more urgent, while Mrs. Evans\u2019s tears fell silently, her hand reaching for mine. I stood there, caught between the two worlds, my heart pulled in opposite directions, unsure which need to answer first."}
