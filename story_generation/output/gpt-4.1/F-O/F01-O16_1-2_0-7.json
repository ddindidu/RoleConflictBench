He\u2019d just started college, and his voice trembled as he asked how to handle the uncertainty and pressure. As his grandfather, I wanted to offer the comfort of my years, to share stories of my own missteps and reassure him that he\u2019d find his way. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014a message from the hospital. One of my patients, a woman with a stubborn autoimmune disease, needed an urgent adjustment to her treatment plan. The hospital expected me to respond quickly, to review her labs and prescribe the right medication before her condition worsened. My heart pulled in two directions: the warmth of my grandson\u2019s trust, the weight of my patient\u2019s health. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of wisdom and care from both sides, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for them both in this moment."}
