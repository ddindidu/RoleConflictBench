The street is familiar, lined with old maples and the occasional barking dog. My phone buzzes with a project update\u2014one of the contractors needs an answer about the site plan, and the timeline is already tight. I glance at the message, mentally reviewing the tasks I need to check off before tomorrow\u2019s meeting. My brother tugs at my sleeve, pointing out a car speeding down the road. He wants to cross, but I hesitate, torn between keeping him safe and responding to the urgent work message. My mind races: if I stop to answer, I might miss something important with him; if I focus on him, the project could slip further behind. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, and I feel the tension coil in my chest as I try to decide what to do next."}
