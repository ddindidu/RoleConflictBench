My daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and my heart clenched\u2014she never called during the day unless it was important. I remembered the message from this morning: my grandson was struggling, and the family needed me to check in, to be the steady presence I\u2019d always promised. But as I glanced up, I saw a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, giggling, unsupervised. The rules were clear: no one in the water without a lifeguard\u2019s watchful eye. My supervisor expected vigilance, and parents trusted me to keep their children safe. Yet, my family needed me now, my daughter\u2019s voice trembling with worry echoing in my mind. I gripped the phone, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to the swimmers before me, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding my attention."}
