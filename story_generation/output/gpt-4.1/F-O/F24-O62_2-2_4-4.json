My stepdad had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, especially since my stepsister was finally coming home from college. I knew how much it meant to my mom, too\u2014she wanted us all together, making memories, showing that we were a real family. But as I walked past the pool on my last check before closing, I spotted the broken lane rope floating limply in the water. Swim lessons started early tomorrow, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the whole schedule would be thrown off. As a lifeguard, I was supposed to make sure everything was ready and safe, no excuses. My supervisor had been clear: equipment issues had to be handled immediately. I stood there, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of the house waiting for me and the cold responsibility of the pool. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment I\u2019d cause at home against the chaos I\u2019d leave behind at work."}
