My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my sister, reminding me that everyone was waiting for me at the family dinner. Mom had made my favorite, and Dad rarely asked for all of us to be together. I could almost hear their laughter through the phone, the clinking of dishes, the warmth I\u2019d been missing.\n\nBut the line at the store was still long, and my manager had just handed me the deposit bag. \u201cYou know the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery bill counted, every form signed. No shortcuts.\u201d The procedures were strict, and if I made a mistake, it could mean a write-up or worse. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me to show up, to be present, to be a good brother; my job demanding precision, patience, and adherence to every policy.\n\nI stood there, torn, the deposit bag heavy in my hands, my phone buzzing again. I could feel the pull from both sides, each expectation stretching me thin, and I didn\u2019t know which part of me I could let down."}
