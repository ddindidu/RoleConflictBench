She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement. I knew how much it meant to her that I respond, to be present and share in her joy, especially since I\u2019d promised to keep in touch more often. But just as I started typing a reply, the call bell rang from Mrs. Evans\u2019 room. She\u2019d just received her diagnosis\u2014cancer, aggressive\u2014and I could already hear her sobbing through the thin walls. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be there for her, to offer comfort and a listening ear, to sit with her in her pain. My heart pulled in two directions: the warmth of my family\u2019s happiness, the weight of my patient\u2019s sorrow. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in on me, knowing that whichever door I walked through, I\u2019d be leaving someone waiting."}
