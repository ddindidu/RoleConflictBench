The school had called\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, to talk, to help him understand the seriousness of what he\u2019d done. I could picture his face, anxious and confused, waiting for me to show up and guide him through this. But just as I was about to grab my keys, my work phone buzzed. The external inspector was on site, raising urgent safety concerns. If I didn\u2019t address them immediately, our operations could be shut down.
