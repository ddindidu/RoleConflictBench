My stepdad\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe really want you there. It means a lot to your mom.\u201d I knew how important these family gatherings were, especially since I was still finding my place in this new family. But as I set my phone down, my next client, Mrs. Patel, settled into my chair. She smiled, her usual warmth making me relax a little. \u201cJust a tiny trim on the fringe, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, touching her hair lightly. I checked the clock\u2014if I hurried, I might just make it to dinner on time. But Mrs. Patel was particular about her hair, and I prided myself on never rushing a client, always making sure they left happy. My hands hovered over her hair, my mind torn between the expectation to be the reliable step-sibling and the professional hairdresser. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
