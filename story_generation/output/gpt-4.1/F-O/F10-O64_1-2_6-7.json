The lunch rush is in full swing, and the line snakes past the bakery display. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014three messages from Mom. I know what that means. She\u2019s been anxious lately, and I promised I\u2019d check in more often, ask if everything\u2019s okay at home. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of her expectation. But the customer in front of me is already unloading groceries, chatting about her day. I nod, ring up her items, and try to sound cheerful, but my mind is split. I want to be the daughter who listens, who reassures, but right now, I\u2019m the cashier who\u2019s supposed to be friendly and efficient. The line grows longer, and my phone keeps buzzing. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between the needs of my family and the demands of my job."}
