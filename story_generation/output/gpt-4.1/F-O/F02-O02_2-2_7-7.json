My daughter tugged at my sleeve, asking if we could go to the park this weekend, her eyes full of hope. I wanted to say yes, to promise her everything would be fine, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cQuarterly roadmap meeting in 30 minutes.\u201d As an engineer, I was expected to provide precise time estimates for the new project, and management was pressing for answers. I knew that if I underestimated, the project would fail and my job could be at risk. If I overestimated, I might be seen as unreliable. The weight of my family\u2019s needs pressed against the demands of my job, and I felt torn in two. My mind raced, trying to balance the numbers on the bills with the hours I could realistically commit to the project. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, knowing that whatever I said next would have consequences for both my family and my career."}
