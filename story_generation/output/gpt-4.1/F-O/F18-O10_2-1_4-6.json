Mom had been planning it for weeks, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories over her famous lasagna. But as I was about to leave the office, an email notification popped up\u2014our vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol required a formal reply before the end of the business day. My manager had emphasized the importance of timely communication, especially with this vendor, and I knew a delay could reflect poorly on our firm. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family would be disappointed if I was late or distracted, but my professional reputation was on the line if I didn\u2019t respond promptly. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, torn between being the reliable sibling and the responsible accountant."}
