The contractor was waiting for my measurements, tapping his foot impatiently. We were already behind schedule, and I knew every minute counted if we wanted to finish the cabinetry before the next team arrived. My phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating insistently. It was Thursday evening\u2014time for my weekly call with my stepdad and mom. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s gentle voice, asking about my week, wanting to know if I was eating well, if I was happy. They counted on these calls, a ritual that made me feel like I belonged, even if just for a few minutes. But the contractor\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, reminding me of the deadline. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of family and the demands of my craft. My phone kept buzzing, and I stood frozen, caught between the world of home and the world of work, not sure which one needed me more."}
