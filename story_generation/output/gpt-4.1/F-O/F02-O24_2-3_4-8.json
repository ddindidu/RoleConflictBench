As a father, I knew I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior before it became a habit. My mind was already rehearsing the words I\u2019d use\u2014calm, patient, but clear. Then, my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen: an urgent message from my clerk. The Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of the jury instructions I was about to deliver in court. As a judge, I was expected to be up-to-the-minute, to halt proceedings and adapt instantly to the new legal landscape. My heart pounded. My son\u2019s laughter echoed, and I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding I be a present, guiding father, the other insisting I be an ever-vigilant, impartial judge. I stood frozen, torn between the aisle and the bench, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
