It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. My heart skipped. I knew he\u2019d been having a tough time at school, but the urgency in her words made my hands tremble. As a grandfather, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, to listen, to help my family through anything. I wanted to step away, call her, and be the support they needed right now.\n\nBut just then, a woman approached the counter, her face pinched with pain. \u201cExcuse me, which painkiller is best for a headache?\u201d she asked. As a pharmacist, I\u2019m expected to give every patient my full attention, to counsel them properly, not just toss out a quick answer. I could see she needed more than a rushed reply.\n\nI glanced at my phone, then at the woman. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and my responsibility to my patient. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
