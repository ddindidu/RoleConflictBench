My spouse sat across from me, their eyes clouded with worry. I knew I should ask what was wrong, open up about my own rough day, and be present\u2014just like we promised each other. But as I reached for their hand, my work phone rang. It was a customer, their tone sharp, asking why their package hadn\u2019t arrived yet. I could hear the impatience in their voice, and I knew I had to respond calmly, professionally, even though my mind was still with my spouse. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, feeling the weight of both expectations. I wanted to be the supportive partner, to listen and share, but I also had to be the reliable delivery person, polite and efficient. The two worlds collided in that moment, and I felt torn, unsure which voice to answer first."}
