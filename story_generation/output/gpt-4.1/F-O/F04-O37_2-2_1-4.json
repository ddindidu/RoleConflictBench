It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I could sense the heaviness in her words, and as her brother, I knew I should be there for her, especially since she\u2019d been having a tough week. But as I packed up my cleaning supplies, I noticed the bottle of floor cleaner was almost empty. The Johnsons expected me to keep track of their supplies and let them know in advance if anything was running low. Their next cleaning was in three days, and if I didn\u2019t alert them now, I\u2019d risk not having what I needed for the job. I stared at my phone, torn. Should I call the Johnsons right away, or rush to my sister\u2019s side? Both roles demanded my attention, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
