My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mom, reminding me that tonight was the annual family dinner, a tradition we never missed. She expected me to be there, to help set the table, to laugh and share stories with everyone. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, telling me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s values.\n\nBut as I handed a receipt to a customer with a practiced smile, my manager approached. \u201cCan you stay late tonight? We\u2019re short-staffed.\u201d The request was polite, but I knew what was expected: friendly, reliable service, even if it meant missing out on personal plans. My heart pounded as I looked from the register to my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the dependable son my family counted on, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down. The conflicting demands pulled at me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which role I could afford to disappoint."}
