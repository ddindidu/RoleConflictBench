My kids would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I could already picture their hopeful smiles, the way they\u2019d run up and hug me, chattering about their day. But then the radio crackled, sharp and urgent: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress, Main and Fifth. Immediate response needed. Bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart lurched. I was the closest unit. I could hear the dispatcher\u2019s voice, tense, expecting me to respond, to protect the people in danger. My hand hovered over the radio, torn. My duty as a police officer demanded I go\u2014lives could depend on it. But as a mother, I\u2019d promised my children I\u2019d be there, that they could count on me. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I sat frozen, the siren\u2019s wail echoing in my mind, my children\u2019s faces just as loud in my heart."}
