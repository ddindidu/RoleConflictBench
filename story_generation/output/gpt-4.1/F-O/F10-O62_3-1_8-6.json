My mom and dad had come to visit, sitting just behind me on the bleachers. I could hear their voices, low and heavy, as they started to talk about Dad\u2019s recent health scare. Mom\u2019s hand trembled as she reached for mine, her eyes searching for reassurance. I knew they needed me to listen, to comfort them, to be the steady daughter they could lean on. But just as Dad\u2019s voice cracked, I caught a glimpse of two kids slipping into the shallow end, no adult in sight. My training kicked in\u2014no unsupervised swimmers, ever. My heart pounded as I looked from my parents\u2019 anxious faces to the pool, torn between the urge to wrap my arms around Mom and the duty to keep everyone safe. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, caught between the daughter they needed and the lifeguard I was supposed to be."}
