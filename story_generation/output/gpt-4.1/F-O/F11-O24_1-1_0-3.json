Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of our bond. As his sister, I\u2019d always been there for his big moments\u2014cheering him on, making him feel special. But as I glanced at the stack of files on my desk, my heart sank. The new case had just landed on my docket, and the scheduling order was due by Friday. The court expected clarity and precision, and I prided myself on never missing a deadline. I could already hear my clerk\u2019s reminder echoing in my mind. I wanted to be the sister who showed up, who toasted my brother\u2019s success. But I was also the judge who couldn\u2019t let the court down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, each refusing to yield. I stared at my calendar, torn between the courtroom and my family, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
