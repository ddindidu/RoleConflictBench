I glanced at the half-finished data charts on my laptop, the numbers blurring together. I needed to finalize the summaries, double-check the graphs, and prepare to answer questions about the preliminary results. The pressure to be thorough and precise weighed on me\u2014my advisor expected nothing less. Just then, my younger brother burst into my room, helmet in hand, eyes shining with excitement. \u201cCome watch me try the new trick!\u201d he pleaded. I followed him outside, heart pounding as he eyed the steep, cracked ramp. He was determined, but I saw the risk\u2014the uneven surface, the speed he\u2019d pick up. As his sibling, I felt the urge to stay close, to make sure he was safe, to be there if he fell. But my mind kept drifting back to my research, the unfinished work, the looming meeting. I stood at the edge of the driveway, torn between the responsibility to protect my brother and the obligation to my scientific integrity, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
