The family gathering was circled in red on my calendar at home, a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They\u2019d been looking forward to it\u2014homemade cookies, stories, laughter. But here I was, in my cashier\u2019s apron, scanning groceries and greeting the few customers who trickled in with a practiced smile. My manager had called in sick, and I was asked to cover the shift. Each beep of the scanner reminded me of the time slipping away, of the little faces waiting for me. I tried to focus on the customers, offering friendly words, but my mind kept drifting to my family. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my duty to keep the store running smoothly. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which role I could let down less."}
