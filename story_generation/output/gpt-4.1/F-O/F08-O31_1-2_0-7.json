I wanted to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to reassure her that kindness and understanding often go further than anger. But my radio crackled, and I was called to a minor traffic accident just down the street.\n\nMinutes later, I stood between two frustrated drivers, each insisting the other was at fault. As a police officer, I was expected to remain impartial, to listen carefully and act with fairness. But my mind kept drifting back to my granddaughter\u2019s question. I felt torn\u2014should I advise her to always seek compromise, as I often do in uniform, or to stand her ground, as I sometimes wish I could? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding a different kind of guidance, and I found myself caught between the wisdom of a grandmother and the duty of a police officer, unsure which voice should speak first."}
