Just as I was about to call them in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my stepmother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I hesitated, knowing she rarely reached out like this. My father had been distant lately, and she\u2019d been struggling, confiding in me more and more. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014her need for comfort, for someone to listen, to be the step-child who could bridge the emotional gap in our family.\n\nBut outside my door, the patient waited, expecting me to be the doctor\u2014calm, focused, ready to diagnose and treat. I could hear the muffled coughs, the anxious shifting in the chair. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient and the pull of family, the need to heal bodies and the need to heal hearts. My hands trembled slightly as I stared at the phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which door to open first."}
