Mrs. Lee\u2019s blood pressure was dropping, and I needed to monitor her vitals closely, recording every change. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me about the family video call tonight. The holiday was always our time to reconnect, to laugh and share stories, and as a grandfather, I was expected to be present, to keep the family bonds strong. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s condition demanded my full attention; missing even a few minutes could mean missing a critical change. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the beeping monitors and toward the faces of my grandchildren waiting to see me. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure how I could possibly meet the expectations of both worlds at once."}
