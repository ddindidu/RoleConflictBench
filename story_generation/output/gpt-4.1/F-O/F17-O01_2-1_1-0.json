There\u2019s a small inconsistency in the fire exit placement\u2014nothing catastrophic, but it nags at me. As an architect, I know I should flag it, double-check every detail, ensure everything is perfect and safe. My phone buzzes, and I glance at the clock. It\u2019s Sunday evening, the time I always call my parents. They wait for my updates, eager to hear about my week, to know I\u2019m okay. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, asking if I\u2019m eating well, if I\u2019m happy. I want to be present for them, to show I care, to keep our connection strong. But the plans demand my attention, and the weight of responsibility presses on me. If I call now, I\u2019ll be distracted, unable to focus on their words. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss our ritual, disappoint them. My mind spins, torn between being a good child and a responsible architect, feeling the pull of both worlds and the ache of not knowing which to choose."}
