But in the rearview mirror, I see my passenger anxiously checking his watch, his suitcase clutched tight. \u201cCan you get me to the station in fifteen minutes? My train leaves soon,\u201d he says, urgency in his voice. The traffic ahead is thick, and I know every minute counts. My mind races\u2014should I call my husband and risk distracting myself, or focus on the road and risk letting him down? The weight of both expectations presses on me: the need to be a caring partner, the responsibility to deliver my passenger safely and on time. My hands grip the wheel tighter as I wrestle with the impossible choice, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
