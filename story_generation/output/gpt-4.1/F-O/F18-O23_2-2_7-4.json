The client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I knew every minute counted. But the text was from my younger brother: \u201cAbout to try the new trick. Come watch?\u201d I glanced out the window and saw him at the old skatepark, helmet askew, grinning at the ramp that looked more dangerous than ever. As his sibling, I\u2019d always promised Mom I\u2019d look out for him, especially after his last fall. He expected me to be there, to cheer him on, and to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But as a lawyer, my client was counting on me to be focused, prepared, and present in court\u2014no distractions, no excuses. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks: if I left, I might miss a crucial moment in court; if I stayed, I might not be there if my brother needed me. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, torn between the courtroom and the skatepark, unable to move."}
