My mind is split in two. As a subway operator, I know every second counts\u2014passengers rely on me to get them to work, to school, to their lives, safely and on time. A minor signal delay flashes up ahead, and I must adjust the speed just right: too fast, and I risk a jolt; too slow, and I\u2019ll throw off the whole schedule. \n\nBut my thoughts keep drifting to my son. He\u2019s been counting down the days, reminding me every morning about the Nintendo I promised him. He\u2019s been so patient, and I want to keep my word. But the cost tugs at me\u2014our budget is tight, and every extra shift I take is for his future, for our stability. I feel the weight of his hopeful eyes, the expectation that I\u2019ll come through, and the pressure to keep this train running smoothly. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the demands of both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t let either down."}
