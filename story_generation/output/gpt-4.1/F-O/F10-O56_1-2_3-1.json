My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t forget, we light the candles together at six. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t be late, that I\u2019d help set the table and share stories with my cousins. But as I hung up my coat, the bell above the door chimed. A woman stepped in, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I recognized the look\u2014first-time jitters. My manager caught my eye, nodding toward her. \u201cShe\u2019s yours,\u201d he mouthed. I knew what was expected: a warm welcome, a gentle touch, reassurance that she\u2019d leave feeling beautiful. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my sister, reminding me not to miss the family photo. My heart squeezed. I wanted to be the daughter who honored our traditions, but I was also the hairdresser who made strangers feel at home.
