His message was short: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been wrestling with a big decision at work, and he always turned to me for support. I wanted to be there, to listen, to help him sort through his worries. But as I pulled up to the curb, my next passenger slid into the back seat, chatting about the weather and his plans for a relaxed afternoon meeting. He seemed in no rush, but I still felt the weight of my responsibility\u2014get him there safely, on time, and with a friendly attitude. My phone buzzed again, and my heart twisted. I was torn between the urge to call my husband, to be the supportive wife he needed, and the duty to focus on the road, to be the reliable driver my passenger expected. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
