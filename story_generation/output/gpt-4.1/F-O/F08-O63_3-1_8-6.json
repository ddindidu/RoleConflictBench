My supervisor\u2019s email chimed in: \u201cLight call volume\u2014take your break whenever you need.\u201d I glanced at my cell phone, where a message from my daughter waited. \u201cMom, can you call? It\u2019s about Jamie. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart squeezed. Jamie, my grandson, was struggling, and my daughter needed me. As a grandmother, I was expected to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and advice. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break within the allotted window, not whenever I felt like it, even if today\u2019s rules were relaxed. If I called my daughter now, I might run over my break or get caught up in a long, emotional conversation. If I waited, I\u2019d be failing my family when they needed me most. My hands hovered over the phone, torn between the quiet hum of the office and the silent plea from home, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
