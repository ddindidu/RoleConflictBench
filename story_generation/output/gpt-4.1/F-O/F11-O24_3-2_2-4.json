The trial had ended yesterday, and now the responsibility of writing the final judgment weighed heavily on my shoulders. Thirty days, I reminded myself, to craft a clear, thorough opinion\u2014every word scrutinized, every fact carefully considered. My phone buzzed, breaking my concentration. It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen. He rarely called during the day. I answered, and his voice trembled as he told me about his breakup, how lost he felt, how he needed me. I heard the expectation in his voice\u2014his big sister, always there, always listening. But as he spoke, my mind drifted to the court\u2019s deadline, the pressure to be impartial and precise, to not let anything cloud my judgment. I wanted to be present for him, to offer comfort, but the demands of my robe tugged at me, reminding me of the duty I owed to the law. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both things at once, not in this moment."}
