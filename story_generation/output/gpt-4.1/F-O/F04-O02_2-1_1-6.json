It was my sister, her name lighting up the screen with a message: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week, and as her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there when she needed support. But as an engineer, I was expected to be present for these planning sessions, to give accurate time estimates so the team could move forward. The meeting was informal, and the timeline wasn\u2019t set in stone, but I also knew my input mattered. My manager expected me to be reliable, to show up and contribute. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My sister\u2019s need felt urgent, but so did my responsibility to my team. My heart pounded as I hovered between answering her call and unmuting myself for the meeting, torn by the demands of being a good brother and a dependable engineer."}
