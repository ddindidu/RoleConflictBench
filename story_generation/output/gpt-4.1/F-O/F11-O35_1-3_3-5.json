My little brother wanted to go hiking, and my mom was already planning the picnic menu. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present, to laugh and help make the day special. I wanted that too. But as I scrolled through my phone, my work app buzzed\u2014an emergency alert from the subway control room. A passenger had pulled the emergency alarm; someone needed medical help on my train. My heart raced. As a subway operator, I was trained to respond quickly, to keep everyone safe, to be calm and decisive. My family\u2019s voices faded as I stared at the screen, torn between the warmth of home and the urgent responsibility waiting for me underground. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my answer about the weekend, while my mind spun with protocols and the weight of lives depending on me."}
