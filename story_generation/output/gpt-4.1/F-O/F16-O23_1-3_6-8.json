They asked, \u201cRough day?\u201d and I nodded, trying to keep my tone light. \u201cJust the usual,\u201d I said, but my mind replayed the tense exchange with opposing counsel earlier. They\u2019d pressed hard for details I couldn\u2019t share\u2014details that, if revealed, would devastate my client\u2019s case. My spouse leaned in, concern etched on their face. \u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything, right?\u201d The expectation to be open and honest in our marriage pressed against the ironclad duty I owed my client. I wanted to unburden myself, to let my spouse in, but the weight of confidentiality held me back. My heart ached with the need to connect, but my professional oath stood firm.
