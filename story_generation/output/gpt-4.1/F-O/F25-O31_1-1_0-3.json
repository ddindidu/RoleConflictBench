Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I stared at the screen, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I knew how much it meant to him and Mom that I checked in, especially since I moved out. They always said, \u201cJust a quick text, let us know you\u2019re safe.\u201d But my shift had just ended, and I needed to get inside, work out, keep myself in shape\u2014my duty as a police officer. If I let my fitness slide, I\u2019d be letting my team down, maybe even putting someone at risk. But if I ignored the message, I\u2019d be letting my family down, too. I could already hear my mom\u2019s voice, soft but disappointed, \u201cWe just worry about you.\u201d My thumb hovered over the reply button, heart pounding, torn between the badge on my chest and the family waiting for a sign that I still cared."}
