My mom\u2019s eyes were red, her voice trembling as she confided in me about her worries\u2014Dad\u2019s health, the bills piling up, the loneliness she felt. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I reached for her hand, but my mind was split. The phone kept vibrating: it was the factory operator again. He\u2019d been calling all morning, unable to get the machine to run properly. Every minute I didn\u2019t answer meant more wasted material, more money lost, and my boss\u2019s growing frustration. I could almost hear his voice in my head, reminding me that I was the only one who could walk the operator through the right settings. My mom\u2019s words blurred with the operator\u2019s frantic messages. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by the family who needed my heart, the other by the job that demanded my expertise. My chest tightened as I tried to decide who needed me more in that moment."}
