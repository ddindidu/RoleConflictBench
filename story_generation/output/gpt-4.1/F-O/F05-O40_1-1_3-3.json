My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight?\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from a client. They want a custom bookshelf, and they need an estimate by tomorrow morning. I know I have to check my inventory, calculate the wood I\u2019ll need, and place an order before the supplier closes. My mind races between the two worlds: the quiet, shared work of folding laundry with my wife, and the urgent, solitary task of planning the new project. Both are important. Both are expected of me. I feel the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, my hands hovering between the laundry basket and my notepad, heart pounding as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
