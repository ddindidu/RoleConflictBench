She looked at me not just as her daughter, but as her anchor, her comfort. I wanted to reach out, to hold her hand and reassure her that everything would be okay, to listen without judgment or interruption. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014my next patient was waiting at the clinic, a young woman with a runny nose and a cough, symptoms that could be nothing or something more. As a doctor, I was expected to be thorough, to listen carefully, to diagnose with precision and not let personal matters cloud my judgment. My mother\u2019s eyes pleaded for my presence, while my patient\u2019s chart waited for my attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the daughter my mother needed and the doctor my patient deserved."}
