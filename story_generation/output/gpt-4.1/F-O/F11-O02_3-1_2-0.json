It was my younger brother, his name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, knowing he rarely called unless something was wrong. As his sister, I\u2019d always been the one he leaned on, the one who listened when things got tough. I could hear the strain in his voice as he asked if I had a moment\u2014he needed to talk, really talk, about something that was weighing on him.\n\nBut my mind was tangled in the technical challenge in front of me. The team was counting on me to propose a new approach for the project, and even though we were still in the early stages, I felt the pressure to deliver something innovative. I knew I could suggest alternatives later, but I also knew how quickly ideas could get dismissed if I wasn\u2019t present and engaged.\n\nI stared at my notes, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both sides. My brother needed me now, but so did my team. The expectations pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, torn between being the sister he could rely on and the engineer my colleagues depended on."}
