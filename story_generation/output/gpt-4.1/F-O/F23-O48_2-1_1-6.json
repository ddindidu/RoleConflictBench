The open class at Lily\u2019s school was starting in less than an hour. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on like the other parents. I promised her I would come, and I could still hear her voice in my head, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d But here I was, sitting beside Mrs. Carter, my favorite patient, who was having a rough morning. She clung to my hand, her eyes watery, telling me how lonely she felt since her daughter moved away. My supervisor expected me to spend extra time with patients like Mrs. Carter, offering comfort and companionship. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Lily\u2019s need for my presence, Mrs. Carter\u2019s need for my support. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cLily\u2019s open class, 10:00 AM.\u201d I stared at it, torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
