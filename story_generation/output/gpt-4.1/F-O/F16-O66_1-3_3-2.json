I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d help more, and I know she\u2019s counting on me. But my phone buzzes again\u2014dispatch. A passenger needs a ride to the airport, and there\u2019s a winter storm swirling outside. The roads are slick, traffic crawling, and the passenger\u2019s voice is tight with worry: \u201cMy flight\u2019s in two hours. Please, I can\u2019t miss it.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife expects me to be present, to share the load at home, to be the partner she needs.
