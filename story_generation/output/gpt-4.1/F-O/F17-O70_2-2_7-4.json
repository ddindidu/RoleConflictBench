Dad barely touched his dinner, lost in thought. I knew they were both carrying more than usual, and I felt the weight of their exhaustion settle on my shoulders. I wanted to sit with them, to ask if they were okay, to offer comfort\u2014just be the child they needed right now. But my phone buzzed: another delivery notification. I had to get out the door, uniform on, packages in hand. The next stop was a moderately valuable item, and the app reminded me: \u201cSignature required.\u201d I couldn\u2019t risk a missed delivery or a lost package\u2014my job depended on it.
