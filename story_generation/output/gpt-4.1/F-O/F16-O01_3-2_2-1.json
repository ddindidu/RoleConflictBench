As an architect, I knew the weight of my responsibility\u2014if I didn\u2019t review the plans tonight, unsafe elements might slip through, putting lives at risk and violating every code I stood for. But across from me, my partner sat hunched, eyes red and voice trembling, barely holding it together after the news about their father\u2019s health. They needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. I could see the expectation in their gaze: to be present, to reassure, to help them carry this pain. My mind raced between the two worlds, each demanding all of me. The guilt gnawed at my insides\u2014how could I possibly choose between the safety of strangers and the heart of the person I love? My hands shook as I reached for my partner\u2019s, the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing that whatever I did next, something important would be left behind."}
