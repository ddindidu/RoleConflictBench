I glanced at the time, feeling the familiar pressure of the ticking clock. As I reached for my keys, my grandson called out from the living room, his voice trembling. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d He looked up at me, eyes wide and searching, holding back tears. I knew that look; he needed more than a quick answer. He needed the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give, the kind that comes from years of mistakes and hard-won wisdom.\n\nBut the hospital was waiting, and I knew the consequences if I was late. Patients depended on those supplies, and my job was to make sure they arrived on time, every time. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo delays, especially not with medical deliveries.\u201d I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the boy who needed me, and the patients who didn\u2019t even know my name but counted on me all the same. I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between the expectations of a loving grandfather and a responsible delivery person."}
