My stepbrother, Jamie, darted outside, his shoes barely on. I remembered Mrs. Patel\u2019s strict instructions: every room had to be spotless by noon, and I was already behind. But as I glanced out the window, I saw Jamie heading straight for the busy street, not even glancing up from his phone. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe. But as the housekeeper, I was expected to finish cleaning, no excuses. If I left now, I\u2019d never finish in time, and I\u2019d risk losing my job. If I stayed, Jamie could get hurt. My hands trembled, torn between the mop and the door, between the demands of family and work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
