It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for college?\u201d My heart warmed\u2014she trusted me to guide her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. I wanted to give her my full attention, to offer thoughtful advice, but just then, a customer approached, holding a blender and looking anxious. \u201cI need to return this, but I lost the receipt,\u201d she said. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, no exceptions. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my granddaughter needed my guidance, the customer needed compassion, and the store needed me to follow the rules. My mind raced, torn between the urge to step away and call my granddaughter, and the duty to handle the return by the book. I gripped the counter, caught between the expectations of family and work, unsure which demand to answer first."}
