She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her first-day excitement with me. My daughter had already texted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call her tonight\u2014she\u2019s been waiting to tell you everything!\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of being needed, but my gaze shifted to the back of the van where a package sat, addressed to a customer who\u2019d been tracking it all day. It was running a bit late, though still within the promised window, and I knew the company expected me to deliver every parcel promptly and without error. My supervisor had reminded us just this morning: \u201cNo delays, no mistakes.\u201d I felt the tug of both worlds\u2014my family expecting my attention and support, my job demanding my focus and punctuality. My heart ached at the thought of missing my granddaughter\u2019s call, but my hands tightened on the steering wheel, knowing the customer was waiting too. I sat there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
