He\u2019s been counting down the days.\u201d I could almost see Jamie\u2019s hopeful face, the way he\u2019d hugged me last week, whispering, \u201cThank you for saving up, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d I wanted to keep that promise, to show him he could trust me, that I was here for him and his mom, that I could provide. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my work radio crackled. \u201cHey, can you come to the floor? The new guys are about to start the batch, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve read the safety manual.\u201d My stomach twisted. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint Jamie and break my word. If I stayed, I could prevent a dangerous mistake, maybe even save someone from getting hurt. Both roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding I be a reliable parent, the other insisting I be a responsible expert. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the toy store and the factory floor, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
