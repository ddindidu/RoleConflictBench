I glanced at the screen\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cPlease, I need you.\u201d My heart clenched. He\u2019d just found out about our dad\u2019s diagnosis, and I knew he was barely holding it together. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to help him through this storm. But right now, a frail woman stood in front of me, clutching a new prescription, her eyes anxious. As a pharmacist, I was expected to give her my full attention, to explain the medication, warn her about side effects, and answer her questions with patience and care.
