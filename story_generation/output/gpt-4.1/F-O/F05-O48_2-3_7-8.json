You seemed distant this morning.\u201d My chest tightens. She\u2019s always valued our open communication, and I promised myself I\u2019d be there for her, especially when she\u2019s worried. But as I tuck my phone away, I hear soft sobs from Room 214. Mrs. Evans, who just learned her cancer has returned, sits hunched on her bed, tears streaming down her face. My supervisor expects me to offer comfort, to sit with her, listen, and help her through this moment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife needs me to share and listen, to be present at home, while Mrs. Evans needs me now, in this room, to be her support. My heart aches, torn between the woman I love and the patient who depends on me. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, knowing that wherever I go, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
