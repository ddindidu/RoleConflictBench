It\u2019s a message from my wife\u2014her words are shaky, desperate. She\u2019s having another panic attack, and she needs me. I can almost hear her voice trembling, feel the weight of her fear through the screen. I want nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her hand and remind her she\u2019s not alone. But the intercom crackles, and a supervisor\u2019s voice cuts through: \u201cUnattended bag reported in car three. All operators, be alert and follow safety protocol.\u201d My heart pounds. I know what\u2019s expected of me here\u2014keep calm, ensure every passenger is safe, follow the emergency procedures to the letter. Hundreds of people are counting on me to do my job right now. But my wife is counting on me, too, in a way that feels even more urgent. I stand frozen, torn between the duty to the people on my train and the person I love most in the world, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
