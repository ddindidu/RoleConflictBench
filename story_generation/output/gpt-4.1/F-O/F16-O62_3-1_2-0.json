They needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014right now. The weight of their crisis pressed between us, and I could feel their silent plea for comfort, for me to stay, to listen, to be present. But as I tried to focus on their words, my gaze kept flickering to the water. I was on duty, the only lifeguard for this stretch of sand, and a few swimmers were drifting farther out, not in trouble yet, but edging toward the deeper water. My training screamed at me to watch them, to never let my attention waver, even for a second. But my partner\u2019s voice trembled, and I saw the fear in their eyes, the need for reassurance only I could give. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice\u2014be the anchor my partner desperately needed, or the vigilant guardian the swimmers depended on. I felt torn in two, unable to give either role what it demanded of me in this moment."}
