He looked up at me, waiting for my reaction. I knew I should use this moment to teach him about cleaning up after himself, about responsibility and respect for others\u2019 work. My phone buzzed on the counter. I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from dispatch. The medical supplies in my van had to reach the hospital in thirty minutes, no exceptions. Someone\u2019s care depended on it. My son\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for approval or correction. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to guide him, to be the father he needed. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk being late, letting down the patients and my employer. My heart pounded as I stood between the spilled milk and the ticking clock, torn by the demands of two lives that refused to wait for each other."}
