Dad barely spoke at dinner, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. I knew they needed me\u2014just to listen, to reassure them, to be present. But my phone buzzed with a call from dispatch. I was needed on patrol, and soon enough, I found myself standing beside a car parked illegally outside a small grocery store. The owner, a friend of my parents, pleaded with me, explaining he\u2019d only run in to help his sick wife. I remembered the expectation drilled into me at the academy: act with integrity, treat everyone fairly, no exceptions. Yet, I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to show compassion, to understand the struggles people face. My heart ached, torn between the daughter who wanted to ease burdens and the officer who had to uphold the law. I stared at my ticket pad, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, unsure which role I could bear to disappoint."}
