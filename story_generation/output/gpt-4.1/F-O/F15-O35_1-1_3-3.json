She looked up at me, her eyes searching for approval, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a parent\u2014to guide her, to shape her into a kind and disciplined person. Just then, my work phone buzzed. I was on call as a subway operator, and a passenger was asking for directions over the intercom. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways respond promptly. Passenger safety and assistance come first.\u201d I glanced at my daughter, still waiting for my attention, and then at the blinking phone. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to stay and finish the lesson, but also the duty to help the passenger who might be lost or anxious. The expectations from both worlds pressed in on me, and for a moment, I was frozen, torn between being the parent my daughter needed and the operator my passengers depended on."}
