It\u2019s important to us.\u201d Her words echo in my mind, heavy with the weight of tradition. My family has always insisted that I honor our customs, especially now, when they feel our values are slipping away. But as I tuck my phone back into my pocket, the foreman\u2019s voice booms across the site, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. It\u2019s non-negotiable\u2014missing it means risking my job and letting down my crew. I can see my coworkers gathering, hard hats in hand, eyes expectant. My heart pounds as I stand between the pull of my family\u2019s expectations and the demands of my job. I want to be the dutiful child, but I also need to be a reliable worker. The seconds tick by, and I feel the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both need me, both right now."}
