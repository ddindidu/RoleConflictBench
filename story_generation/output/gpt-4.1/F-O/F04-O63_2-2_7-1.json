As a telemarketer, I was supposed to handle every objection, every question, with confidence\u2014even when the script barely scratched the surface of the technical details customers demanded. My supervisor expected me to keep the calls moving, to never admit uncertainty, to always sound like the expert. But today, my little brother barged into my room, frustrated about a disagreement we\u2019d had earlier. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, to understand why I always seemed impatient with him. I knew, as his brother, I should listen, be patient, and respect his feelings, even if we saw things differently. But the clock was ticking, and my call quota loomed over me. My headset beeped, signaling another prospect on the line, probably ready with a barrage of questions I wasn\u2019t fully prepared to answer. My brother\u2019s eyes pleaded for my attention, while my job demanded I focus on the customer. I felt the tension coil inside me, torn between being the brother he needed and the employee my boss expected."}
