As his sister, I wanted to be there, to hug him, to see his face light up when he realized how proud we all were. But as a lifeguard, I was stationed at the busiest stretch of sand, eyes scanning the churning water, every muscle tense. The tide was high, the waves rough, and the beach was packed with swimmers. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo distractions, not even for a second.\u201d I could see my family gathering near the dunes, waving me over, my brother\u2019s grin wide and expectant. My heart twisted. I wanted to run to them, to celebrate, to be the supportive sister he deserved. But I also knew that even a brief lapse in attention could mean disaster for someone in the water. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of family and the weight of responsibility, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
