My father\u2019s voice, usually steady, trembled as he recounted a difficult day at work. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure, to simply be present. But as I sat with them, my phone buzzed with reminders: the departmental meeting was tomorrow, and I hadn\u2019t finished compiling the preliminary data summaries. My supervisor had emphasized the importance of accuracy and timeliness, and I could almost hear her voice in my head, urging me not to let the team down. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for comfort, and the unyielding demands of my research.
