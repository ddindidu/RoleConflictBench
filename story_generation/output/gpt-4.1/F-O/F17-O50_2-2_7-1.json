Dad barely touched his coffee, staring blankly at the morning news. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort\u2014just as I always tried to do when things got tough at home. But my phone buzzed insistently, the message from work urgent: the main production unit was down again, sensor errors halting everything for half an hour now. They needed me to diagnose the problem, to get the line running before the delay spiraled into something worse. My mind raced, torn between the silent plea in my parents\u2019 faces and the mounting pressure from my team. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be the one who could fix things. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
