He asked about mine, and I hesitated, knowing he wanted me to share, to be open, to let him in. I started to mention a difficult call from earlier, but before I could finish, my radio crackled to life. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries, immediate response needed. My heart pounded. I saw the expectation in my husband\u2019s eyes\u2014he wanted me to finish, to trust him with my thoughts, to be present as his wife. But the uniform in the other room, the keys on the hook, reminded me of the other expectation: lives depended on my speed, my focus, my professionalism. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. My husband reached for my hand, and the radio repeated the call, more insistent this time. I stood frozen, caught between the need to be a good wife and the duty to save lives, unsure which demand to answer first."}
