My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my partner\u2019s text: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Nintendo for Jamie. He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d I promised him, and I know how much it means, especially after all the changes in our family. But the store manager just reminded me: tonight\u2019s deposit is huge, and every bill must be counted, logged, and double-checked. No shortcuts, no mistakes, or I risk a write-up, maybe worse. My heart pounds as I picture Jamie\u2019s hopeful face, the way he\u2019s been trying to trust me, to let me in. But the deposit will take at least an hour, and the electronics store closes soon. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s trust, our financial needs, the rules of my job, and the fear of letting someone down, no matter what I choose."}
