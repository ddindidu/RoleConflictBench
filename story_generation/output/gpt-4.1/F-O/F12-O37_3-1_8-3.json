He wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about our finances, about the medical bills piling up on the kitchen counter. As a wife, I knew I owed him honesty, my full attention, and open communication. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was responsible for making sure we didn\u2019t run out of essentials, and I\u2019d already noticed we were low on disinfectant and sponges. If I didn\u2019t finish the inventory now, I\u2019d lose track and risk missing something important for tomorrow\u2019s cleaning schedule. My mind raced, torn between the urge to sit down and be present for my husband, and the pressure to finish my work before the day slipped away. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
