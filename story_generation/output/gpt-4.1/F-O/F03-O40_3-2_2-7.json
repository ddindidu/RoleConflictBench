She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten lunch, if I was wearing my jacket, if I\u2019d remembered to call Auntie about her birthday. I\u2019d always made it a point to reply quickly, to keep our daily conversations going\u2014she said it made her feel close, especially since Dad passed. But right now, I was kneeling on the splintered boards of Mrs. Lee\u2019s deck, tools scattered around me, sweat trickling down my back. She stood nearby, anxious, watching every move. The deck was worse than I\u2019d thought; some beams needed replacing, and she wanted it done before her family barbecue tomorrow. My phone buzzed again. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s worried voice in my head, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to focus, to fix her deck before the sun set. I stared at my phone, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s expectations and the pressing demands of my work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
