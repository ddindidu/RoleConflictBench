I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. She rarely called during the day unless something was wrong. My heart skipped. I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee, who smiled and asked if I could just take a little more off the sides. She was always so patient, and I wanted her to leave happy, as she always did. But my mind was already with Mom, wondering if Dad was okay, if she needed to talk, if I should have checked in more often. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the daughter who should be there for her parents, the hairdresser who should never let a client feel neglected. My hands trembled slightly as I combed through Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair, torn between the urge to excuse myself and call Mom, and the duty to finish the perfect cut."}
