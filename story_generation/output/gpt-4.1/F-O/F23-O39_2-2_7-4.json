As a step-parent, I felt the weight of every dollar, knowing my family depended on me to keep things afloat. The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any accidents. Keep your area clean.\u201d I was hauling bags of cement when I spotted a slick, oily puddle in the walkway. It wasn\u2019t big, but it was right where the crew would be moving heavy loads all morning. I knew I should stop and clean it up, but I also knew that every minute away from my assigned task meant less pay, and I couldn\u2019t risk being docked for lost time.
