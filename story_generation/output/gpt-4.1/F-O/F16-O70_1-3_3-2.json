My partner\u2019s been hinting all week\u2014\u201cMaybe we can fold it together tonight?\u201d\u2014but every night, I\u2019m either too tired or running late. Today, I promised I\u2019d get it done before dinner. But just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes: urgent delivery, medical supplies, hospital drop-off, must arrive within the hour. I know what\u2019s at stake\u2014someone\u2019s care, maybe even their life, depends on me getting there on time. But I also know what\u2019s at stake at home. My partner\u2019s patience is wearing thin, and I can\u2019t keep letting them down. My chest tightens as I glance between the laundry and my delivery bag. Both roles demand my attention, both feel equally important, and I can\u2019t see how to do right by both."}
