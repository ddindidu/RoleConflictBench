It was almost three, and my children would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there today\u2014no more missed pickups, no more disappointed looks. But on my desk, the thick stack of papers stared back at me: the purchase agreement for the firm\u2019s biggest client. The filing deadline was tonight, and I hadn\u2019t finished my review. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the school, and at the same time, an email from my managing partner popped up, asking for an update. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my children\u2019s trust, my professional responsibility. I imagined their faces, hopeful and expectant, and then pictured the consequences of a missed deadline: a client lost, my reputation questioned. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the father my children needed and the lawyer my firm demanded. The minutes ticked by, and I still hadn\u2019t moved."}
