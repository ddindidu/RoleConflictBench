The hearing was in two weeks, and as a judge, I knew I should start reviewing it now, even if it seemed straightforward. My reputation depended on being thorough, never missing a detail. But my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I remembered my promise to check in more often, to be the son who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home. Guilt pricked at me\u2014my parents needed me, not just as a visitor on holidays, but as someone who cared enough to ask, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I glanced at the file, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. The expectation to be diligent and prepared as a judge clashed with the need to be present and supportive as a son. My mind raced, torn between duty and love, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
