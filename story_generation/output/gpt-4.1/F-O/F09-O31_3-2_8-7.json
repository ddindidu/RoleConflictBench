The two drivers stood outside, voices rising, each insisting the other was at fault. As a police officer, I was expected to be fair, to listen to both sides and make an honest report. But my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. My son\u2019s school fees, groceries, the bills\u2014everything depended on me keeping this job and maybe even earning a little extra overtime. One of the drivers, a well-dressed man, quietly slipped a business card into my hand, hinting at a \u201cfavor\u201d if I sided with him. My heart pounded. As a mother, I wanted to secure my family\u2019s future, to make sure we never missed a payment. But as an officer, I was sworn to uphold the law, to act with integrity. The two roles pulled at me from opposite sides, and I felt trapped in the middle, unable to move forward."}
