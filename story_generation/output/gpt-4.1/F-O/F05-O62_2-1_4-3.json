The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d handle it, wanting to share the load at home. But as I walk through the pool area at work, my lifeguard instincts kick in. A few pool chairs are out of place, not a hazard yet, but I know the facility manager expects everything to be orderly. I can almost hear his voice: \u201cWe set the standard here. Details matter.\u201d My shift ends soon, and I\u2019m torn. If I stay to realign the chairs, I\u2019ll be late getting home, and the laundry might not get done in time. If I rush out, I\u2019ll be letting down my team and risking a reprimand. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. I stand at the edge of the pool, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the needs of my family and the standards of my job."}
