My spouse had mentioned, not so subtly, that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s soccer game, and I\u2019d promised to handle it tonight. The washing machine hummed in the background, but I kept glancing at the clock, feeling the weight of another responsibility tugging at me. At the pool, I\u2019d noticed earlier that some of the chairs were out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but enough to catch the supervisor\u2019s eye if left unattended. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, to show pride in the facility. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding me that details matter. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the pool closing checklist. I felt torn, standing in the middle of my living room, laundry basket in hand, knowing that whichever task I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
