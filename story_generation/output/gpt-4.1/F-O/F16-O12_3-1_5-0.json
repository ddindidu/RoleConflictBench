My spouse is bustling around, making lists and asking if I can vacuum the living room before her parents arrive tomorrow. I nod, but my mind is still tangled in the code I left unfinished upstairs. The new module I\u2019m working on has a generous deadline, and technically, I could refactor it later, but I hate leaving messy code behind. I want to be the kind of developer who always delivers clean, maintainable work. At the same time, I want to be the partner who shares the load, who doesn\u2019t leave everything to her when family is coming. The expectation to be present and helpful at home clashes with the urge to finish my work the right way. I feel the tension building in my chest, torn between the hum of the vacuum and the call of my IDE, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at once."}
