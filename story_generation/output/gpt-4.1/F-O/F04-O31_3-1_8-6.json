My heart sank as I recognized my younger brother\u2019s license plate. I knew he\u2019d been struggling to find parking near his new job, and we\u2019d just talked about how tough things had been for him lately. As a brother, I wanted to call him, talk it out, and maybe let this one slide\u2014after all, family looks out for each other, and I wanted to show him respect by understanding his situation.\n\nBut as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, treating everyone equally, no matter who they were. If I let him off, was I being unfair to others who\u2019d gotten tickets here? My badge demanded impartiality, but my heart ached at the thought of disappointing my brother or damaging the trust we\u2019d built. I stood by his car, ticket book in hand, torn between the expectations of my uniform and the bond of blood, wrestling with what it meant to do the right thing."}
