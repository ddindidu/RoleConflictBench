The customer had called twice already, her voice tight with urgency\u2014she needed those groceries for dinner, and the window was closing fast. My phone buzzed again, but this time it was my wife. I could hear the strain in her voice, the way she hesitated before saying, \u201cCan we talk when you get home? I just\u2026 I need to share something.\u201d I remembered our promise to always communicate, to never let worries fester in silence. But the pressure of the delivery weighed on me; I couldn\u2019t be late, not again, or I\u2019d risk a complaint, maybe even my job. My mind spun between the two worlds\u2014my wife\u2019s need for comfort and my customer\u2019s expectation for reliability. I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the person waiting at home and the one waiting at the door, both counting on me in different ways."}
