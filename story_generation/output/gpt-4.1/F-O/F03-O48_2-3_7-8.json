We\u2019re both so tired.\u201d I could hear the exhaustion in her words, and I pictured them at home, shadows under their eyes, waiting for me to come back and be the son they needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to just be there. But as I slipped my phone into my pocket, I heard a soft sob from down the hall. Mrs. Lee, one of my patients, had just learned her cancer had returned. She was alone, her hands trembling as she wiped her tears. My supervisor expected me to be present, to offer comfort and companionship, to sit with her and help her through the shock. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart aching for my parents at home and for Mrs. Lee in her hospital bed. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which door to walk through first."}
