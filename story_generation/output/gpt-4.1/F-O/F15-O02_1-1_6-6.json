I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d buy it this month, and he\u2019d been counting down the days, his eyes shining with anticipation. But as I glanced at our bank account, the numbers didn\u2019t quite add up the way I\u2019d hoped. The project at work was in its early stages, and my manager expected me to join the informal planning session tonight to provide time estimates\u2014nothing was set in stone yet, but my input would shape the next few months. I knew that being present and accurate at work meant stability for my family, but my son\u2019s hopeful face tugged at me. Could I really justify spending on the Nintendo now, or should I wait until the project was more secure? My mind spun with the weight of both roles, the demands of my job and the promise I\u2019d made to my child pulling me in opposite directions."}
