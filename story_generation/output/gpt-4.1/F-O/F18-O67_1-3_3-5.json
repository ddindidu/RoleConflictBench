My younger brother looked at me, eyes bright, and said, \u201cYou have to come this time. It\u2019s been ages since we all did something together.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, feeling the warmth of belonging. Just then, my phone buzzed. Dispatch. A patient was having a major heart attack, and I was the closest ambulance driver on call. My heart pounded as I glanced at my family, their faces full of hope and expectation. I knew what was at stake for the patient\u2014every second mattered. But I also saw the disappointment flicker in my brother\u2019s eyes as I reached for my keys.
