My son, Ben, is across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, cereal splattered on the table. I\u2019m supposed to be teaching him to clean up after himself, to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d to be patient. But my phone buzzes\u2014another call. I click \u201caccept,\u201d and a customer\u2019s voice fills my ear, rapid-fire questions about the new service. The script doesn\u2019t cover half of what she\u2019s asking. I\u2019m supposed to sound confident, handle objections, keep her interested. Ben drops his spoon, milk splashes. He looks at me, waiting for guidance, for a gentle reminder about table manners. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Answer every question.\u201d Ben\u2019s eyes plead for attention. The customer\u2019s voice grows impatient. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the expectation to be a patient, present parent and the demand to be a knowledgeable, persuasive telemarketer. My heart pounds as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
