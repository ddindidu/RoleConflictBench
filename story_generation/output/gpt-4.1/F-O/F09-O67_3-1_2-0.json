My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the school. My heart sank as I read it: my son had been caught bullying another child. The principal wanted me to come in immediately to discuss his behavior. As a mother, I felt a surge of guilt and responsibility. I should be there, guiding him, showing him right from wrong. But as I looked at the radio, I knew I couldn\u2019t just leave. At any moment, a call could come in\u2014a life might depend on how quickly I responded. My supervisor expected me to be ready, focused, and reliable. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My son needed his mother, but the city needed its ambulance driver. I stared at the dashboard, my mind racing, caught between the urgent needs of my child and the unknown emergencies waiting out there."}
