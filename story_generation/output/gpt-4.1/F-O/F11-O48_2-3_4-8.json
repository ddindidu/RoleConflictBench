Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter and smell the food, the warmth of being together after a long week. But as I tucked my phone away, I heard quiet sobs from Room 214. Mrs. Evans, who\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, sat hunched on her bed, tears streaming down her face. My heart twisted. I knew my family expected me to be there tonight, to share stories and help set the table, to be the sister who never misses a gathering. But here, in this small, sterile room, I was needed just as much. Mrs. Evans looked up at me, her eyes pleading for comfort, for someone to sit with her in her pain. I felt torn in two\u2014pulled by the love and duty I owed my family, and the compassion and responsibility I felt for my patient. My hands trembled as I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
