The bathroom still needs cleaning. Relatives will be here by six.\u201d I could almost hear the urgency in her words. As a husband, I knew I was expected to help make the house spotless, to share the load, especially with her family coming. But as I tucked my phone away, the line at my register stretched past the candy racks. A customer slammed her items on the counter, her voice sharp and impatient. \u201cWhy is this taking so long?\u201d I forced a smile, trying to stay calm and friendly, even as my mind raced with the chores waiting at home. My manager watched from the end of the aisle, expecting me to keep things moving and customers happy. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my wife needed me at home, my job needed me here. My heart pounded as I rang up the next item, caught between the demands of being a good husband and a good cashier, not sure which role I could let down less."}
