My phone buzzed with a message from my client, \u201cNeed your review by tonight\u2014urgent.\u201d I glanced up at my spouse, who was waiting patiently across from me, concern etched on their face. We\u2019d agreed to talk tonight about our finances\u2014medical bills, savings, the future. They deserved my full attention, my honesty. But the contract in front of me was a ticking time bomb; if I missed something, my client could face disaster. My spouse reached for my hand, voice gentle, \u201cCan we talk now?\u201d I felt the weight of their expectation for openness, for trust. At the same time, the lawyer in me screamed that I couldn\u2019t let my client down. My heart pounded as I tried to be present in both worlds, torn between the person I love and the duty I owe. I stared at the contract, then at my spouse, feeling the pressure mount, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at this moment."}
