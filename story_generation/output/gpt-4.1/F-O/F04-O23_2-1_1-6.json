It was my younger sister, her text urgent: \u201cCan you call? Need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her brother, I felt the familiar pull to drop everything and be there for her. But just as I was about to step away, a colleague approached, introducing me to a potential client. The conversation quickly turned to a high-profile case I was handling. \u201cSo, what\u2019s really going on with that client of yours?\u201d the new acquaintance asked, curiosity gleaming in his eyes.\n\nI felt the weight of my roles pressing in. As a brother, I wanted to excuse myself and call my sister, to be the support she needed. As a lawyer, I was expected to maintain professionalism, keep client details confidential, and not appear evasive in front of colleagues. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect my sister and the duty to uphold my ethical obligations. The expectations from both sides clashed inside me, leaving me frozen, heart pounding, unsure which role to honor first."}
