I really need you.\u201d I could almost hear the strain in his words. As his sister, I knew I should be there for him, especially when he reached out like this. But I was behind the wheel, working my shift as a taxi driver, and the city was a maze of orange cones and flashing signs today. \n\nJust ahead, a school zone sign blinked, and a group of children clustered near the curb, their backpacks bobbing. The construction had squeezed the road into a single, narrow lane. My passenger was already late, shifting impatiently in the back seat. I felt the weight of my brother\u2019s need pulling at me, but the rules of the road and the safety of those kids demanded my full attention. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between answering my brother\u2019s call for help and my responsibility to drive safely. The phone buzzed again, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
