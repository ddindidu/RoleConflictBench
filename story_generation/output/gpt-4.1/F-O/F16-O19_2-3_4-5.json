My partner had mentioned, not unkindly, that the kids were running out of clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s field trip. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d handle the laundry tonight, but as I was sorting the colors from the whites, my phone buzzed.

She was on a cocktail of high-risk drugs, and the new intern was nervous about missing something critical. I knew how important it was to catch potential interactions, to explain everything clearly so she\u2019d be safe.
