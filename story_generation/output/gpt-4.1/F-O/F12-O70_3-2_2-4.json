It was a message from my husband: \u201cCan you come home soon? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling for weeks, barely sleeping, and I knew how much he depended on me to help him through this rough patch. My heart ached, wanting nothing more than to drop everything and rush home to hold him, to listen, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut in my other hand was a moderately valuable package, and the app reminded me: \u201cSignature required.\u201d My supervisor had been clear\u2014no shortcuts, no missed signatures, or I\u2019d risk a warning. The customer was already waiting at the window, watching for me. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectation to be reliable, professional, and efficient.\n\nI stood there, torn between the doorbell and my phone, between the person who needed me most and the job that paid our bills. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
