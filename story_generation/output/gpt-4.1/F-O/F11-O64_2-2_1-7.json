The line stretched past the bakery, and I could feel the impatience simmering. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep it moving, be friendly, make them feel welcome.\u201d I nodded and greeted each customer, but my phone buzzed in my apron pocket, vibrating with urgency. I glanced down and saw my sister\u2019s name. She never called during the day unless it was serious. My heart squeezed\u2014she\u2019d been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d always be there for her. But the line wasn\u2019t getting any shorter, and the customers\u2019 faces were growing more strained. I could almost hear my sister\u2019s voice, shaky and needing comfort, while at the same time, I felt the weight of the store\u2019s expectations pressing on me. I gripped the scanner tighter, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job, caught in the impossible space between being a good sister and a good cashier."}
