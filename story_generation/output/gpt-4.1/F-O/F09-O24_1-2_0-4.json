As a judge, I had just concluded a complex bench trial, and the weight of responsibility pressed on my shoulders. The parties were anxious for a decision, and I knew the law required me to write a thorough, well-reasoned judgment\u2014one that would stand up to scrutiny and provide closure. Yet, as I stared at my notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: school dismissal in thirty minutes. My children would be waiting, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there to pick them up like I promised. I could picture their disappointment if I was late, the way their shoulders would slump, the questions in their eyes. My heart tugged me toward the school, but my mind circled back to the unfinished judgment, the expectation that I would deliver justice promptly and clearly. I sat at my desk, torn between the courtroom and the schoolyard, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
