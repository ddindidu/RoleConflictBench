The route closure had thrown the entire airspace into chaos, and every second counted. My supervisor\u2019s expectation was clear: keep the skies safe, manage the congestion, don\u2019t let a single mistake slip through. My hands hovered over the console, issuing instructions, my mind racing to keep up.\n\nBut my phone buzzed on the desk, vibrating with a message from my stepmother: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to light the holiday candles. It\u2019s important to your father.\u201d I could picture them all gathered in the living room, the table set, the family tradition I was supposed to uphold. I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I\u2019d promised to be there this year.\n\nThe weight of both worlds pressed down on me. My family expected me to show up, to prove I belonged, to honor their traditions. My job demanded unwavering focus, lives depending on my every word. I felt split in two, heart pounding, as I stared at the radar and the glowing phone, torn between the sky and the home I was still trying to fit into."}
