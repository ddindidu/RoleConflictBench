He grinned at me, board in hand, ready to launch himself down the steep, cracked ramp. \u201cWatch this!\u201d he called. My heart thudded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, but he hated when I hovered. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my boss, reminding me to double-check the plans for the new community center. I\u2019d already noticed a few minor inconsistencies\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but as an architect, I was expected to ensure every detail was perfect, every risk accounted for. My mind raced, torn between running to stop my brother before he hurt himself and sitting down to pore over the plans before the deadline. Both roles demanded my vigilance, my care, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my hands trembling as I tried to decide where my responsibility truly lay."}
