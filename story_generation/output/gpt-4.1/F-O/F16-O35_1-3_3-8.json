It\u2019s piling up.\u201d I picture the overflowing basket in the corner of our bedroom, the silent expectation that I\u2019ll help keep our home running smoothly. But before I can reply, the cabin door slides open and my supervisor steps in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cUnannounced audit,\u201d he says, settling into the jump seat. My heart rate spikes. I know every move I make will be scrutinized\u2014my announcements, my timing, my adherence to every protocol. I can\u2019t afford a single mistake. Yet, in the back of my mind, the image of the laundry persists, tangled with guilt and frustration. I want to be reliable at home, to share the load, but right now, every ounce of my focus must be on the tracks ahead and the supervisor beside me. The train lurches forward, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, waiting for me to choose which expectation I\u2019ll meet first."}
