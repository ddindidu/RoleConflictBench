As his step-parent, I felt the weight of teaching him the right way to treat others, to instill those small but important habits. Just as I was about to correct him again, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the pool manager. Swimmers had been slipping into the shallow end without lifeguard supervision, and I was expected to enforce the rules strictly, no exceptions. My mind raced. At home, I was supposed to be patient, nurturing, guiding my stepson with understanding. At the pool, I had to be firm, authoritative, and sometimes even harsh to keep everyone safe. The expectations clashed inside me. How could I be gentle and supportive in one role, but strict and unyielding in another? I felt the tension building, torn between the urge to soften my approach for my stepson and the need to uphold the rules at the pool. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I sat there, unsure which part of myself should take the lead."}
