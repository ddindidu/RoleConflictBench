Need a fix ASAP.\u201d My laptop is open, code editor ready, but my mind is elsewhere. Across the table, my spouse sits, eyes searching mine, voice gentle but firm. \u201cWe need to talk about the medical bills. I need to know what we can really afford.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of her expectation\u2014honesty, openness, no distractions. But the pinging notifications pull at me, each one a reminder that my team and our users are counting on me to solve this bug, now, not later.\n\nMy heart pounds. If I focus on the code, I\u2019ll miss the chance to be present, to reassure her, to share the truth she deserves. If I turn away from my laptop, the errors will pile up, users will be frustrated, and my team will be left hanging. I want to be the partner she needs, the developer my team relies on. But right now, I can\u2019t be both. I sit frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure build as both wait for me to choose."}
