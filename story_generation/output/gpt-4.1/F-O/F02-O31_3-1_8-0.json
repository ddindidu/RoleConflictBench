My wife glanced at me, worry flickering in her eyes, and I knew I had to find a way to keep us afloat. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a noise complaint, another late-night party in the neighborhood.

But as a father, I needed to figure out how to secure our finances, maybe even take on extra shifts or overtime. The thought of leaving my family again tonight, missing another chance to talk through our budget, twisted my insides. I could hear my daughter\u2019s laughter from her room, a reminder of what was at stake. The demands of my badge and my home pulled me in opposite directions, and for a moment, I just sat there, torn, unable to move."}
