The store manager\u2019s stern words still echoed in my ears as I pulled away from the curb. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. My heart pounded with the weight of that responsibility, the urge to stop the car and talk to him immediately almost overwhelming.\n\nBut as a taxi driver, I had a passenger waiting for pickup across town, and I was already running late. The expectation to follow traffic laws and drive safely pressed on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t speed or make reckless turns, not with my son in the car and my job on the line.
