She chattered about her day, and I kept an eye on the traffic, making sure she stayed close to the curb. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mrs. Hargrove, whose house I\u2019d inspected that morning. The termite damage was worse than I\u2019d thought, and she needed a repair plan before sundown to keep her insurance. I could already hear her anxious voice in my head, expecting me to drop everything and get to work. But my sister\u2019s hand slipped into mine, and I remembered Mom\u2019s words: \u201cDon\u2019t let her walk home alone. Keep her safe.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility as her big brother, and my duty as a carpenter. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of the repairs and the promise I\u2019d made to my family. I squeezed her hand, heart pounding, caught between the pull of two lives that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
