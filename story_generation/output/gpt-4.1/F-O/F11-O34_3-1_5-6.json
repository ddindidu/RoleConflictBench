Mom\u2019s so excited.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, full of hope and expectation. I knew how much these rare family gatherings meant, especially to Mom, who\u2019d been planning this holiday for months. But as I sat in the control tower, headset snug over my ears, my focus was pulled back to the radar. An aircraft was approaching the sector boundary, and I needed to coordinate with the next controller to ensure a seamless handoff. The airspace was busy, and any lapse could cause confusion or even danger. My supervisor expected nothing less than perfect attention and communication. My heart pounded as I weighed the pressure from home against the responsibility in front of me. I felt torn, the demands of being a good sister clashing with the unyielding vigilance required in the tower. The voices in my headset blurred with the echo of my family\u2019s expectations, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which one I could let down."}
