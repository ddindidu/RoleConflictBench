She had just learned about her diagnosis, and I could feel her pain as if it were my own. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to be the strong sibling she needed, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone in this. But then my radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling in a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My training screamed at me to move, to save lives, to not waste a second. But my heart ached at the thought of leaving my sister in her darkest moment. I could see the silent plea in her eyes, begging me not to go, while the urgency of the call pressed on my conscience. I was torn, paralyzed between the duty to my family and the duty to strangers whose lives might depend on my speed. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I couldn\u2019t breathe."}
