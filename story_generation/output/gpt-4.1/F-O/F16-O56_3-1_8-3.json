It\u2019s important.\u201d I knew what it was about\u2014our mounting bills, the insurance forms I\u2019d been avoiding, the way we\u2019d both been skirting around the truth. Honesty was what we promised each other, but lately, I\u2019d been too tired to face it head-on. \n\nJust then, my regular client, Mrs. Lee, settled into my chair, her usual smile in place. \u201cCould you trim just a bit more off the fringe?\u201d she asked, voice gentle. I nodded, but my mind was racing. As a hairdresser, I prided myself on making every client feel heard and happy, no matter what was happening in my own life. I needed to focus, to listen, to make sure she left satisfied. \n\nBut the weight of my other role pressed in. I was supposed to be open and present for my spouse, to have that hard conversation tonight. Yet right now, Mrs. Lee needed my full attention. I felt torn, the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
