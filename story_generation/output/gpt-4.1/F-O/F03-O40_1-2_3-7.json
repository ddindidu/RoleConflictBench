Grandpa\u2019s expecting you to help with the prayers.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family traditions. I glanced at my workbench, scattered with tools and wood shavings. The homeowner\u2019s call echoed in my mind\u2014her deck was splintered and unsafe, and she needed it fixed before her guests arrived tomorrow. As a carpenter, I took pride in my work, knowing people relied on me to keep their homes safe and beautiful. But the deck would take hours to repair, and if I started now, I\u2019d miss the family gathering.
