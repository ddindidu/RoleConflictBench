She looked up at me, her small hands clutching a stuffed bear, waiting for my approval. Just then, my phone buzzed urgently\u2014an alert from the construction site. The evacuation alarm had gone off. My supervisor\u2019s message was clear: everyone must report to the muster point immediately, no exceptions. My heart pounded. I was supposed to be a model worker, never ignoring safety protocols or delaying in an emergency. But here I was, torn between guiding my daughter through her lesson in discipline and dropping everything to fulfill my duty at work. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides. My daughter\u2019s eyes searched mine for reassurance, while my mind raced with the consequences of failing my team. I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
