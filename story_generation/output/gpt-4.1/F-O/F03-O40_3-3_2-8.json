She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, if I was warm enough, if I\u2019d remembered to call Auntie about her birthday. I\u2019d always made it a point to reply quickly, to keep our daily conversations going\u2014she said it made her feel close to me, even though I\u2019d moved out years ago. But right now, I was kneeling in the crawlspace of a client\u2019s house, flashlight in one hand, poking at beams that crumbled under my touch. The termite damage was worse than I\u2019d thought, and the homeowner was hovering anxiously, waiting for my assessment. I knew I needed to focus, to draft a repair plan before the damage got any worse. But my phone kept buzzing, each vibration a reminder of my promise to my parents. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing against the urgency of my work. My mind raced, caught between the comfort of family and the responsibility of my craft, unsure which demand to answer first."}
