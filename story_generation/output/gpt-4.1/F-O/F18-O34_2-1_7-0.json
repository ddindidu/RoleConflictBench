The airspace was calm, almost eerily so, and I let myself relax for a moment. That\u2019s when my phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother, already up, was outside, helmet in hand, texting me about the new skateboard trick he was about to try on the old, cracked ramp behind our house. He wanted me to watch, maybe film it, just in case he finally landed it. I could picture him, grinning, fearless, but I also knew how dangerous that ramp was. As his sibling, I felt a surge of worry, the urge to rush out and make sure he was safe, to be there if he fell. But as an air traffic controller, I was tethered to my post, responsible for the sky, even if it was empty for now. My supervisor expected vigilance, no matter how quiet the shift. I stared at the radar, my brother\u2019s message glowing on my phone, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to the skies, heart pounding as I weighed which role I could not let down."}
