It was Sunday evening\u2014our usual time to talk. She expected me to call, to share how my week had gone, to ask about Dad\u2019s health, to be present as a daughter. But my mind was elsewhere, tangled in the details of a contested motion scheduled for tomorrow morning. My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I needed every spare moment to review evidence, anticipate arguments, and prepare for court. I could almost hear my client\u2019s anxious voice, counting on me to fight for them, to be the advocate they needed. Yet, I also pictured my stepmother\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t call, her gentle reminders about family and connection. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my professional focus, the other my emotional presence. My thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding, torn between the courtroom and the living room, between duty and love, not knowing which expectation I would let down tonight."}
