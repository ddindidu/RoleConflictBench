My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a text from my stepdad, just checking in. He and Mom always said it was important to keep in touch, especially on weekends when I was busy. I knew they worried, wanted to feel included in my life, and I\u2019d promised to text back whenever I could. \n\nBut as I glanced at the message, I caught a glimpse of a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on the water, to be ready to jump in at any second. I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in\u2014my family expecting a quick reply, my job demanding unwavering attention. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the need to reassure my parents and the responsibility to protect the swimmers. I gripped the phone tightly, caught in the moment, unsure which role to answer first."}
