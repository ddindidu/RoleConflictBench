He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. As a mother, I knew I had to be there for him, to understand what happened, to show him that his actions had consequences but that I was still on his side. I imagined his anxious face, waiting for me to walk through the school doors.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the safety audit at work. As the lead engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every document was up to date, every protocol followed. The audit wasn\u2019t until next week, but I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d review the new compliance checklist today. They depended on me to catch mistakes before the auditors did.\n\nI felt torn, pulled by the urgent need to support my child and the professional responsibility to my team. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my care. I sat at my desk, the weight of expectation pressing down, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
