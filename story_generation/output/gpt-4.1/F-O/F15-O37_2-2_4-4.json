I glance at the cleaning supplies aisle, remembering that Mrs. Lee\u2019s floor cleaner is almost gone, and I promised her I\u2019d make sure everything was stocked before my next visit. I\u2019m mentally calculating how much I can carry when I hear my son\u2019s laughter echoing down the aisle. He\u2019s darting between displays, weaving dangerously close to a pyramid of canned beans. Other shoppers are starting to stare, some with disapproving frowns. I know I should stop him, teach him about respect and discipline, but my hands are full, and my mind is split. If I don\u2019t grab the right cleaner now, I\u2019ll have to make another trip, and I can\u2019t afford to let my client down. But if I ignore my son\u2019s behavior, am I failing as a parent? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good mother and a responsible cleaner, unsure which demand to answer first."}
