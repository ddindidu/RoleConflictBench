My phone buzzes with a message from my son: \u201cDid you get the Nintendo yet? You promised.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014stores close in an hour. My heart tightens. I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to this, how I promised him after months of saving, wanting to give him something special, something normal. But the grant that funds my research is on the line, and if I miss this submission, our financial stability could be at risk. My mind races with the weight of both worlds: the scientist in me knows the importance of accuracy and timeliness, the mother in me aches not to disappoint my child. I feel the pressure mounting, the expectations of my colleagues and my family pulling me in opposite directions, and I sit frozen, torn between the lab and the living room, between duty and love."}
