I know it\u2019s my stepmom\u2014she expects me to check in every day, to share how my shift is going, to reassure her that I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve done since I moved in, a ritual that keeps us close. But right now, I\u2019m sitting beside Mrs. Carter, who\u2019s just come out of surgery. Her hands tremble as she clutches the blanket, eyes darting to the door every time someone passes. She needs me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. I can see the fear in her face, and I know how much it helps when I just sit quietly and talk with her. My phone vibrates again, and I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I don\u2019t reply soon, my stepmom will worry, maybe even call the nurse\u2019s station. I want to be there for both of them, but I can\u2019t split myself in two. My heart pounds as I stare at the unread messages, torn between the family I promised to keep close and the patient who needs me right now."}
