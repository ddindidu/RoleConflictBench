She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the weight I carried home from the pharmacy. But my mind was still tangled in the memory of the patient I\u2019d counseled just hours before\u2014a man juggling a handful of high-risk medications, each with its own dangers. I\u2019d spent nearly an hour with him, explaining every interaction, every side effect, making sure he understood. That was my duty as a pharmacist: to protect, to inform, to be thorough.\n\nNow, as my wife waited for me to let her in, I felt the pull of both worlds. She needed honesty, vulnerability, a partner who didn\u2019t hide behind professional walls. But I was exhausted, my thoughts still with my patient, worried I\u2019d missed something crucial. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014her need for connection, my responsibility to my patients. I stared at my plate, torn, unsure which part of me to give voice to first."}
