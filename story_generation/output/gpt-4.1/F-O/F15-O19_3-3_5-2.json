Just an hour ago, I\u2019d caught my son slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the grocery store. The look in his eyes\u2014guilt, fear, confusion\u2014haunted me. As his parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and firmness. But now, I was at work, staring at a chemotherapy prescription, double-checking every calculation, every label. The pharmacist in me knew that a single distraction could mean a life-threatening mistake for my patient. My phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cHe\u2019s crying. What should I do?\u201d My heart ached to rush home, to comfort and correct my son, to be the parent he needed. But the weight of the prescription in my hands reminded me that someone else\u2019s life depended on my focus. I felt torn, pulled by the urgent needs of my child and my patient, both expecting my undivided attention, both deserving it. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, as I tried to steady my breath and decide what to do next."}
