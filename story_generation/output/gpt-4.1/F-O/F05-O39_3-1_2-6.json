She needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014now more than ever. Her father\u2019s illness had shaken her to the core, and every night she reached for my hand, searching for comfort, for someone to lean on. I wanted to be there, to listen, to reassure her that we\u2019d get through this together.\n\nBut at work, a new notice had gone up: an optional training session next week, right after our shift. The foreman made it clear that those who attended would be first in line for overtime and new projects. The guys were already talking about how important it was to show up, to prove you\u2019re committed. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I missed it, I\u2019d be letting the team down, maybe even risking my spot on the next big job.\n\nI stared at the calendar, the training circled in red, the same night my wife had her father\u2019s specialist appointment. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
