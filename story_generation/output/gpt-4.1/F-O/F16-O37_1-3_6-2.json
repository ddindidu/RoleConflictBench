My partner poured us both a cup of tea, their eyes warm and expectant. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d they asked, voice gentle. I wanted to tell them about the exhaustion in my bones, the endless scrubbing, the way my knees ached from kneeling on hard tiles. But as I glanced around, I noticed a streak on the window, dust gathering in the corners, and I remembered the supervisor\u2019s words: \u201cEvery surface spotless, every time.\u201d I knew I should open up, share my feelings, let my spouse in. That\u2019s what they wanted\u2014honesty, connection. But the thought of admitting I hadn\u2019t finished the deep clean gnawed at me. If I confessed, would they see me as failing at home too? My mind spun between the urge to be honest and the pressure to be perfect, my heart caught in the tug-of-war between being a good partner and a diligent cleaner."}
