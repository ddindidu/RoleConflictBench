My supervisor always emphasized the importance of keeping everything in perfect order, even the pool chairs. I noticed a few were slightly misaligned, not enough to be dangerous, but enough to catch my eye. At the same moment, my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you! Don\u2019t be late for the family photo.\u201d Today was our annual holiday celebration, and everyone expected me to be there, smiling and present, not distracted by work. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important these moments were. But the lifeguard in me couldn\u2019t ignore the expectation to maintain the facility, to make sure everything was just right. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility of my job, both demanding my attention at the same time."}
