My stepmom looked at me expectantly, waiting for my input. \u201cYou\u2019re always so busy,\u201d she said, nudging me gently. I knew she wanted me to be present, to help choose between hiking or a movie, to laugh and be part of the family. But my mind kept drifting to the construction site, the emails piling up, the contractor who needed my approval by Monday. I glanced at my phone, checking the project timeline again, making sure nothing was slipping. My boss expected me to keep everything on track, to be the reliable architect who never let details slide. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I focused on work, I\u2019d disappoint my family; if I joined in fully, I risked missing something important at the office. My heart pounded as I tried to balance both worlds, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides."}
