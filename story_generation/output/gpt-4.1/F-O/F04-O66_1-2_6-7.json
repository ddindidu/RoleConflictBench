It\u2019s been ages.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how much she valued these little get-togethers, how we\u2019d promised to include each other more, to build the kind of respect that comes from simply showing up. But as I pulled up to the curb, two travelers flagged me down, their arms waving, suitcases piled at their feet. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I hesitated, knowing that as a taxi driver, I was expected to be professional, to help with luggage, to make every customer feel welcome and cared for. My sister\u2019s message buzzed again, a gentle reminder of my promise to her. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my family expecting my presence, my job demanding my attention. My hands hovered over the steering wheel, heart thumping, torn between the pull of family and the call of duty."}
