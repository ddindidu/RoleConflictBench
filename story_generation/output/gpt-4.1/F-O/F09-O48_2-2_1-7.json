The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was about to start, and she had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she mentioned showing me her artwork. I promised her I\u2019d be there, and I could almost hear her little voice in my head, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d But as I turned away from the clock, I saw Mr. Lee, my patient, shifting restlessly in his hospital bed. He\u2019d just come out of surgery yesterday, and his hands trembled as he tried to reach for the call button. His eyes met mine, wide and uncertain, and I knew he needed someone to sit with him, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. My supervisor had reminded me earlier how important it was to provide emotional support, especially for patients like Mr. Lee. I stood frozen, torn between the classroom where my daughter waited and the hospital room where Mr. Lee needed me, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, demanding more than I could give."}
