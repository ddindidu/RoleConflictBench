The line stretched past the candy racks, and my manager had already warned us about keeping things moving during the lunch rush. Each beep of the scanner felt like a countdown. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014a reminder about my stepson\u2019s open class at school. He\u2019d asked me twice this week if I\u2019d be there, his eyes hopeful, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d try. But now, with the store packed and my shift not ending for another hour, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Customers expected cheerful small talk and quick service, but my mind kept drifting to the school gym, picturing my stepson searching the crowd for my face. I forced another smile, but inside, I was torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, dreading the disappointment I might cause no matter what I chose."}
