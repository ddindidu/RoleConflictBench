My mother moved quietly, her eyes shadowed with worry. They\u2019d both been working longer hours, and the house felt heavier with their exhaustion. I wanted to reach out, to sit with them, to offer comfort and listen\u2014just be present, as they\u2019d always hoped I would be. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder about the jury trial starting tomorrow. My client\u2019s future depended on me, and the court had made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. I was expected to be sharp, focused, and fully committed in that courtroom. The weight of my parents\u2019 silent plea for support pressed against the unyielding demands of my profession. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, as I tried to figure out how to be the child they needed and the lawyer my client deserved."}
