My wife was on the couch, scrolling through her phone, her shoulders a little tense. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual. She nodded, not making a big deal of it, but I could tell she needed me to sit beside her, to listen, maybe hold her hand. That\u2019s what she always says helps\u2014just being there, being present.\n\nBut my mind raced back to the training at work: \u201cAlways remove your uniform and sanitize before interacting with anyone at home.\u201d I hadn\u2019t had time to shower yet, and my hands felt raw from the constant scrubbing, but I still worried about invisible germs. I wanted to comfort her, to be the supportive husband she needed, but the cleaner in me screamed about protocols, about not risking her health. I stood there, torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to honor first."}
