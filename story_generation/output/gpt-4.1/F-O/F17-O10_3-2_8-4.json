As an accountant, I knew the company\u2019s quarterly filing was due next week, and every minute counted. My mind raced with numbers, deductions, and compliance checklists. Suddenly, my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She began to talk about her worries\u2014Dad\u2019s health, the bills piling up, her own sense of helplessness. She looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of emotional support a child should give. I felt her need, the weight of her vulnerability, and guilt pricked at me for even glancing at my laptop. But the pressure from work was relentless; mistakes could mean penalties for the company, and my reputation was on the line. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my mother\u2019s pain and my professional obligations. I wanted to be fully present for her, but the numbers and deadlines wouldn\u2019t wait. I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
