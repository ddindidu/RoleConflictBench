The speaker\u2019s voice echoed through my headphones, discussing the latest updates in diabetes management\u2014information I needed to keep my license and stay sharp for my patients. Just then, my granddaughter, Emma, wandered in, her face clouded with uncertainty. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when you started something new? I\u2019m nervous about high school.\u201d I could see she needed more than a quick answer; she wanted the kind of wisdom only a grandparent could give, the kind that comes from years of living. But the conference was at a critical point, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss the session. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the professional duty that kept me relevant and the family role that made me feel whole. I looked at Emma, then at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
