She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her excitement. My daughter had already texted, reminding me to call and congratulate her, to keep the family close and show support. I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was almost over. Just then, a customer approached, asking about over-the-counter pain relief. I knew I should take the time to counsel her properly, as my role demands, but my mind was half with my family, picturing my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face, waiting for my call. The expectation to be present for my family tugged at me, but so did my responsibility to my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
