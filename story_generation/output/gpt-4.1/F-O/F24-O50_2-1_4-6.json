Don\u2019t be late, Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter from the kitchen, the clatter of plates, the warmth of being included. I wanted to be there, to show I cared, to prove I was part of this family, not just an outsider.\n\nBut just as I was about to grab my jacket, my work phone buzzed. It was a new client, nervous and apologetic, asking if I could walk them through the basics of their new machine. \u201cI just want to make sure I\u2019m doing it right,\u201d they said, their voice tinged with anxiety. I knew how much a little guidance could mean, how a few minutes of my time could save them hours of frustration.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the laughter waiting for me in the dining room and the responsibility I felt toward my client. Both sides expected me to show up, to be present, to care. I felt the weight of their hopes pressing in, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
