I can hear him pacing, waiting for me to finish work, hoping I\u2019ll come sit beside him and listen. But on my screen, a call blinks through. I answer, and immediately, a customer\u2019s angry voice fills my ear, demanding to know why our offer is legitimate, firing off questions I\u2019m expected to handle with patience and professionalism.
