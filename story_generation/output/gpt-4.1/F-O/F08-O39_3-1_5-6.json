My daughter called earlier, her voice trembling\u2014my grandson had a fever that wouldn\u2019t break, and she needed me. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be there, to hold his hand, to reassure my daughter that everything would be alright. But at the same time, a notice from the site manager sat in my lunchbox: an optional training session next week, the kind that could mean more hours or even a safer job if I attended. The crew expected me to show up, to prove I was committed, not just another old-timer who couldn\u2019t keep up. I could almost hear the foreman\u2019s voice, reminding us how important it was to be a team, to take every chance to learn. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds\u2014my family needed me, but so did my job. I stared at the notice, torn between the warmth of my grandson\u2019s small hand and the cold certainty of the construction site."}
