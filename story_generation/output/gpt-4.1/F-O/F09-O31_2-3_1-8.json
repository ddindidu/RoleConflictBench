She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll come, Mom?\u201d she\u2019d pleaded, her eyes wide with hope. I\u2019d promised, of course. But this morning, just as I was packing her lunch, my phone buzzed with a message from the station: I was needed in court to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. The hearing was scheduled for the exact same time as the open class. As a police officer, I knew my testimony was crucial\u2014justice depended on it, and I was expected to act with integrity, to be there when called. But as a mother, I was expected to show up, to be present for my child\u2019s big moment. My heart twisted as I imagined her scanning the crowd, searching for my face. I felt torn in two, pulled by the weight of both uniforms I wore\u2014one blue, one invisible, but just as heavy."}
