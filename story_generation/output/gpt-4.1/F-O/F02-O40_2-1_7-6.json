She looked at me with hope, asking if I could fix it. I examined the toy, running my fingers over the cracked wheels, and thought about the time and materials it would take. My mind drifted to my own family\u2014my wife had reminded me that morning that we were running low on groceries, and the bills were piling up. I needed every job to count, every quote to be fair but enough to keep us afloat. The boy\u2019s eyes were wide, waiting for me to promise his train would run again. I felt the weight of my roles pressing in: as a father, I knew what it meant for a child to lose a beloved toy, but as a provider, I couldn\u2019t afford to undercharge. My heart tugged in two directions as I opened my mouth to speak, caught between compassion and necessity."}
