As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My shift starts in a few hours, and I need to be at my best, both for myself and for the people I protect. Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d I could hear the worry in her voice even through the text. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be facing something serious. My heart pulled me toward her, wanting to offer the guidance and comfort only a grandfather can give. But the clock was ticking, and if I missed my workout, I\u2019d be letting down my team\u2014and myself. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I stood in the hallway, torn, keys in one hand and phone in the other, feeling the impossible tug of two worlds I loved."}
