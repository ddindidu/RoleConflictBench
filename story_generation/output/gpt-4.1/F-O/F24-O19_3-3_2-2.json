The dosage was precise, the margin for error nonexistent. My mind kept drifting to the text I\u2019d just received from my stepbrother\u2014he\u2019d gotten terrible news about our dad\u2019s health, and he was falling apart. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen, to comfort, to drop everything if he needed me. But right now, I was a pharmacist, and the patient waiting for this medication depended on my full attention. My phone buzzed again, his messages growing more desperate. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the expectation to be the steady sibling he could lean on, and the responsibility to ensure this medication was perfect. My heart ached to call him, to reassure him, but my mind screamed that even a moment\u2019s distraction could be catastrophic. I stared at the prescription, torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
