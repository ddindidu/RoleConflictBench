My younger sister was animatedly describing her idea for a family hiking trip this weekend, and everyone was chiming in with suggestions. I knew how much these moments meant to my family\u2014they always expected me to be present, to laugh and plan with them. But as I tried to focus on the conversation, my mind kept drifting to the email notification I\u2019d just seen: a client needed clarification on a confusing invoice, and they were waiting for my response. As an accountant, I was expected to be prompt and thorough, especially with clients who could easily take their business elsewhere. My dad looked at me, expecting my input on the hiking route, while my phone vibrated again, reminding me of my professional responsibility. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being the attentive sibling my family wanted and the reliable accountant my client needed. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t satisfy both expectations at once."}
