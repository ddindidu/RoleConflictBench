The family gathering was circled in red on the calendar, a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They\u2019d been looking forward to it, and so had I\u2014stories, laughter, the warmth of being together. But here I was, boots caked in dust, sweat trickling down my back, standing on the construction site. As I wiped my brow, I caught sight of Joe, a new guy, wandering dangerously close to a suspended load. My gut twisted. I knew the rules\u2014safety first, always. If I didn\u2019t shout, he could be hurt, or worse. But if I did, I\u2019d miss my bus, and the family would be waiting, disappointed again. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My voice caught in my throat, torn between the call of family and the duty to protect my coworker."}
