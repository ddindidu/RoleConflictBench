She\u2019s been with our company for years, and now she\u2019s questioning every detail of the offer I\u2019m supposed to sell. My manager expects me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call going, to not let a customer slip away. I\u2019m searching for the right words, my mind racing, when my phone buzzes with a message from Mom: \u201cJust checking in, hope you\u2019re okay. Love you.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last text from two days ago. Guilt tugs at me\u2014she just wants to know I\u2019m alright, to hear from her son, even if it\u2019s just a quick hello. But the customer\u2019s voice sharpens, demanding answers, and I know my supervisor is listening in. I feel split in two, the pressure mounting from both sides. I want to reassure my mom, but I can\u2019t lose focus on the call. My thumb hovers over my phone, my mind torn between the demands of being a good son and a reliable employee."}
