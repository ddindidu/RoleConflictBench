My shift was steady, the usual hum of voices in my headset, and a commercial flight was about to cross into the neighboring sector. I was ready to coordinate the handoff, as expected\u2014no room for error in this job. Then my phone buzzed. It was my daughter, her voice trembling. Something serious had happened at home, and she needed me\u2014needed her mother, needed her children\u2019s grandmother. My heart twisted. I could picture my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, the way they look for comfort in my arms. But here, in this tower, dozens of lives depended on my focus. The expectation was clear: I had to keep the skies safe, work with my team, and ensure every plane moved smoothly. Yet, the pull of family was just as strong, the need to be present, to offer love and support. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and for a moment, I just sat there, caught between the radar\u2019s steady beeping and the echo of my daughter\u2019s plea."}
