They\u2019d been talking for weeks about how we needed to honor our customs, and tonight\u2019s meal was a big part of that. But as I glanced at the stack of packages in my van, my heart pounded faster. One of them was a box of urgent medical supplies, marked for delivery to the hospital by 6:00 p.m. sharp. The hospital staff had stressed how crucial it was for patient care, and my supervisor had warned me that any delay could have serious consequences. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me at the table, my job demanding I be on the road. My hands trembled as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the pull of tradition and the responsibility of my work, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
