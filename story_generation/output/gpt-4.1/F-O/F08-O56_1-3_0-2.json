It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d My heart ached to give her the time and wisdom she needed, to sit her down and share stories of my own uncertain beginnings. But just then, the bell above the door jingled. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids swept in, faces flushed with nerves, glancing at their watches. I could see the expectation in their eyes\u2014they needed reassurance, a calm presence, someone to make them feel beautiful and at ease before the big moment. My granddaughter\u2019s question echoed in my mind, but the salon was suddenly alive with demands: warm greetings, gentle hands, soothing words. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on me, each expecting my full attention, my best self. My hands hovered over the phone, my eyes flicked to the anxious bridal party, and I felt the familiar ache of wanting to be everything to everyone, all at once."}
