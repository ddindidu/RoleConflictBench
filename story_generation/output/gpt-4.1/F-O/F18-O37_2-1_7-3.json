Glancing out the window, I saw my younger brother, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp with his skateboard. My heart skipped. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I had to finish the supply check before the delivery truck arrived\u2014if I missed anything, we\u2019d run out of essentials for the week, and I\u2019d get an earful from my supervisor.\n\nI could see him hesitating, then setting his board at the top of the ramp. My mind raced. If I ran outside now, I\u2019d leave the inventory incomplete and risk messing up my job. If I stayed, I might not be there to stop him from getting hurt. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own consequences. I stood frozen, torn between the clipboard in my hand and the brother I might need to protect."}
