Haven\u2019t seen you in ages!\u201d I stared at the screen, guilt prickling at my conscience. We\u2019d promised to make more time for each other, to not let work or life get in the way. She always included me in her plans, and I knew she expected the same from me. But my laptop chimed with another alert\u2014our production service was lagging, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged yesterday. My team was counting on me to fix it, to uphold the standards of clean, efficient code. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of reliability. My sister\u2019s message blinked on my phone, a reminder of the bond I was supposed to nurture. My code editor glared at me, demanding my attention. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which world I was about to disappoint."}
