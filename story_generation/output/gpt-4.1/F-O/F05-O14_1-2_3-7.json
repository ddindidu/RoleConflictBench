My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the lab safety audit is tomorrow morning. I remember the frayed wire on the centrifuge, the loose chemical labels, the checklist I haven\u2019t finished. If I don\u2019t fix these tonight, the whole lab could be written up, and my team will be furious. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I\u2019m expected to be a partner, to share the load, to show I care. At work, I\u2019m the responsible scientist, the one who keeps everyone safe. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both places need me now. My hands hover over the laundry, but my mind is already in the lab, picturing the equipment, the audit, the consequences. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice, torn between the person I love and the work I\u2019m trusted to do."}
