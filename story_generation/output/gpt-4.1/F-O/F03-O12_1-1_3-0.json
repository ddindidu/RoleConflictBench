My mother\u2019s voice floated down the hallway, reminding me that tonight was the annual family recipe night\u2014a tradition my grandparents started decades ago. I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially my parents, to see me there, kneading dough and sharing stories. But my mind kept drifting back to the code on my screen. I\u2019d finally gotten a generous deadline for the new module, a rare chance to refactor the messy legacy code I\u2019d inherited. If I started now, I could make real progress, maybe even impress my team with how clean and efficient I could make it. Yet, the thought of missing out on family tradition gnawed at me. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing against the quiet, persistent call of my professional pride. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart caught between the warmth of the kitchen and the glow of the monitor, unsure which world needed me more tonight."}
