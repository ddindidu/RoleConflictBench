My mind was on autopilot, counting change and bagging groceries, when I glanced out the wide front window and saw my little brother, Sam, on the sidewalk. He was fiddling with his phone, not paying attention, and I saw him step off the curb, right as a car was coming down the street. My heart leapt into my throat. As a sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, especially since Mom always said he was too distracted for his own good. But as a cashier, I was expected to stay at my post, keep the line moving, and not abandon my register. The customers were watching, waiting for me to finish their transactions. I could feel their impatience, but all I could see was Sam, oblivious, one step away from danger. My hands shook as I tried to decide what to do, torn between the demands of my job and the instinct to protect my brother."}
