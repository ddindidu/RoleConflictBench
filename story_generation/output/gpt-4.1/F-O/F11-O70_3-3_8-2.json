It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night\u2014something about me not listening, him feeling ignored. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew how important it was to show him respect, to be the sister who listens and helps mend things. But as I glanced at the insulated box in my hands, the hospital\u2019s address printed in bold, my heart pounded. The medical supplies inside were urgently needed, and I\u2019d been warned: any delay could put patient care at risk. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cOn time, every time.\u201d I stood there, torn, the weight of my brother\u2019s need for understanding pressing against the responsibility of my job. I wanted to be the sister who made things right, but I also couldn\u2019t let down the patients depending on me. My thumb hovered over the call button, my other hand gripping the delivery bag, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
