Just checking in. Love you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20145:12 a.m. The radar is calm, only a few blips moving steadily across the screen. I know Mom worries when I work these early shifts, and she expects a quick reply, just a simple \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d But as an air traffic controller, even in these quiet hours, I\u2019m supposed to be fully alert, eyes on the scope, ready for anything. The rules are clear: no distractions, not even for a moment. My thumb hovers over my phone, heart tugged by the familiar ache of wanting to reassure her. I can almost hear her voice, gentle but anxious, hoping for a sign that I\u2019m safe. At the same time, I feel the weight of my headset, the silent expectation that I\u2019ll catch any change in the airspace, no matter how small. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my attention, and for a moment, I\u2019m suspended between them, uncertain which call to answer first."}
