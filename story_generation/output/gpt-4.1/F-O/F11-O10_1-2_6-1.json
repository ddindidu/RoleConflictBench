My phone buzzed with a message from my younger sister: \u201cMovie night with everyone at 8! You\u2019re coming, right? Haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her that I join these outings\u2014she always said it made her feel included, like we were really close. I wanted to be the kind of sister who showed up, who built that mutual respect and connection. But the thought of leaving my work unfinished made my stomach twist. If I didn\u2019t finish tonight, I\u2019d risk making mistakes or missing the deadline, letting my team down. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart caught between the numbers on the screen and the laughter waiting for me just a few blocks away."}
