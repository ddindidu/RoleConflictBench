My next stop was the hospital, and the label was marked \u201curgent\u2014medical supplies.\u201d I knew the importance of being on time; a delay could mean someone wouldn\u2019t get the care they needed. As I started the engine, my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s been really down lately.\u201d My heart tightened. Jamie, my sweet grandson, always looked to me for advice, and I could tell from our last conversation that something was weighing on him. I wanted to be there, to offer the comfort and wisdom only a grandmother could give. But the hospital was across town, and traffic was unpredictable. If I stopped to call Jamie now, I might be late with the delivery. If I waited, I\u2019d miss the moment he needed me most. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn between the needs of my family and the demands of my job."}
