She\u2019d been restless all morning, her eyes darting to the door every time someone passed, her hands trembling as she clutched her blanket. I knew she needed me to sit with her, to reassure her that the pain would ease and she wasn\u2019t alone. But the message on my phone was from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. As a sister, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and support him the way we always promised we would. But as a nursing assistant, I was expected to be present for my patients, especially when they were scared and vulnerable. I stood in the hallway, torn between the two people who needed me, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which door to open first."}
