Dad wants to hear your voice.\u201d It\u2019s Thursday, our usual call night, and I know how much these weekly chats mean to them. They wait for my updates, ask about my health, and share little stories from home. But as I glance at my computer screen, my heart sinks. The external auditor\u2019s email sits at the top of my inbox, marked urgent. They need the quarterly financial statements by tomorrow morning, and I haven\u2019t even started reconciling the accounts. My manager expects nothing less than perfection\u2014no errors, no delays. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth of my parents\u2019 voices on the other end of the line, the cold precision of spreadsheets demanding my attention. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between dialing home and diving into numbers, my mind racing with guilt and anxiety as I wrestle with which role to honor first."}
