But as I drove my taxi through the city, the meter ticking, I knew I couldn\u2019t just pull over and make calls. My passengers expected a safe, smooth ride, and I was determined to follow every traffic law, especially with the roads so clear and tempting for a quick text at a red light. My heart tugged between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the duty I owed to my passengers and the rules of the road. The phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
