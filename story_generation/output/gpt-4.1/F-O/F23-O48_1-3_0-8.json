It was almost three, and I was supposed to pick up Mia and Lucas from school. Today was important\u2014their last day before summer break, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there, waiting with a smile. But as I turned to leave, Mrs. Evans, my patient, began to sob. She\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, and her hands trembled as she reached for mine. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d she whispered, her eyes pleading for comfort.
