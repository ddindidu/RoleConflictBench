My phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother, again. We\u2019d argued last night, and he wanted to talk, to patch things up. I knew I should be patient, listen, and show him respect, but my mind was split. At that moment, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cMayday, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My training kicked in, every second counted. I had to focus, give clear instructions, keep the skies safe. But my brother\u2019s message lingered in my mind, the weight of our strained relationship pressing on me.
