Mom answered, her voice a little tired, and I asked if everything was okay. She hesitated, then started telling me about Dad\u2019s recent doctor visit and how she\u2019s been feeling overwhelmed. I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the son she could lean on. As she spoke, I glanced over at the pool and noticed the lane rope was broken\u2014again. Swim lessons were starting soon, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids would be at risk, and my supervisor would be furious. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my mom\u2019s need for comfort, my duty to keep the pool safe. My phone grew hot in my hand as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
