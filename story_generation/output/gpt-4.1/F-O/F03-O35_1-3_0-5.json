My heart jumped. I glanced at the message, half-typed, thumb hovering over the send button. I knew my parents worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially on weekends. They always said, \u201cJust let us know you\u2019re okay.\u201d But now, the intercom crackled with urgency: \u201cMedical emergency in car three.\u201d I could already see passengers looking around, anxious, expecting me to act. My training kicked in\u2014safety first, immediate response, every second counts. But my phone buzzed again, a new message from my dad: \u201cEverything alright?\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed reassurance, but so did the people on my train. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the duty to my parents and the responsibility to my passengers, feeling the pressure of both roles collide inside me."}
