My stepson, Jamie, had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that honesty matters, even when it\u2019s hard. But as I listened to the manager\u2019s stern voice, my phone buzzed again\u2014my boss, reminding me that the new furniture order needed my attention. I was supposed to estimate materials and place the order before the supplier closed for the weekend. If I missed it, the whole project would be delayed, and my reputation as a reliable carpenter would take a hit. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014Jamie needed me to be present, to guide him through this mistake, but my work demanded my focus, too. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility of shaping a young life and the duty to my craft and clients. I stood in the parking lot, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
