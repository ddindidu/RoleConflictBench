As a mother, I knew my kids would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face, expecting me to be there like always. But as a lifeguard, I stared at the frayed lane rope floating in the water, knowing that if I didn\u2019t fix it now, the next swim lesson would be a mess\u2014maybe even unsafe. My supervisor always reminded us that equipment maintenance was non-negotiable, and I took pride in keeping things running smoothly. But my children\u2019s faces flashed in my mind, the disappointment if I was late, the worry if I didn\u2019t show. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. Should I grab the toolbox and get to work, or rush out the door to be the mom my kids needed? The minutes slipped away, and I stood frozen, torn between the pool and the schoolyard, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
