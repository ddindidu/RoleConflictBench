It would mean so much to your dad.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important these traditions were to my family, especially since I\u2019d joined them. They wanted me to step up, to show I belonged, to honor the rituals that made us whole. But my laptop pinged with another Slack notification\u2014QA had flagged the UI glitch again. It wasn\u2019t critical, but users were getting confused, and my manager expected a fix by tomorrow. I could almost hear his voice: \u201cWe need you on this, you\u2019re the only one who understands that module.\u201d \n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my family\u2019s hopes pressing on one shoulder, the responsibility to my team on the other. If I focused on the ceremony, I\u2019d let my colleagues down. If I dove into the code, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even widen the gap I\u2019d worked so hard to close. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
