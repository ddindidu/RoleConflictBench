Tonight was Mom\u2019s birthday, and she\u2019d made it clear how much it meant to her that we all be there for dinner. My phone buzzed with texts from my sister, reminding me not to be late. But as I walked my beat, I spotted a car parked illegally outside a busy restaurant. The driver was a regular in the neighborhood, always polite, and I knew he was just running in to pick up food for his elderly mother. Technically, I should issue a ticket, but I also had the discretion to let it slide, especially since it wasn\u2019t causing any harm. My radio crackled with updates, and I felt the minutes slipping away. If I stopped to write the ticket, I\u2019d be late for dinner\u2014again. If I let it go, was I compromising my duty? The pressure from both sides built up inside me, and I stood there, torn, the pen in my hand trembling as I weighed what mattered more in that moment."}
