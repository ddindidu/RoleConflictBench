She was anxious about starting high school, asking for advice on making friends and handling the pressure. I wanted to pause, to call her and share stories from my own youth, to reassure her that she was strong and capable. But just then, my next patient entered\u2014a young woman with a runny nose and a cough. She looked worried, convinced her symptoms were something more serious. As a doctor, I needed to focus, to listen carefully, to diagnose her accurately and provide reassurance based on evidence, not just comfort. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my granddaughter\u2019s message, the weight of her trust in me as her grandparent. I felt torn, pulled between the immediate needs of my patient and the emotional needs of my family. Both expected my full attention, my wisdom, and my care, but I only had one heart and two hands."}
