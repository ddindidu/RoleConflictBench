She looked at me with watery eyes, her voice trembling, and I knew how much she needed someone to simply listen. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my child\u2019s school. My heart dropped. The principal wrote that my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and they needed me to come in immediately to discuss the situation. I could almost hear my son\u2019s anxious voice, see his downcast eyes, and I knew he needed me, too. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s grip tightened, her loneliness palpable. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My child needed guidance and support, but so did Mrs. Carter. I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a present parent and a compassionate nursing assistant, my mind racing, my chest tight, not knowing which need to answer first."}
