My partner had mentioned, not unkindly, that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s game, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d take care of it after my shift. But now, standing behind the register at the store, I noticed a small discrepancy in the cash drawer\u2014just a few dollars off, nothing that would change the day\u2019s totals, but enough to catch my attention. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, and any irregularity reported immediately. My manager expected diligence, no matter how minor the issue seemed. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I stayed to sort out the register, I\u2019d be late getting home, and the laundry might not get done in time. If I left it for the next shift, I\u2019d be shirking my responsibility as a cashier. My mind raced, torn between the expectations at work and the promises I\u2019d made at home, anxiety tightening in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
