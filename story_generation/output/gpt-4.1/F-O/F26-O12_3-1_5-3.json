Her voice trembled\u2014something serious had happened, and she needed me to come over right away. As a grandmother, I knew my presence would bring comfort, maybe even stability, to my family in this moment. But as I hung up, a notification popped up: the product team\u2019s big brainstorming session was about to start. It was technically optional, but I knew how much my input mattered. We were about to define the next set of features, and my experience could shape the direction. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, the missed opportunity to collaborate and contribute. My heart ached, torn between the urgent need to be with my family and the professional expectation to be a team player. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
