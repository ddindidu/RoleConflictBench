Everyone gathered in the living room, eyes bright with anticipation. My heart swelled\u2014these were the moments I cherished as a grandparent, being present for milestones and memories. But my phone buzzed insistently. It was a reminder: my next client would be arriving at the salon in ten minutes. As a hairdresser, I prided myself on professionalism, always following the routine\u2014wash, condition, then cut.
