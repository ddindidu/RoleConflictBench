It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I glanced at the address on the package\u2014just a few blocks away, but the instructions were clear: \u201cLeave at door, confirm with photo, do not leave unattended if possible.\u201d The company had been strict lately; one missed delivery and I\u2019d be written up. But my granddaughter\u2019s words echoed in my mind. She was counting on me, needing the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give. I felt the weight of both uniforms I wore\u2014one with a name tag, the other invisible but just as real. The clock on the dashboard ticked louder. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the responsibility to my job and the responsibility to my family, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
