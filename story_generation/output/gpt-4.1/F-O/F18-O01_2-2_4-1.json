Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much it meant to everyone that I show up. Family dinners were rare these days, and I knew how much my presence mattered. But on my desk, blueprints sprawled out, red circles marking areas of concern. The contractor was waiting for my review before moving forward, and I\u2019d just spotted a potential safety hazard in the stairwell design. If I didn\u2019t address it now, the crew might proceed, risking not only compliance but people\u2019s safety. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a call from the site manager, his tone urgent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth and expectation of my family, the responsibility and pressure of my profession. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role I couldn\u2019t let down tonight."}
