As a mother, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability, and every shift as a housekeeping cleaner mattered. Today, I arrived at work exhausted, but determined. My supervisor reminded us again about the new safety and hygiene protocols\u2014gloves, masks, sanitizing every surface, no shortcuts. I knew how important it was, especially with the recent health scares, but the extra steps slowed me down. If I didn\u2019t finish my assigned rooms on time, I risked losing hours, maybe even my job. But if I rushed and skipped steps, I\u2019d be putting myself and others at risk\u2014and breaking the rules. My mind raced: my son\u2019s school fees, groceries, the looming loan. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s laughter at home, and I wanted to keep that roof over her head. But the pressure to follow every protocol perfectly pressed in on me, too. My hands trembled as I reached for the gloves, torn between doing what was right for my family and what was right for my job."}
