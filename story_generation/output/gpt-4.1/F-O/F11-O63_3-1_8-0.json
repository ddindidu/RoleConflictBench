He\u2019d sent a long message, upset about something I\u2019d said last night. As a sister, I knew I should call him, listen, and clear things up\u2014he deserved my respect and honesty. But as a telemarketer, I had to answer the call, stick to the script, and handle any objections smoothly. The customer on the line was polite but confused, asking questions I\u2019d answered a hundred times before. My mind kept drifting to my brother\u2019s words, the tension between us, and the urge to fix it right away. I felt torn\u2014my job demanded focus and patience, but my heart ached to be the sister he needed. The expectation to be professional clashed with my need to be present for my family. I stared at the blinking cursor on my phone, caught between the call in my ear and the message on my screen, unsure which role to answer first."}
