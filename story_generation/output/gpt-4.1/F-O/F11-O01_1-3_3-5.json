My family\u2019s voices swirled in the background, laughter and suggestions filling the air as they discussed weekend plans. My younger brother nudged me, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us to the lake, right?\u201d My mother looked over, her eyes hopeful, expecting me to join in, to be present, to be a good sister.\n\nBut my mind was tangled in the hospital wing design due Monday. I could see the layout in my head\u2014operating rooms, emergency routes, every detail needing my attention. The project manager\u2019s email echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need your revisions by Sunday night.\u201d The weight of responsibility pressed on me; lives could depend on my work.\n\nI wanted to be there for my family, to laugh and relax, but the demands of my job pulled me in the opposite direction. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to focus on both conversations, feeling like I was failing at both. The voices around me faded as I stared at my screen, torn between being the sister they needed and the architect I was expected to be."}
