He asked about my shift, his eyes gentle, expecting me to share, to let him in. I wanted to tell him everything, to be the open, communicative wife he deserved. But my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. A woman had fallen, broken her arm, and I was needed immediately. As I grabbed my keys, my husband\u2019s voice followed me, soft but insistent, \u201cAre you okay? You never really talk about work anymore.\u201d I felt the weight of his expectation, the need to be present, to share my burdens. But as an ambulance driver, I had to focus, to be calm and professional, ready to provide care and comfort to a stranger in pain. My mind raced, torn between the urge to stay and talk, and the duty to rush out and help. The door closed behind me, and I stood for a moment, heart pounding, caught between the demands of the woman waiting for my help and the man waiting for my words."}
