My mom had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, to show I was really part of the family now. I wanted to be present, to laugh and share stories, to prove I belonged. But as I was about to leave, my work phone vibrated. A customer was calling, her voice tense as she asked about her missing package\u2014one I was supposed to deliver hours ago. I could hear the disappointment in her tone, and I knew I had to respond with patience and professionalism, even as my mind raced with worry about the family waiting for me. My boss expected me to handle every issue with care, no matter what. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me not to let them down. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
