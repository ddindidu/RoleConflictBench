My last client, a first-time visitor, stared at her reflection, lips pressed tight. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected,\u201d she said, voice trembling. I felt my stomach twist\u2014she was clearly unhappy, and I knew I had to fix it, reassure her, make her feel heard. That\u2019s what a good hairdresser does. But my phone kept vibrating in my pocket. I\u2019d seen the messages from home: my stepdad was having a rough day, and Mom sounded exhausted on the phone earlier. I was supposed to be there for them, to listen, to help lighten the mood, especially now when things were tense at home.
