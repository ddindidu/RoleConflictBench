She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d promised her I would come, just this once, even if it meant swapping shifts or running on no sleep. But as the train rumbled into the next station, the emergency alarm blared, jolting me back to my other world. The intercom crackled with urgency\u2014a passenger needed help, and I was the only one who could respond quickly and keep everyone safe. My hands trembled as I reached for the radio, torn between the desperate call from the train and the silent plea from my daughter\u2019s classroom. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding all of me, right now."}
