As his sister, I knew how much it meant to him for me to be there, cheering him on, just as he had always done for me. But as I stood behind the pharmacy counter, a high-risk chemotherapy prescription landed in my hands. The label glared up at me, reminding me that even the tiniest mistake could have devastating consequences for the patient. My phone buzzed with messages from my brother, asking when I\u2019d arrive, and my heart twisted with guilt. I could almost hear my family\u2019s laughter in my mind, the clink of glasses, the warmth of being together. Yet, the weight of my responsibility as a pharmacist pressed down on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t rush, not with someone\u2019s life depending on my accuracy. Torn between the joy of being a supportive sister and the gravity of my professional duty, I felt the two worlds pulling me apart, each demanding more than I could give."}
