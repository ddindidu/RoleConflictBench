My sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She\u2019d just called me an hour ago, her voice trembling as she told me about the news\u2014something so heavy, I could hear her trying not to cry. I promised I\u2019d call her back soon, but now, staring at the contract, I felt torn. As a lawyer, I knew this document wasn\u2019t urgent, but I also knew my client expected thoroughness and professionalism, even for routine matters. Yet, as a sibling, I was supposed to be there for my sister, to listen, to comfort her, especially now. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention in different ways. My mind raced, guilt gnawing at me for even hesitating. I wanted to be the reliable lawyer my client trusted, but more than anything, I wanted to be the supportive sibling my sister needed. My hand hovered over the phone, heart pounding, caught between duty and love, unsure which role to answer first."}
