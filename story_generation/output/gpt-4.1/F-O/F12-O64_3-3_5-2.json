His tone was urgent\u2014my in-laws would arrive in a few hours, and the house was still a mess. He needed me to pick up groceries, help tidy the living room, and make sure the guest room was spotless. I felt the weight of his expectations pressing on me, the unspoken rule that I should help make everything perfect for our guests. But as I returned to my register, the end-of-day rush began. My manager reminded me that I\u2019d be handling the final cash count, and any mistake could throw off the books. Customers lined up, some with large purchases, and I forced myself to focus, knowing that even a small error could mean hours of reconciliation. My mind kept drifting home\u2014what if I forgot something important? What if my husband felt let down? I felt torn, my heart racing as I tried to balance the demands of being a reliable cashier and a supportive wife, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
