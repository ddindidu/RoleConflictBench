My patient, a teenager with flushed cheeks and a scratchy voice, waited for my diagnosis. I listened carefully, prescribed antibiotics, and offered reassurance, knowing my words carried weight. Yet, as I handed over the prescription, my phone buzzed with a message from home. My stepmother said Dad hadn\u2019t slept well again, and she sounded more tired than ever. I pictured them at the kitchen table, shadows under their eyes, waiting for me to come home and ask how they were, to listen and comfort. But here, I was the doctor\u2014expected to be calm, focused, and professional, not distracted by family worries. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my patients needed my expertise, my parents needed my heart. I felt torn, caught between the sterile certainty of medicine and the messy, aching needs of home, unsure which part of me should come first."}
