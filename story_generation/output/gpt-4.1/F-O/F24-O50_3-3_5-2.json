I knew how much this holiday trip meant to them\u2014how much it meant to her, especially, that I\u2019d join in, laugh, and belong. But just as I zipped my bag, my work phone rang. The hospital\u2019s biomedical engineer was frantic: a life-support machine in the ICU was failing, and they needed me to diagnose the fault codes immediately. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my new family, maybe confirm their fears that I\u2019d never really fit in. But if I ignored the call, a patient\u2019s life could hang in the balance. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding all of me, and I stood frozen, torn between the family I was trying to build and the lives I was trained to save."}
