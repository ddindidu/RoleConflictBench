My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my supervisor: \u201cProduction line down. Sensor error. Need you ASAP.\u201d I could picture the blinking red lights, the mounting pressure as every minute ticked by. But right now, my son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. Other shoppers stared. I felt their judgment, the silent expectation that I\u2019d step in, teach him respect and self-control. I wanted to kneel down, look him in the eye, and explain why we don\u2019t run indoors, why we respect shared spaces. But my mind raced with technical diagrams and error codes, the weight of the halted production line pressing on my shoulders. I gripped the cart, torn between the parent I needed to be and the technician everyone was waiting for, my heart pounding as I stood frozen in the aisle, caught between two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
