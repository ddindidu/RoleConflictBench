They weren\u2019t major\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger\u2014but as an architect, I knew the rules: every detail mattered, every line had to be perfect. My phone buzzed, and I saw my sibling\u2019s name flash on the screen. I hesitated, remembering the call earlier that day\u2014their voice trembling as they shared the difficult news, the kind that shakes your world and leaves you gasping for air. I knew what was expected of me: to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and support. But the plans in front of me demanded my attention, too. If I let these small errors slide, I\u2019d be betraying my professional standards. If I ignored my sibling, I\u2019d be failing them when they needed me most. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the weight of family and the responsibility of my work, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
