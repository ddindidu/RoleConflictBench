She\u2019d just snapped at her little brother, and I knew this was one of those moments where I needed to step in\u2014teach her about patience, kindness, and how we treat family. I opened my mouth to speak, but my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the pool: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed right away, the water could become unsafe for everyone. As a lifeguard, I knew the risks\u2014bacteria, cloudy water, accidents. My supervisor expected me to be there, to keep the facility safe for all the kids who\u2019d be swimming tomorrow. But right now, my own child needed me to be present, to guide her, to show her what it meant to be a good person. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention. My daughter\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for guidance, while my mind raced with images of the pool and the safety of dozens of children. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which role to answer first."}
