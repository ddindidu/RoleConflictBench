My stepson, Jamie, sat at the table, slouched and sullen, refusing to say \u201cplease\u201d when asking for breakfast. I knew I should sit with him, talk about respect and kindness, and guide him through these small but important lessons. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does\u2014teaches, listens, and helps shape a child\u2019s values. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The hospital needed me; my shift had started, and Mrs. Carter was waiting for her morning vitals. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be prompt, efficient, and attentive\u2014lives depended on it.
