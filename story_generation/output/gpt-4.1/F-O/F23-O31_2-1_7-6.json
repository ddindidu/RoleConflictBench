The meter had expired, but the car belonged to Mrs. Lee, a single mother who worked two jobs and always greeted me with a tired smile. I knew she struggled, just like my own family. My stepdaughter\u2019s school fees were due next week, and groceries were running low. The overtime from ticket quotas would help, but only if I kept my numbers up. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of every dollar, every bill, every expectation to provide. But as a police officer, I was supposed to be fair, to use discretion, to remember that the law wasn\u2019t just about punishment. My supervisor expected results, but my conscience whispered about compassion. I gripped the ticket, heart pounding, torn between the need to support my family and the duty to act with integrity. The clock on the dashboard ticked, and I still hadn\u2019t decided what to do."}
