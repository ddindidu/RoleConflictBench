My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that tonight\u2019s family gathering was not just dinner\u2014it was a celebration of our heritage, a tradition my family insisted we honor, especially now. I could hear my uncle recounting stories of our ancestors, and I knew they expected me to join, to listen, to show respect for the customs that shaped us.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with messages from my project manager. The client was waiting for my time estimates, and the contract\u2014months of work\u2014hung in the balance. My team needed my calculations tonight, not tomorrow. I felt the weight of their trust, the expectation that I would deliver precise numbers so the project could move forward.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s traditions and the cold urgency of my professional responsibility.
