Can we talk tonight?\u201d I knew they\u2019d been stressed lately, and I\u2019d promised to be more open and supportive, to really listen when they needed me. Just as I was about to reply, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, urgency in their voice. I saw the line of cabs behind me, the expectation to keep things moving, to be courteous and efficient. My mind raced\u2014if I took the time to help, I\u2019d be late getting home, and my spouse was counting on me to be present, to share and listen. But if I rushed, I\u2019d risk a complaint or a bad review, maybe even lose future fares. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my hands gripping the steering wheel as I tried to figure out who needed me more in that moment."}
