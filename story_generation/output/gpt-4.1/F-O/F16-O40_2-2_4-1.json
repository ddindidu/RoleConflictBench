My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d get it done, but my mind was already at the workshop, replaying the foreman\u2019s warning from this morning: \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep your area clean, someone\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d I knew he was right\u2014just last week, a stray nail nearly caused an accident. The pressure to keep my workspace spotless weighed on me, but so did the expectation at home. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I stayed to finish the laundry, I\u2019d be late to the site and risk a safety violation. If I left now, the family would be left scrambling in the morning. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility to put first, feeling the tug of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
