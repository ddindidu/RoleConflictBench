The safety briefing starts in two minutes, and I know the foreman expects everyone to be on time, no excuses. But here I am in the supermarket, my son darting between aisles, giggling as he weaves past startled shoppers. I feel the eyes of strangers on me, silently judging. As a mother, I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and teach him about respect and discipline\u2014how we behave in public, how we consider others. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cSafety briefing in 2 min.\u201d If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll let my team down, maybe even get written up. My mind races, torn between the mother who wants to guide her child and the worker who must be reliable and punctual. I call his name, voice tight, but he\u2019s already halfway down the next aisle. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands tremble as I weigh what to do next, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
