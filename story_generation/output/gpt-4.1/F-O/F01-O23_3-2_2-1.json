The purchase agreement needed my full attention\u2014every clause, every word, had to be scrutinized before the filing deadline. My client was counting on me to catch any oversight, and I knew the consequences of a mistake could be severe. Just as I reached for my pen, my phone buzzed. It was my grandson, his voice trembling as he asked if he could come over. He needed advice, he said\u2014something serious was weighing on him, and he trusted me to help him make sense of it. I could hear the hope in his voice, the expectation that I would offer the wisdom and comfort only a grandfather could provide. My heart ached, torn between the duty to my client and the love for my grandson.
