My partner\u2019s text from earlier echoes in my mind: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019m swamped.\u201d I promised I would, but now my headset buzzes, and the telemarketing dashboard blinks with reminders\u2014break in five minutes, back in ten, every second logged and monitored. If I step away outside my scheduled break, the compliance system will flag me, and I can\u2019t risk another warning. But if I don\u2019t fold the laundry, I\u2019ll be letting my partner down again, adding to the quiet tension that\u2019s been building at home. My heart pounds as I glance between the laundry and the screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I want to be reliable at work, but I also want to be a good partner. The minutes tick by, and I\u2019m frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations at home, unsure which responsibility to let down."}
