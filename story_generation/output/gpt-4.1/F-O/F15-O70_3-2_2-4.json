My heart sank as I read it\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in and discuss it immediately. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to understand what happened and show the school I took this seriously. But as I looked at the stack of packages in my van, I remembered the company\u2019s strict policy: all moderately valuable items needed a signature, and I was already running behind. Missing a delivery or failing to get a signature could mean a formal warning, maybe even losing my job. I could picture my supervisor\u2019s disappointed face, the customer complaints, the risk to my paycheck. But then I thought of my son, sitting in the principal\u2019s office, maybe scared or confused, needing his parent. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my child and the demands of my job, both urgent, both important, and I felt the pressure building as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
