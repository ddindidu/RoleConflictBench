My mind raced with the implications for our patients, the side effects, the dosing changes. I knew I needed to stay sharp, to keep up with every new release\u2014my patients depended on it. But across from me, my spouse sat quietly, stirring their tea, eyes distant. I\u2019d noticed their silence all week, the way they lingered in the hallway before work, the heaviness in their sighs. I wanted to reach out, to ask what was wrong, to be the partner who listened and shared. But the clock was ticking on my break, and I felt the pressure to finish reading before my shift resumed. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to close the newsletter and be present, and the professional voice insisting I couldn\u2019t fall behind. I looked up, meeting their eyes, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
