I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in his words, and I knew he needed me. As his sibling, I\u2019ve always tried to be there for him, especially when he\u2019s anxious. But at that moment, I was standing behind the pharmacy counter, a patient waiting in front of me with a new prescription for a complex medication. She looked nervous, clutching the bag, clearly needing reassurance and careful counseling about side effects and how to take it properly. My mind raced\u2014my brother expected my emotional support, my patient needed my professional guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention. My heart ached for my brother, but my responsibility as a pharmacist couldn\u2019t be ignored. I glanced at my phone, then at the patient, torn between the urge to comfort my sibling and the duty to care for someone else\u2019s health."}
