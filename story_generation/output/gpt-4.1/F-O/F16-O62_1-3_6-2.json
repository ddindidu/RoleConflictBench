My phone buzzed with a message from my spouse: \u201cCan we talk about your day when you get a break?\u201d I knew they valued our open conversations, the way we shared even the smallest details. But the beach was packed, high tide pulling at the edges, kids darting in and out of the surf. Every instinct screamed at me to keep my focus on the water, to not let my attention drift for even a second. Yet, I could hear my spouse\u2019s voice in my mind, hoping for a moment of connection, a sign that I cared enough to share. The expectation to be present for them tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to keep these swimmers safe. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to reply, to be the partner they needed, while knowing that one glance away could mean disaster."}
