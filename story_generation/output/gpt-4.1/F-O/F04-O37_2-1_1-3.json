It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week, and as her brother, I always tried to be there for her, especially when she reached out like this. But I was on the clock, and Mrs. Johnson had been clear\u2014she expected a full report on the supplies before noon. I glanced at the half-empty shelves, the list of items to check still long. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to drop everything and call my sister, to be the supportive brother she needed, and the pressure to finish my work, to be the reliable cleaner my employer depended on. I could feel the stress building, my mind racing with the weight of both responsibilities, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
