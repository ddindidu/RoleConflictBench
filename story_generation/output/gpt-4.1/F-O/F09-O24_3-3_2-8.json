My heart pounded\u2014every eye in the courtroom was on me, waiting for guidance. I knew I had to pause, review the new ruling, and ensure justice was served. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I saw a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, now, to address his behavior and support him through the consequences. As a mother, I felt a surge of worry and guilt\u2014my child needed me, and I was expected to be present, to guide him, to show him right from wrong. As a judge, I was responsible for upholding the law, for not letting personal matters interfere. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be unwavering. I stood there, torn, the courtroom silent, my son waiting, and I didn\u2019t know which part of myself to answer first."}
