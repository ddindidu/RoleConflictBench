The lines needed to be precise, the flow of the space functional, every inch accounted for. My mind was deep in the details\u2014where the light would fall, how the storage would tuck away neatly\u2014when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in and discuss it immediately.\n\nMy heart clenched. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions mattered, to help him understand right from wrong. But as an architect, I was on a tight deadline; this renovation was my chance to finally create a space that worked for me, and I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus now. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my child needed guidance, my work needed attention. I stared at the unfinished sketch, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which demand to answer first."}
