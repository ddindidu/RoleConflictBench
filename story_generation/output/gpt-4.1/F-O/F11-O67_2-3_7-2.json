We\u2019d been arguing\u2014again\u2014about my long hours and how I never seemed to listen. She wanted me to understand her frustrations, to be patient and see things from her side. I tried, I really did, but just as I was about to apologize, my pager blared: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported. My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. The expectation was clear\u2014drop everything, get to the scene, save lives. But my sister\u2019s eyes pleaded for me to stay, to finally put her first, just this once. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The world outside demanded my speed and focus, but here, at home, my sister needed my patience and understanding. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, her hand in the other, caught between the blaring siren of duty and the quiet ache of family."}
