She wanted me to be open, to share every worry and hope, to let her in on the numbers and the fears. I knew she needed that from me, needed to feel we were facing this together. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the plant manager. The old packaging machine, the one that only ran during slow periods, was acting up again. They needed me to come in, to figure out what was wrong before the next shift. I could already picture the blinking lights, the cryptic error codes, the pressure to fix it fast. My wife\u2019s voice pulled me back, gentle but insistent, asking if I was really listening. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be present and honest at home, and the expectation to be the problem-solver at work. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which demand to answer first."}
