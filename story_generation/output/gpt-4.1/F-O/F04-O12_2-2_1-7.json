I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. At the same time, my laptop screen was filled with error logs and urgent emails from QA\u2014users were hitting a bug that crashed our app, and my manager had just pinged me: \u201cNeed a fix ASAP. Users are getting frustrated.\u201d\n\nI stared at the two screens, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a brother, I was supposed to be there for my sister, especially when she was struggling. But as a software developer, I was expected to drop everything and fix critical issues before they spiraled out of control. My heart ached for my sister, but my mind raced with possible solutions for the bug. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. The pressure built inside me, and I sat frozen, caught between the demands of family and work, unsure which role to answer first."}
