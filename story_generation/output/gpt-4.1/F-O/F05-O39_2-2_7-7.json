She barely touched her toast, her eyes distant. I knew I should ask her what was wrong, open up about my own stress at the site, like we promised we would. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the safety briefing was about to start. Missing it would mean a warning, maybe worse, and the foreman had already given me a look last week for being late. My boots were by the door, and I could hear the guys gathering outside, their voices drifting through the window. I wanted to sit down, take her hand, and talk, but the clock was ticking. My heart pounded with the pressure\u2014be the supportive husband she needed, or the reliable worker my team depended on. I stood frozen, torn between the kitchen and the jobsite, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
