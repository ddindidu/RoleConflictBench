My heart skipped\u2014he\u2019d been talking about trying that new trick for weeks, and I\u2019d promised our parents I\u2019d keep an eye on him. But right now, I was in the middle of a colour appointment with a new client, Mrs. Patel, who was frowning at her reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected,\u201d she said, her voice tight. I could feel her disappointment, and I knew I needed to reassure her, maybe offer a toner or a redo. But my mind kept darting to Jamie, picturing him wobbling at the top of that ramp, no helmet in sight. I felt torn in two\u2014my hands wanted to reach for the colour chart, but my eyes kept flicking to the window, watching Jamie\u2019s every move. I could almost hear my parents\u2019 voices: \u201cLook out for him, please.\u201d But Mrs. Patel was waiting for my answer, her trust in my hands. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this moment."}
