My hands gripped the wheel, mind focused on the patient waiting for me\u2014chest pain, shortness of breath, the dispatcher said. Every second mattered. Then my phone buzzed in my pocket. Glancing down, I saw my granddaughter\u2019s name. I hesitated, but answered on speaker. Her voice trembled, \u201cGrandma, I need your advice. Something really bad happened at school. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My heart twisted. She never called me at work unless it was serious. I wanted to pull over, to listen, to offer the comfort and wisdom she expected from me. But the patient\u2014someone\u2019s parent, someone\u2019s grandparent\u2014was counting on me too, expecting me to arrive quickly, to help them breathe, to keep their heart beating. I could hear the fear in my granddaughter\u2019s voice, and I could feel the urgency of the siren. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My mind raced, torn between the two worlds I belonged to, knowing I could not give both what they needed at the same time."}
