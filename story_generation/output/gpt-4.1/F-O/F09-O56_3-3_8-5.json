My client glared at her reflection, her words sharp and loud enough for the other stylists to glance over. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for! I can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d she snapped. I felt the familiar knot in my stomach tighten. I needed her to leave satisfied, or at least not furious\u2014bad reviews meant fewer clients, and fewer clients meant less money. With the home loan repayment looming in two months, every tip, every appointment mattered. My mind raced with numbers and deadlines, but my heart ached for my son waiting at home, probably already in his pajamas, hoping I\u2019d be there to tuck him in. I wanted to comfort him, to be the mother he needed, but right now, I had to be the professional, calm hairdresser. The weight of both roles pressed down on me as I faced her in the mirror, searching for the right words, torn between my family\u2019s needs and my client\u2019s demands."}
