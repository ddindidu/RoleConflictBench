It was my sister, her voice trembling, \u201cCan you come? Mom\u2019s not doing well. I need you.\u201d I could hear the fear in her words, the kind that only a brother could understand. I promised I\u2019d be there, my mind already racing with ways to comfort her, to be the support she needed.\n\nBut before I could leave, my pager blared. The ICU needed me\u2014one of the life-support machines was flashing critical fault codes. The nurse\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe need you now.
