The lines blurred as my mind wandered to the living room, where my wife sat curled up on the couch, her eyes red from crying. She needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my presence. But the deadline for the renovation plan loomed, and my client expected a functional, thoughtful design by morning. I tried to focus on the layout, measuring the space for a compact desk, but guilt gnawed at me. Every minute spent on the sketch felt like a minute stolen from her, from the comfort I should be giving. Yet, if I left the drawing now, I\u2019d risk disappointing my client and jeopardizing my reputation. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. My pencil hovered, my heart torn, as I listened to the quiet sobs from the next room, unsure which role needed me more."}
