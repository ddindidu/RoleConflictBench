She\u2019d had a rough day at school\u2014her friends had left her out again, and she was coming home in tears. I knew she needed me; I\u2019d always promised to be there for her, to listen and help her through these moments. But as I glanced up from my phone, the passenger emergency alarm blared through the train. The intercom crackled with urgency: someone needed immediate medical attention in the next car. My training kicked in\u2014passenger safety was my top priority, and I was expected to respond quickly, to keep everyone calm and provide assistance. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds: my sister\u2019s pain waiting for me at home, and the crisis unfolding right in front of me. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
