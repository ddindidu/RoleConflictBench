The family group chat buzzed with messages about the gathering tonight\u2014my daughter reminding me to bring the old photo albums, my grandson asking if I\u2019d play chess with him. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there early, to help set up and spend some real time with everyone. But now, my passenger in the back seat, a young man with headphones, was heading to a meeting across town. He\u2019d booked me for a round trip, and though he said he had plenty of time, I knew traffic could be unpredictable. My dispatcher expected me to be reliable, to get every passenger to their destination safely and on time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family waiting for me, expecting laughter and stories, and my duty as a driver, to not let anyone down. My heart tugged in two directions as I watched the city lights blur past, wondering how I could possibly be in both places at once."}
