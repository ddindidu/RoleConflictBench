The courthouse is quiet, but my mind is anything but. I know I have to review every detail, every affidavit, before the hearing in less than an hour. The weight of my robe feels heavier than usual. My phone buzzes\u2014it's a message from my stepmother: \u201cCan you call? Your dad\u2019s been quiet all morning.\u201d I remember how I promised myself I\u2019d check in more, to be the emotional anchor they need, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through as a family. I want to call, to ask if everything is okay, to be present for them. But the clock ticks, and the law demands my full attention. I stare at the phone, then at the files, feeling the pull from both sides. My heart aches with guilt and responsibility, torn between the family that needs my support and the people whose safety may depend on my judgment."}
