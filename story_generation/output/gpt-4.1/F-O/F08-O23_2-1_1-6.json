She hadn\u2019t said much, but I could sense the weight she carried. As her grandmother, I wanted to offer comfort, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to assure her that even the hardest problems could be faced with courage and honesty. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the networking event I\u2019d promised to attend. There, a colleague, half-joking, half-curious, asked about a particularly sensitive client case. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, expected to guard my client\u2019s secrets fiercely, no matter how innocently the question was posed.\n\nI felt torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in. My granddaughter needed my undivided attention and gentle guidance, but my professional world demanded vigilance and discretion. I could feel the tension rising, the urge to be present for my family clashing with the unyielding ethical standards of my career. My heart ached as I weighed the needs of the people who depended on me, uncertain which role I could truly fulfill in this moment."}
