As their son, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for them, to listen and offer comfort, especially now when they needed me most. But today, as I was about to head home, a call came in\u2014a minor traffic accident just a few blocks away. I arrived to find two drivers arguing, each blaming the other. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen to both sides and make an unbiased decision. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my mom, asking if I\u2019d be home soon. I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. Torn between my duty to the community and my duty to my family, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding more than I had to give. My heart ached as I stood between the arguing drivers, my mind drifting to my parents waiting at home, needing me just as much."}
