The new feature was almost done, but the code review comments kept popping up\u2014warnings about performance, suggestions for cleaner logic. My team was counting on me to get this right before tomorrow\u2019s release. Just as I was about to test a fix, the front door slammed. My younger brother trudged in, backpack slung low, eyes red and puffy. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, probably with his friends again. I could feel the weight of his silence, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d be there for him, listen, maybe even offer advice. But the clock was ticking, and my mind was split between the lines of code on my screen and the ache in his posture. I wanted to close my laptop and sit beside him, but the pressure from work gnawed at me. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat frozen, caught between being the sibling he needed and the developer my team depended on."}
