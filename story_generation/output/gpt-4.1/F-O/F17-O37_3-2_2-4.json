I know it\u2019s my mom\u2014she always texts around this time, wanting to know how my day is going, if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m supposed to reply quickly, tell her about my morning, maybe send a photo of my lunch. But as I glance at the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner, my mind races. The client expects me to keep track of supplies, and I should message them now, before I forget, to let them know they\u2019ll need more before my next visit. My hands are wet, my phone is buzzing again, and I feel the pressure mounting. I want to be the attentive child my parents expect, but I also need to be the responsible cleaner my client relies on. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the two messages I need to send, each demanding my attention, each representing a different part of who I am."}
