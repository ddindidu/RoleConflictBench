He was supposed to be practicing polite conversation, a lesson we\u2019d started at home this morning. As his step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide him, to gently correct his slouching posture and remind him to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d But the meter was running, and my passenger in the front seat kept checking his watch, expecting a smooth, timely ride to his meeting. I could sense his impatience every time I slowed down to address my stepson\u2019s behavior. My mind raced\u2014should I focus on teaching my stepson, risking the passenger\u2019s satisfaction and possibly my tip, or should I keep quiet, prioritizing my job as a taxi driver? The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between being the parent my stepson needed and the professional my passenger expected."}
