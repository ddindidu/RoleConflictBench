Everyone\u2019s counting on you to help with the prayers.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. It was the annual family gathering, the one night when everyone came together, and I was expected to lead the blessing, just like my father used to. I promised I\u2019d be there, but as I checked my taxi app, a new ride popped up\u2014an urgent request. The passenger\u2019s message was insistent: \u201cPlease hurry, I can\u2019t be late. This is important.\u201d I could almost feel their anxiety through the screen. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I accepted, I\u2019d be cutting it close, maybe even missing the start of dinner. If I declined, I\u2019d let down someone who needed me, and my rating might drop. My family expected me to honor our traditions, to be present and respectful. My job demanded reliability and professionalism. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
