Her eyes were wide with uncertainty as she asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d I could see she needed reassurance, the kind only a grandmother could give\u2014gentle wisdom, a listening ear, a story from my own tangled past. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the factory: the new staff were about to start the old press, unaware of the safety steps I\u2019d meant to show them. My mind raced. They needed my expertise, my clear instructions, or someone could get hurt. Yet here was my granddaughter, waiting for my guidance, hoping for comfort. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the warmth of family and the cold, sharp edge of responsibility."}
