She looked up at me, eyes wide with worry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d she whispered, voice cracking. As her sibling, I knew she needed me\u2014someone to reassure her, to sit by her side, to remind her she was capable. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to help her through this storm.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, and I saw the message: I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in an important case. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to fulfill my duty to the justice system, no matter what. The weight of both roles pressed down on me.

I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
