She asked how work was going, and I could tell she wanted more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she expected me to open up, to share the stress I\u2019d been carrying, but my phone buzzed with a new delivery alert. It was a medical supply run\u2014urgent, for the hospital. The package had to be there on time, no exceptions. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my wife\u2019s gentle expectation for honesty and connection, and the hospital\u2019s silent demand for reliability and speed. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on her words, but my mind raced with the route I\u2019d need to take, the traffic I might hit, the consequences if I was late. I wanted to be present for her, to be the husband she needed, but the responsibility of that delivery gnawed at me. I looked at her, then at my phone, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the duty waiting outside."}
