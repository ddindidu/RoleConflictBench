He didn\u2019t say a word, just trudged past me toward his room. As his sibling, I knew I should go after him, sit beside him, and listen\u2014be the support he needed after a rough day at school. But my laptop was open on the kitchen table, the cursor blinking on a blank document. The court had assigned me a new case, and the scheduling order was due by Friday. The legal language had to be precise, the deadlines clear, and I couldn\u2019t afford to make mistakes. My mind raced with the expectations of my job, the pressure to be thorough and timely. Yet, my heart ached for my brother, knowing he needed me now more than ever. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my family and the demands of my profession, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
