It\u2019s tradition.\u201d Lately, my family has been insistent that I help keep our customs alive, especially after my grandmother\u2019s passing. I promised I\u2019d be there, but as I started my shift at the care home, I saw Mrs. Patel\u2019s name on my list. She\u2019s been unstable lately, and I know how important it is to take her vitals on time. My supervisor reminded me, \u201cAccuracy and punctuality are crucial.\u201d As I walked down the hallway, my phone buzzed\u2014my sister texting, \u201cDon\u2019t be late tonight. Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to my patients, who rely on me for their health, and the responsibility to my family, who expect me to honor our traditions. My heart pounded as I reached Mrs. Patel\u2019s door, torn between the beeping machines and the memory of my family gathered in prayer, waiting for me."}
