We need to clean the living room and set up the guest room before you leave for work.\u201d I promised I\u2019d help, but as I pulled on my uniform, I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift as a subway operator started in less than an hour. The pressure was already building. At the station, I slid into the operator\u2019s seat, my mind still replaying the list of chores waiting at home. Suddenly, the control panel blinked: a minor signal delay ahead. I had to adjust the train\u2019s speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost time. My passengers depended on me to get them to work safely and on schedule. But my spouse was counting on me, too, expecting me to share the load at home. As I gripped the controls, my thoughts tugged in two directions\u2014toward the spotless home my family expected, and the steady hands my passengers needed. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand I could meet without letting someone down."}
