Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of being home. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially after missing so many family gatherings because of work. But as I zipped up my uniform, the radio crackled with urgency. A protest downtown was turning volatile, and all available officers were being called in. My duty was clear: I was needed on the streets, to keep the peace, to protect people\u2014strangers, yes, but also my responsibility. My heart twisted. I could picture my family waiting, plates set, my chair empty again. I could also picture the chaos downtown if I didn\u2019t show up. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait.
