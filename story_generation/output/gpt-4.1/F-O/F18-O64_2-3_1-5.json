The policy was clear: no distractions, no shortcuts, no exceptions.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you come home? I really need to talk.\u201d I pictured him, shoulders slumped, eyes red from holding back tears. He\u2019d had a rough day at school, and I was always the one he turned to.
