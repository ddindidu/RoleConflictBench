It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d My heart skipped. Jamie, my grandson, had been struggling lately, and I knew my family expected me to be there, to listen, to offer comfort. But as I glanced up, I noticed the pool chairs\u2014some were out of line, not dangerous, but not up to the standard I was supposed to maintain. The pool manager had been clear: everything in its place, always. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family needed me, but so did my job. I stared at my phone, then at the chairs, feeling the tug of responsibility from both sides, my hands trembling as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
