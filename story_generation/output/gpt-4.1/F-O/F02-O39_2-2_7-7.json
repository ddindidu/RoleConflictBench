Can you send some money today?\u201d My stomach knots. I know how tight things have been lately, and I promised her I\u2019d make sure the kids never go hungry. But right now, I\u2019m standing at the edge of the construction site, hard hat in hand, as the foreman\u2019s voice booms over the loudspeaker, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. It\u2019s mandatory\u2014miss it, and I risk a write-up or even losing my day\u2019s pay. My team is already gathering, eyes on me, expecting me to be there, to pull my weight and follow the rules. But if I don\u2019t send the money now, my family will have to wait another day for food. My hands tremble as I weigh the phone in my palm, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the strict demands of my job. The seconds tick by, and I can feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions."}
