The weight of the home loan pressed on my chest\u2014I had two months to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. Every dollar counted, and I needed every hour at the carpentry site to keep us afloat. But as I rushed to get ready, my phone buzzed: my boss\u2019s reminder about the new safety protocols. \u201cNo shortcuts, no late arrivals,\u201d he\u2019d said. I knew the risks\u2014one slip, one missed check, and someone could get hurt. But if I left now, I\u2019d barely see my stepdaughter before she woke up, and I\u2019d have to skip breakfast to make it on time. If I was late, I could lose hours, maybe even the job. If I rushed, I might miss a safety step. My mind spun with the demands\u2014be a responsible parent, keep the house, keep the job, keep everyone safe. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, torn between the door and the kitchen, between my family and my work."}
