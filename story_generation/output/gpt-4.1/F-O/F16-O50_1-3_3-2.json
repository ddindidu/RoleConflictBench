My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you please fold those tonight? I\u2019ve got dinner and the kids\u2019 homework.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of shared responsibility settle on my shoulders. Just as I reach for the first towel, my phone buzzes urgently. It\u2019s the hospital\u2014ICU, critical fault on a life-support device. My heart skips. I know what that means: someone\u2019s life could depend on how fast I get there and fix it. I glance back at the laundry, then at the phone, my mind racing. At home, I\u2019m expected to pull my weight, to be present, to help keep our little world running smoothly. But at work, I\u2019m the one they call when machines fail and lives hang in the balance. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I feel the tension coil in my chest. I stand frozen, torn between the pile of clothes and the flashing red urgency of the hospital, not yet moving, not yet choosing."}
