The service was lagging, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged yesterday. My team was counting on me to fix it\u2014fast. Every minute the system crawled, more users were affected, and I could almost feel the weight of their frustration pressing down on me. \n\nThen my phone buzzed again. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute? Dad seems a bit down today.\u201d I knew what she needed\u2014just a few minutes of my time, a gentle check-in, a reminder that I cared. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be there for them, especially now that they seemed more fragile, more in need of reassurance. \n\nBut the code demanded my full attention. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to debug and the quiet, persistent pull of family. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of being a good daughter and a responsible developer, unsure which role to answer first."}
