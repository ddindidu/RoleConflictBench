The product manager\u2019s message blinked at the top: \u201cNeed your input on the API changes ASAP\u2014architects are waiting.\u201d My calendar was a wall of overlapping meetings, all suddenly urgent since the launch date was moved up. I rubbed my temples, trying to focus, when I heard a soft sniffle from the living room. My granddaughter sat curled on the couch, her eyes red and distant. I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her, something she didn\u2019t know how to say. My heart ached to go to her, to offer the comfort and perspective only a grandparent can give. But the pressure from work was crushing; teams were blocked, and everyone was waiting on me. I felt torn in two, the demands of my job and the needs of my family pulling me in opposite directions. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing with code and compassion, unsure which world needed me more in this moment."}
