They needed me\u2014really needed me. Their world was falling apart, and I was supposed to be their anchor, the one who listened, who held them together. But just as I started to type a reply, the call light blinked on. Room 204. Mrs. Jenkins. She\u2019d been having a rough day, her pain almost unbearable, and she hadn\u2019t touched her lunch. I knew she needed help, someone gentle to coax her to eat, to make her feel cared for. My heart twisted. My partner\u2019s words echoed in my mind, desperate and raw, but Mrs. Jenkins was waiting, too, her pain just as real. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be there for both of them, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands shook as I stood, torn between the person I loved at home and the person who needed me here."}
