It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014my next client, Mrs. Lee, was already settling in, her hair still damp from a shower at home. She smiled and said, \u201cNo need to wash, I\u2019m all set for the cut.\u201d But the salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned by us, no exceptions. My boss was strict about it, and I\u2019d been warned before.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My granddaughter needed me, probably right now, and I wanted to be the wise, steady presence she counted on. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, and I was expected to follow the rules, even if it seemed unnecessary. My hands trembled as I picked up the comb, my mind racing between the duty of a grandfather and the expectations of a professional hairdresser, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
