The line stretched down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every so often, silently urging me to keep up the pace. My mind, though, was somewhere else\u2014at home, where my daughter and grandchildren were already gathering for our long-awaited family dinner. I could almost hear their laughter, smell the roast in the oven, feel my youngest grandchild\u2019s arms around my neck. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there early, to help set the table and share stories. But here I was, tied to my register, responsible for every cent and every smile, knowing that leaving early would let my team down and possibly cause mistakes. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My heart ached as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
