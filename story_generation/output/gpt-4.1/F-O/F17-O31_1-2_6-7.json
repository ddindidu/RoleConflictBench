Just before my shift, I\u2019d called home, asking Mom if everything was okay. She\u2019d sounded tired, her voice thin, but insisted all was well. I knew she wanted me to focus on my job, but I couldn\u2019t shake the worry. Now, standing between two angry drivers at the scene of a fender-bender, I felt the weight of my badge. Both drivers were frustrated, each blaming the other, and I was expected to listen, remain fair, and uphold the law. But as I tried to mediate, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Dad: \u201cCall when you can.\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be the supportive child, to check in, to reassure them and myself that everything was truly fine at home. But right now, I was the officer, expected to be impartial and focused. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which part of myself needed me more."}
