It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped\u2014she rarely used that word. As a grandfather, I knew I should be there, to listen, to offer comfort, to keep the family close, especially now when someone needed me most. But just as I reached for the phone, my work laptop pinged with a flurry of Slack notifications. The production system was down, and the outage was traced to a bug in my code. Customers were locked out, and the team was waiting for me to jump in and fix it. I could almost hear the frustration in their messages, the expectation that I\u2019d drop everything and help.

The weight of both roles pressed on me, each urgent, each important, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
