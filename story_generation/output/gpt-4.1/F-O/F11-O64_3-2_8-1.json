My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every move I made, expecting speed and accuracy. Suddenly, I saw my younger brother at the end of the line, his face tight with frustration. We\u2019d argued that morning\u2014something about him borrowing my headphones without asking. He\u2019d left the house angry, and I\u2019d spent all day replaying our words, wishing I\u2019d handled it better. Now, he was here, and I could see he wanted to talk, maybe to clear the air. But the customers were restless, sighing and shifting their weight, and I knew I couldn\u2019t hold up the line. My brother\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for a moment, while my manager hovered nearby, expecting me to keep things moving. I felt torn, caught between the need to do my job well and the urge to reach out to my brother, to show him I cared enough to listen. My heart pounded as I tried to decide what to do next."}
