The house was a whirlwind of last-minute cleaning, and I could feel her stress radiating through every request. I wanted to be present, to help, to share the load as I\u2019d promised. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014my clerk\u2019s urgent message. I was needed in court, right now. \n\nMinutes later, I stood in my robes, instructing the jury, my mind still half at home. Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent I was using. Everything I\u2019d prepared was now wrong. I had to stop, reassess, and rewrite my instructions on the spot. The weight of the courtroom\u2019s expectation pressed down on me, but so did the image of my wife, overwhelmed and alone, preparing for our relatives. I felt torn in two, each role demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between duty and devotion, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both things at once."}
