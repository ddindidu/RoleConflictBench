My spouse stood by the window, worry etched across their face. I knew that look\u2014they needed to talk, to share the weight of whatever was troubling them. I remembered our promise to always communicate openly, to be there for each other no matter what. But my phone buzzed: a passenger needed a ride to the train station, and their train was leaving soon. The station was clear across town, and traffic would be heavy at this hour. My job demanded I get them there safely and on time. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the urgency of my passenger\u2019s schedule and the silent plea in my spouse\u2019s eyes. I stood in the doorway, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of being a supportive partner and a reliable driver, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
