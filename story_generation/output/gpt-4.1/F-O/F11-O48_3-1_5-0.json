My younger brother kept peeking into my room, asking if I\u2019d packed my bag yet, and my mom reminded me how much it meant to her that we\u2019d all be together this year. But as I checked my phone, I saw the schedule for my shift at the care home\u2014Mrs. Evans needed help with her morning routine, and I was the only nursing assistant available. My supervisor\u2019s message was clear: the residents depended on me, especially today. I could almost hear Mrs. Evans\u2019 gentle voice, waiting for me to help her get ready for breakfast, and I knew how much she valued our morning chats. My family\u2019s laughter drifted down the hallway, and I felt the weight of their expectations, wanting me to be present, to share in the memories. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the warmth of home and the quiet responsibility waiting for me at work. I stood in the hallway, suitcase in one hand, work uniform in the other, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in."}
