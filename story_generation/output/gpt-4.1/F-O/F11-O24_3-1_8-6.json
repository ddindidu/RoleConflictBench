I think you misunderstood what I said earlier.\u201d I knew he was upset about our argument last night, and as his sister, I felt the weight of our relationship pressing on me. We\u2019d always promised to talk things through, to never let resentment fester. But the journal\u2019s articles beckoned, full of new legal theories I needed to understand to stay sharp as a judge. My docket was full, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind on the latest precedents. I stared at the phone, torn. If I called my brother, I\u2019d lose precious time for professional growth. If I ignored him, I\u2019d risk damaging the trust we\u2019d built. The expectations of being a good sister and a diligent judge pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
