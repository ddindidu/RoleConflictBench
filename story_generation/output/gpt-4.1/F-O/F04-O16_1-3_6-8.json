It was my younger brother, inviting me to join him and his friends for dinner. He sounded excited, and I knew he valued these moments together\u2014he\u2019d mentioned before how much it meant to him when I made time for us. I promised I\u2019d be there, wanting to show him that he mattered, that I respected our bond.\n\nBut as I was heading out, a nurse rushed over. A patient had just arrived in the ER with a severe, rapidly spreading infection. The situation was critical; they needed immediate assessment and the right antibiotics, or things could turn fatal fast. As a doctor, I knew my responsibility was clear: my patient\u2019s life depended on my expertise and swift action.\n\nStanding in the hallway, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My brother\u2019s expectation for me to be present, to nurture our relationship, clashed with my duty to my patient, who needed me now more than ever. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two calls\u2014one of family, one of profession\u2014each demanding a different part of me."}
