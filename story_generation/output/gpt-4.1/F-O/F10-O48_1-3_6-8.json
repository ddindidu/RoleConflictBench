Dad\u2019s been quiet all day.\u201d I know what she wants\u2014just to hear my voice, to feel like I\u2019m there for them, even if it\u2019s just a few minutes asking if everything\u2019s okay at home. I want to be that daughter, the one who checks in, who listens, who reassures. But as I tuck my phone away, I hear soft sobs from Room 214. Mrs. Evans, my patient, has just learned her cancer has returned. She\u2019s alone, her hands trembling, tears streaming down her face. My heart aches for her. I\u2019m supposed to be her support, her comfort, her companion in this moment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my parents needing their daughter, my patient needing her nursing assistant. I stand in the hallway, torn, my chest tight, wishing I could split myself in two."}
