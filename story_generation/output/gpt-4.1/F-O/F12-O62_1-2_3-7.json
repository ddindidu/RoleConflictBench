My husband had asked if I could fold them before my shift, and I promised I would. But now, standing at the edge of the pool in my red lifeguard suit, whistle around my neck, I spot a group of teenagers laughing and pushing each other dangerously close to the no-diving signs. My mind races\u2014at home, I\u2019m expected to keep things running smoothly, to share the load, to be a good partner. Here, I\u2019m responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, expected to be vigilant, to enforce the rules no matter what. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the guilt of the laundry left undone and the urgency of the risky behavior in front of me. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the demands of being both a reliable wife and a responsible lifeguard, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
