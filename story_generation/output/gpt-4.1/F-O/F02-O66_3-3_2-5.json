The school had called earlier\u2014my son, caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me there, now, to talk things through. I kept replaying the conversation in my head, wondering where I\u2019d gone wrong, what I\u2019d say to him, how I\u2019d show him right from wrong. But I was still on my shift, and fares were slow today. I needed every ride I could get.\n\nAs I turned onto Maple Avenue, orange cones forced all the cars into a single lane. Children clustered on the sidewalk, backpacks swinging, some darting too close to the curb. The school zone sign flashed, demanding I slow to a crawl. My phone buzzed with another reminder from the school. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my son needed me, but so did my job. I couldn\u2019t risk a ticket or, worse, an accident. My heart pounded as I inched forward, torn between the father my son needed and the driver I was expected to be."}
