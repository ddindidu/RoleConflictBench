My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the family emergency\u2014she needed me, right now, to help calm everyone and keep the kids safe. My heart ached; I knew how much my family relied on my steady presence in moments like these.\n\nBut as I hung up, another call came through. It was the plant manager. The old packaging machine, the one only I seemed to understand, was acting up again. Production was slow, but if the glitch wasn\u2019t fixed now, it could halt everything when demand picked up. They needed me to come in and diagnose the issue before it spiraled out of control.\n\nI stared at my hands, still dusted with flour, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family needed their grandmother, the one who soothed fears and brought comfort. My team needed their repairer, the one who could keep the wheels turning.
