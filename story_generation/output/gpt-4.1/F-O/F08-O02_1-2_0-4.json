My phone buzzed with a reminder: the new safety standard documentation was due by noon, and I still needed to double-check the compliance checklist for the upcoming product release. Just then, my granddaughter wandered in, her face clouded with uncertainty. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new? Like, really ready?\u201d I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she wanted the kind of wisdom only experience could offer. But my mind kept drifting to the technical report, the looming deadline, and the responsibility I carried as an engineer to ensure everything was perfect and safe. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present, patient, and wise for her, and the professional demand to be precise, thorough, and timely. My heart ached to give her my full attention, but my mind raced with regulatory clauses and checklists. I took a deep breath, torn between the warmth of family and the rigor of my profession, unsure which role to answer first."}
