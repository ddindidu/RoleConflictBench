I know I should call Jamie back, remind them about respect and safety, but my phone buzzes with a message from my cleaning supervisor: \u201cClient noticed dust on the baseboards again. Please be more thorough.\u201d My mind races\u2014if I don\u2019t get home soon, I\u2019ll fall behind on the extra cleaning I promised, and I can\u2019t afford another complaint. But Jamie\u2019s wild laughter echoes, drawing annoyed glances. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to teach Jamie right from wrong, to be the steady adult, and the demand to keep every corner of the house spotless. My heart pounds as I grip the cart, torn between calling Jamie to my side and rushing through the store to get back to my cleaning duties. I stand frozen, caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my job, unsure which role to answer first."}
