The numbers blinked at me\u2014just a few more calls, a few more sales, and I\u2019d help the team hit our target. My phone buzzed with reminders from my manager, the pressure mounting with every passing minute. Just then, my spouse walked in, eyes tired, voice soft. \u201cCan we talk? You seem stressed lately. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d I knew they expected me to open up, to share what was weighing on me, to be present and honest. But my mind raced with scripts, quotas, and the fear of letting my team down. I wanted to close the laptop and listen, to be the partner they needed.
