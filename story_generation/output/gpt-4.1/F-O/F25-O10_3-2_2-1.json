My phone buzzes for the third time in ten minutes\u2014another message from my stepmother. She wants to know how my day is going, if I\u2019ve eaten, and if I can call her tonight. I know she expects me to reply quickly, to keep up the daily rhythm of our conversations, especially since Dad passed away. She says it makes her feel less alone.\n\nBut the numbers on my screen blur together, and I can\u2019t afford a mistake. My manager has already reminded me twice that the financial records must be flawless and submitted by tomorrow morning. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family needing reassurance, my job demanding perfection. My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking cursor in my stepmother\u2019s chat, torn between typing a quick reply and focusing on the ledger. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I can\u2019t see how to satisfy them both."}
