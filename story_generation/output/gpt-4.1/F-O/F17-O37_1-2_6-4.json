My mom had just texted, \u201cCan we talk tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. I always tried to check in, to ask if things were alright at home, even when I was tired from work. But as I glanced at my work schedule, my mind jumped to my other responsibility. The Johnsons\u2019 house was on my list for tomorrow, and I remembered seeing the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner last time. If I didn\u2019t remind them or pick some up myself, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job properly. My boss expected me to manage these supplies, to keep everything running smoothly. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my parents needed me emotionally, but my job demanded my attention and organization. My heart ached with guilt, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they needed at the same time. I stared out the window, torn, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
