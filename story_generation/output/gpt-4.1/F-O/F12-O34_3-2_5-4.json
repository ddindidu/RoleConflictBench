The cloud tops are rising faster than forecasted, and three pilots are waiting for my revised climb instructions. My voice must be calm, precise\u2014lives depend on it. But my phone buzzes on the desk, a message from my husband: \u201cRelatives will be here in an hour. Can you help with the living room and set the table?\u201d I picture the chaos at home, the expectation that I\u2019ll share the load, make our home welcoming. My mind splits\u2014one part calculating altitudes and headings, the other tallying chores left undone. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the demand to be present and perfect in each. My heart pounds as I try to focus, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both are counting on me right now."}
