The store is quiet, but my mind is anything but. My wife texted earlier\u2014our rent is due, and the kids need groceries for the week. I know every dollar I bring home matters. As a father, I feel the weight of their needs pressing on my chest, reminding me that I can\u2019t afford to make a mistake, not now.\n\nBut as a cashier, I have to focus. The drawer is full of large bills, and the customer in front of me is impatient. My manager expects perfect accuracy, especially with high-value transactions. One slip, and I could be short for the day, risking my job and the money my family depends on. My hands tremble slightly as I recount the cash, my mind torn between the fear of making a costly error and the anxiety of not providing enough for my family. The pressure builds, and I can feel my heart pounding as I try to steady myself, caught between the demands of being a good father and a responsible cashier."}
