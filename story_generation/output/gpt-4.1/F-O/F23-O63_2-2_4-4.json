My headset was barely muffling the shrieks of my stepson, Ethan, who was darting between aisles, giggling as he knocked cereal boxes askew. I was supposed to be teaching him right from wrong, showing him how to behave in public, but my manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cYou\u2019re three sales short, and there\u2019s only an hour left.\u201d I watched Ethan disappear around a corner, my heart pounding. If I stopped to discipline him, I\u2019d lose precious minutes\u2014maybe my bonus, maybe even my job. But if I ignored him, I\u2019d be failing him, letting him think this chaos was okay. My phone beeped, another potential customer on the line. Ethan\u2019s laughter rang out, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose which expectation to betray."}
