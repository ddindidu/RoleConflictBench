She wanted to know how my day was going, what I\u2019d eaten for lunch, if I\u2019d remembered to call my dad. I\u2019d promised to keep in touch, to be the kind of step-child who didn\u2019t let the distance grow. But in the lab, the hum of the centrifuge and the blinking lights of the incubator reminded me that my experiment was at a critical stage. I could run the test today or wait for another slot next week, but the data was fresh, and I was eager to see the results. My supervisor expected dedication, focus, and timely progress. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my own drive to push the research forward. My fingers hovered over the phone, torn between sending a quick reply and diving back into the experiment. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both sides what they wanted at the same time."}
