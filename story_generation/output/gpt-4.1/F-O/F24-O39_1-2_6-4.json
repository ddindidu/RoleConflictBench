He\u2019s younger, always distracted, and I promised to look out for him. We passed the construction site where I work part-time, and I spotted a small puddle of oil on the walkway\u2014right where workers and kids sometimes cut through. My boss drilled it into us: any spill, no matter how small, gets cleaned up right away. Safety first, always. But my stepbrother tugged at my sleeve, eager to get home, and I knew he hated waiting around the site. If I left him alone, even for a few minutes, he might wander off or get into trouble. But if I ignored the spill, someone could slip, and I\u2019d be responsible. My chest tightened as I stood there, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job, both demanding my attention at the same moment."}
