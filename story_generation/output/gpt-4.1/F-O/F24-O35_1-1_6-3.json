Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood. I keep an eye on the traffic, making sure he doesn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my shift as a subway operator starts in ten minutes. I\u2019m supposed to be on the train, headset on, ready to answer passengers\u2019 questions and keep everyone safe.\n\nAs we near the corner, my stepbrother slows down, distracted by a stray cat. I glance at my watch, heart pounding. I know the subway can\u2019t run without an operator, and passengers rely on me for directions and safety. Suddenly, my work phone rings. A passenger is lost and needs help finding the right transfer. I\u2019m expected to answer immediately, but my stepbrother is now halfway across the street, chasing the cat. I freeze, torn between grabbing him before he gets hurt and picking up the call to help the passenger. Both roles demand my attention, and I can feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me."}
