My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his work shirt clean for tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d take care of it. The washing machine hummed in the background, but I hadn\u2019t even sorted the colors yet. Just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling right on schedule for their check-in. I knew they\u2019d want guidance\u2014basic operating tips, maybe a few troubleshooting tricks. That was my job, after all: to be patient, clear, and helpful, no matter how simple the question. I could hear my husband in the next room, rustling through drawers, probably searching for something clean to wear. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the laundry room and toward the phone in my hand. Both roles expected me to be present, attentive, and reliable. I felt the pressure building, my heart caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my work, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
