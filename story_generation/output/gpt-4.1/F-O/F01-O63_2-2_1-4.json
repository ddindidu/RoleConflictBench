My sales numbers glared at me from the screen\u2014still three short of the weekly target. Management\u2019s emails echoed in my mind: \u201cPush harder, don\u2019t let up.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to the living room, where my grandson sat slumped on the couch, shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on the floor. He\u2019d barely spoken at dinner, and I could sense the weight he carried, the kind of burden I recognized from my own youth. I wanted to go to him, to offer the comfort and guidance a grandfather should, to remind him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But every minute away from the phone meant another missed opportunity, another step further from my quota. My heart tugged me toward my grandson, but my job demanded I stay put, voice cheerful and persistent, chasing sales. The two worlds pulled at me, each expecting more than I felt I could give."}
