My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She never called during my shift unless it was serious. I answered, and her voice trembled as she told me about her breakup, how she needed me, just to talk, to be there. I wanted nothing more than to pull over and listen, to be the sister she could lean on, like always.\n\nBut in the back seat, my passenger kept checking his watch, anxiety etched on his face. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he said, voice tight.
