It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you!\u201d My heart squeezed a little. I knew how much these family gatherings meant to everyone, especially after the year we\u2019d had. But as I glanced around the living room, I saw the dust gathering on the shelves and the crumbs scattered across the coffee table. My supervisor at the cleaning agency had just texted, reminding me that the house needed to be spotless for the next inspection. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the brother who showed up. But my job demanded that I keep the house immaculate, even though I\u2019d only managed to do the bare minimum lately. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s disappointment if I let things slide. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold reality of my responsibilities. I stood in the middle of the living room, paralyzed, not knowing which role to choose."}
