My wife\u2019s gentle reminder echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need clean clothes for the kids\u2019 field trip tomorrow.\u201d I promised I\u2019d help tonight, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to share the load. But my phone buzzes with a Slack notification\u2014production is lagging, and the team suspects the new code I pushed this afternoon. My lead is asking for a quick fix before the nightly batch jobs run. I stare at my laptop, guilt gnawing at me. If I ignore the code, the service could crash, affecting thousands of users. If I ignore the laundry, I let my family down. My mind races, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the blinking cursor on my screen. Both worlds expect me to step up, right now, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be failing someone."}
