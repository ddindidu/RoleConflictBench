My daughter\u2019s message was short but heavy: my grandson was struggling, and she needed me to talk to him. As a grandfather, I knew how much my presence mattered, especially now. But as I looked up, I saw the new notice pinned to the wall\u2014an optional training session next week, the kind that could help me keep up with the younger guys and maybe even earn a little more. The foreman had made it clear that those who showed initiative would be remembered when overtime was handed out. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family expected me to be there, to listen, to guide. My team expected me to show up, to learn, to pull my weight. I stared at the phone, torn between the voice of my blood and the call of my livelihood, my heart pounding with the fear of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
