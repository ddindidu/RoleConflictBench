My daughter had called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. I could already picture their eager faces, the board games waiting on the living room table, the laughter echoing through the house. But as I was about to leave my office, an email notification blinked on my screen. It was from the tax authority: a discrepancy in a client\u2019s file, flagged for immediate attention.
