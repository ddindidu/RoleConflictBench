My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d she said, urgency in her voice. I nodded, glancing at the traffic ahead. Then my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a call from Mom. I hesitated, but answered on speaker. Her voice trembled, \u201cYour dad and I had a fight. I just need to talk to you.\u201d I could hear the pain in her words, the expectation that I\u2019d listen, comfort her, be the son she needed right now. But the passenger in my rearview mirror was checking her watch, her eyes pleading for speed, for focus. My heart pounded. I wanted to pull over, to give Mom my full attention, but the city\u2019s traffic lights blinked red, and the minutes ticked by. I gripped the wheel, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my passenger, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
