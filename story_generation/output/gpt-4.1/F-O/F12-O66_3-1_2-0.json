His messages were short, desperate\u2014he needed me, needed to talk, to hear my voice. He was unraveling, and I was supposed to be his anchor, the one who listened, soothed, and stayed close. But right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat, humming to himself, unconcerned with the world. He had asked for a slow, scenic route, said he wasn\u2019t in a rush. I was expected to be patient, attentive, and safe, to make his ride pleasant and unhurried. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I could feel the weight of my husband\u2019s pain through the phone, but I couldn\u2019t answer, couldn\u2019t be the wife he needed. My mind raced with guilt and frustration\u2014how could I be in two places at once, meeting two needs that pulled me in opposite directions? The silence in the car grew heavy, my heart pounding as I stared at the road ahead, torn between the person who needed me most and the job I was supposed to do."}
