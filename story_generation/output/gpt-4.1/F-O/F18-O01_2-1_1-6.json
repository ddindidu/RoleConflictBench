The deadlines were tight, and I needed to make sure every task was on track. My phone buzzed with a reminder to check in with the contractor, and I was already drafting an email in my head when the front door creaked open. My younger brother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. He dropped his backpack with a thud and slumped onto the couch, silent. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, probably with his friends again. \n\nI felt the pull immediately. As his sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to help him through whatever was weighing him down. But the project was at a critical point, and if I didn\u2019t keep things moving, the whole team would feel the impact. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014one where I closed the laptop and sat beside him, and another where I kept working, hoping he\u2019d understand. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between being the sibling he needed and the architect my team depended on."}
