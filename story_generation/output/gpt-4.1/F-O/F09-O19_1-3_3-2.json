He was supposed to be learning table manners, and I knew I should gently correct him, remind him to sit up straight and wipe his mouth. But my phone buzzed with a message from the pharmacy\u2014an urgent request to double-check a high-risk chemotherapy prescription. I could picture the vials, the precise measurements, the gravity of a single decimal point. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: my son\u2019s wide eyes waiting for my attention, the patient\u2019s life depending on my focus. I felt the pull of responsibility from both sides\u2014my child needing guidance to grow into a good person, and a stranger needing my undivided accuracy to survive. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn by the impossible demand to be fully present in two places at once."}
