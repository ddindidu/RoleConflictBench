My shift as a subway operator was about to start, and the pre-departure check was waiting\u2014nothing urgent, but still, it was my responsibility to make sure every system was in order before the train rolled out. Just then, my phone buzzed. A message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s really down lately.\u201d My grandson, usually so full of life, had been quiet and withdrawn. I knew he needed me, needed the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give\u2014someone to listen, to share a story, to remind him that storms pass.\n\nBut the minutes ticked by. The train wouldn\u2019t wait, and neither would the passengers counting on me to get them safely to their destinations. My duty was clear, but so was the ache in my chest. Could I be the steady hand for hundreds of strangers and still be the wise, comforting presence my grandson needed? The weight of both roles pressed down, and I found myself frozen, torn between the tracks and the family that needed me."}
