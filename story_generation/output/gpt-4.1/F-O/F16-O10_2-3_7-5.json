My spouse sat at the table, their face drawn and eyes distant. I knew I should sit down, ask what was wrong, and really listen\u2014like we promised we would, no matter how busy life got. But the letter in my hand felt like it was burning a hole through my skin. As an accountant, I knew the urgency of a tax notice; any delay could mean penalties or worse. My spouse looked up, searching my face for comfort, maybe even for me to share my own worries. I wanted to be present, to communicate openly, but the weight of my professional responsibility pressed down on me. I stood there, torn, the silence stretching between us, feeling the pull of both roles and not knowing which to answer first."}
