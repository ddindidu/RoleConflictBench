My daughter\u2019s name flashes on the screen, and I know she\u2019s calling to finalize plans for the family holiday. Every year, I\u2019m the one who gathers everyone, who makes sure the grandkids know their stories and their roots. It\u2019s a tradition, and I can hear my wife\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t let them drift apart.\u201d But today, the dispatcher\u2019s voice is just as clear\u2014this medical supply run is urgent, the hospital is counting on me, and there\u2019s no room for delay. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I answer the call, I risk being late with the delivery, and someone\u2019s care could be compromised. If I ignore it, I let down my family, maybe miss the only chance to bring everyone together this year. My hands tremble on the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to strangers who need me just as much."}
