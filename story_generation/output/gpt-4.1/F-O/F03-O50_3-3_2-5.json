I knew it was Mom\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I was okay. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d reply quickly, keep her updated, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. But right now, the machine was on the verge of seizing up, and if I didn\u2019t get it cleaned and the bearing replaced, the whole line would grind to a halt. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Stay focused.\u201d I could almost feel the weight of both expectations pressing on my shoulders\u2014my parents needing reassurance, my job demanding my undivided attention. My hands hovered between the wrench and my phone, heart pounding, torn between being the reliable son and the dependable repairer."}
