I\u2019d been looking forward to it\u2014just the two of us, catching up, sharing stories, building the kind of mutual respect we\u2019d promised each other after our last argument. But as I set my phone down, a thick file on my desk caught my eye. The attorney in tomorrow\u2019s case had just cited a new appellate decision, one I hadn\u2019t yet read. As a judge, I was expected to be fully prepared, to know the latest legal precedents inside and out. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d have to skim the case later, risking missing something crucial. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my sister again, making her feel excluded from my life. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. I sat frozen, torn between the courtroom and the dinner table, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
