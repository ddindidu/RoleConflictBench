Dispatch had called in a patient with a sprained ankle\u2014nothing life-threatening, but protocol demanded urgency. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my head from that morning: \u201cNever forget who you are, and always respect our family\u2019s ways.\u201d Lately, my family had been insistent that I honor our traditions, especially the one about never using unnecessary force or haste, even in work. \u201cPatience and care,\u201d my father always said, \u201care our family\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\nBut now, every honk and impatient driver around me seemed to push me toward breaking that promise. The city\u2019s chaos pressed in, and I felt the weight of my uniform and my family\u2019s expectations both tightening around me. Should I push through the traffic, risking a reckless move and betraying my family\u2019s values, or should I slow down, upholding tradition but possibly disappointing my team and the patient? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the daughter my family wanted and the ambulance driver my job demanded."}
