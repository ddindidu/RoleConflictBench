My daughter had just called everyone together, and I could feel the anticipation in the air. This was the kind of moment I cherished\u2014being present, listening, and celebrating with them. Just as my granddaughter opened her mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling during my scheduled check-in. I knew he was anxious about using the new machine, and he\u2019d hinted before that he needed some extra guidance. If I ignored the call, he might feel unsupported, maybe even frustrated. But if I answered, I\u2019d miss the look on my granddaughter\u2019s face, the laughter, the shared joy. My heart tugged in both directions\u2014toward the family who expected my full attention, and toward the client who relied on my expertise. I stared at the phone, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
