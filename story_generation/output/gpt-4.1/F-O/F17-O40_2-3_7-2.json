My father barely touched his breakfast, his eyes distant. I felt the weight of their exhaustion settle on my shoulders, a silent plea for comfort and understanding. I wanted to sit with them, to offer words that might ease their burdens, to be the child they needed right now.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I was due at the construction site in half an hour. As a carpenter, I knew the importance of inspecting every tool, every piece of equipment before starting the day\u2019s work. One missed step, one overlooked crack in a ladder or frayed cord, and someone could get hurt. The crew depended on me to keep things safe and running smoothly.\n\nStanding in the hallway, I felt torn in two. My heart ached to stay, to be present for my parents, but my mind raced with the responsibilities waiting for me at the site. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, caught between the roles I was expected to fill, unsure which demand to answer first."}
