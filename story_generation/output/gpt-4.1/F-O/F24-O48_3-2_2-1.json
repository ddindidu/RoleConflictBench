He\u2019d just learned about our father\u2019s sudden illness, and I could hear the pain in every word. I wanted nothing more than to be there for him, to offer comfort and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But just as I promised I\u2019d call him back, my supervisor called my name. Mrs. Patel, my post-op patient, needed help getting out of bed and dressed. She was anxious and unsteady, and I knew she depended on me to help her safely. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my stepbrother needed my emotional support, but Mrs. Patel needed my physical presence and care. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, my mind racing with guilt and worry. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the family I\u2019d chosen and the patients I was sworn to help, not knowing which need should come first."}
