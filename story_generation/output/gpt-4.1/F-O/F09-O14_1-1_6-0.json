This project is crucial for my research, and every run brings me closer to the results I need for my next paper\u2014and, hopefully, the grant that will help secure our family\u2019s future. But as I close my laptop, I see my son\u2019s hopeful eyes and remember my promise: tomorrow, we\u2019d go to the store together and finally buy him the Nintendo he\u2019s been saving for, the one I said I\u2019d get as soon as things calmed down at work. He\u2019s been so patient, counting the days, and I know how much this means to him. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to provide, to keep our finances stable, and my desire to keep my word as a mother, to see his joy and not let him down. My heart aches as I realize that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014either my son, or the future I\u2019m working so hard to build for us both."}
