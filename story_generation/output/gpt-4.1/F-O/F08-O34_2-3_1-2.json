The sudden closure of a major route had thrown the airspace into chaos\u2014planes circling, pilots anxious, my voice the thread holding it all together. My heart pounded as I issued instructions, calculating safe distances, rerouting flights, every second critical. But just behind me, in the break room, my granddaughter sat curled on the couch, her shoulders slumped, eyes red. I\u2019d noticed her distress all morning, the way she avoided my gaze, the heaviness in her silence. I knew she needed me\u2014needed the comfort only a grandmother could give, the gentle words and steady presence that might help her find her way. Yet, the demands of the airspace pressed in, the expectation that I remain focused, unflappable, responsible for hundreds of lives in the sky. My mind tugged in two directions: the urgent, unyielding needs of my job, and the quiet, aching need of my family. I gripped the edge of the console, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
