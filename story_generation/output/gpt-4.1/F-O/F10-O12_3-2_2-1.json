It\u2019s Mom, asking if I\u2019ve eaten and how my day is going. I know she expects a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my lunch, and a rundown of my morning. We talk every day, and I can almost hear her voice in my head, worried if I don\u2019t answer soon. But my laptop screen is filled with red flags\u2014performance warnings from the latest code review. The new feature is almost done, but my team lead wants the code cleaner, more efficient. I\u2019m supposed to focus, rewrite, and test before the end of the day. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between typing a reassuring message to Mom and diving back into the code. The pressure from both sides squeezes my chest. I want to be a good daughter, attentive and present, but I also want to be a reliable developer, delivering quality work. The demands pull me in opposite directions, and for a moment, I just sit there, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
