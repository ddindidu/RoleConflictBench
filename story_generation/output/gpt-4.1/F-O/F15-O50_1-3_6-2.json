He\u2019d been so patient, saving up his allowance, and I\u2019d promised\u2014sworn, even\u2014that I\u2019d make up the difference and order it today. I could already picture his face lighting up, the way he\u2019d run to tell his friends, the pride in being able to keep my word as a parent. \n\nBut just as I was about to confirm the purchase, my work phone buzzed urgently. The hospital\u2019s ICU. A life-support machine was flashing critical fault codes, and the nurse\u2019s voice was tight with panic. I was the only one on call with the expertise to fix it. If I didn\u2019t go now, someone\u2019s life could be at risk. \n\nMy heart pounded. My son\u2019s happiness, our family\u2019s stability, my promise\u2014on one side. On the other, the weight of responsibility, the knowledge that my skills could mean the difference between life and death. I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice, as both worlds demanded all of me at once."}
