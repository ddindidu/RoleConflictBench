My phone buzzed\u2014my granddaughter, calling during her lunch break. I answered, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s time to move out on your own?\u201d My heart ached to give her the wisdom she sought, to reassure her with stories of my own first steps into adulthood. But just as I opened my mouth, a pilot\u2019s urgent voice crackled through my headset: \u201cTower, this is Delta 142, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My training kicked in, mind racing to calculate safe approaches, but my granddaughter\u2019s question still hung in the air, her need for guidance pressing against the life-or-death urgency on my screen. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down\u2014one demanding calm, precise instructions to keep hundreds safe, the other needing the gentle, patient wisdom only a grandparent can give. My hands hovered, one over the radio, the other gripping the phone, heart pounding as I wrestled with which call to answer first."}
