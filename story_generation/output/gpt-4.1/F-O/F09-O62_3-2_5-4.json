My heart dropped. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake and help him understand honesty and discipline. But just as I was about to approach him, my supervisor called out\u2014one of the lane ropes had snapped, and swim lessons were about to start. As the lifeguard on duty, it was my responsibility to fix it immediately, to ensure the safety and order of the pool. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my son needed me to be his mother, to correct and comfort him, but the pool needed me to be the lifeguard, to keep everything running smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my child and my duty to everyone at the pool."}
