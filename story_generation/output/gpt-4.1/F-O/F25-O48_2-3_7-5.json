Mom barely touched her coffee, her eyes distant. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a reminder from the hospital. My shift started in twenty minutes, and today I was assigned to Mr. Harris, a patient in the ICU whose blood pressure had been dangerously unstable all night. The charge nurse had stressed how crucial it was to monitor him closely, to record every change, every minute. My parents\u2019 voices faded into the background as I mentally rehearsed the steps\u2014thermometer, cuff, chart, repeat. But guilt gnawed at me. How could I leave my parents when they needed me most? Yet, how could I let my patient down, knowing his life might depend on my vigilance?
