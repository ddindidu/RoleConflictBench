As a parent, I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running indoors isn\u2019t safe or respectful. I want to teach him about discipline, about thinking of others. But my phone buzzes\u2014my next taxi fare is waiting outside. The app says the passenger is early, heading to a casual meeting, but I still feel the pressure to be prompt, to keep my five-star rating. My mind races: if I take the time to correct my son, I\u2019ll be late for my passenger. If I rush him out, I miss a chance to teach him something important. My heart pounds as I watch him, torn between the duty to my child and the responsibility to my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I can give at once."}
