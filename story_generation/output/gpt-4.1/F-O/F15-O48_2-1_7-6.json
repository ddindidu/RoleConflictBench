Can you pick up a shift this weekend?\u201d My heart sinks. I know we need the money\u2014rent is due soon, and the kids\u2019 shoes are wearing thin. As a parent, I feel the weight of every bill, every empty shelf in the fridge. But right now, I\u2019m at work, standing outside Mrs. Thompson\u2019s room. She\u2019s been especially quiet today, her eyes searching mine for comfort as I check her vitals. I know she looks forward to these moments, the only real conversation she gets all day. My supervisor expects me to be present, to offer more than just medical care\u2014to be a companion, a listener. But my mind is split, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my patient. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure is building inside me, a knot of guilt and worry. I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself, knowing I have to choose where I am needed most."}
