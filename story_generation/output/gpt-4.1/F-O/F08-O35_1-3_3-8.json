My daughter had sent a picture of the grandkids already setting the table, their little faces beaming. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there early, to help with dinner and read their favorite story. But as I pulled the subway train into the next station, the supervisor stepped into my cabin, clipboard in hand, announcing an immediate performance audit. My heart sank. I knew what was expected\u2014flawless adherence to every protocol, no distractions, no early departures. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the warmth of my family waiting, the cold scrutiny of my supervisor beside me. I felt the ache of wanting to be the reliable grandmother, the one who never breaks a promise, and the pressure of being the consummate professional, the operator who never falters. My hands tightened on the controls as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the laughter waiting at home and the stern eyes watching my every move."}
