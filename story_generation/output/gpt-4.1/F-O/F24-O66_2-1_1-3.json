As I pulled into the driveway, I saw my stepbrother trudging up the walk, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. He barely glanced at me before heading inside. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of expectation: I should be there for him, listen, offer comfort, help him through whatever had happened at school.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a last-minute ride request, a regular who depended on me to be punctual. If I took the call, I\u2019d have to leave immediately, focus on the road, keep my mind sharp and my emotions in check, as any distraction could mean a mistake behind the wheel. I stood in the doorway, torn between the urge to drop everything and sit with my brother, and the responsibility to do my job safely and professionally. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
