My daughter had called earlier, her voice warm with excitement, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to our afternoon together. I could already picture their eager faces, the board games waiting on the living room table, the laughter that always filled the house when we were all together. \n\nBut as I set my phone down, my laptop chimed with a new email. It was from a client, attaching a standard contract for a routine service engagement. The deadline wasn\u2019t pressing, but I knew from experience that these \u201croutine\u201d documents often hid subtle pitfalls. My professional instinct urged me to review it now, to get ahead, to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks. \n\nI felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me\u2014my family expecting my full presence, my professional self whispering that diligence now could prevent headaches later. I stared at the screen, torn between the warmth of my family and the quiet call of responsibility, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
