My mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe really want you there this year. It\u2019s important.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, hopeful and a little pleading. As a sister, I knew how much these gatherings meant, how my absence would be noticed and quietly mourned. But at the same time, my work headset buzzed in my ear. The call queue was endless, and management had just sent another reminder: \u201cBreaks must be taken as scheduled. No exceptions.\u201d They were tracking every minute, and I\u2019d already been warned about stepping away outside my allotted time. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectation to be present for my family against the rigid demands of my job. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and anxiety twisting together. I wanted to be a good sister, but I also needed this job. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between replying to my family and logging my next break, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
