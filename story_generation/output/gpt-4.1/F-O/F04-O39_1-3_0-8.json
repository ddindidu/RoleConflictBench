It was a message from my sister: \u201cI got the scholarship! Can you come to the ceremony? It\u2019s in an hour.\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014she\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for her big moments. But before I could even reply, the site-wide evacuation alarm blared, echoing off the steel beams. Instinctively, I dropped my tools and looked to my foreman, who was already waving us toward the muster point. Site protocol was strict\u2014no exceptions, no lingering, no personal business. My team counted on me to follow the rules, to keep everyone safe. But my mind was racing, torn between the duty to my crew and the promise I\u2019d made as a brother. I could almost hear my sister\u2019s voice, hopeful and excited, as I joined the line of workers shuffling toward the exit, my phone heavy in my pocket and my chest tight with indecision."}
