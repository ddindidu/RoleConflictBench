The final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial demanded my full attention\u2014every detail could tip the scales of justice. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me that tonight was the annual family dinner, a tradition my family held sacred. This year, more than ever, they insisted on everyone\u2019s presence, emphasizing how important it was to honor our customs, especially after my father\u2019s recent illness. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, urging me not to let work come before family. But as a judge, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted; the case was complex, and both parties deserved my undivided focus. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the duty to my family and my responsibility to the court.
