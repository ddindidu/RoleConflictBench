He sounded upset, saying he felt I\u2019d been distant and dismissive lately. He wanted to talk, to clear the air and rebuild the trust we\u2019d always shared. I knew I should call him back right away, listen to his feelings, and try to resolve whatever misunderstanding had crept between us. But just as I reached for my phone, an email from the tax authority popped up on my screen\u2014a notice about a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return that needed an immediate response. As an accountant, I knew the stakes: missing the deadline could mean penalties for my client and damage to my professional reputation. My heart pounded as I stared at the two demands, feeling the weight of my brother\u2019s hurt and the urgency of my work. I wanted to be the sister he could rely on, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility to my client. The pressure built inside me, torn between the need to protect my family bond and the duty to uphold my professional standards."}
