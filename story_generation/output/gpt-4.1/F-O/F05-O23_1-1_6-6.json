She asked about my day, her eyes warm and expectant, and I wanted to share everything\u2014how the case I was working on had taken an unexpected turn, how the client\u2019s story had moved me. But I caught myself, remembering the strict boundaries of my profession. I mumbled something vague, feeling her curiosity linger in the air.\n\nLater that evening, at a networking event, a colleague leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHeard you\u2019re handling that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d The question was casual, almost friendly, but I felt the weight of my oath as a lawyer pressing down on me. I couldn\u2019t share details, not even the smallest hint, without betraying my client\u2019s trust.\n\nBack home, my wife noticed my distance. \u201cYou\u2019re so quiet lately. I just want to know what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d I wanted to be open, to let her in, but the lines between my roles blurred, pulling me in opposite directions. The pressure built inside me, torn between honesty at home and duty at work, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
