She waved, and I felt a familiar warmth\u2014she rarely visited me at work. As she approached, I noticed the bag in her hand and realized she was here to return something. \u201cHey, can I return this? I lost the receipt, but it\u2019s brand new,\u201d she whispered, glancing at the line behind her.\n\nMy heart sank. Store policy was clear: no returns without a receipt. But Mia was counting on me, and I knew she\u2019d been looking forward to using the money for our movie night later. I remembered our promise to include each other in plans, to always have each other\u2019s backs. But as a cashier, I was expected to follow the rules, no exceptions\u2014even for family. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the supportive sister Mia needed and the responsible employee my manager expected. My hands trembled as I looked from Mia\u2019s pleading eyes to the return policy taped to my register, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
