As his wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was on his mind, and share my own anxieties from the day. We\u2019d promised each other open communication, especially when life felt heavy. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my next patient was waiting, a routine check-up, but she always had a list of questions and needed reassurance. As her doctor, I owed her my full attention, clear explanations, and empathy. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My husband needed me to be present, to listen and share, but so did my patient. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between the expectations of being a supportive wife and a compassionate doctor, knowing that whichever I chose in this moment, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
