My son darted between the supermarket aisles, laughter echoing as he weaved past startled shoppers. As a father, I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that public spaces require consideration for others. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the clinic. My next patient, a young woman, had arrived early, coughing and sniffling. As a doctor, I was expected to be thorough, to listen carefully, to distinguish between a harmless cold and something more serious. My mind raced with the dual demands: the need to guide my son in the moment, and the responsibility to my patient waiting for my attention and expertise. I felt torn, my heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each expectation clashing with the other. I stood frozen, caught between the lessons I owed my child and the care I owed my patient, uncertain which path to take first."}
