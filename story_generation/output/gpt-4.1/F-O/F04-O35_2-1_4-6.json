Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone. It\u2019s important we\u2019re all together.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. As the oldest brother, I was expected to set the example, to show up and be present, not just physically but emotionally too.\n\nBut as I sat in the subway operator\u2019s break room, another email pinged. The transit authority was offering a professional development seminar\u2014optional, but everyone knew that those who signed up were seen as more committed. The catch: the sign-up deadline was tonight, right during dinner. Management expected us to be proactive, to show we cared about our roles and the future of the system.\n\nI felt the pressure building, my thumb hovering over the reply button. If I excused myself during dinner to respond, I\u2019d disappoint my family. If I waited until after, I might miss the opportunity and look uncommitted at work. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, torn between being the reliable brother and the dedicated subway operator."}
