It means so much to your grandmother.\u201d My heart thudded. This ceremony was a cornerstone of our family\u2019s tradition, and everyone expected me to honor it, to show respect and keep our values alive. But as I tried to focus, my work email pinged again. The subject line: \u201cURGENT: Supplier Halting Shipments.\u201d My boss\u2019s message was clear\u2014if I didn\u2019t resolve the overdue invoice with our major supplier today, our operations could grind to a halt. I was supposed to call the supplier, negotiate, and reassure them, all before the end of business hours. My mind raced, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the pressing demands of my job. I could feel the pressure mounting, my sense of responsibility pulling me in two directions at once, each role demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait."}
