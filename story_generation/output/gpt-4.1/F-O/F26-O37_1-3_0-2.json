It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when you started living on your own?\u201d I could hear the uncertainty in her words, the kind that only a grandparent\u2019s reassurance could soothe. But the clock was ticking\u2014my supervisor had just reminded me that every room needed to be spotless by noon, and I was already behind. My hands, raw from cleaning, ached to put down the brush and cradle the phone, to offer the wisdom she needed. Yet, the pressure to finish my work, to meet the standards expected of me as a cleaner, weighed heavily. I felt torn, my heart pulled toward my granddaughter\u2019s need for guidance, while my mind raced with the demands of my job. The mop in my hand felt heavier, and I stood frozen, caught between the roles that defined me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
