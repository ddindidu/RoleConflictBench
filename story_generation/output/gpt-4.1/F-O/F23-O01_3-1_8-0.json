As an architect, I was trained to catch every detail, to ensure every plan met the highest safety standards. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the new building plan\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to nag at my conscience. Fixing them would mean more hours, more back-and-forth with the client, and possibly delaying the project. \n\nBut at home, the pressure was mounting. As a step-parent, I was responsible for our family\u2019s financial stability. The home loan repayment loomed just two months away, and every extra hour at work meant overtime pay\u2014money we desperately needed. My partner trusted me to keep us afloat, to provide the security our blended family was still learning to trust. \n\nI stared at the plans, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I flagged the issues, I risked losing precious time and income. If I let them slide, I\u2019d be betraying my professional standards. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between the demands of my family and my duty as an architect."}
