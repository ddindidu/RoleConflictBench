It means so much to your grandmother.\u201d My heart squeezed. This ceremony was more than a ritual\u2014it was a thread tying generations together, and my family expected me to honor it, to show I hadn\u2019t forgotten where I came from. But as I scrolled through my emails, my client\u2019s anxious words echoed in my mind. The court hearing was set for the same day, and I was their only hope to keep their business afloat. My firm expected nothing less than total commitment, and my client\u2019s future depended on my preparation and presence. I felt torn, the weight of tradition pressing from one side, the duty to my client from the other. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety tangling together. How could I choose between my family\u2019s trust and my professional responsibility? Both sides needed me, and I couldn\u2019t see a way to be enough for both."}
