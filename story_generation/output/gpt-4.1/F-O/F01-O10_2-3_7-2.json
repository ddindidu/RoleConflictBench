The email from the external auditor blinked insistently in my inbox, demanding the quarterly financial statements by tonight. My mind raced through spreadsheets and ledgers, searching for any discrepancies that could trip me up. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter. She\u2019d started her new job today, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement\u2014photos, voice notes, everyone chiming in. I knew they expected me to call, to share in her joy, to be the supportive grandfather who never misses a moment. But the weight of the audit pressed down on me. If I didn\u2019t get these records right, the consequences could be serious. My heart tugged me toward my family, but my professional duty anchored me to the desk. I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold precision of my work, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
