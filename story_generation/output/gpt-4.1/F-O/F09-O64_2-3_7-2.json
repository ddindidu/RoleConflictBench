My feet ached, but I kept my focus sharp as I counted the thick stack of bills for the final deposit. Every cent mattered\u2014at home, my kids needed groceries, rent was due, and I was the one who had to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. As a mother, I felt the weight of every dollar, knowing my family depended on me to keep us afloat. But as a cashier, I had to be precise, double-checking every transaction, every receipt, because one mistake could mean a shortage I\u2019d have to explain, or worse, pay for. My manager expected perfection, no excuses. My hands trembled as I recounted the cash, my mind racing with thoughts of my children\u2019s empty lunchboxes and the bills piling up on the kitchen table. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s needs and my job\u2019s demands\u2014pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
