I promised her I\u2019d be there, cheering her on, just like I always have. But as I sat in the operator\u2019s seat, guiding the subway through its evening run, a piercing alarm shattered my thoughts. The control panel flashed red: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I stop the train immediately, report the issue, and ensure every passenger\u2019s safety. I glanced at the clock. If I followed procedure, I\u2019d miss the family celebration entirely. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my daughter\u2019s reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t be late, Dad!\u201d The weight of my uniform pressed heavier than usual. My family needed me, but so did the hundreds of strangers trusting me to get them home safely.
