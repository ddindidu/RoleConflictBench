I glanced at my little brother, who was skipping ahead on the sidewalk, humming to himself. We always walked home together, and Mom trusted me to keep him safe, especially after what happened last year. But the contractor\u2019s texts kept coming, each one more frantic than the last. I tried to type a quick reply, but my brother darted toward the curb, chasing a stray soccer ball. My heart pounded. I was supposed to be watching him, not juggling work emails. The pressure from the site was relentless\u2014if I didn\u2019t keep things moving, I\u2019d let down my team and risk my reputation. But if I took my eyes off my brother, even for a second, I\u2019d be breaking the promise I made to my family. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the demands of the job I\u2019d worked so hard for and the responsibility I could never ignore."}
