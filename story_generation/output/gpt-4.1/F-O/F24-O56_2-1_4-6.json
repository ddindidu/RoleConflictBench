I knew how much these gatherings meant to her, especially since I\u2019d joined the family. She wanted us to feel close, to build memories together. I wanted that too, but my last client of the day was just settling into my chair, her hair already damp and fragrant with shampoo. \u201cI washed it right before I came,\u201d she said, smiling. \n\nSalon policy was clear: every client gets a wash and condition, no exceptions. My boss insisted it was about consistency and hygiene, but I could see the annoyance flicker in my client\u2019s eyes when I mentioned it. If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be bending the rules and risking a reprimand. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be late for dinner\u2014again\u2014and disappoint my stepfamily, who already felt I was distant. My hands hovered over the sink, my mind torn between the expectations of my job and the hope of finally fitting in at home."}
