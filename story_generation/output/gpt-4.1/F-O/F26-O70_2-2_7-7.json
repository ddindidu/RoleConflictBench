Family expects me to be present, to share in these moments, to keep our bond strong. But as I reached for my phone, it buzzed with a message from a customer: \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly, to be polite and professional, no matter how frazzled I feel. My mind raced. If I called my granddaughter now, I\u2019d be late replying to the customer, risking a complaint. If I answered the customer first, I\u2019d miss the chance to share in my granddaughter\u2019s joy while it was fresh. I could almost hear both voices in my head\u2014one eager and proud, the other impatient and demanding. My heart tugged in two directions, each role asking for my attention, each expecting me to put them first. I stared at my phone, torn, unsure which call to make."}
