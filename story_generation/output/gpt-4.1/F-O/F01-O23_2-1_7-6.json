The whole family was eager to hear every detail, and I felt the warmth of being included in their excitement. As a grandfather, I knew how important it was to stay connected, to show interest, and to share in these moments. Later that evening, I attended a networking event for lawyers. A colleague, who happened to be a distant relative, leaned in and asked about a high-profile case I was handling. \u201cJust between us,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on with your client?\u201d I felt the weight of my profession settle on my shoulders. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, unable to share even the smallest detail. Yet, as a grandfather and family member, there was an unspoken expectation to be open, to trust, and to connect. The two worlds collided inside me, and I could feel the tension rising, torn between loyalty to my family and my duty to my client."}
