But today, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cCan you call? I need you.\u201d I called during my break, and her voice trembled as she confided in me about her fears of losing her job. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the strong one. I wanted to stay on the line, to offer the comfort she sought, but as I returned to the operator\u2019s cabin, a piercing alarm blared. The control panel flashed red: brake system malfunction. My training kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report immediately, stop the train, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, desperate and raw, but the passengers\u2019 lives were now in my hands. My heart pounded as I gripped the radio, torn between the child my mother needed and the operator my passengers depended on. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call to answer first."}
