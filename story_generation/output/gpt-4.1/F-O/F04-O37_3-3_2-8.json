It was my younger sister, her name flashing on the screen. She never called during my shift unless it was serious. I hesitated, glancing at the mop in my gloved hands and the checklist clipped to my cart. The supervisor had just reminded us that under no circumstances were we to remove our protective gear or use our phones in the cleaning zones\u2014strict hygiene rules, no exceptions. But my sister\u2019s voice, shaky and urgent, came through the line. She was crying, needing me, her big brother, to listen and help her through a rough moment. I could hear the desperation in her voice, the kind that always made me drop everything for her. But now, standing in my uniform, surrounded by the smell of disinfectant, I felt torn. My job demanded I put safety first, keep my gloves on, and stay focused. My heart demanded I be there for my sister, no matter what. I stood frozen, phone in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the brother she needed and the cleaner I was expected to be."}
