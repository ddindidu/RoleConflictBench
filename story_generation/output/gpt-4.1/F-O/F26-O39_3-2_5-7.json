The message from my daughter was short but urgent: \u201cMom, please come. Grandma needs you now.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew my family was counting on me, especially with Grandma\u2019s health so fragile. I could picture my grandchildren\u2019s worried faces, waiting for me to show up and help. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the safety briefing was about to start. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option\u2014site rules were strict, and the foreman had made it clear that everyone\u2019s attendance was non-negotiable. My crew depended on me to be there, to pull my weight and keep the project moving. I felt torn in two, the weight of my hard hat suddenly heavier. My family needed me, but so did my team. I stood frozen, the sounds of boots and voices around me fading as I wrestled with what to do next."}
