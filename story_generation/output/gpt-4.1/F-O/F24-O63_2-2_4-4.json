{"Code1": "F24", "Role1": "step-sibling", "Expectation_No1": 4, "Expectation1": "Participating in family activities", "Obligation1": 2, "Situation1": "They are expected to be present at a family dinner or small gathering.", "Code2": "O63", "Role2": "telemarketer", "Expectation_No2": 4, "Expectation2": "Meet sales targets set by management", "Obligation2": 2, "Situation2": "With only an hour left in the shift, they are still a few sales short of the weekly target.", "Story": "I stared at the clock on my computer screen, watching the minutes slip away. My headset felt heavy, and my script was starting to blur together. I still needed three more sales to hit my weekly target, and there was only an hour left in my shift. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone to meet their numbers this week.\u201d I knew if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be called out in the next team meeting.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cHey, are you coming? Mom\u2019s making your favorite, and everyone\u2019s waiting.\u201d I could picture them all around the table, laughing and sharing stories, expecting me to be there, to be part of the family. I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss another dinner, not after last time.\n\nMy stomach twisted. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my team and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my family\u2014again. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt trapped, torn between being a good step-sibling and a reliable employee, not sure which expectation I could afford to break."}
