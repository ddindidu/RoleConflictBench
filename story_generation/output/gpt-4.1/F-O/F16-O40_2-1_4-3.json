My partner had left a gentle reminder on the fridge: \u201cPlease don\u2019t forget the laundry\u2014kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I knew how important it was to keep the household running smoothly, to share the load so neither of us felt overwhelmed. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a client, eager for a quote on a custom bookshelf. The job was urgent\u2014if I didn\u2019t estimate the materials and place the order today, the project would be delayed, and my reputation as a reliable carpenter would take a hit. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present and helpful at home, and the demand to be responsive and professional at work. My hands hovered between the laundry basket and my phone, my mind racing, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my craft."}
