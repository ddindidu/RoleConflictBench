My last client of the day, Mrs. Lee, had just arrived, her hair damp and clinging to her forehead from her gym session. She smiled apologetically, mentioning she was in a rush and needed a quick wash and cut before her evening meeting. I nodded, trying to focus on her needs, but my mind kept drifting to my phone, where a reminder blinked: \u201cPick up kids from school at 3:15.\u201d My son had been looking forward to showing me his art project, and my daughter had begged me not to be late again. I could almost hear their voices, see their faces searching the crowd of parents. Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair needed extra care today, and I knew she expected my full attention. But the minutes were slipping away, and I felt torn, pulled between the chair in front of me and the school gates across town.
