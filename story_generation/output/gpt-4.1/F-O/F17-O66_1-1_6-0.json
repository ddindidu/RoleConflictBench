Lately, she\u2019s been quieter, and I\u2019ve made it a habit to check in, to ask if everything\u2019s okay at home. I know she expects me to be there, to listen, to reassure her that I care. But right now, I have a passenger in the back seat, humming to a tune, relaxed, heading to a meeting with time to spare. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to focus on the road, to get them there safely and on time, no distractions. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014should I call Mom back at the next stoplight, risking my attention on the job, or wait until the ride is over, knowing she might need me now? The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I can\u2019t give at the same time. My hands grip the wheel tighter as I wrestle with what to do next."}
