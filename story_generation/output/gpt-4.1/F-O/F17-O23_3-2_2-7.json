She expects a quick reply, maybe a funny story about work, and I know she worries if I don\u2019t answer soon. I glance at the clock\u2014almost lunchtime, the only quiet moment I\u2019ll get. But just as I start typing, an assistant from another department knocks on my door, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files. She says it\u2019ll save everyone time, but I know she isn\u2019t authorized. My mind races: I want to help her, to be seen as a team player, but my duty as a lawyer is clear\u2014protect client information at all costs. Meanwhile, my mom\u2019s message sits unread, and I feel the familiar tug of guilt. I want to be the attentive child she expects, but I can\u2019t risk even a hint of confidential information slipping out, not even in a casual story. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone and the assistant, torn between the roles I\u2019m supposed to fulfill, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
