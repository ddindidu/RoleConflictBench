The crane was already holding it midair, swaying slightly, and I knew every second counted. But the message was from my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019d just started her new job, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to listen and celebrate every little victory. I could almost hear her voice, eager and proud, waiting for my reply. But the men on the site were counting on me too; if I didn\u2019t help now, the whole operation would stall, and safety was on the line. My hands trembled, torn between the weight of the beam and the weight of my promise. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers and the silent hope of my granddaughter, both expecting me to be present, both needing me in different ways. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between steel and love, unsure which world to answer first."}
