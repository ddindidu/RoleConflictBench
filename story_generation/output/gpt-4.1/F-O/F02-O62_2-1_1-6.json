My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I scanned the pool, I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, giggling, unsupervised. My supervisor had drilled it into us: never leave the pool deck unattended, always enforce the rules. The parents trusted me to keep their children safe, just as my daughter trusted me to show up for her. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my little girl\u2019s face in my mind, the laughter of the swimmers echoing in my ears. I felt torn, the pressure building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
