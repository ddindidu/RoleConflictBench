Mom wanted a picnic, Dad suggested a movie, and my brother was already planning the snacks. I felt their eyes on me, waiting for my input, wanting me to be present, to be part of these simple, precious moments. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. A patient had just arrived in the ER, their symptoms severe and mysterious. The team needed me to help diagnose, to bring my expertise and calm to a situation where every second mattered. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s expectant faces to the glowing phone. I wanted to be the sibling who showed up, who laughed and planned and belonged. But I was also the doctor, the one who was supposed to save lives, to be reliable in crisis. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, torn by the demands of love and duty."}
