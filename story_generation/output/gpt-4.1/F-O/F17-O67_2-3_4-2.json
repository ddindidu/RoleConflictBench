It was the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s passing, a tradition we never missed. The house was filled with the scent of my grandmother\u2019s cooking, and everyone expected me to be there, to honor our family and show respect. My phone buzzed sharply in my pocket. Dispatch was calling\u2014a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. My heart pounded as I looked at my family, their faces full of expectation, and then at my phone, the screen flashing with urgency. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s traditions pressing down on me, while the responsibility to save lives pulled me in the opposite direction. My hands trembled as I tried to steady my breath, caught between the duty to my family and the duty to strangers in desperate need."}
