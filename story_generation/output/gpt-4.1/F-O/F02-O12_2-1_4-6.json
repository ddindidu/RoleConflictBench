I know I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why we need to respect others\u2019 space\u2014teach him about discipline, about being considerate. That\u2019s what a good father does. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I see the message from QA: another user has reported the UI glitch. It\u2019s minor, but the team expects me to jump in, patch it, and reassure everyone that I\u2019m on top of things. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s laughter echoes, but so does the ping of my phone. I want to be present, to guide him, but I also know my team is waiting, counting on me to fix things quickly. My heart pounds as I stand in the cereal aisle, torn between the lesson my son needs and the responsibility my job demands."}
