She was fidgety, distracted, and I could see she needed my full attention to really absorb the lesson. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my next client, Mrs. Lee, would be arriving at the salon in ten minutes. I knew she always appreciated a warm greeting and a few minutes of friendly conversation before her appointment. The receptionist could handle the check-in, but Mrs. Lee always looked for me, expecting that personal touch. My daughter looked up at me, waiting for my next instruction, her eyes searching for approval. At the same time, I pictured Mrs. Lee walking in, scanning the room for my familiar face. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the responsibility of shaping my child\u2019s character, and the professional expectation to make my client feel valued. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
