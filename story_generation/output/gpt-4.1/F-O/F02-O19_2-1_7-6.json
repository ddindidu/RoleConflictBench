New drugs, new protocols\u2014so much to keep up with. My mind wandered to the bills waiting at home, the groceries we needed, the shoes my daughter had outgrown. I knew I had to stay sharp at work, keep up with the changes, or risk falling behind. But every minute I spent reading about new medications felt like a minute stolen from figuring out how to stretch our budget, how to make sure my family had what they needed. My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cCan you pick up milk and bread on your way home?\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to provide, and my responsibility to be the best pharmacist I could. I stared at the newsletter, the words blurring, torn between the demands of my profession and the needs of my family, unsure which to put first."}
