It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my parents. They looked forward to these calls, and so did I\u2014hearing about Dad\u2019s garden, Mom\u2019s new recipes, and sharing bits of my week. But tonight, my mind was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, an urgent email from the tax authority landed in my inbox: a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return, needing clarification by tomorrow morning. As an accountant, I knew the stakes\u2014missing this deadline could mean penalties for my client and a black mark on my record.
