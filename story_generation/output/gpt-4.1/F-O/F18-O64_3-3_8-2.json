I\u2019m behind the register, counting out a stack of bills for a customer, double-checking every note because one slip could mean a huge loss. My manager\u2019s watching, expecting perfection. Out of the corner of my eye, through the store\u2019s glass front, I spot my little brother. He\u2019s waiting for me, fidgeting on the curb, and suddenly he steps off, not even glancing at the traffic. My stomach twists. I\u2019m supposed to keep him safe\u2014Mom always says, \u201cWatch out for your brother.\u201d But my hands are full of cash, and the customer is impatient, tapping the counter. If I leave, I risk a mistake or worse, suspicion. If I stay, my brother could get hurt. The weight of both roles presses down on me, my mind torn between the register and the street, between being a good cashier and a good sibling. I freeze, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds, my heart in my throat as I try to decide what to do."}
