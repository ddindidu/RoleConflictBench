My son darts past me, giggling, weaving between carts and startled shoppers. I catch the glare of an older woman as he nearly bumps into her. My client\u2019s voice is tense, asking for clarification on a charge. I know I need to respond clearly and professionally, but my mind is split. I should be teaching my son about respect and discipline, not letting him run wild. But if I pause to correct him, I risk losing the client\u2019s trust\u2014or worse, their business. My heart pounds as I try to keep my voice steady, glancing at my son, torn between the urgent needs of my job and my responsibility as a parent. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I don\u2019t know which to choose."}
