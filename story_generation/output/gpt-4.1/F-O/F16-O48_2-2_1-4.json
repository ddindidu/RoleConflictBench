My partner sat across from me, eyes red and voice trembling as they described the impossible choice their boss had given them. They needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice, my presence. I reached for their hand, trying to listen, but my mind kept drifting to the hospital. My shift had just ended, but I\u2019d gotten a message from the nurse: one of my patients, Mrs. Lee, was showing slightly elevated vital signs after her procedure. I was supposed to check on her, take her temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record everything for the next shift. I could picture her anxious face, waiting for someone to come. My partner\u2019s voice wavered, searching my face for comfort. My heart twisted, torn between the person I loved and the patient who depended on me. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
