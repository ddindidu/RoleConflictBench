My heart warmed at the thought of little hands tugging at my sleeve, stories and laughter filling the house. But as I stood behind the pharmacy counter, white coat crisp, I scanned a prescription for a common cold\u2014something I\u2019d done a thousand times. Still, I paused, double-checking the label, the dosage, the patient\u2019s name. The expectation was clear: no mistakes, ever. My mind flickered back to the family group chat, messages piling up, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you, Grandma!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My daughter expected my presence, my undivided attention, but the pharmacy needed my focus, my precision. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice: \u201cAccuracy is everything.\u201d My heart tugged one way, my professional duty the other. I stood there, prescription in hand, torn between the warmth of family and the cold clarity of responsibility, not yet knowing which role would win."}
