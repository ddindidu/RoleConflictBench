The cabinetry project was at a critical stage\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish assembling the frames and coordinate with the electrician today, the whole schedule would slip. The contractor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays.\u201d But then my phone buzzed with a reminder: school pick-up in thirty minutes. My kids would be waiting at the gate, eyes searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I could picture their faces, the disappointment if I was late again. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the reliable dad, the one who showed up, but I also needed to be the dependable carpenter, the one the team could count on. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each tugging me in a different direction. I wiped my hands on my jeans, staring at the unfinished cabinet, the clock ticking louder in my ears, torn between the workshop and the schoolyard."}
