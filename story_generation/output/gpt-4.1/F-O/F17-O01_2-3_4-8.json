The city council wanted updates, and my inbox overflowed with urgent requests. The deadline for the new community center loomed, and every minute counted. Yet, my thoughts kept drifting to home, where my parents had called a family meeting for tonight. They\u2019d been talking more and more about our traditions\u2014how important it was to keep them alive, especially now. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that missing the gathering would be a sign of disrespect, a break in the chain of values passed down for generations. But my team needed me; a delay now could unravel months of work. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectations of my family and my profession pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the legacy I was born into and the one I was building on my own."}
