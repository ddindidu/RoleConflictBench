It was my daughter, her voice trembling as she explained that my grandson had been rushed to the hospital. \u201cWe need you here, Mom,\u201d she pleaded. My heart clenched; as a grandmother, I knew my family needed me, and I wanted nothing more than to be by their side, offering comfort and support.\n\nJust then, my assistant knocked, asking for access to confidential client files. She insisted it would help her prepare documents more efficiently, but she wasn\u2019t familiar with the case, and I knew the ethical boundaries I was sworn to uphold as a lawyer. Granting her access would be a breach of trust, yet refusing her would delay our work and add to my stress.\n\nTorn between the urgent pull of my family and the unyielding demands of my profession, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of being a present grandmother and a principled lawyer, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
