My phone buzzed in my bag\u2014another message from my brother, reminding me that the family was waiting for me to join the holiday barbecue. Mom had made my favorite pie, and Dad was firing up the grill, everyone expecting me to be there, laughing and sharing stories. But here, at the pool, I was the only lifeguard on duty. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, nothing urgent, but I knew how quickly things could change. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever take your eyes off the water.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, and the responsibility of keeping these swimmers safe. My heart pounded as I stared at the water, torn between the pull of home and the duty of my post, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
