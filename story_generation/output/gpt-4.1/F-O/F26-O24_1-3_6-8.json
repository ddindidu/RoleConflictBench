My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a rare breach of protocol, but today was different. The family group chat was alive with messages about the upcoming holiday, my daughter\u2019s gentle reminders that the grandchildren missed me, my son\u2019s plea for a video call to plan the menu. I felt the familiar tug of longing, the ache to be present, to laugh and share stories as we always did this time of year.\n\nJust then, my clerk hurried over, face pale, and handed me a note. The Supreme Court had just issued a ruling\u2014one that upended the very foundation of the instructions I was about to give the jury. My mind raced. I was expected to be the pillar of legal knowledge, to adapt instantly, to ensure justice was served. But my heart was still with my family, their voices echoing in my mind, the weight of their expectations pressing against the gravity of my judicial duty. I stared at the bench, torn between the law and the love that defined me, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
