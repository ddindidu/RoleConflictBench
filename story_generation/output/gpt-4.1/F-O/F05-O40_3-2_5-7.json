She looked at me with that mix of hope and urgency, asking if I could help her clean the house, move some furniture, and make sure everything was perfect. I could see how much it meant to her\u2014she wanted her family to feel welcome, and she needed me to share the load. But just as I was about to grab the vacuum, my phone buzzed. It was a client, sounding anxious. Their deck had splintered overnight, and they needed it fixed before their own guests arrived for a birthday party. As a carpenter, I know how important it is to respond quickly\u2014my reputation depends on it, and I hate letting people down. I stood in the hallway, broom in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My wife\u2019s expectant eyes met mine, and I could hear the urgency in my client\u2019s voice echoing in my head. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
