He looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in his eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, trying to sound present and warm, even as my phone buzzed in my pocket for the tenth time in as many minutes. He shrugged, \u201cJust a lot of little things. Nothing big, but it adds up, you know?\u201d I nodded, wanting to sit beside him, to listen and offer comfort, but my mind was already racing through the Slack messages piling up. The product launch had been moved up\u2014again\u2014and now architects from three different teams were waiting on my input before they could move forward. I could almost feel the weight of their expectations pressing through the screen. My husband started telling me about a meeting that went sideways, and I tried to focus, but the urgency of my other world tugged at me. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, but I also knew that every minute I delayed meant more people waiting, more pressure building. I stood there, torn, heart and mind pulled in opposite directions, unsure which world to step into first."}
