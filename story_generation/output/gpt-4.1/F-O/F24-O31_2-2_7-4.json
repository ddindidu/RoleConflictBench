My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my stepbrother, Jamie, again. He\u2019d been texting all morning about trying a new skateboard trick on the old, crumbling ramp behind our house. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But as a police officer, I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post at the accident scene; people were counting on me to keep the intersection safe, to prevent another crash. I could picture Jamie, helmet askew, grinning as he eyed the ramp\u2019s jagged edge. My heart pounded with worry\u2014what if he got hurt while I was here, doing my duty? I felt torn in two, the weight of both uniforms\u2014family and law\u2014pressing down on me, each demanding I be somewhere else, someone else, at the very same moment."}
