My stepson, Jamie, had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he asked if I\u2019d be there. I promised I would. But just as I was about to leave for the school, my work phone buzzed. The factory\u2019s operator was on the line again, his voice tense. He\u2019d been struggling with the new press, and every time he tried to adjust the settings, he made things worse\u2014wasting material, racking up costs. My supervisor\u2019s message was clear: \u201cYou need to guide him, now. We can\u2019t afford more mistakes.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure building in my chest. Jamie was counting on me to show up, to prove I cared. But the operator was waiting, and if I didn\u2019t help, the company would lose even more money\u2014and my reputation as a reliable repairer would take a hit. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the classroom and the factory floor, wishing I could split myself in two."}
