My parents chimed in, their faces bright with anticipation, and I felt the familiar warmth of belonging. They expected me to be there, to join in, to make memories together. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the notice posted at the construction site earlier that day. There\u2019s an optional training session next Saturday, and the foreman hinted that those who attend might be considered for more responsibility. I know how important it is to show commitment, to be seen as a team player, especially if I want to move up. The two worlds tug at me\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness and my own drive to prove myself at work. As the conversation at the table swirled around me, I felt the pressure mounting, unsure how I could possibly meet both sets of expectations."}
