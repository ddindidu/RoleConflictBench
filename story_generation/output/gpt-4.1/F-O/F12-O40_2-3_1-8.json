They needed an urgent repair plan, and as their trusted carpenter, I knew the safety of their family depended on my quick response. My mind raced with measurements, materials, and the logistics of fitting the job into my already packed schedule. Just as I started sketching out a plan, my husband walked in, his face drawn and anxious. He\u2019d been wrestling with a tough decision at work, and tonight he needed me\u2014his wife\u2014to listen, to offer advice, to be his anchor. I could see the hope in his eyes, the silent plea for support. My heart twisted as I glanced between him and my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be fully present for him, to reassure him, but the urgent responsibility of the repair gnawed at me. The expectations from both sides pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
