The store is quiet, and I\u2019m grateful for the lull, but my mind is elsewhere. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my son\u2019s teacher has messaged again. He\u2019s been talking back, refusing to share, and I promised myself I\u2019d address it tonight. I know I need to sit him down, talk about kindness and respect, show him the right way. That\u2019s what a good mother does.\n\nBut as another customer approaches, I push those thoughts aside, focusing on the friendly service expected of me. I can\u2019t let my worries show; I have to be patient, cheerful, attentive. Yet, every beep of the scanner reminds me of the conversation waiting at home, the lesson I owe my child. I feel torn, stretched between the gentle guidance my son needs and the pleasant, undistracted service my customers deserve. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, and I wonder how I can possibly do justice to either."}
