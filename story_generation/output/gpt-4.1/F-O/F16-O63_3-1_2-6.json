My phone buzzes with a message from my partner: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I know they\u2019re struggling, barely holding it together after the news from this morning. My heart aches to be there, to offer the comfort they expect from me as their spouse. But I\u2019m at work, and even though the call volume is light and my supervisor is lenient about breaks today, I\u2019m supposed to stick to my schedule. If I take an unscheduled break, I risk setting a bad example or missing a sudden influx of calls. My mind races\u2014my partner needs me now, but my job expects me to be present and reliable. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the urge to step away and call home, and the responsibility to stay at my post. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the growing knot in my stomach as I try to decide what to do next."}
