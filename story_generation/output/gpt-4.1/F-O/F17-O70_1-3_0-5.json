I glance at the screen\u2014it's a message from Mom: \"How are you? Haven't heard from you today.\" I know she worries, especially on weekends when I get busy. She expects a quick reply, maybe a call, just to know I'm okay. But right now, my focus has to be on the delivery. The instructions are clear: hand this package directly to the recipient, check their ID, and get a signature. No distractions. My supervisor drilled it into us\u2014no mistakes, especially with sensitive deliveries. I feel the pressure mounting, my thumb hovering over the phone. If I text Mom now, I risk fumbling the package or missing the recipient. If I wait, she'll worry, maybe even call, and I can't have my phone ringing in the middle of this. My heart pounds as I stand at the door, torn between being a good child and a responsible delivery person, both roles demanding my attention at the exact same moment."}
