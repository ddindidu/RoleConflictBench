Hope you\u2019re okay. Love you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Saturday, 3:15 p.m. I promised myself I\u2019d check in with her and Dad every weekend, just a quick text or call so they know I care. But today, the office is tense. It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and my manager keeps pacing behind our cubicles, reminding us that if we don\u2019t hit our sales target, we\u2019ll lose our bonuses. My headset is glued to my ear, my script open in front of me, and every second not dialing feels like a risk. I know if I pause to text my parents, I might miss a call that could make the difference. But if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll feel that familiar guilt\u2014like I\u2019m letting them down, again. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between the ping of family expectation and the relentless pressure of my job."}
