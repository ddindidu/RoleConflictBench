My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019ve done the rest.\u201d I promised her I would, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to help keep our little world running smoothly. I reach for the first shirt, determined to finally get it done, when my radio crackles to life. \u201cUnit 12, we have a call\u2014possible broken femur, Main and 5th.
