Can you come home early?\u201d I could picture them both, faces drawn, weighed down by the stress that seemed to have settled in our house lately. I wanted to be there, to sit with them, maybe make tea, just listen. But my shift as a subway operator was about to start, and the pre-departure check was waiting. The intercom crackled, reminding me that the train wouldn\u2019t leave without my sign-off. Passengers depended on me to keep them safe and on time, even if today\u2019s check was only for non-critical systems. My supervisor expected nothing less than full attention to protocol. I stared at my reflection in the window, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to hundreds of strangers. My heart ached with the urge to rush home, but my hands moved automatically toward the checklist, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
