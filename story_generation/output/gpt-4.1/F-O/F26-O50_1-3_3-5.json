My grandkids had been talking about it for weeks, and I\u2019d promised to bring my famous apple pie. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being together. But just as I was about to pack up, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent call from the factory. The line manager\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cThe main conveyor\u2019s bearing is screeching. If it fails, we\u2019ll lose hours of production.\u201d I knew what that meant\u2014lost revenue, angry clients, and a mess only I could fix. My toolbox sat by the door, a silent reminder of my responsibility. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family expected my presence, my stories, my love. The factory needed my skills, my steady hands, my experience. I stood there, keys in one hand, pie in the other, heart pounding as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
