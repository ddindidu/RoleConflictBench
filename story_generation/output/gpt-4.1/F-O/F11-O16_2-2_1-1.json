Fever, joint pain, a rash\u2014none of it fit neatly into a box, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a doctor pressing down on me. I needed to focus, to piece together the clues and give my patient the answers they desperately needed. But the message was from my younger sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her sister, I was supposed to be there, to listen and support her when she was hurting. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient and the pull of family. If I stepped away now, I might miss a crucial detail in the case. If I ignored my sister, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unable to choose which part of myself to answer first."}
