Miss you.\u201d I wanted to call her, to listen and reassure her, to be the husband she needed. But the line at the register was growing, and my break was almost over. I tucked my phone away, forcing a smile as I returned to the counter. The next customer slammed her groceries down, voice sharp and impatient. I could feel my own stress rising, but I knew I had to stay calm, friendly, patient\u2014what the store expected of me. My mind kept drifting to my wife, picturing her alone on the couch, waiting for a kind word. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be present for her and the demand to serve each customer with a smile. My heart ached with guilt and frustration, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing I had to choose which role to fulfill in this moment."}
