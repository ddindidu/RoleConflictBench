My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cDid you get a chance to fold these?\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised I\u2019d help more, share the load, be present at home. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another email from the site manager. The hospital project\u2019s inspection is tomorrow, and I\u2019m the lead architect. If I miss a single safety detail, lives could be at risk. My mind races with checklists: fire exits, structural reinforcements, compliance codes. I glance at the laundry, then at my laptop, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My husband expects a partner, someone who keeps the home running. My team expects a leader, someone who ensures no corner is cut. My heart pounds as I stand between the two, torn by the demands that refuse to let go."}
