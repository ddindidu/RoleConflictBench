I know it\u2019s my mom\u2014she always expects a quick reply, especially since Dad\u2019s surgery last month. We talk every day, and she worries if I don\u2019t answer right away. But right now, I\u2019m sitting beside Mrs. Lee, who\u2019s just been told her cancer has returned. She\u2019s sobbing, clutching my hand, her whole body shaking. My supervisor expects me to be present, to offer comfort and listen, not to be distracted by personal calls. I can feel my mom\u2019s anxiety through the unanswered messages, but I can\u2019t leave Mrs. Lee alone in this moment. My heart aches, torn between the daughter my parents need and the nursing assistant my patient needs. I stare at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
