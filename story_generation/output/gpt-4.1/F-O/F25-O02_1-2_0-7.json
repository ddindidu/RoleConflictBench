Can we catch up this weekend?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Saturday afternoon. I know she wants to feel included, to know I\u2019m okay, to keep the fragile bond we\u2019ve built since Dad remarried. I type a quick reply, promising to call soon, but my laptop screen is filled with Gantt charts and Slack notifications. Management is pushing for project estimates by Monday, and I\u2019m the only one who understands the new module\u2019s complexity. My team is waiting for my numbers to finalize the roadmap. I feel the weight of both worlds: the gentle tug of family, the relentless pull of work. If I focus on the call, I\u2019ll lose precious hours and risk letting my team down. If I ignore my stepmom, I\u2019ll reinforce the distance she fears. My fingers hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of being a good step-child and a reliable engineer."}
