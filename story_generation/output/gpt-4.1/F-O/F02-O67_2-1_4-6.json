As a father, I knew I should have stopped him, knelt down, and explained why running indoors was dangerous and disrespectful. But I was already late for my shift, and the thought of disappointing my team gnawed at me. Now, as I navigated city traffic, the weight of both roles pressed on me. My supervisor expected me to drive safely, no matter how tight the schedule. My son needed guidance, discipline, and patience. I replayed the scene in my head\u2014his laughter echoing, the disapproving glances from strangers, my hurried, ineffective scolding. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the urge to call home and talk to him, and the responsibility to focus on the road. The expectations of being a good father and a reliable ambulance driver pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which role to answer first."}
