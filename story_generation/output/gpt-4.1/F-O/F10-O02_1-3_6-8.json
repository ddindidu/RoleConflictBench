My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014just to talk, to check in, to feel like I was there for them. I glanced at the clock. The project planning meeting was in twenty minutes, and my manager had already reminded me twice that the client was waiting on my effort estimates. Without them, the contract couldn\u2019t move forward, and the whole team was depending on me. My mind raced, torn between dialing home and running through the numbers one more time. I could hear Mom\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but worried, and at the same time, I felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing down. I wanted to be the daughter who noticed when something was off at home, but I was also the engineer who couldn\u2019t let everyone down. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more right now."}
