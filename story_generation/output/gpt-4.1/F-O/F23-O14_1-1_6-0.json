This was my chance to gather the data I needed, to finally test the hypothesis I\u2019d been working on for months. But as I closed my laptop, I caught sight of the crumpled flyer on the kitchen table\u2014an ad for the Nintendo my stepson, Ethan, had been talking about for weeks. I\u2019d promised him we\u2019d go pick it up together, and he\u2019d been counting down the days, his excitement infectious. \n\nBut the price tag gnawed at me. Money was tight, and I knew I should be careful, especially with the uncertainty of grant renewals. As a step-parent, I wanted to keep my promise, to show Ethan he could rely on me. As a scientist, I felt the pull of my work, the need to seize every opportunity, even if the experiment could technically wait.
