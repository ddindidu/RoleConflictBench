My stepmother\u2019s voice carried, reminding everyone about the upcoming family gathering and how important it was to honor the traditions\u2014every detail, from the food to the seating arrangement, had to be just right. She caught my eye and smiled, expecting me to help organize, to show I belonged by upholding these customs.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the client meeting was in two hours, and I hadn\u2019t double-checked the contractor\u2019s progress. As an architect, I was supposed to keep everything on track, but I\u2019d been reviewing timelines only in passing, trusting things would work out. Now, I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my team needed me to be thorough, to catch issues before they became problems.\n\nI could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family wanted me present, invested in tradition, while my job demanded focus and efficiency. I stared at the blueprints, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of being a good step-child and a responsible architect, unsure which role to answer first."}
