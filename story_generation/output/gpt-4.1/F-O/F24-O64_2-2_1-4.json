He\u2019d come home from school, shoulders slumped, eyes red, barely mumbling a word. I wanted to sit with him, listen, maybe make him laugh like I usually do. But I had to rush out the door, promising I\u2019d talk later. Now, behind the register, I tried to focus on scanning groceries, but my mind kept drifting back to him.\n\nA woman approached, holding a blender. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she said, but when I asked for a receipt, she shook her head. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager watched from across the aisle, expecting me to enforce the rules. But the woman looked desperate, explaining she\u2019d lost the receipt during a stressful week. I felt the pressure mounting: at home, I was supposed to be the understanding, supportive sibling; here, I was expected to be the by-the-book cashier. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between compassion and responsibility, knowing whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
