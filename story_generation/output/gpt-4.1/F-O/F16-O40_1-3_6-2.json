They looked at me, expecting more than my usual nod. I knew I should open up, share about my own day, maybe talk about the near-miss with the faulty drill or the stress of keeping the crew safe. But my mind was already racing ahead to tomorrow\u2014there was a big job, and I hadn\u2019t yet checked the saws or tightened the scaffolding bolts. If I didn\u2019t do it tonight, someone could get hurt. My partner\u2019s eyes lingered on me, waiting for me to say something real, to let them in. But the weight of responsibility pressed down: if I stayed, I\u2019d be the spouse they needed, but if I left, I\u2019d be the carpenter my team depended on. My heart tugged in both directions, caught between the safety of my crew and the closeness of my marriage, unsure which role to answer first."}
