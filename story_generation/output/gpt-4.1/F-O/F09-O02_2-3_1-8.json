She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I promised her I would. But just as I was about to confirm my attendance, my work chat pinged. The project manager\u2019s message was urgent: the client needed our time estimates by noon, or the contract would be delayed. The team was waiting for my input, and I knew how critical my calculations were. If I missed this deadline, the whole project could be at risk. My heart pounded as I pictured my daughter scanning the classroom for me, her face falling when she didn\u2019t see me. At the same time, I imagined my colleagues\u2019 frustration, the client\u2019s disappointment, and the pressure of letting everyone down. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding more than I could give."}
