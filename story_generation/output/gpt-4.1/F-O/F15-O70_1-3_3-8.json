I wanted to be patient, to show her how important it is to speak kindly and wait her turn. Just as I was about to praise her for remembering, my phone buzzed with a message from a customer. Their package was delayed\u2014again. I could feel the tension rising as I read their frustrated words, demanding an update. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, to reassure them and keep my job secure. But my daughter was looking up at me, waiting for my attention, needing my guidance. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014one part wanting to be the calm, attentive parent, the other needing to be the reliable, courteous delivery person. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to answer first, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
