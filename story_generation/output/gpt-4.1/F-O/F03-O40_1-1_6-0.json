It was my mom, her voice trembling as she told me Dad hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. I knew I should sit with her, ask if everything was okay, and offer the comfort she needed. That\u2019s what a good son does\u2014makes sure his parents feel supported, especially when things at home seem off. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded. I was already running late for the job site. As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to be late; safety briefings start sharp at seven, and missing them means risking not just my own safety, but everyone else\u2019s too. My boss expects me to be there, boots on, ready to follow every protocol. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the urge to sit with my mom and the pressure to rush out the door. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
