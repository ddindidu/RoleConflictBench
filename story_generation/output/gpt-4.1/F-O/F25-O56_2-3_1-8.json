The buildup is worse than I expected, and I know I\u2019ll need extra time to wash and condition before I can even think about cutting. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my weekly call to Dad and my stepmom. I promised I\u2019d call at six, just like every Sunday, to check in and let them know how I\u2019m doing. They always say it means a lot, especially since I moved out. But Mrs. Lee is my last client, and she\u2019s already anxious about her hair. If I rush, I\u2019ll do a poor job, but if I take my time, I\u2019ll miss the call and disappoint my parents. My chest tightens as I try to focus on the knots in front of me, but my mind keeps drifting to the phone in my pocket and the expectation on the other end. I can\u2019t seem to please everyone at once, and the pressure is almost too much to bear."}
