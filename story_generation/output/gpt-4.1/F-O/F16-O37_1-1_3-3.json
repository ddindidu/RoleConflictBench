I know they\u2019re counting on me to fold it before dinner, to show I\u2019m pulling my weight. But as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the cleaning company\u2019s app. I\u2019m supposed to check the inventory of cleaning supplies today, make sure we\u2019re not running low on disinfectant or sponges. If I don\u2019t, the next client\u2019s house might not get cleaned properly, and I could get a warning from my supervisor.\n\nMy mind races. If I fold the laundry now, I\u2019ll be late updating the supply list, risking my job. If I check the supplies first, the laundry will sit there, another broken promise to my spouse. Both roles tug at me, each demanding my attention, each with its own consequences. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, unsure which responsibility to face first."}
