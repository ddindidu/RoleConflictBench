My phone buzzed\u2014my partner, voice trembling, needed to talk. They\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant longer hours and more stress. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d they whispered, hoping for reassurance, for me to listen and help them sort through the mess of feelings. I wanted to be there, to give them my full attention, to hold their hand and tell them I believed in them.\n\nBut as I hung up, my client arrived, hair damp and sticky from a workout. She looked at me expectantly, ready for her usual cut. I knew she expected me to wash and condition her hair, to make her feel fresh and pampered. I could see the faint impatience in her eyes\u2014she had somewhere to be after this.\n\nMy mind raced. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be a supportive spouse and the professional demands of my job. I could hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, needing comfort, while my client sat in my chair, waiting for me to begin. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be everything to everyone, all at once."}
