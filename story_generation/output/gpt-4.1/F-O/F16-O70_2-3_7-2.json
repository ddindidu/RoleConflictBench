My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo delays, this one\u2019s critical.\u201d But as I started the engine, I saw my spouse\u2019s message pop up\u2014just a simple, \u201cCan we talk when you get home?\u201d I remembered the worry in their eyes this morning, the way they hesitated before I left. We promised to share our burdens, to be honest about our struggles. I knew they needed me to listen, to be present, to open up about my own stress. But the hospital was across town, and traffic was already building. If I was late, patient care could be compromised. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I made at home. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the urgency of the delivery and the silent plea from the person I love."}
