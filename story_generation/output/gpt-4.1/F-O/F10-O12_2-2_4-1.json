The new feature was almost done, but the code review comments kept piling up\u2014warnings about performance, maintainability, and efficiency. My team expected nothing less than clean, elegant solutions, and I could feel the pressure mounting with every Slack notification. Just as I was about to refactor a particularly messy function, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mother, reminding me about the family dinner tonight. She mentioned, again, how important it was to uphold our traditions, especially now that my grandparents were visiting. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, insisting that I be present, that I show respect for our customs. My mind spun between the demands: the unyielding logic of my code and the unspoken rules of my family. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of being a good daughter and a responsible developer, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved at the same time."}
