I knew I should ask what was wrong, open up about my own day, and really listen\u2014like we promised we would. But my mind kept drifting to the job site. Tomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to start on the new frame, and I haven\u2019t had a chance to check the tools. The last time I skipped an inspection, a saw blade snapped, and I can\u2019t risk that happening again. My spouse\u2019s voice is soft, almost hesitant, and I can tell they need me to be present, to share and reassure. But the clock is ticking, and if I don\u2019t get out to the garage soon, I\u2019ll be working in the dark, maybe missing something crucial. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding my attention and care at home, the other insisting on vigilance and responsibility for safety. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, unsure which need should come first."}
