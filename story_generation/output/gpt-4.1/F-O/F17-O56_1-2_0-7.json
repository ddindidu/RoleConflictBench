There\u2019s a text from Mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you this weekend.\u201d Guilt prickles at me. I promised I\u2019d check in more often, especially after Dad\u2019s surgery. But right now, my next client is already in the chair, her hair damp with sweat from her gym session. She\u2019s in a rush, asking if we can skip the wash and just get straight to the cut. I know the salon expects me to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before styling\u2014hygiene and quality, they always say. My phone buzzes again. I feel the weight of my mother\u2019s worry and the pressure of my job\u2019s standards. My hands hover over the shampoo bottles, but my mind is split. Should I quickly text Mom back, risking a delay and breaking salon protocol, or focus on my client and let my mom wait, knowing she\u2019ll worry even more? The demands of being a good child and a responsible hairdresser pull me in opposite directions, and I can feel the tension building inside me."}
