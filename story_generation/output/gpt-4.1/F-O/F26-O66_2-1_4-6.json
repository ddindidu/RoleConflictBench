Lily wants to show everyone her first school project.\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of my granddaughter\u2019s excitement. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing her proud little face. But as I hung up, I glanced at the backseat\u2014muddy footprints from my last passenger. I had a regular client scheduled for an airport run in an hour, and my reputation depended on spotless service. If I rushed the cleaning, I might miss a spot and risk a complaint. If I took my time, I\u2019d be late for Lily\u2019s big moment. My mind spun with guilt and worry, torn between being the grandparent Lily expected and the reliable driver my clients counted on. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, cleaning spray in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
