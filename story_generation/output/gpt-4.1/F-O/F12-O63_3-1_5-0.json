My script was open in front of me, the answers easy, my voice practiced and calm. But in the background, I could hear the clatter of dishes and the hum of the vacuum\u2014my husband moving through the house, trying to get everything ready for his family\u2019s visit tonight. He\u2019d already texted twice, asking if I could help fold the laundry and tidy the guest room. I knew he expected me to share the load, especially with so much to do before everyone arrived. But every time I thought about stepping away, another call came through, and my supervisor\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you on the line, especially during peak hours.\u201d My stomach twisted as I tried to focus on the customer\u2019s question, guilt prickling at the edges of my concentration.
