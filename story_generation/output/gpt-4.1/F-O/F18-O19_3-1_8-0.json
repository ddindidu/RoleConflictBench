The label matched the medication, but I always made sure\u2014accuracy was everything. Just as I was about to hand it over, I glanced out the window and saw my younger brother on the sidewalk, headphones in, about to step off the curb. He didn\u2019t see the car speeding down the street. My heart pounded. As a sibling, I was supposed to protect him, make sure he was safe. But as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t abandon my post or leave a customer with unfinished business. The customer waited expectantly, trusting me to do my job. My brother was oblivious, trusting the world to be safe. I felt torn, my mind racing between the responsibility in my hands and the one outside the window, both demanding my immediate attention."}
