My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my younger brother, inviting me to join him and his friends for dinner. He\u2019d been hinting that I\u2019d been distant lately, and I knew he wanted me to be more present, to show I valued our relationship by including him in my life outside of work. But the deadline for the office design was tomorrow, and I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to fit the break room without sacrificing the natural light in the workspaces. My boss expected nothing less than perfection, and I wanted to prove I could design a space that truly worked for everyone. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me. Was I letting my brother down by not making time for him? Was I sacrificing family for my career? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, unable to silence the demands of either role."}
