My son tugged at my shirt, his face pale, and whispered, \u201cMom, I took some candy from the store. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d My heart clenched. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake and help him understand the importance of honesty. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t leave my post. A few swimmers were drifting toward the deep end, nothing urgent yet, but I had to keep watching. My mind raced\u2014should I pull my son aside and address his confession, risking the safety of those in the pool? Or do I keep my focus on the swimmers, letting this crucial teaching moment slip by? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my child and the responsibility for everyone in the water."}
