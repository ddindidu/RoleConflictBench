My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted me to come in immediately. My mind raced. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to show up, to be present and responsible, especially now when my stepson needed guidance and consequences. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t just leave the kit unchecked\u2014lives depended on it being ready, and my shift was about to start. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the school expecting a caring parent, my team expecting a reliable medic. My hands trembled as I held the phone, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my patients, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
