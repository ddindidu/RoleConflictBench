He asked about my day, his eyes warm and expectant, and I knew he wanted more than just a list of tasks\u2014I could sense he hoped for a real conversation, a moment of connection after our busy schedules. I wanted to share, to be present, to listen and talk openly as a good wife should. But my phone buzzed with a new email notification: a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol demanded I reply promptly and formally, even if it was just a routine message. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close my laptop and give my husband my full attention, and the professional voice in my head insisting that I respond to the vendor immediately to maintain my reputation for reliability. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my time and presence in different ways."}
