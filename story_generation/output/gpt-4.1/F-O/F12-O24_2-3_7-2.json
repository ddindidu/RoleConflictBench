I knew I should ask him what was wrong, to open up and share my own worries too, as we always promised each other. But just as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the court clerk. An emergency motion had been filed, and as the presiding judge, I was required to review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. My heart pounded. My husband needed me, and I needed to be present for him, to listen and share. But the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed down on me. The law demanded my immediate attention, and the people involved in the case were depending on my careful, thorough review. I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of being a supportive wife and a diligent judge, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, unsure which to answer first."}
