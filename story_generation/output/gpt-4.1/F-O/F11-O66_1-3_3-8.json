My younger brother wanted to go hiking, and my mom was already planning a picnic. I could see how much it meant to them that I was there, part of the conversation, not just passing through. My phone buzzed on the table, and I glanced at the screen\u2014a new ride request. The app showed the passenger was already waiting, sending urgent messages about needing to get to the airport on time. I felt the familiar tug in my chest. My family expected me to be present, to join in and make plans, but my job demanded I leave now, deliver professional service, and not keep a paying customer waiting. My mom looked at me, hopeful, as my brother asked if I\u2019d come along this time. Meanwhile, the passenger\u2019s messages grew more insistent. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the reliable sister my family wanted and the dependable driver my passenger needed."}
