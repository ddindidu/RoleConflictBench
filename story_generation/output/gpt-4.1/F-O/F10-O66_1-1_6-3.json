Can you call when you have a minute?\u201d My heart squeezed. I knew she wanted me to check in, to be the daughter who always asks if everything\u2019s okay, who listens and reassures. But as the light turned green, I gripped the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. My passenger was tapping impatiently at his phone, and I was expected to drive safely, obey every law, keep my focus on the road. The streets were clear, the speed limit steady, but my mind was racing. I wanted to pull over, call home, be there for my parents. But I couldn\u2019t risk my passenger\u2019s safety or break the rules I\u2019d promised to follow. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
