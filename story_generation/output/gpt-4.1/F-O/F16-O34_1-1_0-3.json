My partner greets me with a tired smile, mentioning offhand that work was a bit rough today. I see the slump in their shoulders, the way their eyes search mine for comfort. I want to sit beside them, listen, and offer the warmth they need. But my phone buzzes\u2014an alert from the tower. A cruising aircraft is requesting the routine altimeter setting. It\u2019s standard, nothing urgent, but protocol demands my immediate response. My headset is within reach, the pilots waiting for my voice, depending on me for clarity and safety. I feel the pull from both sides: the need to be present for the person I love, and the responsibility to the pilots in the sky. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, torn between the comfort of home and the duty of the skies, knowing I can\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
