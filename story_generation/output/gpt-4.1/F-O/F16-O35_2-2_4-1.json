My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my spouse, reminding me that the laundry still isn\u2019t done and the kids need clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d help tonight, but now, a signal delay flashes on my monitor. I have to adjust the train\u2019s speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost time. The passengers rely on me to get them home safely and on schedule. My mind races between the tracks and the laundry basket at home. I feel the weight of my spouse\u2019s expectation, the silent frustration that might greet me if I come home late and the chores are still waiting. At the same time, I know a single mistake here could ripple through the whole subway line. My heart pounds as I try to focus, torn between the family that needs me and the passengers who trust me, both expecting me to be present, responsible, and reliable."}
