Your mom\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I glanced at the control panel, my heart tightening. I knew they expected me to check in, to be the bridge that kept our patchwork family steady. I always tried to ask if everything was okay at home, to show I cared, even if it felt awkward sometimes.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone during a lull, a piercing alarm blared from the console\u2014a critical brake system malfunction. My training kicked in: I had to report it immediately, stop the train, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. The passengers depended on me to keep them safe and on time.
