The subject line\u2014\u201cFinal Notice: Immediate Payment Required\u201d\u2014made my stomach twist. As an accountant, I knew the consequences if we didn\u2019t pay soon: production would stop, clients would be furious, and my boss would demand answers. I needed to draft a response, maybe negotiate a payment plan, but my mind kept drifting to the living room, where my wife waited. She wanted to talk about our own finances, about the medical bills piling up and the choices we\u2019d have to make. As her husband, I owed her honesty and openness, but I worried that sharing everything would only add to her stress. My heart pounded as I stared at the two worlds colliding\u2014my responsibility to my company and my responsibility to my marriage. Both demanded my full attention, both required difficult conversations, and I felt the weight of expectations pressing in from every side."}
