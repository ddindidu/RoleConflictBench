My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet today. I could picture my child\u2019s face, anxious and ashamed, waiting for me to show up and help him make sense of what he\u2019d done. I knew I needed to be there, to listen, to guide him through this mistake.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with another reminder. The merger contract was waiting\u2014hundreds of pages, dense with legal jargon, and somewhere in there, a clause that could cost my client millions if I didn\u2019t catch it before the deadline tonight. The partners were counting on me, expecting my sharpest focus and undivided attention.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son needed his parent. My client needed their lawyer. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second, and wondered how I could possibly be both at once."}
