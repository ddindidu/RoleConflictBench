It\u2019s your turn to honor our ancestors.\u201d My hands trembled, not just from the weight of tradition, but from the lingering scent of cleaning spray on my palms. Just an hour ago, I was scrubbing the backseat of my taxi, making sure every surface gleamed, every trace of the last passenger gone. My boss had been clear\u2014no complaints about cleanliness, or I\u2019d lose my shift. Now, my family expected me to recite prayers perfectly, to guide everyone through rituals I barely remembered, to show respect and devotion. But my mind kept drifting to the cab, parked outside, and the possibility of a surprise inspection. I felt torn, the pressure of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, while the demands of my job tugged me away. My heart pounded as I stood between the altar and the door, caught in the impossible space between being a dutiful child and a responsible taxi driver."}
