My son tugged at my hand, begging for a snack, but I shook my head, focused on the swimmers. Suddenly, he darted away, weaving between shoppers in the supermarket section beside the pool. My heart pounded\u2014he knew better than to run indoors. As his mother, I was supposed to teach him discipline, to stop him and explain why his behavior was wrong. But just then, I caught a glimpse of a swimmer flailing in the deep end, their head bobbing above the water. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on the pool, to be ready to jump in at any sign of real trouble. I felt torn in two\u2014my son needed guidance, but someone in the water might need saving. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of being a good mother and a vigilant lifeguard."}
