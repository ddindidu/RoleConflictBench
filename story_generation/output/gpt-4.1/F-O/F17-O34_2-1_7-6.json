The hum of voices in the control room is a familiar comfort, but today my mind keeps drifting. This morning, I saw the lines on my mother\u2019s face deepen as she poured her coffee, my father\u2019s silence heavier than usual. I know they need me\u2014just a word, a hug, something to show I\u2019m there for them. But now, as an aircraft blips closer to the sector boundary, I have to focus. The pilot\u2019s voice crackles in my ear, and I coordinate with the next controller, making sure the handoff is seamless. My heart tugs me home, to the kitchen where my parents sit, waiting for me to notice their fatigue. But my hands are tied to this console, my mind split between the sky and the living room. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I can give."}
