It was a reminder: the kids would be out of school in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up today. I could picture their faces, searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I said I would. But in front of me, the homeowner\u2019s voice trembled as she pointed to the gaping hole in her floorboards, the wood eaten through by termites. \u201cCan you help? I need a plan today,\u201d she pleaded, her worry almost tangible. My mind raced\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d let her down, leave her home at risk. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to the kids, let them stand alone at the curb, wondering if I cared enough to show up. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the family I was trying to build and the work that kept us afloat."}
