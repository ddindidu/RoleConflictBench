I promised him a Nintendo if I could save enough this month, and every fare counts toward that goal. The backseat is empty now, but my next passenger is waiting across town, and I need to make good time if I want to keep up the pace. As I turn the corner, orange cones funnel traffic into a single lane, and a cluster of children giggle near the curb, backpacks swinging. The school zone sign blinks at me, reminding me to slow to a crawl. My foot hovers over the brake, but my eyes flick to the meter, ticking away precious minutes. If I\u2019m late, I might lose the fare\u2014and the extra cash I need for the Nintendo. My heart pounds as I weigh the urge to inch forward quickly against the responsibility to drive safely. The pressure to provide for my son tugs at me, but so does the duty to protect these children, strangers but someone else\u2019s world. I grip the wheel, caught between the two roles that define me, unsure which expectation I can afford to let down."}
