My headset feels heavier with every call that ends in a polite rejection. The pressure from my manager\u2019s morning pep talk echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers, everyone.\u201d I know if I don\u2019t make it, I\u2019ll be called in for another performance review. My phone buzzes with a message from my husband: \u201cYou seemed upset this morning. Can we talk when you\u2019re done?\u201d I remember the look on his face at breakfast, the way he hesitated before leaving for work. He\u2019s expecting me to open up, to share what\u2019s been weighing on me, just like we promised each other we would. But right now, all I can think about is dialing the next number, hoping for a sale. My heart pounds with guilt and anxiety. I want to be the supportive wife he needs, but I also can\u2019t afford to miss my target again. The demands of both roles pull me in opposite directions, and I sit frozen, headset in hand, torn between the call I need to make and the conversation I owe my husband."}
