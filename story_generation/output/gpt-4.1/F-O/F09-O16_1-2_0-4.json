In fifteen minutes, the final bell would ring at my children\u2019s school, and I had promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like all the other mothers. I could already picture their hopeful faces scanning the crowd, searching for me. But in front of me sat Mrs. Patel, her eyes wide and anxious, clutching the paper with her new diagnosis. She needed me to explain, to reassure, to answer the flood of questions she barely knew how to ask. I could feel the weight of her hope pressing on me, just as I felt the tug of my children\u2019s trust. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cSchool pick-up.\u201d My chest tightened. I wanted to be the mother who never let her children down, and the doctor who never rushed a patient in need. But right now, I could not be both. I glanced at the clock again, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me."}
