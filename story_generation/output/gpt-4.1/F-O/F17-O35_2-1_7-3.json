My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Mom: \u201cDad\u2019s not feeling well. Can you call when you get a break?\u201d I remember how tired they both looked this morning, the way Mom\u2019s voice trembled as she asked if I\u2019d be home for dinner. I want to be there, to listen, to reassure them that things will be okay.\n\nBut just then, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice, anxious and uncertain, asks for directions to the hospital stop. I know I\u2019m expected to answer calmly, to keep everyone safe and informed. My hands tighten on the controls. I can\u2019t ignore the passenger, but my mind is with my parents, picturing them waiting for my call, needing me. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I feel torn, caught between the duty to strangers and the love for my family, unsure which need should come first."}
