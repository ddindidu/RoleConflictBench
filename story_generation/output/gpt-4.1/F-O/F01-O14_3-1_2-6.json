It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d I could hear the worry in her voice even through the text. As a grandfather, I knew I should drop everything, listen, and offer the wisdom she needed. She rarely reached out like this, and I sensed she was struggling with something serious.\n\nBut as a scientist, I was also responsible for the safety of my team. The lab\u2019s equipment hadn\u2019t shown any issues, but the checklist was due soon, and I was the only one with the expertise to ensure everything was in order. If I delayed, I risked missing a hidden fault, putting everyone at risk.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. My granddaughter needed me now, but so did my lab. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart ached as I tried to decide which responsibility I could set aside, even for a moment."}
