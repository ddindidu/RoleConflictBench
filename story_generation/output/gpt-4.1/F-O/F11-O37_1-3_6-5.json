It was my client, Mrs. Patel, asking if I could come in an hour early because she needed the house spotless for a last-minute dinner party. As her housekeeping cleaner, I knew she expected me to manage all the supplies, but when I checked the storage closet, I realized we were out of the specialized wood cleaner she insisted on for her antique table. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014Mrs. Patel would be upset if the table wasn\u2019t perfect, but my brother was already waiting by the door, excited for our outing. He\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I\u2019d promised to include him more, to build the kind of mutual respect we both wanted. My mind raced, torn between rushing out to buy the cleaner and risking being late for my brother, or letting Mrs. Patel down and facing her disappointment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move."}
