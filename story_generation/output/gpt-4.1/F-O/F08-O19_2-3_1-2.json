Every decimal, every instruction, had to be perfect\u2014someone\u2019s life depended on it. My mind was trained to focus, to block out distractions, but today, my heart was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d noticed my granddaughter sitting quietly in the living room, her eyes red and distant. She\u2019d barely spoken, and I could sense the weight she carried. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer comfort, and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. She needed me, perhaps more than ever. But here I was, surrounded by vials and labels, expected to be flawless, to ensure no harm came to the patient whose prescription I held. The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way. My mind raced, torn between the child who needed my guidance and the patient who needed my precision. I felt the ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing I could not fail either."}
