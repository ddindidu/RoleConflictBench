My little brother\u2019s eyes sparkled as he begged me to join them for a movie marathon, and Mom smiled, clearly hoping I\u2019d say yes. I wanted to be there, to laugh and relax with them, to be the sibling they expected\u2014present, involved, part of the fun. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled to clean Mrs. Patel\u2019s house in an hour. As I gathered my supplies, I realized I was out of the special wood polish she insisted on for her antique furniture. She\u2019d be upset if I didn\u2019t use it, and I knew how much she valued my attention to detail. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family\u2019s hopeful faces on one side, Mrs. Patel\u2019s high standards on the other. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility of my job, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
