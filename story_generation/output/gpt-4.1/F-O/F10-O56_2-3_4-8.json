As her daughter, I knew how much she cherished our family\u2019s traditions\u2014especially the one about never cutting hair on certain days, a custom she\u2019d reminded me of just this morning. But as her hairdresser, I saw the thick, sticky buildup clinging to her strands, the kind that would make any cut uneven and damage my scissors. My training told me I had to wash and condition her hair first, but her words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe don\u2019t break tradition, not for anything.\u201d My hands trembled slightly as I sectioned her hair, feeling the weight of her expectations as a mother and my professional standards as a stylist. I could sense her watching me in the mirror, waiting for me to honor our family\u2019s values. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to do what I knew was right for her hair, and the fear of disappointing her by breaking a rule that meant so much to her."}
