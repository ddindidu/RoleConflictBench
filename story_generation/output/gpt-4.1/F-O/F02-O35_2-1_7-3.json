My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my wife, reminding me that the rent is due tomorrow and the kids need new shoes. I swallow hard, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a father. I have to keep this job, keep the paychecks coming, or my family will struggle even more.\n\nSuddenly, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice, anxious and uncertain, asks for directions to the hospital. I know the rules: I\u2019m supposed to respond promptly, keep everyone safe, and help however I can. But my mind is racing with worries about bills and groceries, and I feel my patience thinning.
