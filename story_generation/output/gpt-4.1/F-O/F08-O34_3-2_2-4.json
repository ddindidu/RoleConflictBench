I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d always be there, and now her trembling voice came through, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important.\u201d I could hear the worry in her words, the kind that only a grandmother\u2019s wisdom could soothe. But outside, the clouds were building fast, and I knew every second mattered for those pilots waiting for my instructions.
