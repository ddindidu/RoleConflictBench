Mom had made it clear\u2014everyone was expected, no excuses. It was the first time in months we\u2019d all be together, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare. But as I scrolled through the messages, my email pinged: a reminder from the court clerk. The jury trial I\u2019d been preparing for was set to begin tomorrow, and my client\u2019s future hinged on my performance. There was no room for delay, no chance to reschedule. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds\u2014my family\u2019s expectation for togetherness, my client\u2019s desperate need for my focus and presence. I felt the pressure building, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, the one who showed up, but I was also the advocate who couldn\u2019t let a client down. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly meet both demands, and I sat frozen, torn between two parts of myself, unsure which role would have to give."}
