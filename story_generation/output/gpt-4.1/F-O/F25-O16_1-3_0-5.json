My stepmother\u2019s message from this morning blinks at me: \u201cHope you\u2019re well. Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I know she expects a reply, maybe a quick call, just to check in. It\u2019s the weekend, after all, and she\u2019s always said that family should stay connected, especially since Dad passed. But my pager buzzes again, pulling me back to the hospital corridor. The family in room 312 is waiting. Their father\u2019s test results are back, and the news isn\u2019t good. I\u2019m supposed to be calm, clear, and compassionate\u2014give them the truth, answer their questions, help them through the shock. My mind races with the weight of both worlds: the gentle, reassuring words my stepmother needs, and the steady, honest presence my patient\u2019s family deserves. I feel the pressure building, the impossible tug-of-war between being a good daughter and a good doctor. My phone vibrates again. I close my eyes, heart pounding, caught between two lives that both need me, right now."}
