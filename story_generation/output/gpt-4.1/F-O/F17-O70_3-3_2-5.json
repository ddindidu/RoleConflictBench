I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed calls and a string of messages from Mom: \u201cHow are you? Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply soon; we always talked around this time, and she expected to hear every detail of my day. But right now, my focus had to be on the delivery. The package was for a law office, and protocol demanded I hand it directly to the recipient, check their ID, and get a signature. No shortcuts, no distractions. My supervisor had drilled it into us: one mistake, and the company\u2019s reputation was on the line.
