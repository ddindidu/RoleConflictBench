The package I was supposed to deliver had been misplaced at the depot, and now the customer was calling, their tone already tense. I knew I had to be calm, professional, and reassuring, even though I didn\u2019t have good news. At the same time, my daughter\u2019s message popped up on my phone\u2014she\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her excitement. She\u2019d sent a photo of her desk, a big smile on her face, and a message: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to tell you all about it, Grandpa!\u201d I felt a tug in my chest. I wanted to call her right away, to be the supportive grandparent she expected, to share in her joy and make her feel heard. But the customer was waiting, and my job demanded my full attention and patience. I stared at the two notifications, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
