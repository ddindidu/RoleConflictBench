My mother had texted earlier, asking how my week had been, and I knew she expected a reply soon. I glanced at her message, feeling a familiar tug of guilt for not calling more often. Just then, a colleague introduced me to a friend, who, after learning I was a lawyer, asked, \u201cSo, what kind of cases are you working on these days?\u201d The question was innocent enough, but I felt the weight of my professional responsibility settle on my shoulders. I couldn\u2019t share details, not even the broad strokes, without risking client confidentiality. At the same time, my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my mother, a gentle reminder of her wish to stay connected. I stood there, caught between the urge to be a good son and the duty to uphold my ethical standards as a lawyer, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
