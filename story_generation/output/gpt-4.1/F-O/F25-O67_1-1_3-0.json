My step-siblings laughed as they decorated the tree, and I tried to join in, remembering how important these traditions were to her. She always said, \u201cFamily comes first, especially on days like this.\u201d My phone buzzed on the coffee table, and I glanced at it, heart pounding. I was on call tonight\u2014my shift as an ambulance driver had started an hour ago. The expectation was clear: be ready, respond instantly, save lives. I tried to focus on the laughter, but my mind kept drifting to the possibility of a dispatch. If a call came in, I\u2019d have to leave, disappointing my stepmother and missing the one night she asked me to be present. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait for the other. My phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, caught between the warmth of family and the urgency of duty, not knowing which expectation I would have to let down."}
