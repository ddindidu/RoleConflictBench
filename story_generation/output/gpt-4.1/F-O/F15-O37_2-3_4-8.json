My son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. I called his name, trying to keep my voice calm, but he just laughed and ran further. At the same time, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my supervisor about the new safety protocols at work. Gloves, masks, sanitizers, no exceptions. I remembered how last week, a coworker was reprimanded for not sanitizing properly after touching something in public. My hands itched to grab my son, to guide him back and correct his behavior, but I hesitated. If I touched him now, without sanitizing, would I be risking bringing germs to my cleaning job? My mind spun with the pressure: be a good parent, be a responsible cleaner. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
