My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou\u2019re on track to break records this week\u2014keep pushing.\u201d I should have felt proud, but my stomach twisted. Tonight was the family dinner, the one my stepmother insisted we all attend, where we\u2019d recite the old prayers and share stories, just like her parents did. She\u2019d made it clear\u2014being present meant respecting the family, honoring the traditions that made us whole. But the call list was long, and every sale brought me closer to a bonus I desperately needed. If I left early, I\u2019d miss the best calling hours. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even confirm their quiet doubts about my place among them.
