My manager expected me to keep things moving, smile, and make every shopper feel welcome. I tried to keep my voice cheerful, even as my mind wandered. Today was my little brother\u2019s graduation, and he\u2019d begged me to be there, to celebrate with the family. As his sister, I knew how much it meant to him\u2014he\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But now, with the store so busy and my manager watching, I felt trapped. If I left early, I\u2019d let down my team and possibly risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to my brother. My heart pounded as I rang up another customer, torn between the expectations of being a supportive sister and a reliable cashier, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
