He\u2019d called me last minute, asking for a ride across town. As his brother, I knew he expected patience\u2014he was always running late, always a little scattered, and I\u2019d promised myself to be more understanding, to build the kind of respect that comes from not snapping at each other over small things. But as a taxi driver, I had a schedule to keep. My next fare was waiting, and I prided myself on being reliable and punctual. My brother, though, seemed in no rush, chatting on his phone, oblivious to the time. I felt the tension coil in my chest: do I gently remind him to hurry, risking a flare-up and undermining the respect I\u2019m trying to build? Or do I wait in silence, knowing I might let down my next passenger and compromise my reputation as a dependable driver? The minutes ticked by, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the brother he needed and the professional I was supposed to be."}
