Can you call them tonight?\u201d I\u2019d noticed it too\u2014Dad\u2019s voice quieter, Mom\u2019s eyes tired even over video calls. I promised myself I\u2019d check in after my shift, maybe even stop by if I could. But just as I was about to send a quick reply, the radio crackled: \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew the drill\u2014passenger safety came first, and I had to act fast, stay calm, reassure everyone. But my mind kept drifting to my parents, picturing them sitting in their quiet apartment, waiting for a call that might not come. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by the responsibility to hundreds of strangers relying on me for safety, the other by the quiet, persistent need of the people who raised me. I stood at the threshold of the train car, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
