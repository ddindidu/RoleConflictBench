My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile and hear him talk about his painting. I could already picture his eager eyes searching for mine in the crowd, waiting for my hug and words of praise.\n\nBut on the same evening, there was a workshop at the pharmacy downtown. The topic was new prescription guidelines\u2014crucial updates that would affect how I counsel patients. My manager had emphasized the importance of attending, and I knew missing it could mean falling behind, risking patient safety, and letting down my colleagues who counted on my expertise.\n\nAs I sat at the kitchen table, invitation in one hand and workshop flyer in the other, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my pride. My profession demanded my diligence, my responsibility, my commitment to learning. I closed my eyes, torn between the laughter of my family and the duty to my patients, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
