It was my mother. Her voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s recent health scare, her words heavy with worry. She needed me\u2014her son\u2014to listen, to reassure her that everything would be alright. I wanted nothing more than to step away, to give her my full attention, to be the comfort she was seeking.
