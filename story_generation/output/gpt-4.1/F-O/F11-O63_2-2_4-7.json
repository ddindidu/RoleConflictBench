Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family dinners were rare, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially Mom. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized my shift as a telemarketer wouldn\u2019t end until 8. Management had just sent another reminder about sticking to scheduled breaks\u2014no exceptions. The call queue was endless, and every minute away from my headset was tracked. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, warning us about the importance of every call. My family expected me at the table, laughing and sharing stories, but my job demanded I stay glued to my desk, headset on, voice cheerful for strangers. The pressure built inside me, torn between the warmth of home and the cold necessity of work. I wanted to be a good sister, but I also needed this job. My hands trembled as I weighed my choices, feeling the tug of both worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d let down tonight."}
