It\u2019s important for the family.\u201d My heart thudded with the weight of her words. This ceremony wasn\u2019t just a ritual\u2014it was a thread tying generations together, and my parents expected me to honor it, to show respect for our heritage. But as I scrolled through my emails, another message caught my eye: a reminder about the tax law seminar scheduled for the same day. As an accountant, I was expected to stay ahead of regulatory changes, to protect my clients and my firm from costly mistakes. Missing this seminar could mean falling behind, risking my professional reputation. I felt torn, the pressure from both sides squeezing my chest. My family needed me to be present, to carry on our traditions. My career demanded vigilance and constant learning. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, unable to choose, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
