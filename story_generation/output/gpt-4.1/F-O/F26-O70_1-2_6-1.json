My daughter sent a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom, we\u2019re all counting on you to bring the pie and stories for the kids!\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of their anticipation, but my work phone buzzed almost immediately. A new delivery popped up\u2014groceries for a customer who\u2019d specifically requested the evening slot, just before dinner. The address was across town, and the window was tight. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cOn-time delivery is everything, especially for perishables.\u201d I knew how much families depended on these deliveries, especially for meals. But my own family expected me to be present, to share in our traditions, to be the grandparent who never missed a moment. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the family waiting for me at home, and the stranger relying on me for their dinner. I sat in my car, keys in hand, torn between the roles that defined me, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in as the clock ticked on."}
