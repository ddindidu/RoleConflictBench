The customer, a mother with tired eyes, waited anxiously for my quote. Her little boy clung to her side, his gaze fixed on the broken toy. I knew I should focus, assess the damage, and give a fair price\u2014my reputation as a carpenter depended on it.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. Dad expects you to help with the holiday toast.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, laced with the unspoken reminder that I was still the outsider, expected to prove I belonged by honoring their traditions.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions. The family dinner was a chance to show I cared, to fit in, but this mother and her son needed my attention now. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, the urge to be the reliable craftsman and the dutiful step-child. My hands trembled as I picked up the train, caught between the demands of wood and blood, unsure which expectation I would let down."}
