Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just past three. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents all week, and guilt tugs at me. I know they expect me to check in, to share a little about my life, to remind them I\u2019m still their kid even though I\u2019m busy. But my headset is already on, and the office is tense. It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and every call counts. My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cWe need five more sales to hit target. No distractions.\u201d If we don\u2019t make it, the whole team loses out on bonuses, and I can\u2019t afford that. My phone buzzes again\u2014Dad this time, a simple \u201cMiss you.\u201d I stare at the screen, torn. My family wants to hear my voice, but my job demands my full attention. My heart pounds as I weigh the phone in my hand, caught between being a good child and a responsible employee, not sure which role to answer first."}
