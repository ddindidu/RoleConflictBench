My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019ve done it the last three times.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes\u2014another delivery notification. The app flashes red: \u201cUrgent! Customer needs groceries by 6:00 PM.\u201d I check the clock. It\u2019s already 5:15, and the address is across town. If I leave now, I\u2019ll make it, but the laundry will sit untouched, and I know my partner will be frustrated. If I stay and fold, the customer\u2019s dinner plans are ruined, and my delivery rating takes a hit. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations: be a reliable spouse, be a dependable delivery person. Both roles demand my time, both feel urgent, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both. I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, a crumpled T-shirt in the other, torn between two worlds that need me right now."}
