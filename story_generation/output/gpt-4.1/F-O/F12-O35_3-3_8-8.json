We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about the choices we\u2019d have to make. He looked at me, searching for honesty, for the openness we\u2019d promised each other. My phone buzzed\u2014my shift was starting soon. I kissed him goodbye, promising we\u2019d finish the conversation tonight.\n\nSliding into the operator\u2019s seat, I tried to push the worries aside. The subway rumbled to life beneath me. Suddenly, the cabin door opened and my supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand. \u201cUnannounced audit,\u201d he said, his tone clipped. My heart pounded. Every move I made was under scrutiny; there was no room for distraction or error. But my mind kept drifting back to my husband, to the conversation unfinished, to the truth I still needed to share.

I wasn\u2019t sure which expectation would break me first."}
