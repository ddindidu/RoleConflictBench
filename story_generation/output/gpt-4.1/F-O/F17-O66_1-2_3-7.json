Every holiday, I\u2019m expected to join the family, help set the table, and listen to stories that have been told for generations. Today, though, I\u2019m behind the wheel of my taxi, wearing my other hat. Two travelers flag me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. They ask if I can help load their bags and if they can split the fare. I know as a professional, I should help them with their luggage and accommodate their request, even though it means running late. But my phone buzzes with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner starts at six. It\u2019s important to your father.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectations to be present and honor our traditions, and my duty to my passengers, who rely on me for good service. My hands grip the steering wheel as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between being the dutiful child and the responsible taxi driver."}
