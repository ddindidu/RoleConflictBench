My fingers hovered over the console, ready to coordinate the emergency diversion that had just been declared. Three sectors, all at once\u2014my colleagues\u2019 voices crackled with urgency, and I knew every second counted. Then, my phone buzzed. I glanced down. It was my granddaughter, her name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, but answered, hearing her trembling voice. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice. It\u2019s important.\u201d Her words tugged at my heart, the weight of her trust pressing on me. She needed my wisdom, my calm reassurance, the way only a grandmother could give.
