It was my younger sister, texting me in all caps about how upset she was after our argument last night. She wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew how important it was to communicate openly and rebuild the trust between us. But as I glanced at the mop in my hand, I realized I\u2019d forgotten to put on my gloves and mask\u2014again. My supervisor had just reminded us about the new safety protocols, and I could get in serious trouble for not following them. I felt torn. If I stepped outside to call my sister, I\u2019d be neglecting my duties and risking contamination. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting our relationship fester. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, phone in one hand, mop in the other, caught between being the brother she needed and the responsible cleaner my job demanded."}
