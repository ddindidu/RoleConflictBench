She\u2019d just started her first job, and her excitement was contagious. She wanted to video call and tell me all about her first week, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened and shared in her joy. As her grandparent, I always tried to be present, to keep our bond strong, especially now that she was growing up so fast.\n\nBut as I reached for the phone, another message came through\u2014this one from the station. I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d been working on for months. The timing was critical, and my testimony could make a real difference. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to be reliable and fair, and to put my duty above all else.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in on me. My family needed me to be there, to celebrate and support, while my profession demanded my unwavering commitment. I stared at the two messages, heart pounding, torn between the joy of my granddaughter\u2019s milestone and the responsibility of my badge, unsure which call to answer first."}
