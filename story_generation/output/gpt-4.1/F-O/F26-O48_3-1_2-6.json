It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer the guidance she trusted me for. But just as I was about to reply, my supervisor poked her head in. \u201cMrs. Lee in 204 is asking for you. She\u2019s been a bit down today\u2014could you spend some time with her?\u201d As a nursing assistant, I knew how much my patients depended on me for comfort, especially Mrs. Lee, who had no family nearby. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My granddaughter needed her grandmother\u2019s wisdom, but Mrs. Lee needed her nursing assistant\u2019s compassion. I stared at my phone, then at the hallway leading to Mrs. Lee\u2019s room, feeling the impossible pull of two people counting on me at the same moment."}
