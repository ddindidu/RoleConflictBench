She wanted the whole family there tonight, and I could see how much it meant to her. My daughter caught my eye, silently urging me to promise I\u2019d be present. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the departmental meeting was in two hours, and I still hadn\u2019t finished summarizing the preliminary data from my latest experiment. The results were promising, and my colleagues were counting on me to present them clearly and accurately. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting my presence, my team expecting my diligence. My heart ached as I tried to focus on my granddaughter\u2019s story, but my mind kept drifting to the unfinished charts and notes on my desk. I wanted to be the grandfather who never missed a moment, and the scientist who never let his team down. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
