He asked about my day, and I hesitated, the memory of the afternoon still fresh. I wanted to tell him everything, to be open like he always hoped I would. But as I started to speak, my mind drifted back to the pool, to the group of teenagers laughing and daring each other to dive where the signs clearly said not to. I remembered the tension in my chest as I called out, my voice firm, enforcing the rules I was trained to uphold. Their annoyed glances stung, but I couldn\u2019t let them risk injury. Now, sitting here, I felt torn. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, expecting honesty and connection, but my thoughts were tangled with the responsibility I carried at work. I wanted to share, but I also wanted to protect him from my stress. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the need to communicate openly and the duty to enforce safety, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
