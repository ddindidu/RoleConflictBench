I knew something was wrong\u2014they\u2019d been quiet all evening. As a partner, I was supposed to be present, to listen, to share my own worries and let them share theirs. I reached out, ready to ask what was on their mind, when my radio crackled to life. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries, every second mattered. My heart pounded. I was expected to drop everything, to get behind the wheel and race to the scene, lives depending on my speed.

I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding all of me at the same impossible moment."}
