As a step-child, I felt the weight of her expectations, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d embrace these customs as my own, proving my place in the family. But my phone buzzed with reminders from the pharmacy board\u2014my continuing education seminar was scheduled for the same weekend. Missing it would mean falling behind on the latest treatments, risking my license, and letting down my colleagues who counted on my expertise. The pressure built inside me, two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I wanted to honor my family, to show them I belonged, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my professional duty. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between the warmth of family acceptance and the cold necessity of my career."}
