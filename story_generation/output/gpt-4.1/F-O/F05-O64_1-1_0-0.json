My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my wife. She tells me about her day, how her boss was short with her, how she feels a little worn down. I know she needs me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present for her. But as I glance up, I see a small line forming at my register. The customers look tired, waiting for me to finish. My manager expects me to keep the line moving, to avoid mistakes, to stay focused. I want to text my wife back right away, to let her know I care, but my hands are busy with barcodes and receipts. My mind is split, pulled between the need to be a supportive husband and the responsibility to be a diligent cashier. I feel the pressure building inside me, unsure which role to answer first."}
