He asked about my day, and I knew he wanted more than just a quick answer\u2014he wanted me to open up, to share the little details that keep us close. I started to tell him about a difficult customer, but my phone buzzed urgently. It was dispatch: a medical supply delivery needed to reach the hospital within the hour, no exceptions. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My husband waited, expecting me to be present, to talk and listen, while my job demanded I leave immediately to ensure those supplies reached the patients who needed them. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the need to be a supportive wife with the responsibility of being a reliable delivery person. I could see the hope in his eyes, but I also knew what was at stake if I failed to deliver on time. The clock ticked, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which role to choose."}
