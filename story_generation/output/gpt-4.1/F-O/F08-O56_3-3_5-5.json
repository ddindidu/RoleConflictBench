She jabbed a finger at her reflection, her words sharp and urgent, demanding I fix the cut she hated. My hands trembled as I tried to soothe her, knowing that as a hairdresser, I was expected to remain calm, professional, and attentive until she left satisfied. But my phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I knew what it meant. There was trouble at home, something serious enough that my family needed me, needed their grandmother to be present, to comfort, to help. My heart pounded with guilt and worry. I could almost hear my grandchildren\u2019s voices, feel their small hands reaching for mine. Yet here I was, trapped between the demands of my client and the urgent pull of my family, torn by the impossible choice of who needed me more in this moment."}
