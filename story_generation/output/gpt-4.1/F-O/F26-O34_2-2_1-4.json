The clouds outside were building fast, and I could hear the tension in the pilots\u2019 voices as they awaited my next instructions. My job demanded absolute focus\u2014one wrong call, and lives could be at risk. But just as I was about to issue a revised climb clearance, my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Emma? She\u2019s really down today.\u201d I glanced over at the break room, where my granddaughter sat, shoulders slumped, tracing circles on the table. I knew she needed me\u2014needed the kind of comfort only a grandparent could give, the wisdom and reassurance I\u2019d always promised to provide. But the radio crackled again, and I felt the weight of dozens of lives depending on my calm, precise instructions. My heart pulled in two directions, torn between the skies and the small, worried face waiting for me just a few steps away."}
