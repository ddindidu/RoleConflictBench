My heart pounded as I listened to the accusation\u2014my boy had slipped a candy bar into his pocket. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. He looked up at me, eyes wide with fear and shame, waiting for my reaction. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket: a reminder that the safety briefing at the construction site was about to start. Missing it meant risking my job, letting my team down, and possibly facing disciplinary action. I glanced at my son, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My responsibility as a father demanded patience and guidance in this moment, but my duty as a laborer required me to be on site, ready to work safely with my crew. I stood there, torn, the seconds ticking by, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
