My passenger kept glancing at his watch, his voice tight as he reminded me\u2014again\u2014that his flight left in less than an hour. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, trying to focus on the slippery road and the anxious man in the back seat. My phone buzzed in the cup holder. I knew it was my mom; we always texted around this time, sharing how our days were going. She worried if I didn\u2019t answer quickly, especially in weather like this. I could almost hear her voice, asking if I was safe, if I\u2019d eaten, if I was warm enough. But I couldn\u2019t risk taking my eyes off the road, not with the ice and the pressure to get my passenger to the airport on time. The phone buzzed again, and I felt the familiar tug\u2014my mom\u2019s need for reassurance, my duty to the person in my back seat, and my own growing anxiety as I tried to be both a good daughter and a responsible driver, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
