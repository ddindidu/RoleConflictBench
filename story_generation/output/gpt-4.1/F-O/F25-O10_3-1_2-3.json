She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I\u2019d remembered to water the plants. I knew she expected a reply\u2014something thoughtful, not just a quick \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d That\u2019s how we kept our relationship strong, with daily check-ins and honest updates. But my laptop chimed with a calendar reminder: the tax law seminar was starting in ten minutes. As an accountant, I couldn\u2019t afford to miss it. The firm expected me to stay ahead of every regulation, to be the one who always knew what was coming next. Missing this seminar could mean falling behind, letting my team down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing a long message to my stepmother and logging into the seminar. The pressure built in my chest, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
