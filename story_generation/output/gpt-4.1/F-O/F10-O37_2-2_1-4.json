It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my parents. They\u2019d be waiting, probably already sitting together in the living room, eager to hear about my week and tell me about theirs. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved out. But my mind kept drifting to the supply closet at Mrs. Patel\u2019s house. I\u2019d noticed earlier that her floor cleaner was almost gone, and I was supposed to clean her place in just three days. If I didn\u2019t remind her to buy more, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job properly, and she\u2019d be disappointed. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my parents\u2019 gentle expectation for connection, and my responsibility to keep my client\u2019s home spotless. My heart pounded as I weighed which call to make first, feeling the tug of both roles, each demanding my attention, each too important to ignore."}
