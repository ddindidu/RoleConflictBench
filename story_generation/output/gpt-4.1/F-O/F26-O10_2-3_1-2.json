She lingered at the door, eyes downcast, her usual spark missing. I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her, and as her grandmother, I felt the pull to set aside everything and offer her the comfort and wisdom she needed. But just as I stood to go to her, my phone buzzed with an urgent email from the external auditor. They needed the quarterly financial statements immediately, and I knew any delay could mean trouble for the company. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my profession\u2014accuracy, timeliness, responsibility\u2014and the deeper, quieter call to be present for my granddaughter in her moment of need. I could see her waiting, hoping I\u2019d notice, while the numbers on my screen demanded my attention. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension of being needed in two places at once."}
