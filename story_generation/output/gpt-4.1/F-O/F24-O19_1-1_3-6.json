My stepbrother nudged me, grinning as our parents tossed out ideas for the weekend\u2014hiking, a movie, maybe a barbecue. I knew they expected me to join in, to laugh and share my thoughts, to be part of this new family we were all still getting used to. But my mind kept drifting back to the newsletter, to the new drug approvals and the clinical updates I needed to know for work. My manager always reminded us how important it was to stay current, and I didn\u2019t want to fall behind. I tried to split my attention, nodding at my family\u2019s suggestions while scanning the article about a promising new anticoagulant. Guilt twisted in my stomach\u2014if I focused on work, I\u2019d seem distant, but if I joined the conversation, I\u2019d lose precious time to keep up professionally. My stepbrother caught my eye, waiting for my answer about the barbecue, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
