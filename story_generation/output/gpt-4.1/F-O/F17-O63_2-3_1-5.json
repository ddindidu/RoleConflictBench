They wait for my call, and I know how much it means to them. But tonight, the office is tense. It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cWe need five more sales to hit target. No one leaves until we do.\u201d My headset feels heavy. I glance at the clock\u20147:00 p.m.\u2014the time I usually call home. My parents will be waiting, probably sitting by the phone, expecting to hear my voice. But my team is counting on me, too.
