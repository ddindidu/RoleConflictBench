He wanted us to talk honestly, to share everything\u2014no secrets, no holding back. I knew he expected me to be present, to listen, to open up about my worries and fears. But as he spoke, my eyes kept darting to the living room, where dust glimmered on the shelves and crumbs littered the floor. The mess gnawed at me; I was supposed to keep the house spotless, to make sure every surface shone. My boss at the cleaning agency had called just that morning, reminding me that standards had to be higher, that clients noticed every speck. I felt torn, my mind split between the conversation that demanded my full attention and the urge to grab the vacuum and start scrubbing. My heart pounded with guilt\u2014if I focused on my husband, the house would slip into chaos; if I cleaned, I\u2019d be shutting him out when he needed me most. I sat there, hands clenched, caught between the roles that defined me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
