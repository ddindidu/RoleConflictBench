I know it\u2019s the contract from my client, the one I promised to review this week. It\u2019s not urgent, but I pride myself on being thorough and prompt. At the same time, my six-year-old darts between displays, giggling, ignoring my earlier warnings to stay close and behave. Other shoppers glance our way, some with disapproval, some with sympathy. I feel the weight of their eyes, the silent expectation that I\u2019ll step in and teach my child about respect and discipline. But my mind is split\u2014part of me wants to kneel down, look my child in the eye, and gently explain why this behavior isn\u2019t okay. The other part is already drafting responses in my head, thinking about clauses and indemnities, worried that if I don\u2019t at least glance at the contract now, I\u2019ll lose my train of thought. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the parent my child needs and the lawyer my client expects."}
