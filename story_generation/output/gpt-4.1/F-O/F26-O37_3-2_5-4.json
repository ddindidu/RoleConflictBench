It was my daughter, her message urgent: \u201cMom, can you come? Grandma\u2019s needed. It\u2019s serious.\u201d My heart clenched. I pictured my grandson\u2019s worried face, the family gathered, waiting for me to bring comfort and calm. But as I glanced at the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner on the shelf, another worry pressed in. The client expected me to keep everything stocked, and the next cleaning was in just three days. If I didn\u2019t act now, I\u2019d be letting them down\u2014again. I could already hear the disappointment in their voice, the subtle reminder that reliability is part of my job. My mind raced between the two worlds: my family\u2019s need for my presence and warmth, and my responsibility to keep this household running smoothly. Both sides expected me to be there, to care, to fix things. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
