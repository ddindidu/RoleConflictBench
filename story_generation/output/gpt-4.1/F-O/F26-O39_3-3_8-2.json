The crane was already holding it midair, swaying slightly, and I knew every second counted\u2014if I didn\u2019t get over there, the whole crew would be waiting, and the beam could become unstable. But the message on my phone was from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, please call me. It\u2019s urgent about Sam.\u201d My heart clenched. Sam, my grandson, had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to always be there for him, to keep in touch and support the family. I could picture my daughter\u2019s worried face, hear the tremor in her voice. But the foreman\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, impatient and sharp. My hands shook as I looked from the phone to the beam, torn between the family that needed me and the team depending on me. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which to answer first."}
