My son\u2019s small hand, trembling, clutching a candy bar he hadn\u2019t paid for. The store manager\u2019s stern voice, my son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes\u2014my heart ached with the weight of what I needed to do as a parent. I knew I had to teach him about honesty, about consequences, about making things right. But as I pulled into the driveway, my phone buzzed with a message from the hospital: a patient I\u2019d seen earlier was deteriorating. The symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook case, and I was expected to piece together the puzzle, to be thorough, to not miss anything. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my child\u2019s mistake and my patient\u2019s mystery. Both needed me, both demanded my full attention and wisdom. I felt torn, the expectations pressing in from both sides, and I sat in the car, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
