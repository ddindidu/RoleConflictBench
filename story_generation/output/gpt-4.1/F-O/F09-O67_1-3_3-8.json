The siren wailed, echoing my own racing heart. In the back, a paramedic worked desperately to stabilize a patient whose life hung by a thread. Every second counted, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I knew I had to drive fast, but safe\u2014lives depended on it.\n\nMy phone buzzed in the cupholder. A message from home: my son had hit his sister during an argument. He needed me to guide him, to teach him right from wrong, to be the mother who instilled discipline and kindness. I pictured his tear-streaked face, waiting for my words, my comfort, my lesson.\n\nBut here I was, behind the wheel, responsible for another life. My mind spun with the weight of both worlds\u2014my child needing guidance, my patient needing speed and safety. I felt torn, the expectations of mother and ambulance driver pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding all of me, right now."}
