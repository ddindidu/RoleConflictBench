My family laughed and shared stories, expecting me to join in the annual tradition of decorating the tree together. My mother caught my eye, her smile warm but her gaze lingering, a silent reminder of how much these moments meant to her. My phone buzzed in my lap\u2014a reminder from my firm about the urgent merger contract. The clauses were complex, and if I didn\u2019t review them tonight, my client could face serious financial risk. My laptop sat open in the next room, the contract waiting for my attention. I felt the weight of my mother\u2019s expectations, the importance of being present, of honoring our family\u2019s traditions. At the same time, the responsibility to my client pressed on me, the need to be thorough and timely. My heart pounded as I glanced between my family and the door to my office, torn between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of my work."}
