Her words were shaky, desperate\u2014my grandson was in trouble, and she needed me to call right away. My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew I should be there, offering comfort, listening, being present for my family in their crisis. But just then, I noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system was making a strange, grinding noise. I checked the gauges\u2014something was wrong. If I didn\u2019t act fast, the water could become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. The expectation as a lifeguard was clear: safety first, equipment must be fixed immediately. My phone vibrated again, my daughter\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My family needed me, but so did everyone in the pool. I stared at the phone, then at the faulty filter, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
