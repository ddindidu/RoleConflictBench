My supervisor had just announced that, since call volume was light, we could take our lunch breaks whenever we wanted today. Normally, I\u2019d be relieved\u2014flexibility at work was rare. But today was different. My mother had texted me that morning, reminding me about our family\u2019s tradition of gathering for a special lunch on my grandmother\u2019s birthday. She expected me to be there, just like every year, to help set the table and share stories. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, insisting that family comes first.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, I was also expected to stick to my scheduled hours, even if the rules were relaxed today. If I left now, I\u2019d be gone longer than usual, and I worried about what my supervisor might think if I took advantage of the flexibility. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I felt toward my job.
