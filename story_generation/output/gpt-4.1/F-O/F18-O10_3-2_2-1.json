My phone buzzed again\u2014my sister\u2019s name lighting up the screen. She\u2019d just gotten the news about her job, and her voice had cracked when she called earlier, asking if I could come over. I knew she needed me, needed her sibling to listen, to hold her hand through the shock and fear. But the emails from my manager kept piling up, each one reminding me of the importance of accuracy, of timeliness, of not letting the team down. My mind raced with the expectations: be the reliable accountant, keep the records flawless, don\u2019t miss the deadline. But also, be the supportive sibling, the one who shows up when it matters most. My heart ached with guilt and anxiety, torn between the numbers on my screen and the pain in my sister\u2019s voice. I sat frozen, unable to move, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I could give."}
