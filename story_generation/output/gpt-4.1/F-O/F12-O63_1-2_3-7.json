My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve got to prep dinner.\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I know he\u2019s been picking up the slack lately, and I promised we\u2019d share the chores more evenly. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: break\u2019s almost over. I\u2019m supposed to be back on the phones in three minutes, and management has been watching our break times like hawks. The call queue never empties, and every second I\u2019m away means more pressure on my team\u2014and more scrutiny from my supervisor. I glance between the laundry and my phone, heart pounding. If I help now, I\u2019ll be late logging back in. If I don\u2019t, the laundry will keep piling up, and so will the tension at home. My hands tremble as I hover over the laundry basket, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations at home, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
