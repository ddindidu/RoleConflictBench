Dispatch called: a woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver. My stepson had just spilled his juice, and I was about to gently remind him about cleaning up after himself\u2014one of those small lessons in responsibility I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d teach him. He looked up at me, waiting for guidance, his eyes wide and uncertain.\n\nBut the call was urgent. I could already picture the patient, pain etched on her face, needing me to arrive quickly and provide care. My uniform felt heavier as I stood, torn between the duty to my patient and the promise I\u2019d made to be present for my stepson, to teach him right from wrong, to be the steady adult he could count on. My heart pounded as I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
