My wife paced the living room, her brow furrowed, clutching her phone. She\u2019d just gotten off a tense call with her boss about a promotion she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted. I could feel her eyes on me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of support only a husband could give. But my shift had just started, and the phone lines were already lighting up. \n\nA customer\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, asking about a product return\u2014an easy answer, right there in the script. But my wife\u2019s voice broke through, trembling, \u201cCan we talk? I really need you right now.\u201d My manager\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind: stay on script, handle every call, don\u2019t let personal life interfere. But my heart ached to be present for her, to listen, to hold her hand and help her sort through her worries. \n\nI stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the comforting words my wife needed and the practiced responses my job demanded, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
