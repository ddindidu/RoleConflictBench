My stepsister nudged me, her eyes bright with excitement, and I knew she wanted me to chime in, to help make this new family feel more like home. But my mind kept drifting back to the pool at work. I\u2019d just finished my lifeguard shift, and as I was leaving, I noticed a few pool chairs out of place. They weren\u2019t a safety hazard, but I knew the manager expected us to keep everything perfect. I could already hear his voice in my head, reminding me that attention to detail is part of the job. My stepmom asked me what I thought about going to the lake, and everyone turned to look at me. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014be present, be part of the family. But I also felt the tug of responsibility, the urge to run back and fix those chairs before anyone noticed. My heart pounded as I sat there, caught between wanting to belong and needing to do my job right, unsure which role I should answer first."}
