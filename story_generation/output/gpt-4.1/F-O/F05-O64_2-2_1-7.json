I glanced at the screen\u2014my wife\u2019s name flashed with a message: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d been anxious all week about a big decision at work, and I knew she was finally reaching out for support. But the line at my register stretched past the bakery, and Mrs. Lee, a regular, was already unloading her groceries with a smile. I forced a cheerful greeting, scanning items and making small talk, but my mind was with my wife, picturing her alone in her office, waiting for my encouragement. Every beep of the scanner felt like a countdown, each customer expecting my full attention and warmth. I wanted to be the supportive husband she needed, but right now, I was the friendly cashier everyone expected. My heart tugged in two directions, and I could feel the pressure mounting as I tried to balance the demands of both worlds, unsure which role to answer first."}
