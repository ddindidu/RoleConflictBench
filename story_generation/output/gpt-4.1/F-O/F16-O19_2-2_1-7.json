The workshop on the new prescription guidelines was about to start in thirty minutes, and I knew how important it was to stay updated for my patients\u2019 safety. But as I reached for my bag, my partner called out from the living room, their voice trembling. They\u2019d been wrestling with a difficult decision at work for days, and tonight, they finally wanted to talk. I saw the worry in their eyes, the way their hands fidgeted with the edge of the couch cushion. They needed me\u2014needed my support, my listening ear, my encouragement. But the workshop was a rare opportunity, and missing it could mean falling behind in my responsibilities as a pharmacist. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My partner\u2019s expectation for comfort clashed with my professional duty to stay informed. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between the person I loved and the profession I was dedicated to, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do."}
