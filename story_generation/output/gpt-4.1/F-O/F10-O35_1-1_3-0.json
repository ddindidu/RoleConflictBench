My mother\u2019s message blinked at the top: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to start the meal.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but edged with disappointment if I was late again. I was the only one who still lived close enough to join every year, and I knew how much it meant to her that I uphold our family traditions, especially now that Dad was gone.\n\nBut here I was, standing in the dim light of the subway platform, clipboard in hand. The pre-departure check was routine, but skipping it\u2014even for non-critical systems\u2014wasn\u2019t an option. My supervisor always reminded us: \u201cSafety and punctuality, that\u2019s your job.\u201d If I rushed, I might miss something. If I delayed, the train would leave late, and I\u2019d hear about it in my next review.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be the daughter my mother expected, present and honoring our traditions. But I was also the operator, responsible for hundreds of lives and the city\u2019s rhythm. I stared at the checklist, my hands trembling, caught between duty and devotion."}
