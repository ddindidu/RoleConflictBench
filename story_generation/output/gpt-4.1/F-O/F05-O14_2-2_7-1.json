I knew I should sit down, ask her what was wrong, and really listen\u2014she always said that talking things through helped. But my mind kept drifting to the lab, where the rare instrument I\u2019d waited months to use was finally available. The experiment I\u2019d designed was time-sensitive, and if I missed this window, it could set my research back by weeks, maybe months. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present and supportive at home, and the professional demand to seize this fleeting scientific opportunity. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to comfort my wife and the pull of the lab, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
