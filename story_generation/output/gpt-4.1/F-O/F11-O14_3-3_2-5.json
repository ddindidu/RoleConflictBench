It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20149:30 p.m. The lab was quiet except for the hum of the centrifuge, and my laptop screen glared with the unfinished research report. The journal\u2019s submission portal would close in less than three hours. I\u2019d promised my advisor I\u2019d double-check the datasets and polish the discussion section tonight. \n\nBut my brother never asked for help unless he truly needed it. We\u2019d always been there for each other, especially after Mom passed. I could hear his voice in my head, shaky and uncertain, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless he was struggling. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor. If I called him, I might miss the deadline and let my team down. If I ignored him, I\u2019d betray the trust we\u2019d built as siblings. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I sat frozen, torn between the sister he needed and the scientist I was expected to be."}
