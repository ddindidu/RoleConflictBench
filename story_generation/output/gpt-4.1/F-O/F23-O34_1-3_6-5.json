My stepson\u2019s text buzzed on my phone: \u201cDid you get the Nintendo yet? You promised.\u201d I could almost hear his excitement, the hope in his voice. I\u2019d been saving for weeks, wanting to keep my word, to show him he could count on me. But the price tag still stung, and I worried about next month\u2019s bills. \n\nSuddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cTower, this is Delta 142, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart thudded.
