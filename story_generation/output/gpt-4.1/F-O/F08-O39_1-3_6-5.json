My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom, we\u2019re all counting on you to organize the family call for the holiday. The kids can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but the noise around me snapped me back. I tucked the phone away, reminding myself to call during lunch.\n\nSuddenly, I spotted Joe, a new guy, wandering too close to the crane\u2019s path, oblivious to the heavy load swinging above. My heart pounded. I knew I had to shout, to break the silence of the site and risk drawing attention, but my mind flickered to the family\u2019s expectations\u2014always available, always gentle, never harsh. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the loving grandmother, the vigilant laborer. My throat tightened as I hesitated, caught between the need to protect my coworker and the fear of being seen as harsh or neglectful, either at home or here."}
