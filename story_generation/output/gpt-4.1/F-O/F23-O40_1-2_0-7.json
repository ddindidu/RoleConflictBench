It was a reminder: the kids would be out of school in half an hour, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up today. I could picture their faces, searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I said I would. But the deck boards beneath my boots groaned with every step, and the homeowner\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my mind\u2014she needed the deck safe before her family\u2019s gathering tonight. My tools were spread out, the replacement planks ready, but the job was only half done. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down: the kids needing me to show up, to prove I was part of their lives, and the homeowner counting on my skill to make her home whole again. My hands trembled, torn between two places I was supposed to be, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved."}
