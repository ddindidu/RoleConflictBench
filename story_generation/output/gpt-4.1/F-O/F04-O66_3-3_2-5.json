It was my sister, her name lighting up the screen, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t call unless it was serious. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. I could hear the strain in her voice as she pleaded for me to answer, her words muffled by tears. But the road ahead was a mess\u2014orange cones everywhere, kids darting along the sidewalk, and a crossing guard waving frantically. As a taxi driver, I was expected to keep my eyes on the road, obey every sign, and drive with extra caution, especially here. My heart pounded as I gripped the wheel, torn between the urge to pull over and comfort my sister, and the responsibility to keep my passengers and those children safe. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
