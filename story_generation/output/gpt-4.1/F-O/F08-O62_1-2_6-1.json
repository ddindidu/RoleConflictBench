My phone buzzed in my bag\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me about the family holiday dinner. It was tradition, after all, for everyone to check in, to share plans and excitement. I knew they expected me to reply, to be present, to keep the family connected. But my eyes kept darting back to the pool, where a young swimmer was drifting farther from the edge, their strokes growing sloppy. I felt the familiar tug: the need to be the reliable grandmother, always available, always nurturing, and the unyielding responsibility of the lifeguard, where a moment\u2019s distraction could mean disaster. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, torn between the warmth of family and the cold, clear duty of vigilance."}
