It\u2019s a ritual we\u2019ve kept since my mother passed, a way to bridge the distance and reassure him that I\u2019m still part of his life. Tonight, as I sit at my desk, the phone buzzes with his number. But beside me lies a thick manila folder\u2014case files for a procedural hearing I\u2019m presiding over in two weeks. The case seems simple, but I know the importance of being thorough; my role as a judge demands nothing less. My stepfather\u2019s voice, warm and expectant, echoes in my mind, but so does the silent weight of the unopened file. I feel the pull from both sides: the need to be present for family, to ask about his week and share my own, and the professional obligation to prepare, to ensure justice is served. My hand hovers between the phone and the file, heart pounding, torn by the demands of two worlds that rarely understand each other."}
