Mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, expecting me to chime in and help settle the plan. I wanted to be present, to laugh and debate with them, to show I cared about these moments we rarely get. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a notification from the court: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. I was expected to review the case files and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family and the weight of my responsibility as a judge. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my input, while my conscience nagged at me to focus on the urgent legal matter. My heart pounded as I sat there, caught between the pull of family and the demands of justice, unsure which role to answer first."}
