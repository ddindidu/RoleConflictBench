My younger brother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something at school had gone wrong. He dropped his bag and sat at the kitchen table, silent, staring at nothing. I remembered Mom\u2019s words: \u201cYou\u2019re his big brother. He needs you, especially when things are tough.\u201d I wanted to sit beside him, to listen, to be the support he expected. But my mind kept drifting to the machines at work. The shutdown was only days away, and if I didn\u2019t finish prepping the parts tonight, the whole schedule could fall apart. My boss had made it clear: \u201cNo mistakes, no delays.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my brother\u2019s need for comfort, my responsibility to the team. I stood in the hallway, torn, heart pounding, unsure which door to walk through first."}
