It was almost six, and I knew the laundry basket at home was overflowing. My husband had texted earlier, reminding me that our daughter needed her soccer uniform clean for tomorrow. As a wife, I felt the weight of that expectation\u2014making sure the family had what they needed, keeping the household running smoothly. But here, behind the pharmacy counter, I was a pharmacist first. A mother came in with her son, sniffling and tired, and handed me a prescription for a common cold. I checked the medication, matching it carefully to the label, knowing that even a small mistake could have consequences. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, another reminder of the laundry waiting at home. I felt torn, pulled between the demands of my family and the responsibility to my patients. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, wrestling with the guilt of not being able to do it all at once."}
