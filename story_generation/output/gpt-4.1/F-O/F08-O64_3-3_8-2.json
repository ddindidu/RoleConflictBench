My daughter had texted\u2014my grandson was in trouble, something serious, and they needed me. I could almost hear her voice trembling, the way she always did when she was scared. But here I was, behind the counter, a line of customers waiting, the drawer full of large bills and receipts that needed to be counted with absolute precision. My manager expected no errors, especially now, at closing time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urge to call my daughter, to be the comforting grandmother my family needed, and the responsibility to finish my shift without a single mistake.
