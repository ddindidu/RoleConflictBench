She\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. As her step-parent, I knew I needed to be there\u2014she was already struggling to accept me, and missing this would only widen the gap between us. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning meeting was in thirty minutes. My team and the client were waiting for my effort estimates, and without them, the contract\u2014and months of work\u2014would stall. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice, reminding me how critical my input was. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My stepdaughter needed support and guidance, but my team needed my expertise. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second, wondering how I could possibly be the person both worlds expected me to be."}
