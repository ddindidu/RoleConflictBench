My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cBuy Nintendo for Alex.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014stores would close soon. Alex had been counting down the days, his face lighting up every time he mentioned the promise I\u2019d made. But the hospital project deadline loomed, and I\u2019d just received an urgent email from the city inspector. There was a possible issue with the fire escape routes\u2014if I didn\u2019t review the plans tonight, construction could be delayed, and worse, someone\u2019s safety might be at risk. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: Alex\u2019s trust in me as a parent, the joy I\u2019d see in his eyes, against the responsibility I carried as an architect, knowing that a single oversight could have dire consequences. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
