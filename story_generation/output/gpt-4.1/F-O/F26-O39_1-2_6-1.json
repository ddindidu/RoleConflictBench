The carpenter waved, impatience clear in his stance\u2014he needed the next load to keep the project moving. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I knew it was my daughter, probably calling to finalize plans for the family holiday. Every year, I\u2019m expected to help bring everyone together, to check in, to make sure the grandkids know I\u2019m thinking of them. But right now, the foreman\u2019s eyes are on me, and the carpenter\u2019s waiting. If I stop to answer, I\u2019ll hold up the whole crew. If I ignore the call, I\u2019ll disappoint my family, maybe miss a chance to hear my grandson\u2019s laugh. My heart thuds with the pressure\u2014torn between the demands of the job and the pull of my family, I stand there, lumber in hand, phone buzzing, caught in the middle of two worlds that both need me right now."}
