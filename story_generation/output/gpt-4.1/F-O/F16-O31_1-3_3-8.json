My partner had already done the washing, and I knew they expected me to do my part, to share the load like we promised. But as I reached for a towel, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the station: I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d worked for months. I knew how important my testimony was, how much the department and the victims depended on me to act with integrity and fairness, to be there when called. But I also saw the disappointment in my partner\u2019s eyes when they glanced at the laundry, the silent expectation that I\u2019d help keep our home running. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the duty to my badge and the promise I made at home, and I wondered how I could possibly meet both demands without letting someone down."}
