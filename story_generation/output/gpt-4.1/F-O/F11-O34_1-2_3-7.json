My little brother wanted to go hiking, my mom suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me, expecting I\u2019d be there, too. I nodded, trying to seem present, but my phone buzzed with updates from the control tower. A line of thunderstorms was moving in, and flights were already being rerouted. I knew what that meant\u2014more coordination, more handoffs, and a tense, high-stakes shift ahead. My family\u2019s voices blurred with the urgent chatter in my headset. I felt the weight of their hopes for a rare day together, pressing against the responsibility I owed to the pilots and passengers depending on me. My heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two, torn between the warmth of home and the cold, focused world of the radar screen."}
