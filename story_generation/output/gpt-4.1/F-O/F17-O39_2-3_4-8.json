I drop my tools, glancing at the half-finished wall, but my mind is already racing. The foreman\u2019s voice booms, \u201cEveryone to the muster point, now!\u201d I know the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays. But as I turn to join the others, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, today is the family prayer. You must light the incense before noon, as our ancestors did.\u201d The words weigh on me. My family has been insistent lately, reminding me that tradition is not to be broken, especially now. I feel the pressure of their expectations, the pride in our customs, the fear of disappointing them. But here, on the site, I am just another worker, expected to follow orders, to be responsible for my own safety and that of my team. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my loyalty, and for a moment, I stand frozen, torn between the echoing alarm and the silent call of home."}
