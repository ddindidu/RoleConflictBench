This morning, I\u2019d noticed the deep lines on my mother\u2019s face, the way my father\u2019s hands trembled as he poured his coffee. They tried to hide it, but I could see the exhaustion in their eyes. I wanted to stay, to sit with them, to listen and offer comfort, but duty called.\n\nNow, standing between two angry drivers on the side of the road, I felt the weight of my badge. Both insisted the other was at fault, voices rising, demanding justice. I was expected to be calm, impartial, and fair, to uphold the law without bias. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my mother\u2019s name on the screen. I knew she needed me, maybe just to talk, maybe for something more. My heart twisted as I tried to focus on the accident report, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the officer the public expected. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
