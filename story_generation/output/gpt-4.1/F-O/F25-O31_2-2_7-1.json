Mom barely spoke, her eyes shadowed with worry. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cAll units, report to Main and Fifth.

But as a step-child, I was supposed to be present, to offer comfort and stability at home. I could see the fear in my parents\u2019 faces, their silent plea for me to stay. Yet, the city needed me too. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, torn by the weight of their expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
