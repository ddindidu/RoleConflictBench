My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she told me our son had been caught stealing snacks at the corner store. My heart clenched. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to be there and guide him through this mistake. But just as I was about to call home, a red light flashed on my control panel\u2014a critical brake system alert. My training kicked in: I had to report the malfunction and stop the train immediately, for the safety of hundreds of passengers. My hands hovered over the controls, but my mind was split. My son needed me to be a father, to show him discipline and compassion in this moment. My passengers needed me to be vigilant, focused, and responsible. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I felt torn, caught between the tracks of duty and love, not knowing which path to take first."}
