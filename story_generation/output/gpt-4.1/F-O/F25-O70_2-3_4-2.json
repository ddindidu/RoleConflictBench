The address flashed on the screen: the hospital, urgent, medical supplies. I knew what that meant\u2014someone\u2019s care depended on me. But today was the day my stepfamily gathered for our annual tradition, a dinner that my stepmother insisted was sacred. \u201cWe all have to be there, no excuses,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes lingering on me. I could still hear her voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to honor the family\u2019s customs, especially now that I was part of it.\n\nMy uniform felt heavy as I weighed my options. If I left for the hospital, I\u2019d miss the dinner and disappoint my stepfamily, maybe even make them question my place among them. But if I stayed, the delivery would be late, and someone at the hospital might suffer. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, my stepmother\u2019s expectant gaze in the other. I felt torn in two, pulled by the demands of family and duty, unsure which role I was supposed to honor first."}
