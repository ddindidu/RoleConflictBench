I really need you.\u201d I can almost hear the tremor in her words, and my heart sinks. She\u2019s just found out about Dad\u2019s diagnosis, and I know she\u2019s barely holding it together. I want to be there for her, to listen, to reassure her that we\u2019ll get through this together. But as I reach for my phone, my laptop pings with a dozen Slack notifications. The product launch date was just moved up, and now the architects from three different teams are waiting on me to finalize the API specs. They can\u2019t move forward until I do. My manager\u2019s message is blunt: \u201cNeed your decisions ASAP. Everyone\u2019s blocked.\u201d I stare at the screen, torn. My family needs me, but so does my team. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel paralyzed, caught between being the sibling my sister needs and the developer my team depends on."}
