She needed me to be honest, to share my worries and plans, to be present in this moment. I could see the anxiety in her face, the way her hands twisted together. I wanted to reassure her, to talk through every detail, but my radio crackled to life. Dispatch called: a woman with a broken leg, nothing life-threatening, but she was scared and alone, waiting for help. I grabbed my keys, my wife\u2019s words still hanging in the air. As I slid into the ambulance, my mind raced. She expected my openness, my full attention, but now the city\u2019s rush hour pressed in, horns blaring, lights flashing. I was expected to drive safely, to focus, to keep my patient and crew out of harm\u2019s way. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014my wife\u2019s need for honesty, my duty to the patient. I gripped the wheel, torn between the conversation I\u2019d left unfinished and the responsibility ahead, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
