She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, excited to show me her new drawings and play our favorite board game. My daughter had called earlier, reminding me not to be late this time. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave the shop, my phone buzzed. The plant manager\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cThe main unit\u2019s down again. Sensor errors.
