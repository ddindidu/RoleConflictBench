She\u2019s just learned she has diabetes, and her questions tumble out, each one heavier than the last. I steady my voice, explaining the diagnosis, the medications, the lifestyle changes\u2014trying to be gentle, thorough, and present. But my mind keeps flickering to the text from Mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied. I know she worries, especially when I get busy. I want to send a quick message, let her know I\u2019m okay, but Mrs. Lee is waiting, vulnerable and afraid. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my mother\u2019s need for connection, my patient\u2019s need for comfort. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the guilt gnaws at me. I wish I could split myself in two, but I can\u2019t. I take a breath, torn, as Mrs. Lee looks at me expectantly and my phone vibrates again."}
