The prototype deadline loomed, and every minute counted. My mind raced with calculations, design tweaks, and the pressure of knowing the entire team was counting on me to deliver. Just as I was about to dive into a critical simulation, my younger brother barged in, his face flushed with frustration. He wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about a fight he\u2019d had with our parents. He needed me to listen, to be patient, to understand his side without judgment. I could see how much it meant to him, how much he needed his brother right now. But the clock was ticking, and the project\u2019s success\u2014and my reputation as an engineer\u2014hung in the balance. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations: be the supportive brother he deserved, or the reliable engineer my team needed. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which role to answer first."}
