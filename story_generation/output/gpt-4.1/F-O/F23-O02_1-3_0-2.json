It was 2:45 p.m.\u2014fifteen minutes until the final bell at the kids\u2019 school. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up Jamie and Riley.\u201d I pictured their faces, searching the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. But my screen was filled with error logs and urgent Slack messages. The build was stalled, and the team was waiting on my core module. If I left now, the project would grind to a halt, and the deadline was already tight. My manager\u2019s last message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need your solution ASAP.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down. I wanted to be the reliable step-parent, the one who showed up, but I was also the engineer everyone depended on. My hands hovered over the keyboard, mind racing, as I tried to figure out which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
