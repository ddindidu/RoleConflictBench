She\u2019s just learned she has diabetes, and I can see the questions swirling in her mind\u2014fear, confusion, the need for reassurance. I know I need to be present, to explain things gently, to answer every question with patience and empathy. But the phone keeps vibrating. It\u2019s Sunday evening, the time I always call my stepdad. He\u2019s been waiting for my call all week, probably sitting by the phone, hoping to hear about my life, wanting to tell me about his garden or ask if I\u2019m eating well. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in\u2014my patient needs me to be her doctor, calm and attentive, but my stepdad needs me to be his child, present and caring. My heart aches as I glance at the phone, then back at Mrs. Lee, torn between two worlds that both need me, right now."}
