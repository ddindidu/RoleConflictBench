He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than just a simple answer. I knew he wanted me to open up, to share the stress that had been building inside me all afternoon. But my mind was still at the store, replaying the manager\u2019s instructions: every step of the cash deposit had to be perfect, every form filled, every bill counted twice. The pressure to follow every policy exactly was suffocating, especially after a long, chaotic shift. I wanted to tell him how anxious I felt, how the responsibility weighed on me, but I hesitated. Part of me wanted to protect him from my worries, to keep our evening light. Yet, as a wife, I knew I should be honest, let him in. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, words caught in my throat, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
