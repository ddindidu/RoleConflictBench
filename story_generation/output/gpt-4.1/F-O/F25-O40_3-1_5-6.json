Your father would be proud.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew how much this meant to her, to the family, to the memory of my late father. I wanted to honor them, to show I belonged, but the words felt foreign in my mouth.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A customer\u2019s message: \u201cMy son\u2019s favorite wooden train broke. Can you look at it today? He\u2019s heartbroken.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The ceremony was in an hour, but the shop was only a few blocks away. As a carpenter, I prided myself on being reliable, especially for sentimental repairs. I imagined the little boy\u2019s face, the trust his parents placed in me.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. Family or work? Tradition or responsibility? I stared at the script in my hand, the phone in the other, and felt the ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
