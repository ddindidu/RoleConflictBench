I glanced at the screen\u2014my husband\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d been agonizing over a big decision at work for days, and I knew he was finally reaching out for support. My heart twisted. As his wife, I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d make the right choice. But as a nursing assistant, I was already running behind. Mrs. Carter waited patiently, her frail hands folded, depending on me for her dignity and comfort. The expectation to be present for my husband clashed with my duty to my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My mind raced, torn between the person I loved at home and the person who needed me right here, right now."}
