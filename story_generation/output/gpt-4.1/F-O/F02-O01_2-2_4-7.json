My heart pounded\u2014not just from worry about him knocking something over, but from the urgent buzz of my phone in my hand. The contractor was calling, probably about the delivery delay that could throw the whole project off schedule. I was supposed to be on top of every detail, to answer immediately, to keep the build moving. But right now, my son needed me to be a father, to teach him about respect and discipline, to guide him gently but firmly. I could feel the eyes of other shoppers on us, expecting me to step in. My mind raced: do I answer the call and risk letting my son\u2019s behavior slide, or do I put the phone away and risk missing a critical moment at work? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
