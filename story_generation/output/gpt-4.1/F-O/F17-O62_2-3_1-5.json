As I walked past the filtration system, I noticed a strange noise and a blinking red light. My heart sank. If the filter wasn\u2019t fixed, the water could become unsafe for swimmers tomorrow. I knew I should call maintenance right away and stay until someone arrived. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was 7:00 p.m.\u2014the time I always called my parents. Every week, without fail, I updated them on my life and asked about theirs. They worried if I was even a few minutes late, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. I stood there, torn between my responsibility to keep the pool safe and my promise to my parents. My hand hovered over my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
