My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My fingers hovered over the call list, but my phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cDad\u2019s not feeling well. Can you call?\u201d I pictured them at home, faces drawn, voices tired. I knew they needed me, just to listen, to reassure them everything would be okay. But every minute I spent away from my calls meant fewer chances to hit my target, and the whole team was counting on me. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between dialing another number for work and calling home to be the daughter my parents needed. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
