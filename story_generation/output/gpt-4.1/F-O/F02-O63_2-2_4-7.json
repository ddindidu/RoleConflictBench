My son darts between aisles, giggling, ignoring my whispered pleas to stay close. As a father, I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running in public isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what I promised myself\u2014teach him right from wrong, be present, be patient. But as a telemarketer, my break is strictly timed. Management watches every second, and if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get a warning. The phone queue is always full, and I can\u2019t risk losing this job. My heart pounds as I watch my son nearly bump into an elderly woman. I want to hang up, rush over, and guide him, but the clock is ticking. My mind races, torn between the father my son needs and the employee my job demands. I grip the phone tighter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019ll let down first."}
