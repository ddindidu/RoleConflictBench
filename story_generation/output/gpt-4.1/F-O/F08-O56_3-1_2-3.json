I glanced down and saw my granddaughter\u2019s name flash across the screen, followed by a message: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless something was truly weighing on her. I wanted to drop everything, call her, and offer the comfort and guidance she needed\u2014just as a grandmother should.\n\nBut Mrs. Lee was watching me in the mirror, her eyes kind but expectant. \u201cCould you just take a little more off the front?\u201d she asked, touching her fringe. She trusted me to make her feel her best, and I knew how much she valued these appointments. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My hands hesitated, scissors poised, as I wrestled with the urge to be the wise, supportive grandmother my granddaughter needed and the attentive, professional hairdresser my client expected. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and for a moment, I stood frozen, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
