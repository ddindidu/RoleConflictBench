The laundry basket was overflowing this morning, shirts and socks spilling onto the floor. My partner\u2019s tired eyes met mine as I rushed out the door, and I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight. Now, as a nursing assistant, I\u2019m expected to be focused and efficient. Mrs. Lee is waiting for her morning vitals, and I know how anxious she gets if I\u2019m late. My supervisor expects accuracy and timeliness\u2014no excuses. But my phone buzzes in my pocket: a message from my spouse, asking if I\u2019ll be home early to help with chores. Guilt twists in my stomach. I want to be reliable at work, but I also want to be a good partner, to share the load at home. The weight of both roles presses on me as I stand outside Mrs. Lee\u2019s door, stethoscope in hand, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family."}
