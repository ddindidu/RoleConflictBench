My phone buzzed with messages from my team\u2014everyone was waiting for my core module to be finished so the project could move forward. The deadline loomed, and I knew the pressure was on me to deliver. But across the room, my granddaughter sat curled up on the couch, her eyes red and distant. I could sense her sadness, the way she avoided my gaze, and I knew she needed me. As her grandmother, I wanted to set aside everything, to offer her comfort, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years and help her find her way. Yet, as an engineer, I was the linchpin of a project that dozens depended on. My heart ached with the pull of both worlds\u2014my family needing my presence, my team needing my expertise. I stared at the screen, then at her, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
