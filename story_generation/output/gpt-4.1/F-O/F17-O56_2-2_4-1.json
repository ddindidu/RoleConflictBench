A woman stepped in, her eyes darting nervously, clutching her purse. I knew I should greet her warmly, offer her tea, and make her feel at home\u2014just as my boss expected. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family ceremony. You must wear traditional clothes and help with the rituals. It\u2019s important to us.\u201d My heart squeezed. Lately, my family had been reminding me how crucial it was to honor our customs, to show respect for our heritage. I could almost hear my grandmother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, telling me that family comes first. Yet here I was, the only hairdresser on shift, responsible for welcoming every client. The woman looked at me, uncertain, waiting for reassurance. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, while the demands of my job pulled me in the opposite direction. My mind raced, caught between the warmth of tradition and the duty to my client, unsure which role I could fulfill without letting someone down."}
