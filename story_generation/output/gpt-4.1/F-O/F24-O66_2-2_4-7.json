My stepdad\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, it means a lot to your mom.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were, especially since I\u2019d joined the family only a year ago. They expected me to show up, to be present, to help bridge the awkward gaps that still lingered between us.\n\nBut as I pulled up to the curb, two travelers flagged me down, their arms waving and faces anxious. \u201cCan you help us with our bags? We\u2019re running late for our train,\u201d one said, gesturing to the mountain of suitcases. \u201cWe\u2019ll split the fare, just please hurry.\u201d I could see the stress in their eyes, and I knew what was expected of me as a taxi driver\u2014professionalism, reliability, a willingness to go the extra mile.\n\nMy hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I helped them, I\u2019d be late for dinner, disappointing my family and risking the fragile trust we\u2019d built. But if I turned them away, I\u2019d fail as a driver, letting down people who needed me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, torn, the clock ticking louder with every second."}
