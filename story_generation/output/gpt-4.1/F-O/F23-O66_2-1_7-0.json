My stepdaughter\u2019s text from this morning echoed in my head: \u201cWe\u2019re out of groceries again.\u201d I knew the bills were piling up, and as the step-parent, it was on me to keep the fridge full and the lights on. That meant every fare counted. The passenger slid into the back seat, chatting on his phone about a lunch meeting he wasn\u2019t in a rush for. I started the meter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but not to rush\u2014he had time to spare. But every minute spent on this leisurely ride was a minute I wasn\u2019t picking up another fare, a minute I wasn\u2019t earning what my family needed. My hands tightened on the wheel. Should I take the scenic route, stretching out the ride for a few extra dollars, or stick to the fastest way, honoring my duty as a professional driver? The conflicting demands twisted in my chest as I signaled and pulled into traffic, my mind torn between the needs of my family and the expectations of my passenger."}
