She\u2019d texted me earlier, excited about the party we were both invited to tonight, and I\u2019d promised we\u2019d go together. As her brother, I always tried to make her feel included, especially since she sometimes felt left out of my friend group. But now, sitting in my salon chair, I saw the thick, sticky residue in her hair\u2014she\u2019d tried a new styling gel, and it was a mess. As her hairdresser, I knew I had to wash and condition her hair thoroughly before I could even think about cutting or styling it. But she was already running late, and I could see her anxiety building. She wanted to skip the wash, just a quick trim so we could leave on time. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I insisted on doing my job right, she\u2019d be upset, maybe feel like I was putting work before her. But if I rushed, I\u2019d be compromising my professional standards. My hands hovered over the sink, heart pounding, torn between being the brother she needed and the hairdresser I was trained to be."}
