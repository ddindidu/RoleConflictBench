The contractor was waiting for my approval, but I\u2019d spotted a flaw in the stairwell design\u2014one that could be dangerous if left unaddressed. As I started drafting an urgent email, another message popped up: my younger sister, Anna, was in tears, stranded after a rough day and needing someone to talk to. I could hear her voice trembling through the text, and I knew she rarely reached out unless she truly needed me.\n\nI stared at the plans, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing down. As an architect, I was expected to ensure every detail was safe and compliant, to protect future visitors from harm. But as a brother, I was supposed to be there for Anna, to support her when she was vulnerable. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart raced as I weighed the urgency of the safety issue against Anna\u2019s need for comfort, torn between the expectations of my profession and my family."}
