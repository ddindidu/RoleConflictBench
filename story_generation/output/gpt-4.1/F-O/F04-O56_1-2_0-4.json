As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, cheering her on, just as she\u2019d always done for me. But as I was finishing up my last appointment at the salon, a first-time client stared at her reflection, her lips pressed into a thin line. She hesitated, then quietly confessed that the hair color wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to make every client feel beautiful and heard, to fix any mistake and never rush a job. But my phone buzzed with messages from my sister, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I could almost hear her voice, full of hope, waiting for her big brother. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the client\u2019s disappointment and my sister\u2019s celebration, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
