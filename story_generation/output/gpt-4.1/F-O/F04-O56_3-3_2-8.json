She\u2019d come straight to me after a fight with her best friend, needing comfort, needing her brother. I wanted to hug her, to listen, to be the shoulder she always counted on. But as I ran my fingers through her hair, I felt the thick, sticky buildup\u2014layers of hairspray and dry shampoo, knotted tight. As her hairdresser, I knew I had to wash and condition it thoroughly before I could even think about cutting or styling. If I didn\u2019t, my scissors would snag, and the result would be a mess. But she was pouring her heart out, desperate for me to just be there, not fuss over her hair. I could see she needed me as her brother, not her stylist. My hands hovered, torn between grabbing the shampoo and just holding her hand. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something different from me, each impossible to ignore."}
