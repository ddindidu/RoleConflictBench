My stepmom\u2019s eyes flicked to me, expectant, waiting for my input. I wanted to say yes, to promise I\u2019d be there, but my phone buzzed with a new ride request. The app showed a passenger desperate to get to the airport, their flight leaving in just over an hour. Outside, the snow was coming down harder, and I knew the roads would be treacherous. As a taxi driver, I was supposed to get people where they needed to go, safely and on time, no matter the weather. But as a step-sibling, I was supposed to be present, to help build this fragile sense of family we\u2019d been working on. My stepbrother looked at me, hope in his eyes, while my phone vibrated insistently in my pocket. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
