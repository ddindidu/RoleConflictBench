He was unraveling, his father\u2019s illness weighing on him, and he needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. But my mind was tangled in the day\u2019s events at the firm. Opposing counsel had cornered me in the hallway, their questions sharp, their tone insistent. They wanted details\u2014privileged information about my client that, if revealed, could destroy everything I\u2019d worked to protect. I could still hear their voice, feel the pressure, the threat of consequences if I didn\u2019t comply. My husband\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for comfort, for me to be present.
