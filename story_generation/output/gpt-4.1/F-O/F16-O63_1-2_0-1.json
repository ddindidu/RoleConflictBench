I nodded, half-listening, my mind still tangled in the day\u2019s calls. All afternoon, customers had bombarded me with technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script barely covered. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to never say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The pressure to sound confident, to keep the call moving, was relentless.\n\nNow, my partner needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. But my thoughts kept drifting back to the calls I\u2019d fumbled, the answers I\u2019d improvised. I wanted to be the supportive spouse they deserved, but my mind was still racing with product specs and rebuttals. I could see the hope in their eyes, waiting for me to ask about their day, to care. At the same time, I felt the weight of my job\u2019s demands pressing in, making it hard to switch gears. I sat there, torn, unsure which role to step into first."}
