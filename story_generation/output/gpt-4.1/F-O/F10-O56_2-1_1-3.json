It\u2019s my mom, right on schedule for our weekly call. I glance at the clock\u2014if I answer now, I\u2019ll be late for my next client, but if I wait, I\u2019ll miss the window when Mom is free. Mrs. Lee, always cheerful, suddenly frowns at her reflection and asks if I can snip just a bit more off her fringe. She\u2019s never complained before, and I know how important it is to make sure she leaves happy. My hands hover over her hair, scissors poised, but my mind is split. I can hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, expecting to catch up, to hear about my week, to tell me about Dad\u2019s new hobby. At the same time, I feel the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in me as her hairdresser. I want to be the attentive daughter who never misses a call, and the professional who never lets a client down. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between two worlds, both needing me right now."}
