My daughter had just texted the family group chat, sharing her excitement about her new job. My wife replied with a string of heart emojis, and my grandson sent a voice note, his little voice bubbling with pride for his mom. I knew I should respond, maybe even call, to show I was present and supportive. That\u2019s what a good grandfather does\u2014keeps the family close, celebrates their joys.\n\nBut my screen was filled with error logs. QA had flagged a minor UI glitch that, while not critical, was still my responsibility to fix. The workaround was simple, but the bug nagged at me, a reminder of my duty as a developer to deliver clean, reliable software. My team expected a quick turnaround, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nI stared at the phone, thumb hovering over the call button, while my other hand rested on the mouse, ready to dive back into the code. The weight of both worlds pressed in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
