We\u2019d agreed to share the chores, and I knew my partner was counting on me to finally fold the clothes tonight. But just as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling me in for a minor traffic accident nearby. I was the closest officer on duty. \n\nAs I drove to the scene, my mind raced. At home, I was supposed to be a reliable partner, someone who pulled their weight. But as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to be present and impartial for the people involved in the accident. When I arrived, two frustrated drivers waited, each insisting the other was at fault. I could feel my own frustration simmering beneath the surface\u2014torn between the duty to my badge and the promise I\u2019d made at home. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet them both."}
