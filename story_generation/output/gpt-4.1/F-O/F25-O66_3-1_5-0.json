It would mean so much to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important this was\u2014being asked to uphold the family tradition, to step up as a real part of the family, not just the outsider. But as I read the message, my meter ticked on. My passenger, a young man in no rush, chatted idly about his day, unconcerned with time. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him to his meeting safely and on time, even if he didn\u2019t care about punctuality. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I rushed the ride, I\u2019d risk my passenger\u2019s safety and my reputation. If I took my time, I might miss the ceremony, letting down my family and reinforcing the distance I\u2019d always felt. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my passenger, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
