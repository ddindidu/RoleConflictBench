My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d I promised I would, but now my phone buzzes with a message from the clinic\u2014my last patient is waiting. I grab my coat, guilt gnawing at me as I leave the laundry untouched.\n\nAt the clinic, I sit across from a patient sniffling and coughing, symptoms pointing to a common cold. But I know I can\u2019t just assume; I have to be thorough, ask the right questions, order the right tests if needed. My mind drifts back to home, to the laundry, to my wife\u2019s weary face. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one expects me to be present, to share the load; the other demands my focus, my expertise, my undivided attention. My heart pounds as I realize I can\u2019t be in both places at once, and I\u2019m left suspended, torn between the person I love and the duty I\u2019ve sworn to uphold."}
