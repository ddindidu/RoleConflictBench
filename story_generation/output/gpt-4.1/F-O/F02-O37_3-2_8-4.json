As a father, I know I have to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind\u2014my family\u2019s security depends on it. Every extra rupee counts, and I\u2019ve been picking up extra shifts as a housekeeping cleaner just to keep us afloat. But today, as I finish mopping the last room at my client\u2019s house, I notice the floor cleaner bottle is almost empty. The client expects me to manage their supplies, and the next cleaning is in just three days. If I buy the cleaner myself, it\u2019ll eat into the money I\u2019m saving for the loan. If I don\u2019t, I risk disappointing the client and maybe losing the job. My mind spins with worry\u2014should I spend on the cleaner now, or hold onto every bit for my family\u2019s future? The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy both."}
