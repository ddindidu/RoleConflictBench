He was fidgety, barely listening, and I knew I needed to be patient, to guide him gently, to show him the importance of respect and order. Just as I was about to correct his placement of the spoon, my phone buzzed with a message from my cleaning supervisor: \u201cUrgent\u2014client\u2019s house out of enzyme cleaner. Need you to pick some up before next job.\u201d My heart sank. The client expected the house spotless, and without that cleaner, I couldn\u2019t do my job. But Ethan was looking at me, waiting for approval, and I could see how much he needed my attention. I felt torn\u2014should I rush out to buy the cleaner, risking Ethan feeling abandoned, or stay and finish this lesson, knowing I\u2019d disappoint my employer and possibly lose a client? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
