Her shoulders slumped, and her eyes were clouded with worry. I knew that look\u2014she needed someone to listen, to offer the kind of gentle wisdom only a grandmother could give. My heart ached to reach across the table, to tell her stories of my own struggles and reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab safety audit was in two hours. I\u2019d already been warned about the calibration errors on the spectrometer, and if I didn\u2019t fix them, the whole team could face consequences. My mind raced between the urge to stay and comfort my granddaughter and the responsibility to uphold the standards of my profession. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
