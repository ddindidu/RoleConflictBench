My shift was steady\u2014just routine traffic, nothing out of the ordinary. Then my phone buzzed. It was my daughter. Her voice trembled as she told me my grandson had fallen and was being rushed to the hospital. \u201cDad, can you come?\u201d she pleaded. My heart clenched. I was the one they turned to in moments like this, the steady hand, the comforter. But just then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through my headset, requesting the altimeter setting. My training kicked in\u2014I knew how vital every instruction was, how a single misstep could ripple into disaster. I glanced at the family photo taped to my monitor, my grandson\u2019s gap-toothed grin beaming back at me. The weight of both worlds pressed down on my shoulders. My family needed me, but so did the pilots in my airspace. I felt torn, the expectations of grandfather and controller pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
