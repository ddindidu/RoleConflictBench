My stepkids\u2019 school let out at 3:15, and I\u2019d promised to be there at the gate, waving, just like the other parents. But my headset was still glued to my ear, the phone queue never-ending, and management had sent another reminder about break logs this morning. I glanced at the break schedule\u2014my next one wasn\u2019t for another hour. If I left early, it would be obvious. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice, disappointed, reminding me that every minute counted, that we were a team. But I also pictured the kids\u2019 faces, searching the crowd, hoping to see me. I\u2019d told them I\u2019d be there, and after everything we\u2019d been through, I wanted to keep that promise. My stomach twisted as I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my new family, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
