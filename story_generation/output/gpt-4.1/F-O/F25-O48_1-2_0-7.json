Everything okay?\u201d I know he worries, especially since Mom passed, and I promised I\u2019d check in more often. But I\u2019m at work, and Mrs. Carter, my patient, is gripping my hand, her eyes wide and watery. She\u2019s just come out of surgery, and I can feel her fear in the way she squeezes my fingers. She needs me to be present, to reassure her, to listen. My phone vibrates again, and I glance at it, guilt prickling in my chest. I want to send a quick reply, let my stepdad know I\u2019m thinking of him, but Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice trembles as she asks if I\u2019ll stay with her a little longer. I\u2019m torn\u2014my family expects me to reach out, to show I care, but right now, someone else needs me just as much.
