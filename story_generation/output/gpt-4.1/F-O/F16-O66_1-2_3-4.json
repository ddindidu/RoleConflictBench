My phone buzzes with a message from my spouse: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry tonight? It\u2019s piling up.\u201d I picture the overflowing basket in the living room, socks and shirts tumbling out, and I feel a pang of guilt. I promised I\u2019d help more at home, and I know how much it means to share the load. But right now, I\u2019m gripping the steering wheel, eyes darting between the slick road and the erratic brake lights ahead. The rain is relentless, and other drivers keep darting between lanes, forcing me to brake hard and swerve just to keep my passengers safe. I know I can\u2019t cut corners\u2014one mistake could mean an accident. My mind tugs in two directions: the warmth of home and the cold, tense focus of the road. I want to be reliable in both places, but tonight, I can\u2019t see how. The laundry waits, the rain falls harder, and I\u2019m caught between the demands of the person I love and the job that keeps us going."}
