I knew that if I didn\u2019t get to it right away, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company hours and risking my reputation as the go-to repairer. My hands were already reaching for my toolbox when my phone buzzed. It was a video call from my granddaughter, her face pale and eyes red. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I could see the weight of her worry, the kind that only a grandparent\u2019s wisdom could ease. My mind raced\u2014if I ignored the machine, I\u2019d let down my team and risk a disaster. But if I brushed off my granddaughter, I\u2019d fail her when she needed me most. The demands of both worlds pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I stood frozen, torn between the screeching metal and the silent plea in her eyes."}
