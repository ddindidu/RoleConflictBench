I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and the whole family was gathering to toast her success. I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on, just like she\u2019d always done for me. \n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my supervisor\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom. \u201cWe need you in the workshop. That old packaging machine is acting up again\u2014intermittent fault, and we can\u2019t risk it failing when orders pick up.\u201d I was the only one who really understood its quirks, and even though production was slow, management wanted it fixed before the next rush. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in.
