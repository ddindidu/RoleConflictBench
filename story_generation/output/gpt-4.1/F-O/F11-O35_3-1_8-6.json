He was upset about something I\u2019d said last night, and I knew I needed to call him, to talk it through, to show him I cared and respected his feelings. That\u2019s what being a good sister meant\u2014listening, communicating, not letting misunderstandings fester. But as I sat in the operator\u2019s break room, my work tablet pinged with a new email. It was from the transit authority: an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. They encouraged us to respond promptly, to show initiative and commitment to our roles. I knew my supervisor would notice who replied quickly. I felt the pressure to be the reliable, professional subway operator, always on top of things. My thumb hovered between the call button for my brother and the reply button for the seminar. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my family needed me to be present, but my job demanded my attention, too. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension knot in my chest, torn between the two worlds that both mattered so much."}
