My sister had sent a flurry of excited texts about the holiday trip they\u2019d planned, and Mom was already assigning everyone tasks for the celebration. \u201cWe really want you there,\u201d she wrote, and I could almost hear her hopeful voice. At the same time, my laptop pinged with a Slack notification\u2014another message from the product manager. The launch date for our new feature had been moved up, and now architects from three different teams were waiting on me to finalize the API specs. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: my family expecting me to be present, to laugh and cook and make memories, while my team needed me to be decisive, responsive, and available for late-night calls. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
