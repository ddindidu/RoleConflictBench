The workshop on the new prescription guidelines was running longer than expected, and the speaker was just getting to the most critical updates. I knew how important it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge, and my manager expected me to bring back insights for the whole team. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: school was ending soon, and my kids would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there today, not just to pick them up, but to hear about their day, to be the dad who shows up. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my profession and the promise to my children.
