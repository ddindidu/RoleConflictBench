I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, and he needed me. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and help him through the rough patches. But my mind was racing with another worry. Just before leaving, I\u2019d noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system making a strange grinding noise. If it failed, the water could become unsafe for tomorrow\u2019s swim lessons. As a lifeguard, it was my responsibility to report and address any hazards immediately, no matter what. Max dropped his backpack and looked at me, waiting for me to ask what was wrong. I could see he needed me, but I also knew the pool\u2019s safety couldn\u2019t wait. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between comforting my stepbrother and rushing back to the pool to fix the problem."}
