My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with anticipation every time she asked if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave my chambers, my clerk rushed in, breathless, holding a thick file. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed\u2014one that couldn\u2019t wait. The law demanded I review the documents immediately and make a ruling within the hour. I could picture my daughter scanning the classroom, searching for my face, while I sat at my desk, poring over affidavits and legal arguments. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my duty to protect justice, and my promise to be present for my child. I felt torn, guilt and responsibility warring inside me, as I stood frozen between the courtroom and the school auditorium, unable to move."}
