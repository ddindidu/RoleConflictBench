As her step-child, I was expected to help set the table, share stories, and uphold the family traditions that made these mornings special. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled for the morning shift at the care home. Mrs. Evans, my favorite patient, relied on me to help her bathe and dress before breakfast. She always said my presence made her mornings brighter. I could picture her waiting, anxious if I was late. My stepmother called from downstairs, her voice warm but firm, \u201cWe\u2019re starting soon, don\u2019t be late!\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be the dependable step-child, part of the family, but I also couldn\u2019t let Mrs. Evans down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen at the top of the stairs, torn between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
