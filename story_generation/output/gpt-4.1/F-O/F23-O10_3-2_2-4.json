My phone buzzed with a message from the school: my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me as soon as possible. My heart sank. As a step-parent, I knew I needed to be there for him, to show up at the school, listen, and help him understand the seriousness of his actions. But as the company\u2019s accountant, I was already behind on the quarterly tax filing, and any delay could mean penalties or worse. My boss had made it clear that compliance was non-negotiable. I stared at the calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My stepson needed guidance and support, but the company needed my undivided attention. I could feel the anxiety rising, torn between being the parent he needed and the professional my job demanded."}
