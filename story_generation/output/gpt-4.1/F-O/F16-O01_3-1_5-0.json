My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the guest towels still needed folding and the spare room had to be vacuumed before my in-laws arrived. The house was a flurry of activity, and I was expected to help make everything perfect. My phone buzzed on the counter\u2014an email from the contractor. I opened the attachment and scanned the building plans, my heart sinking as I spotted a few minor inconsistencies in the fire escape routes. They weren\u2019t urgent, but as the lead architect, I was responsible for safety and compliance. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the expectation to be a supportive partner at home, and the professional duty to ensure every detail was right. I felt torn, the pressure mounting as I tried to decide which responsibility needed me more in this moment."}
