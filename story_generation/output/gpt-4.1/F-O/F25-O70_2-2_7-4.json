My shift was almost over, but my mind kept drifting back to home. My stepdad had barely touched his dinner last night, and Mom\u2019s eyes were rimmed red. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to talk to, someone to just sit with them. But now, as I pulled up to the next address, I had to focus. The package in my hands was worth a few hundred dollars, and company policy was clear: no signature, no delivery. I rang the bell, rehearsing my polite but firm request for a signature. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mom, asking if I\u2019d be home soon. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. My parents needed comfort, but my job demanded precision and reliability. If I rushed, I might make a mistake; if I lingered, I\u2019d be late getting home. My heart pounded as the door opened, and I forced a smile, torn between the expectations of the uniform I wore and the family waiting for me."}
