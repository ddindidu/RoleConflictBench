My stepmom\u2019s eyes sparkled with hope that I\u2019d join in, and I could feel the unspoken expectation: be present, be part of the family. But my phone buzzed with another Slack notification from work. The new feature I\u2019d been building was almost done, but the code review was full of red flags\u2014performance issues, suggestions for cleaner logic. My team lead\u2019s comments echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this to be solid before Monday.\u201d I wanted to reassure my family, to say yes to their plans, but my mind kept drifting back to the code, the looming deadline, the pressure to deliver something I could be proud of. I felt torn, the warmth of family togetherness on one side, the cold logic of my IDE on the other, both demanding more than I could give."}
