She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, and if I\u2019d remembered to call Dad about his doctor\u2019s appointment. I knew she expected quick replies, little updates that reassured her I was okay and still part of the family. But the navigation app on my dashboard was flashing too\u2014my next passenger, a businesswoman in a hurry, was already texting through the app, asking how much longer I\u2019d be. As a taxi driver, I was supposed to be focused, professional, and above all, punctual. I could feel the pressure building in my chest, torn between the need to reassure my stepmother and the responsibility to get my passenger to her meeting on time. The light turned green, and I gripped the wheel, my phone vibrating insistently in the cup holder, my mind racing with the impossible choice between family and work."}
