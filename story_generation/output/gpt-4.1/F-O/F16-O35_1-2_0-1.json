Wish you were here.\u201d I can almost hear the fatigue in their words, and I want to reply with something comforting, to let them know I\u2019m thinking of them. But the control panel blinks with a warning\u2014there\u2019s a minor signal delay ahead. I need to adjust the train\u2019s speed, keep the ride smooth, and make sure we stay on schedule. My hands hover over the controls, my mind split. I know my partner expects me to be present, to offer a few kind words, even if just by text. But the passengers in my care expect a safe, steady ride, and my full attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the urge to reach out clashing with the responsibility to focus. My heart aches to be there for my partner, but my duty as a subway operator demands every ounce of concentration. The train hums forward, and I\u2019m caught in the space between two worlds, torn by the expectations that neither can wait."}
