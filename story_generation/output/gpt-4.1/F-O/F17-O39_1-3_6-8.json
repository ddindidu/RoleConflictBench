My heart jumped\u2014protocol was clear: drop everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. But just as I reached for my helmet, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad\u2019s not himself today.\u201d I knew what she needed\u2014just a few words, a check-in, a reminder that I cared. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d always be there for them, especially when things felt shaky at home. But the foreman\u2019s voice was already echoing across the yard, urging us to move, and I could see the other workers streaming toward the gate. My hands shook as I weighed the phone in my palm, torn between the duty to my team and the promise I\u2019d made to my family. The pressure built in my chest, the world narrowing to the choice I had to make, right now."}
