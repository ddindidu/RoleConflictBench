Three sectors, all at once\u2014my mind raced, calculating vectors, frequencies, the voices of other controllers overlapping in my ear. I knew I had to stay sharp, coordinate every move, keep the skies safe. Then my phone buzzed. It was Mom. I hesitated, but answered, her voice trembling. She told me about Dad\u2019s health scare, her fears spilling out, her need for comfort raw and immediate. I could hear the pain in her words, the expectation that I would be the strong one, the listener, the child who could hold her together. But the radio crackled with urgent calls\u2014pilots needing instructions, colleagues needing decisions. My heart pounded, torn between the chaos in the air and the ache in my mother\u2019s voice. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the support she needed, but the demands of the sky pressed in, relentless. I stared at the screens, my hands shaking, caught between two worlds that needed me, unsure which to answer first."}
