Can we talk this weekend?\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I knew she wanted to feel included, to bridge the awkward gaps that still lingered between us. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more often, maybe even call instead of just sending a quick text. But as I typed out a reply, my work email pinged\u2014my client\u2019s hearing, scheduled for Saturday morning, had been moved up. It was a minor procedural matter, nothing urgent, and I could easily request a postponement. Still, I felt the weight of my professional responsibility; my client expected me to be there, to show up, to care about their case as much as they did. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between sending a reassuring message to my stepmother and drafting an email to the court. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to satisfy either without letting the other down."}
