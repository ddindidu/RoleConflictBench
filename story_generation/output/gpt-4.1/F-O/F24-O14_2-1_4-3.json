My stepbrother\u2019s text popped up again: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom\u2019s expecting you at dinner.\u201d I could almost hear the clatter of plates and the awkward laughter that always filled our family gatherings. As a step-sibling, I knew how much it meant to show up, to prove I was part of this patchwork family, especially to my stepmom who tried so hard to make me feel included.\n\nBut as a scientist, I felt the tug of responsibility. The data from today\u2019s experiment was fresh in my mind, the details sharp and clear. I could log it later\u2014my supervisor wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014but I hated the idea of letting the information grow fuzzy, of not being as precise as I could be. I wanted to be reliable in the lab, the one who never cut corners.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be present at the table, but I also wanted to be true to my work. The choice loomed, and I sat frozen, torn between two lives that both needed me."}
