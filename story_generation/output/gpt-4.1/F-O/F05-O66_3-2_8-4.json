My wife\u2019s voice echoed in my mind from this morning\u2014her eyes searching mine, asking for honesty about our finances, about the doctor\u2019s call I\u2019d brushed off. She wanted me to open up, to be the partner she could trust, but I\u2019d dodged her questions, promising we\u2019d talk tonight. Now, as a taxi driver, my focus was demanded elsewhere. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. I had to keep my attention sharp, every sense tuned to the chaos outside, because one mistake could mean disaster for my passenger and me. But my phone buzzed with her name, and guilt twisted in my chest. She needed answers, needed me present and honest, but right now, my responsibility was to the road, to safety. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding all of me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which to answer first."}
