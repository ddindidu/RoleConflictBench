As a lawyer, I knew the client\u2019s document wasn\u2019t urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely. Still, my mind kept drifting to the conversation I\u2019d had with my stepson that morning. He\u2019d been counting down the days until I would buy him the Nintendo I\u2019d promised, his eyes shining with hope. Money was tight, and I\u2019d been working extra hours to ensure our family stayed afloat. The expectation to provide, to keep my promise, pressed on me as heavily as the legal obligations waiting in my inbox. I could use this evening to get ahead on work, maybe even impress the client with my efficiency. Or I could take my stepson to the store, spend the money, and see his face light up. The weight of both roles\u2014provider and professional\u2014pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the familiar ache of not knowing which expectation I should meet first."}
