As a telemarketer, every second was tracked, every break scheduled to the minute. The automated system didn\u2019t care if I was tired or distracted; it only cared that I was on the line, selling, following the script. But today, my mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that I was expected to lead the family ceremony this afternoon\u2014a tradition passed down for generations. My father had already set out the ceremonial items, and my relatives were gathering, waiting for me to take my place at the front. I could almost feel their eyes, full of expectation, urging me not to let them down. Yet, if I left my desk even a minute early, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d risk a warning or worse. My heart pounded as I weighed the pressure of honoring my family\u2019s legacy against the rigid demands of my job. The clock ticked closer to the ceremony\u2019s start, and I felt trapped, torn between two worlds that refused to bend for each other."}
