I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014our traditions were the glue that held our family together. But as I nodded, my mind drifted to the notice I\u2019d seen at the construction site that morning. There was an optional training session next week, one that my supervisor hinted could lead to more responsibility and better pay. The team was counting on me to step up, to show I was serious about my work. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s hopes on one side, my coworkers\u2019 trust on the other. My stomach twisted as I tried to imagine how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
