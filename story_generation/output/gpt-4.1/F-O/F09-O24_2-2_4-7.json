My son darts away, weaving between displays, his laughter echoing down the aisle. I feel the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting a mother to teach her child discipline, to gently but firmly correct him. I call his name, but my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my clerk. The attorney in tomorrow\u2019s hearing has cited a new appellate decision, and I need to review it before court. The weight of my robe presses invisibly on my shoulders, demanding I stay current, impartial, prepared. My son knocks over a display of cereal boxes, and I see the store manager frown. I want to kneel, to explain to my son about respect and responsibility, but my mind races with legal arguments and the urgent need to read that new case. I stand frozen, torn between the mother I am expected to be and the judge I must remain, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
