The routine was always tight, and I knew she depended on me to help her get ready for breakfast. As I passed the window, I caught a glimpse of my younger brother outside, his backpack slung over one shoulder, about to step off the curb without even glancing at the busy street. My heart lurched. I was supposed to be there for him, to make sure he stayed safe, especially after Mom\u2019s constant reminders. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, and I could already hear her soft voice calling for help. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my brother\u2019s safety on one side, my patient\u2019s trust and care on the other. My feet froze, torn between running outside to stop my brother and staying to fulfill my duty as a nursing assistant. The seconds stretched, my mind racing with the impossible choice."}
