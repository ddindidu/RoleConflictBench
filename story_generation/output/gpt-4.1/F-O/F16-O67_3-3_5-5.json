My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the relatives would arrive in two hours and the house still looked like a whirlwind had passed through. I nodded, feeling the weight of expectation\u2014this was our home, our shared responsibility, and I didn\u2019t want to let my partner down. But as I reached for the mop, my work phone rang. Dispatch: a man in his fifties, chest pain, shortness of breath\u2014possible heart attack. I froze, torn. My duty as an ambulance driver was clear: someone\u2019s life could depend on my swift response and care. Yet, at home, my spouse was counting on me, relying on my help to make everything perfect for our guests. My heart pounded as I stared at the mop in one hand and my work phone in the other, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
