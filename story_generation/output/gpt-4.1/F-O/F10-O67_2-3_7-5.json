My father barely touched his dinner, his hands trembling as he reached for his glass. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted to stay, to be the daughter they could lean on, especially now when they seemed so fragile. But my radio crackled, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through the room: \u201cCode Red, possible cardiac arrest, Main and Fifth.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I was trained to respond instantly, to focus on the patient, to be calm and decisive. But as I grabbed my keys, my mother\u2019s eyes met mine, pleading for comfort. I felt torn in two\u2014my duty to my parents pulling me one way, my responsibility to a stranger in crisis pulling me the other. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the daughter my parents needed and the ambulance driver someone else desperately depended on."}
