The store was quiet now, but my mind was racing. Just an hour ago, the school had called. My son had been caught bullying another child, and the principal wanted me to come in immediately. As a father, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions mattered and to support him through the consequences. But as a cashier, I was bound by the store\u2019s strict deposit procedures\u2014no shortcuts, no early departures, especially with such a large sum. My manager had made it clear: any mistake could cost me my job. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the expectation to be a responsible parent and a reliable employee pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached with worry for my son, but my hands kept moving, sorting bills and filling out forms, trapped between two worlds that refused to wait for each other."}
