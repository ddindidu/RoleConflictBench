I know the drill\u2014drop everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. But just as I reach for my hard hat, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice. It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart twists. She never asks for help unless it\u2019s serious. I picture her, anxious and alone, waiting for my wisdom, the way my own grandmother once comforted me. But the foreman\u2019s voice booms, \u201cLet\u2019s go!
