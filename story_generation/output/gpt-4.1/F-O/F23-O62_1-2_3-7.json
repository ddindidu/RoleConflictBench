Teaching him these small courtesies felt important, a way to show him I cared about the kind of person he was becoming. Just as I was about to praise him for remembering, my phone buzzed\u2014my shift at the community pool was starting soon. I hurried over, still thinking about our conversation.\n\nAt the pool, I scanned the water, my whistle ready. Suddenly, I spotted a group of teenagers, including Ethan, laughing and lining up at the pool\u2019s edge, clearly ignoring the bold \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, no exceptions. But as a step-parent, I worried about embarrassing Ethan in front of his friends or coming off as too harsh. My mind raced\u2014should I call them out publicly, risking his trust, or let it slide and compromise safety? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the expectations of discipline at home and authority at work."}
