He was determined to try a new skateboard trick, and I could already imagine the scrapes and bruises\u2014or worse\u2014that might follow. As his sibling, I felt a knot of worry in my stomach, the urge to step in and talk him out of it almost overwhelming. But before I could say anything, my phone buzzed. At the networking event, a colleague leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t your client the one with that big fraud case? What\u2019s really going on there?\u201d As a lawyer, I knew I had to protect my client\u2019s confidentiality, no matter how casual the setting or how persistent the questions. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my brother\u2019s safety demanding my immediate attention, and my professional ethics requiring my focus and discretion. My heart pounded as I stood between the ramp and the conversation, torn by the weight of both responsibilities, unsure which role to answer first."}
