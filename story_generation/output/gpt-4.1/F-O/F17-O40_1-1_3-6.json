I turned the toy over in my hands, already picturing the hours it would take to restore the delicate wheels and faded paint. My mind drifted to home, where my mother was preparing for our annual family dinner\u2014an event I\u2019d never missed, a tradition that meant everything to her. She\u2019d called twice already, reminding me to come early, to help set the table and share stories with my cousins. I could hear her voice in my head, \u201cFamily comes first, always.\u201d But Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes pleaded with me, and I knew how much this toy meant to her child. My heart twisted, caught between the pull of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I felt as a craftsman. I stared at the train, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could bear to let down."}
