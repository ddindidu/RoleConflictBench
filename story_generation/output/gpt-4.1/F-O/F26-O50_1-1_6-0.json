My phone buzzed with messages from my daughter, reminders about the upcoming family holiday. It\u2019s tradition\u2014everyone gathers, stories are shared, and I\u2019m expected to be there, present and attentive, the glue that keeps us connected. But just as I was about to reply, a supervisor rushed in, worry etched on his face. The old packaging machine, the one we barely use, was acting up again\u2014intermittent glitches, nothing obvious, but enough to threaten the next week\u2019s orders. They needed me, the only one who really understood its quirks, to diagnose and fix it before things picked up. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my family expecting warmth and presence, my team relying on my expertise to keep the line running. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility of work, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
