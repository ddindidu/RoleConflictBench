My phone buzzed with a text from my stepbrother: \u201cDinner\u2019s starting. Mom\u2019s asking for you.\u201d I could almost hear the clatter of plates and laughter from the house next door, the expectation that I\u2019d join in, be part of the family, not just the outsider. But here, on my lifeguard chair, I was responsible for every person in the pool. A couple of kids drifted toward the deep end, not in trouble yet, but I knew how quickly things could change. My supervisor always said, \u201cNever take your eyes off the water.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family wanting me to show up, to belong, and my duty to keep these swimmers safe. My heart pounded as I stared at the water, torn between the call of family and the responsibility of the job, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
