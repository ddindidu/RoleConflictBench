I really need you.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in their voice, the way it had been all week since the news about their job. I wanted nothing more than to drop everything and be there, to hold them and tell them it would be okay. But the next address blinked on my delivery app, and I was already late. The package in my hands felt heavier than usual as I walked up the steps, rehearsing my polite greeting for the customer. I knew I had to smile, be patient, and thank them for their time\u2014no matter how distracted I felt. My mind was split in two: one half aching to rush home and be the partner Jamie needed, the other forcing me to stay composed and professional for the customer waiting behind the door. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the person I loved and the job that paid our bills, not knowing which demand I could afford to let down."}
