Her eyes were red, and she didn\u2019t say a word as she dropped onto the couch, hugging her knees. I knew something was wrong\u2014she always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As her step-sibling, I felt the urge to sit beside her, to ask what happened, to be the support she needed after a rough day at school. But the kitchen was still a mess, and the living room floor was scattered with crumbs and wrappers from last night. As the housekeeper, I was expected to keep everything spotless, and I\u2019d already been reminded twice this week about the standards. If I stopped now, the cleaning wouldn\u2019t get done, and I\u2019d hear about it later. But if I kept sweeping, I\u2019d be ignoring her pain, failing her as a sister. My hands gripped the broom tighter, torn between the urge to comfort her and the pressure to finish my chores, my heart pounding with the weight of both expectations."}
