The production outage is my fault\u2014a bug I missed, now locking out hundreds of users. My phone buzzes with urgent Slack messages from QA and my manager, all demanding answers. I know I have to fix this, and fast. But from the kitchen, I hear my parents\u2019 voices, low and weary. Lately, they\u2019ve seemed so tired, weighed down by worries they won\u2019t share. I catch my mother rubbing her temples, my father sighing as he stares at the bills. I want to go to them, to sit and listen, to be the support they need. But the pressure from work is crushing, and I can\u2019t ignore it. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between the code I must fix and the family I want to comfort. The weight of both worlds presses in, and I feel myself pulled apart, unable to be enough for either."}
