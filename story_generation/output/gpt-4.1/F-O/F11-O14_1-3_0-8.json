She\u2019d worked so hard, and I promised I\u2019d be there to celebrate, just like she\u2019d always been there for me. As I hung the last banner, my work phone vibrated with an urgent alert: the mass spectrometer in my lab was issuing warning signals. If I didn\u2019t check it soon, there could be a hazardous leak\u2014protocol demanded immediate attention. My heart pounded as I stared at the two screens, one filled with my sister\u2019s joyful selfies, the other with red warning icons. I could almost hear her laughter from the kitchen, but the thought of a safety breach at the lab gnawed at me. I felt torn, the weight of my promise to her pressing against the responsibility I owed to my team and the safety of the lab. I stood frozen, caught between the warmth of family and the cold urgency of science, unsure which world needed me more in that moment."}
