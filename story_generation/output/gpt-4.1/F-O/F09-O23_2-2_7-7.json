As a mother, I knew the bills were piling up at home\u2014groceries, rent, my son\u2019s school trip. My paycheck was the lifeline for my family, and every hour at work mattered. Today, though, my role as a lawyer pressed in with equal force. An assistant, new and eager, stood at my door, asking for access to files from a high-profile case. She said it would help her get up to speed, make things run smoother. But those files held sensitive information, and client confidentiality was not just a rule\u2014it was a promise. If I refused, I risked being seen as uncooperative, maybe even jeopardizing my position. If I agreed, I\u2019d be breaking the ethical code I\u2019d sworn to uphold. My mind raced, torn between the need to keep my job for my family and the duty to protect my client\u2019s trust. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
