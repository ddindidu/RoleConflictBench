She\u2019d barely slept in days, her eyes red from crying, her voice small as she whispered her fears. She needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my steady presence.

As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to help restore order, to protect the public. My uniform hung in the closet, a stark reminder of my duty.
