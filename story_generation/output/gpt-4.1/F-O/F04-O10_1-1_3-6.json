My sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d be up for a hike on Saturday. My parents looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d join in for once instead of disappearing behind my laptop. I wanted to say yes, to be present, to laugh and plan with them. But my phone buzzed\u2014a new email. I glanced at the screen: a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol required a formal reply within the hour. My boss had reminded me just yesterday how important timely communication was for our firm\u2019s reputation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s voices blurred with the ping of my inbox. I wanted to be the brother they needed, but the accountant in me knew what was expected. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
