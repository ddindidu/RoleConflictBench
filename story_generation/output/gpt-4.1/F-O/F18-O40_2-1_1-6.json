My younger sister trudged in, her backpack hanging off one shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I could tell she\u2019d had a rough day\u2014she didn\u2019t even try to hide it. I wanted to drop everything, sit her down, and listen, like I always did when things got hard for her at school. But just then, a customer walked in, holding out a broken wooden toy, explaining how much it meant to their child and asking for a repair quote. I could see the hope in their eyes, the expectation that I\u2019d help restore something precious. My sister hovered in the doorway, waiting for me to notice her pain, while the customer waited for my professional attention. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the family I loved and the work I took pride in. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing in on me, unsure which role to answer first."}
