My stepdad shuffled in, rubbing his temples, and I remembered how Mom had asked me to check in on him more often. \u201cEverything okay at work?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but he just grunted and poured himself some coffee. My phone buzzed\u2014a new email from a vendor, a standard payment confirmation. I knew I needed to send a formal reply, keep things professional, but my stepdad\u2019s silence pressed on me. I felt torn, my mind split between the expectation to be present and supportive at home, and the demand to maintain my professional image as an accountant. If I focused on the email, I\u2019d seem cold and distant to my family. If I lingered in the kitchen, I\u2019d risk missing the prompt, polished response my job required. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which one to answer first."}
