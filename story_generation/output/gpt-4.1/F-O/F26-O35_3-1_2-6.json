I set my cup down, heart swelling with the urge to comfort her, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. Just as she began to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a new email from work. The subway company was offering a professional development seminar, and they needed responses by the end of the day. I knew management expected us to show initiative, to stay sharp and committed to our roles. My granddaughter\u2019s voice wavered, and I could see how much she needed me right now. But the pressure to be a model employee tugged at me, too. I felt torn, caught between the duty to guide my family and the responsibility to uphold my professional standards. My hands hovered over my phone, my mind racing, unsure which role to answer first."}
