The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019d promised her I would, wanting to do my part at home, to be the partner she deserved. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a message from work. The external inspector had flagged a critical safety issue on the production line\u2014one that, if not addressed immediately, could shut us down for days. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need you here now. Only you know the system well enough to fix this before the inspector leaves.\u201d\n\nI stood in the laundry room, torn. On one side, my family depended on me to keep our home running smoothly, to be present and reliable. On the other, my team at work needed my expertise to keep the plant operational and safe. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and I felt the pressure mounting inside me as I tried to figure out which responsibility I would have to let down."}
