The defendant\u2019s fate hung on my words, and I knew the order had to be written now\u2014every minute mattered. My laptop glowed with the blank document, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was my mother. Her voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare, her fear barely contained. She needed me\u2014not as a judge, but as her child, her comfort. I could hear the expectation in her voice, the unspoken plea to set aside everything and just listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. But the law demanded my focus, my clarity, my immediate action. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the duty to my family and the duty to justice. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught in the impossible space between being the child my parents needed and the judge the law required."}
