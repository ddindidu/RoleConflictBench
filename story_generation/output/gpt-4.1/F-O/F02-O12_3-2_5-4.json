The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline. My heart ached at the thought of his shame and confusion, but I couldn\u2019t let this moment pass without addressing it.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed relentlessly in my pocket\u2014Slack notifications piling up. The design documents for our new feature were due by the end of the day, and the other teams were waiting for my technical input. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice, reminding me of the importance of collaboration and timely delivery. My mind raced, torn between kneeling down to talk to my son and ducking outside to join the urgent call. The pressure from both worlds pressed in, and I stood frozen, caught between the father my son needed and the developer my team depended on."}
