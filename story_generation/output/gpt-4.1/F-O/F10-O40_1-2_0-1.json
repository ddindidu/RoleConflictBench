My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mom, her usual weekend check-in. I glanced at the clock. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d call today, but the shop was a mess, and I was already behind on my cleanup. The foreman had been clear: safety first, no exceptions. Tools scattered on the bench, cords snaking across the floor\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d be breaking every rule I\u2019d been taught about keeping a safe workspace. But if I waited, Mom would worry, maybe think I was ignoring her. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but disappointed, asking why I couldn\u2019t spare a few minutes. My hands tightened around the broom. I wanted to be the reliable daughter she expected, but I also needed to be the responsible carpenter my job demanded. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each pulling in a different direction, and I stood there, caught between the two, unsure which to answer first."}
