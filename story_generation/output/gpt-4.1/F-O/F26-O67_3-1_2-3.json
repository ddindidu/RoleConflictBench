It was my responsibility to be prepared\u2014lives depended on it. As I ticked off the last item, my phone buzzed. It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice. It\u2019s important.\u201d I could hear the urgency, the vulnerability, and I knew she was reaching out for the kind of wisdom only a grandparent could give. But the ambulance company expected me to finish my checks before the next call came in. If I left now, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the patients who might need me at any moment. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the child who needed my guidance, and the strangers who might need my care. I stood there, first-aid kit open, phone in hand, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
