The deadline for my final judgment loomed\u2014thirty days to write a clear, detailed opinion that would shape lives and set precedent. Every word mattered, and the weight of impartiality pressed on my shoulders. Just as I began outlining my findings, my phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, his name flashing with urgency. We hadn\u2019t spoken since our argument last week, and I knew he was reaching out to resolve things. As his brother, I owed him honesty and respect, a chance to talk openly and mend our bond. But as a judge, I was expected to set aside all distractions, to focus and deliver a thorough, timely judgment. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and the demands of my profession. The cursor blinked on the empty page, mirroring my hesitation. I stared at the phone, feeling the pull of both roles, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
