I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. I let it go to voicemail, but a minute later, another call. My heart thudded. I excused myself, promising Mrs. Lee I\u2019d be right back, and ducked into the break room. Mom\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare, her words tumbling out, raw and scared. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the daughter who could hold her together. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, trusting me to fix her fringe just right, to make her feel beautiful and heard. I could picture her in the chair, glancing at the clock, maybe wondering if she\u2019d made me late for my next appointment. My hands shook as I tried to comfort Mom, but my mind kept darting back to the salon, to my client, to the professional I was supposed to be. I felt split in two, pulled by the need to be present for my mother and the duty to care for my client, both expecting all of me at once."}
