Our traditions meant everything to her, and I knew how much it would mean for me to step up, to show respect for our heritage. But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: next week was the scheduled shutdown at the plant, and I was responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of the machines. If I missed it, the whole production line could be delayed, and my team was counting on me to keep everything running smoothly. The weight of both worlds pressed on my shoulders\u2014my family\u2019s hopes on one side, my professional duty on the other. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between honoring my family and fulfilling my responsibilities at work, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
