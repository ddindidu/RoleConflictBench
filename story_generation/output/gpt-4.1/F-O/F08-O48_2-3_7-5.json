She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement\u2014photos of her desk, her first cup of office coffee, her proud smile. I knew how much it meant to her that I respond quickly, to share in her joy and let her know I was proud. But just as I started to type a reply, the charge nurse called my name. The patient in room 204, the one in critical condition, needed his vitals checked again\u2014temperature, pulse, blood pressure\u2014every few minutes. My hands trembled as I tucked my phone away, guilt gnawing at me. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice: \u201cMom, she really wants to hear from you.\u201d But the monitors in 204 beeped insistently, reminding me of the trust placed in me here. My heart pulled in two directions, I stood frozen, torn between the family who needed my love and the patient who needed my care."}
