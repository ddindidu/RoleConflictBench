My mind raced with numbers, calculating tips and appointments, wondering if I could squeeze in a few more clients this week. Every snip of my scissors felt heavier, the weight of my family\u2019s future pressing on my shoulders. As I finished up with Mrs. Lee, my regular, she smiled and asked, \u201cCould you just trim my fringe a bit more?\u201d Her tone was gentle, but I could sense she wanted it perfect. I knew she\u2019d tell her friends if she left happy\u2014or disappointed. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder to check the bank statement. I felt torn: should I rush to fit in another client for extra income, or take the time to make sure Mrs. Lee was completely satisfied? My heart ached with the pressure to provide for my family, but my hands hesitated, caught between the need to earn and the promise of quality."}
