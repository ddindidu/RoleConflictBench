The siren wails, echoing my own racing heart. In the back, a paramedic shouts updates about the patient\u2019s dropping blood pressure. Every second counts, but the roads are slick, visibility almost nothing. I have to keep this ambulance steady, safe\u2014lives depend on it.\n\nMy phone buzzes in my pocket, vibrating with urgency. I know it\u2019s her. This morning, she was in tears, overwhelmed by a decision at work, needing me to listen, to reassure her. She said, \u201cI just need to hear your voice.\u201d I promised I\u2019d call on my break, but there hasn\u2019t been a break. Now, as I drive through the storm, I feel the weight of her expectation pressing against the life in my care.\n\nI want to be the husband she needs, to answer, to comfort her. But I can\u2019t take my hands off the wheel, can\u2019t let my focus slip for even a moment. The storm outside is nothing compared to the one inside me, torn between the person I love and the life I\u2019m responsible for."}
