My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. I felt a wave of guilt and worry\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I knew I needed to be there for him, to show him right from wrong, to support him through this mistake.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with another urgent email. The project manager reminded me that the prototype demo was in two days, and stakeholders were anxious. If I didn\u2019t finish the design review and fix the last bug, we might lose our chance at approval. My team was counting on me; I was the only one who understood the new system architecture.\n\nI felt torn in two. My son needed his mother, someone to guide him through this difficult moment. My team needed their engineer, someone to deliver under pressure. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, forcing me to choose which part of myself to let down."}
