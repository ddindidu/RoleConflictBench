Just an hour ago, I\u2019d caught my stepson slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the corner store. His wide, guilty eyes met mine, and I knew this was one of those moments\u2014one where I had to teach him right from wrong, to be the parent he needed, not just the one who showed up after school. But now, as the train rumbled through the tunnel, the transit authority supervisor stepped into my cabin, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. An unannounced audit. I was expected to be flawless: every announcement clear, every stop precise, every protocol followed to the letter. My mind kept drifting back to my stepson, wondering if I\u2019d been too harsh, or not firm enough. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to guide a child, my responsibility to keep hundreds of passengers safe and the system running smoothly. The supervisor\u2019s pen hovered over his checklist, and I gripped the controls, heart pounding, torn between the demands of two lives that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
