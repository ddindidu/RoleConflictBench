My spouse pours coffee and asks, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I glance up, catching the hopeful look in their eyes. I know they want more than a one-word answer\u2014they want me to share, to connect, to be present. But my mind is tangled in deadlines and contractor updates. The project is behind schedule, and every minute counts. I nod, mutter something about a busy day, and my phone vibrates again. My spouse\u2019s face falls just a little, and guilt twists in my chest. I want to close the laptop, to talk, to listen, but the expectation to keep the project moving presses down on me. I\u2019m torn, caught between the need to be an attentive partner and the relentless demands of my job. The silence stretches, and I feel the weight of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
