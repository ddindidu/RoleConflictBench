I was scanning groceries for Mrs. Patel when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a text from my little brother: \u201cHey, can I come hang out with you and your friends after your shift?\u201d I knew he\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d try harder to include him. But as I glanced at the line, I saw my manager watching from the office window. I was supposed to keep my phone away and focus on the register, making sure every item scanned right and every receipt was perfect. My brother\u2019s message tugged at me, reminding me of the kind of sister I wanted to be\u2014someone he could count on. But the weight of my job\u2019s expectations pressed down, too. I could feel my heart beating faster, torn between replying to him right away or ignoring the message until my break, knowing either choice would let someone down."}
