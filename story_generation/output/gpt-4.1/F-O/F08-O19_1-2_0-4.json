She looked nervous, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when you started something new? I feel lost about college.\u201d My heart swelled; I wanted to share every lesson I\u2019d learned, to reassure her that uncertainty was normal and that she\u2019d find her way. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Patel was due at the pharmacy for her new prescription. She\u2019d been anxious about starting a new medication, and I knew she\u2019d need careful counseling about side effects and dosage. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: Emma\u2019s searching eyes, hoping for wisdom only a grandmother could give, and the professional responsibility to ensure Mrs. Patel\u2019s safety. My mind raced, torn between the comfort my granddaughter needed and the trust my patient placed in me. I could feel the tension rising, my heart caught between two calls for guidance, each urgent in its own way."}
