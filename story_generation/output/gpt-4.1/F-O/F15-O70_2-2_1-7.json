The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there. She\u2019d been talking about it for days, practicing her lines for the class presentation, her eyes shining with excitement. I could already picture her scanning the crowd, searching for my face. But just as I was about to turn off my delivery app, my phone buzzed. A customer was calling, asking about the status of their urgent package. I could hear the impatience in their voice, and I knew the company expected me to handle every interaction with calm professionalism. I tried to keep my tone polite, but my mind was racing. If I stopped now, I\u2019d let the customer down and risk a complaint. If I kept going, I\u2019d miss my daughter\u2019s big moment. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the expectations of a good parent and a reliable delivery person, not knowing which responsibility to choose."}
