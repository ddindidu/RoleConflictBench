It\u2019s a standard contract, nothing urgent, but I know I should at least glance at it\u2014my job as a lawyer is to be thorough, to never let details slip. But right now, my son is darting between displays, giggling as he weaves dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. Other shoppers are starting to stare. As a father, I know I should step in, teach him about respect for public spaces and self-control, show him that actions have consequences. But the lawyer in me nags at the back of my mind, reminding me that my clients expect promptness and precision, that even routine documents deserve my full attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, my son\u2019s laughter clashing with the silent demand of my inbox. I grip my phone, torn between the urge to kneel down and talk to my son, and the responsibility to open that contract and get to work."}
