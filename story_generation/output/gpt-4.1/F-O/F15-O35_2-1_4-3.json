My son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. I opened my mouth to call him back, but my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch, reminding me to check the new safety protocols before my shift. Suddenly, my work radio crackled. A passenger was asking for directions over the intercom, sounding anxious. I knew I was expected to respond quickly, to reassure and guide them, to keep everyone safe and the trains running smoothly. But my son was still running wild, and I could feel the judgment in the air. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the duty to my child and the responsibility to my passengers, both demanding my attention at the same moment."}
