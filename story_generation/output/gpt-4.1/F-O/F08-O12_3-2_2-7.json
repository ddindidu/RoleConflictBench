It was a message from QA\u2014another user had reported the same intermittent error, and the team was waiting for my fix. My mind raced through possible causes, but before I could dive in, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important,\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. I closed the laptop halfway, torn. She needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to listen, to offer the kind of comfort and wisdom only a grandmother could give. But the pressure from work was mounting; the team was counting on me to resolve the bug before it affected more users. My heart ached as I looked at her, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I sat frozen, caught between the urgent needs of my family and my job, unsure which to answer first."}
