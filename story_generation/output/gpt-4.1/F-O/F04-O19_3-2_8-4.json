It was my younger sister, her name flashing on the screen, and I remembered our argument from last night. She\u2019d accused me of not listening, of always being too busy, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d call her today, talk things through, rebuild the trust we\u2019d always had. But now, in front of me, a woman waited anxiously, clutching her medication bag. She needed me to explain the side effects, to reassure her, to answer her questions with patience and care. My sister needed me to listen, to be her brother, to show her she mattered. My patient needed me to be her pharmacist, to guide her safely. Both expected my full attention, my empathy, my time\u2014right now. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my heart torn between the person who\u2019d grown up with me and the stranger who depended on my expertise. I stared at my phone, then at the patient, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
