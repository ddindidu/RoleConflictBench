The launch date just got moved up, and everyone\u2019s looking at me to unblock them. My phone buzzes\u2014my partner\u2019s child, Jamie, texting me a picture of the Nintendo Switch he\u2019s been dreaming about. I promised him I\u2019d get it this month, and he\u2019s been counting down the days. I know how much it means to him, especially after everything he\u2019s been through. But the price tag stings, and with the project\u2019s demands, I haven\u2019t had time to check our finances. My mind races: if I don\u2019t buy it, I\u2019ll break my promise and let Jamie down. If I do, I risk our budget, and I\u2019m already stretched thin with work stress. Meanwhile, the team\u2019s waiting, the pressure mounting. I feel torn in two\u2014between being the reliable step-parent Jamie needs and the dependable developer my team expects. My heart pounds as I hover over the \u201creply\u201d button, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019ll disappoint."}
