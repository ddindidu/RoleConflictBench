The copper highlights I\u2019d carefully painted didn\u2019t match the picture she\u2019d shown me. She sighed, and I felt the familiar pressure to fix it, to make her happy, to prove myself as a professional. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mother. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the prayer tonight. It means so much to Grandma.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, heavy with the weight of tradition. I was the eldest, expected to guide the family through the ceremony, to honor our roots. But here I was, trapped between the salon\u2019s bright lights and the pull of home, my client\u2019s disappointment echoing in my mind. I wanted to be the perfect child, the one who never let the family down, but I also wanted to be the hairdresser who never let a client leave unhappy. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, feeling the demands of both worlds closing in, unsure which one I could bear to disappoint."}
