The principal wanted to meet with me immediately. Guilt and worry twisted inside me\u2014how could my child do this? I needed to be there, to listen, to help him understand the gravity of his actions, to show him I cared and guide him through this mistake.\n\nBut just as I was about to call the school, my pager buzzed. The family of my patient, Mrs. Lee, was waiting. I had to tell them that her cancer had spread, that the prognosis was grim. They needed me to be calm, compassionate, and clear, to answer their questions and support them through the shock and grief.\n\nI felt torn in two. My son needed his mother, present and understanding. My patient\u2019s family needed their doctor, steady and empathetic. Both expected me to be fully there, to give comfort and guidance. I sat at my desk, phone in one hand, pager in the other, my mind racing, my heart aching, unsure which role to answer first."}
