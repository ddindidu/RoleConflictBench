I glanced down\u2014three missed messages from Mom, each more anxious than the last: \u201cAre you okay?\u201d \u201cCall me, please.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d We always talked at lunch, and I hadn\u2019t replied. But at that moment, my clerk hurried over, whispering that the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent I was about to cite. My heart pounded. The courtroom waited for my next words, but my mind was split. As a daughter, I felt the weight of my mother\u2019s worry, the unspoken promise to always keep her close. As a judge, I was expected to halt everything, review the new ruling, and ensure justice was served according to the latest law. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I stood there, torn, the gavel heavy in my hand, my mother\u2019s messages echoing in my mind as the courtroom held its breath."}
