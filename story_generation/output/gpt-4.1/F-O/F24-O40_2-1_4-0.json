My stepbrother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me about tonight\u2019s family dinner\u2014Mom\u2019s first attempt to bring us all together since the wedding. I knew how much it meant to her, to everyone, that I show up and try to fit in. But my phone buzzed with a message from my foreman: \u201cEarly start tomorrow. Need you on site by 6 a.m. sharp. Safety briefing\u2014mandatory.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. If I stayed late for dinner, I\u2019d be exhausted and risk making mistakes at work, maybe even putting myself or others in danger. But if I left early or skipped the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my new family, maybe set back the fragile trust we were building. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the smell of roast chicken and the memory of splintered wood, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
