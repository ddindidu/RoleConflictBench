My phone vibrates with a message from my partner: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I know they\u2019re struggling, barely holding it together after the news from this morning. I want to be there, to listen, to reassure them that I\u2019m here, that we\u2019ll get through this together. But my screen flashes\u2014another call. I force a smile into my voice, launching into the script about our new service. The customer interrupts, firing off technical questions I can\u2019t fully answer. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cHandle objections, don\u2019t transfer unless absolutely necessary.\u201d I\u2019m supposed to be calm, knowledgeable, persuasive. My partner\u2019s message sits unread, a silent plea. My heart aches with guilt. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I want to drop everything and call them, but I need this job. My voice wavers as I try to answer the customer, my mind torn between the person who needs me most and the demands of the job that pays our bills."}
