As a wife, I knew the laundry had piled up\u2014my husband\u2019s work shirts, my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform, all waiting for me to wash and fold so everyone would have what they needed for tomorrow. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep the house spotless, especially the living room and kitchen, where dust and crumbs seemed to multiply the moment I turned my back. My employer had texted, reminding me that the shared spaces needed extra attention today. I could almost hear my husband\u2019s voice in my head, gently reminding me that he needed his shirts for an early meeting. At the same time, I pictured my supervisor\u2019s disappointed look if the house wasn\u2019t up to standard. My heart raced as I stood frozen, torn between the laundry basket and the cleaning supplies, feeling the impossible tug of both roles demanding more than I could give at once."}
