Did you eat?\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014already past noon. I haven\u2019t replied since last night, and I know she\u2019ll worry if I don\u2019t answer soon. But my laptop screen is filled with technical documents, and my team is waiting for my review. The new safety standard just dropped, and I\u2019m responsible for making sure our design meets every requirement before tomorrow\u2019s release. My manager expects a detailed report, and any mistake could mean a costly delay or worse, a safety risk. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the gentle, persistent pull of my parents\u2019 need for connection, and the sharp, urgent demand of my job. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between sending a quick, reassuring message and diving back into the dense checklist of compliance items. My heart aches with guilt\u2014no matter what I do next, I know I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
