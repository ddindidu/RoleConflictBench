My daughter\u2019s voice trembled in the voicemail\u2014something serious had happened at home, and she needed me. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to rush to my family, to hold my granddaughter\u2019s hand and offer comfort in a way only I could. But just as I stood to leave, I heard soft sobs from down the hall. Mrs. Lee, one of my patients, had just received devastating news about her health. She was alone, her eyes red and pleading for someone to sit with her, to listen, to simply be there. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cOur patients need us, especially in moments like these.\u201d I felt torn, my heart aching for my family and for Mrs. Lee. Both needed me, both expected my presence and comfort. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which way to turn."}
