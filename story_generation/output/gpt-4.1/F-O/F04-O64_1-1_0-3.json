Store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no exceptions. As I was double-checking the receipts, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cI got the scholarship! Can you come celebrate with us tonight?\u201d I knew how much this meant to her, and as her brother, I was expected to be there, cheering her on, making her feel special. But the store manager was strict, and I was supposed to stay until the register balanced, no matter how long it took. My heart twisted as I stared at the numbers, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be the supportive brother she deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility as a cashier. The clock ticked, and I stood there, torn between the expectations of my family and my job, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
