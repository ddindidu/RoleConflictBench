My heart pounded\u2014my role as her step-parent demanded I teach her right from wrong, to guide her with patience and discipline. I knew I needed to address her behavior, to talk to her about honesty and consequences. But just as I was about to pull her aside, I noticed a group of kids darting into the shallow end, unsupervised. As the lifeguard on duty, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, expected to enforce the rules and prevent accidents. I felt torn\u2014should I leave Mia\u2019s lesson for later and rush to the pool, or should I focus on her now, risking the safety of the swimmers? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of my child and the safety of the others."}
