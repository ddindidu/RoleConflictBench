She had insisted on bringing the offerings to the temple, reminding me how our family always honored the ancestors on this day. The scent of oranges and sandalwood filled the cab, mingling with the faint aroma of air freshener I\u2019d sprayed that morning. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my car spotless\u2014no crumbs, no lingering smells, always ready for the next passenger. But now, the sticky rice cakes threatened to leave stains on the seat, and the incense ash drifted onto the floor mats. My mother\u2019s voice was gentle but firm, telling me how proud my late grandmother would be if we did this right. I felt the weight of her expectations pressing against the rules I set for myself at work. I wanted to honor my family, but I also needed to maintain the standards that kept my passengers happy and my reputation intact. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
