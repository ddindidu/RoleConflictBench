He sighed, mentioning how his boss had piled on extra work, and I could see the fatigue in his eyes. I wanted to reach out, to listen, to offer the comfort he expected from me as his wife. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the clinic. My patient, Mrs. Lee, was having a flare-up. Her autoimmune disease was unpredictable, and she needed a new prescription, a careful adjustment to her treatment plan. I knew the risks if I delayed, but I also saw the hope in my husband\u2019s face, waiting for me to be present, to care. My mind raced between the two worlds: the woman who promised to be there for her partner, and the doctor who swore to do no harm. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My heart ached as I sat frozen, torn between the demands of love and duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved in this moment."}
