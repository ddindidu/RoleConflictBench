She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Dad?\u201d I promised her I would. But this morning, just as I was packing my tools, my phone buzzed. Mrs. Lee\u2019s voice was tight with worry\u2014her deck was splintered and unsafe, and she had guests coming that evening. She needed it fixed today. As a carpenter, I knew the job couldn\u2019t wait; leaving it would risk someone getting hurt, and my reputation depended on reliability. But as a father, the thought of my daughter scanning the crowd and not finding me made my chest ache. Both roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, each with its own weight of expectation. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second, feeling the pressure build as I tried to figure out who needed me more."}
