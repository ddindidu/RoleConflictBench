Mom\u2019s counting on you to help set up.\u201d Today was the big family holiday dinner, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there early. But here I was, behind the wheel of my taxi, running late after a last-minute fare. My mind raced with guilt\u2014my family expected me to show up, to be present, to help make the day special.\n\nAs I turned onto Maple Street, orange cones forced all traffic into a single lane. Up ahead, a cluster of children waited at the curb, backpacks slung over their shoulders. The school zone lights flashed insistently. I felt the pressure mounting: if I slowed down, I\u2019d be even later, risking my family\u2019s disappointment. But as a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014school zones meant strict speed limits, extra caution, no exceptions. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, hopeful and expectant, and at the same time, the stern reminder from my training: safety first, always. I hesitated, caught between the demands of my family and the responsibility of my job, unsure which way to turn."}
