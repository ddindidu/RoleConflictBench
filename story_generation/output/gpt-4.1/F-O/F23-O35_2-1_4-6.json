That\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me as his step-parent, to guide him, to help him grow into a good person. But my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s an email from work: an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. As a subway operator, I\u2019m supposed to stay sharp, keep up with new protocols, show my commitment to the job. They expect us to respond quickly, to show we care about our professional growth. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I don\u2019t answer now, I might miss the opportunity, or worse, look like I\u2019m not invested.
