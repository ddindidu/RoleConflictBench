My children would be finishing school soon, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there to pick them up. They\u2019d been talking about it all week, excited for me to see their artwork displayed in the hallway. But just as I was about to shut down my computer, an email popped up from my manager: a last-minute seminar on upcoming tax law changes was starting in fifteen minutes. Attendance was strongly encouraged, and missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates that would affect my work as an accountant. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my kids\u2019 hopeful faces on one side, my professional responsibility on the other. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a present parent and the demand to stay compliant and informed in my career. I stared at the screen, my phone buzzing with a reminder to leave for the school, and felt the knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do."}
