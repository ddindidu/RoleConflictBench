She looked at me, her eyes searching, as we began the conversation we\u2019d been putting off for weeks\u2014about our finances, about her recent health scare. She needed me to be present, to listen, to be honest. I wanted to give her that, to reassure her that we were in this together. But as she spoke, my eyes kept darting to the pool. A group of teenagers was drifting toward the deep end, laughing, splashing, not quite breaking the rules but edging close. My training screamed at me to watch them, to never let my guard down, even for a second. My wife\u2019s voice wavered, and I could feel her frustration growing as I glanced away again.
