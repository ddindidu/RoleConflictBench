My son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the corner store. My heart dropped. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that honesty matters, even when no one is watching. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was on track to smash my sales quota this week. Management would be watching my numbers, expecting me to keep up the momentum. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice, urging me to stay on the phones, not to lose focus. But my son needed me now, needed a lesson in discipline and values. I stared at my sales script, my mind racing. If I left my desk, I\u2019d risk losing my hot streak. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my son down when he needed guidance most. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
