My mind, though, was far from the task. Tonight was my stepmother\u2019s annual holiday dinner, a tradition she cherished and expected me to honor, even if I still felt like an outsider at her table. She\u2019d called twice already, reminding me to bring the special dessert and not be late. \n\nBut here, at work, accuracy was everything. A single mistake could harm someone. My manager expected me to be focused, meticulous, and present until my shift ended. The clock ticked closer to the end of my shift, but the line of customers grew longer. I felt the weight of my white coat and the invisible pull of my family\u2019s expectations. My hands trembled slightly as I handed over the medication, my mind torn between the duty to my patients and the longing to fit into my step-family\u2019s world. The pressure built inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that someone would be disappointed, no matter what I chose."}
