My training kicked in, every second mattered. But then my phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother, again. We\u2019d argued that morning, and I\u2019d promised to call him back, to listen, to be patient with his frustrations about our family. He needed me to be understanding, to show him respect even when we disagreed. But now, as sirens wailed and my partner read out the patient\u2019s address, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. My brother expected a sister who listened, who didn\u2019t brush him off. My patient needed an ambulance driver who was focused, calm, and ready to save a life. My heart pounded as I glanced at my phone, torn between the voice of family and the call of duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
