Every muscle in my body was tense, alert for the slightest sign of trouble. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the weekly call to my stepdad. He always said these calls meant a lot, that they made him feel like I was really part of the family. I knew he\u2019d be waiting, probably watching the clock, hoping I wouldn\u2019t forget. But the waves were rough today, and the beach was packed. I couldn\u2019t look away, not even for a minute. The expectation to be present for my family tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to keep these strangers safe. My heart pounded as I weighed the importance of a simple conversation against the possibility of missing a cry for help. I stared at the phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which demand I could afford to ignore."}
