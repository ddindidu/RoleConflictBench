My husband\u2019s message flashed: \u201cCan you finish the laundry before dinner? Kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I glanced at the overflowing basket, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. But my shift as a subway operator was about to start, and I hurried out, promising myself I\u2019d finish the chores later.\n\nHalfway through my route, the emergency alarm blared in my train car. The intercom crackled: \u201cMedical emergency in car three.\u201d Instantly, my training kicked in. I was responsible for the safety of everyone on board. I needed to assist, coordinate with emergency services, and keep passengers calm. But in the back of my mind, I pictured the laundry still waiting at home, my family depending on me to keep their routines running smoothly. The demands of both worlds pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I prepared to respond."}
