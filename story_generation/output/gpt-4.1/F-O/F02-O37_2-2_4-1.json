I know I should call him back, remind him about behaving in public, about respect and discipline\u2014lessons I promised myself I\u2019d teach him. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder from my boss about the extra cleaning shift tonight. I remember the dust piling up at home, the crumbs under the couch, the streaks on the kitchen floor. My mind races with the checklist of chores waiting for me, the expectation that every surface should gleam. My son\u2019s laughter echoes down the aisle, drawing glances from other shoppers. I feel their eyes, judging. I want to kneel down, speak to him gently, but my thoughts are tangled with the pressure to keep everything spotless, to not let my work slip. I grip the cart tighter, torn between the urge to discipline my child and the anxiety of falling behind on cleaning. The weight of both roles presses on me, and for a moment, I just stand there, caught between what I should do as a father and what I must do as a cleaner."}
