He\u2019d always been quiet, but tonight his silence felt heavy, almost pleading. As his step-sibling, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him that he was more than a grade. But my phone buzzed again: a message from the site manager, reminding me that the cabinetry for the new client had to be finished by morning. The other carpenters were waiting for my measurements, and any delay would throw off the whole project. My hands, still rough from sanding wood all day, trembled as I weighed the expectations. My family needed my presence, my empathy. My team needed my skill, my reliability. I stood in the hallway, torn between the closed door to my brother\u2019s room and the open one leading to my workshop, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
