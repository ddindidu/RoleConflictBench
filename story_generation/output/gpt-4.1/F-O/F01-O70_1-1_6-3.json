As a grandfather, I knew how much my presence meant, even if it was just my voice on a screen. But as I pulled up to the next house on my delivery route, I saw the note: \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave packages unattended\u2014porch thefts in the area.\u201d The house was dark, no one home, and my shift was running late.
