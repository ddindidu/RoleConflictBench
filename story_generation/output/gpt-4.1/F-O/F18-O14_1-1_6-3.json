The street is familiar, lined with the same old trees and cracked sidewalks, but today my mind is elsewhere. I keep glancing at my phone, where the results from my latest experiment are waiting to be logged. I know the lab expects accuracy, and I pride myself on never letting data slip through the cracks. The logs can technically wait, but I feel the pressure to record everything while it\u2019s fresh in my mind.\n\nMy brother chatters about his day, but I\u2019m distracted, torn between listening to him and mentally rehearsing my research notes. I know I should focus on him\u2014Mom always says I\u2019m responsible for his safety, especially when we\u2019re out together. But the urge to pull out my phone and start typing up my findings is strong. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the careful scientist who never fudges a detail, and the protective sibling who never lets his guard down. My brother skips ahead, and I hesitate, caught between the demands of the lab and the responsibility walking right in front of me."}
