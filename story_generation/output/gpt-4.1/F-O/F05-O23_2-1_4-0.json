But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014a new email from a client. The subject line: \u201cContract for Review.\u201d It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew the client valued my promptness and attention to detail. I could knock it out now, get ahead, and maybe impress the senior partner at the firm. Yet, the thought of my wife coming home to the same pile of dirty clothes gnawed at me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my time, each expecting me to be present and responsible. My mind raced, torn between the quiet duty of home and the silent call of my profession, both waiting for me to choose."}
