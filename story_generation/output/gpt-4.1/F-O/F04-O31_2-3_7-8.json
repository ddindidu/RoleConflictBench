He was anxious, asking if I could talk to him before his court date tomorrow. He\u2019d gotten into a fight at a bar, and I knew he was scared. As his brother, I wanted to be there for him, to listen without judgment, to show patience and understanding for his mistakes. But just as I was about to reply, my work phone rang. The department needed me to testify in court tomorrow\u2014on the very case involving Sam. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to provide honest, unbiased testimony, no matter who was involved. My heart pounded as I realized the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Sam needed his brother\u2019s support, but the court needed an officer\u2019s truth. I stared at my phones, torn between the loyalty of family and the duty of justice, feeling the impossible pull of both expectations."}
