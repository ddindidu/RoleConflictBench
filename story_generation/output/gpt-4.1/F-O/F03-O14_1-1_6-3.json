My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014almost 8 p.m. I hadn\u2019t checked in with them for a week, and guilt pricked at me. As their son, I knew how much it meant to them when I asked about their day, listened to their worries, and reassured them that I cared. But in front of me, my research notes sprawled across the screen, waiting to be organized and logged. The data from today\u2019s experiment was fresh in my mind, and I knew from experience that if I didn\u2019t document it now, the details might blur by morning. The lab\u2019s flexible schedule meant I could technically log the results later, but accuracy mattered, and I prided myself on my meticulous records. I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my parents\u2019 voices and the cold precision of my research. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
