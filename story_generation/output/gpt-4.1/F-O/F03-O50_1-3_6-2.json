It was Mom, her voice trembling as she asked if I could talk for a minute. \u201cYour father\u2019s been quiet lately. I just\u2026 I need to know you\u2019re there for us,\u201d she said. I promised I\u2019d call back soon, but as I hung up, my pager blared\u2014emergency in the ICU. A life-support machine was flashing red, the nurses\u2019 faces tight with worry.
