As his step-parent, I knew I should step in, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or polite. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a homeowner\u2019s urgent message about their damaged deck. As a carpenter, I was expected to be reliable, to show up quickly and fix what was broken. The deck was splintered and unsafe, and they needed it repaired today. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Max\u2019s wild laughter echoing in my ears, the homeowner\u2019s anxious words on my screen. Should I pull Max aside and risk being late for the repair, or rush through the shopping, letting his behavior slide for now? My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of being a good step-parent and a dependable carpenter, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at this moment."}
