It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014my mother\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I promised her I\u2019d call every week, no matter how busy I was. She worries if I\u2019m late, and I know she\u2019s waiting, probably sitting by the window, phone in hand, eager to hear my voice and my stories from the hospital. But in front of me, a patient gasps for breath, his skin clammy, his symptoms not matching anything I\u2019ve seen before. The nurses look to me for answers, expecting swift, decisive action. My mind races through possible diagnoses, but nothing fits. I feel the weight of my white coat and the stethoscope around my neck, the responsibility pressing down on me. My phone vibrates again\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle persistence. I want to reassure her, to be the attentive daughter she deserves, but I can\u2019t ignore the desperate eyes of the man before me. My heart aches, torn between the comfort of home and the urgency of the ER, caught in the impossible space between daughter and doctor."}
