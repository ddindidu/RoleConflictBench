The family gathering was circled in bright red, a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They expected me to be there, to laugh, to share stories, to be the grandparent who never missed a moment. But as I glanced at the stack of financial documents on my desk, a different kind of responsibility pressed on me. The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the records had to be flawless\u2014no errors, no delays. My boss trusted me to keep everything in order, and any slip-up could mean trouble for the whole team. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice asking if I\u2019d play cards with her, while at the same time, I imagined the anxious emails from my supervisor if the reports weren\u2019t submitted on time. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014family warmth on one side, professional duty on the other. I sat there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my best at the same time."}
