As a step-child in this family, I\u2019d been told over and over how important it was to respect their traditions\u2014never move the heirloom vase, always use the embroidered cloth for Sunday dinners, and never, ever clean the antique cabinet with anything but the special oil. Today, as I reached for the bottle, I realized it was empty. My job as the housekeeper demanded I keep supplies stocked, but I\u2019d missed this one. The cabinet was scheduled for cleaning today, and my stepmother had made it clear: family traditions must be honored, no shortcuts, no substitutions. My mind raced. Should I risk using a different product and possibly damage the cabinet, betraying their trust as a step-child? Or should I leave the job unfinished, failing my duty as a cleaner? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of family and work."}
