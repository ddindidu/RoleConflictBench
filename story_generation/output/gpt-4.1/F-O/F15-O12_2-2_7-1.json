The new feature is almost done, but it\u2019s not up to our standards. I should stay late, clean it up, make it right. That\u2019s what a good developer does\u2014delivers quality, not just speed.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a message from my partner: \u201cGroceries are low. Can you pick up milk and eggs? We need to talk about the bills.\u201d My chest tightens. I know the numbers in our account, the rent due next week, the kids\u2019 shoes with holes in them. If I leave now, I can make it to the store before closing, maybe even catch the kids before bedtime. But if I don\u2019t fix this code tonight, I risk my reputation, maybe even my job. I can\u2019t afford that\u2014not now.\n\nMy hands hover over the keyboard, mind racing between the demands of my team and the needs of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
