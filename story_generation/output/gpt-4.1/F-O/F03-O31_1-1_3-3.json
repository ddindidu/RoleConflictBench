It means a lot to your father.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family traditions. I glanced at my watch\u20145:30. My gym bag sat by the door, packed and ready. As a police officer, staying fit wasn\u2019t just a personal goal; it was a duty. My captain had made it clear: \u201cWe need you at your best, always.\u201d Missing another workout meant falling behind, letting down my team, maybe even risking someone\u2019s safety. But missing the family gathering meant disappointing my parents, breaking a chain of tradition that stretched back generations. My heart pounded with the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wore on duty, and the invisible one stitched by family expectations. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the gym and my family\u2019s front door, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
