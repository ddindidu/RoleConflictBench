My stepson, Jamie, is in the next room, his voice drifting in as he asks for help with his homework. I glance at the bills stacked beside me\u2014electricity, groceries, rent. I know I have to keep this job; we need every paycheck to keep the lights on and food in the fridge. My manager expects me to handle every call smoothly, to stick to the script, to never let a customer\u2019s question throw me off. Most days, it\u2019s easy\u2014just a few objections, nothing I can\u2019t handle. But today, Jamie\u2019s math homework is due tomorrow, and he\u2019s struggling. He calls out again, a little more desperate. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my family needs me to be present, to help, to care. But the call queue is full, and my supervisor is watching my stats. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I hear the next call connect, and Jamie\u2019s voice overlaps with the customer\u2019s greeting."}
