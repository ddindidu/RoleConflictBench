The beach was packed, and every instinct told me to stay sharp\u2014one slip, one second of distraction, and someone could be in real danger. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad\u2019s not feeling well. We just need to hear your voice.\u201d I pictured them at home, faces drawn and tired, needing me in a way that had nothing to do with rescue tubes or whistles. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for them, to offer comfort and reassurance, but I couldn\u2019t leave my post or even let my attention drift. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each impossible to ignore. I gripped the armrest, torn between the crashing surf and the quiet ache of home, not knowing which call to answer."}
