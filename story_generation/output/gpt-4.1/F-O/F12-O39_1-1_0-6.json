My husband was at the kitchen table, swirling his tea, and he told me about a rough day at work\u2014nothing major, just the usual office politics, but I could hear the fatigue in his voice. I wanted to sit with him, listen, and offer the comfort he always gives me. But my mind kept drifting to the notice I\u2019d seen at the site: an optional training session next week. The foreman hinted it could lead to more responsibility, maybe even a raise, but it meant staying late and missing dinner at home. I felt torn\u2014my husband needed me to be present, to care, but my team at work expected me to step up, to show I was committed. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
