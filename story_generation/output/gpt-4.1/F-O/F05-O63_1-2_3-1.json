As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to be ready, script in hand, to answer every question about our new service. Lately, though, the calls have been brutal. Prospects keep asking about technical details the script barely covers, and my supervisor expects me to handle every objection smoothly, no matter how lost I feel.\n\nI glance at the laundry, then at my headset. If I fold now, I\u2019ll fall behind on my call quota. If I keep calling, the laundry will keep growing, and I\u2019ll be letting my wife down.
