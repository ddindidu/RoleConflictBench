I knew I should call him back, remind him about respecting public spaces and behaving properly\u2014he needed to learn discipline, and this was one of those moments where my words and actions mattered. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: an urgent message from my project manager. The new safety standard documentation was due by the end of the day, and I still hadn\u2019t finished compiling the evidence for compliance. My mind raced with the technical details I needed to double-check, the forms I had to fill out, and the pressure of knowing that a single oversight could mean a failed audit. I felt torn, standing in the middle of the supermarket, my son\u2019s voice growing fainter as he disappeared around the corner, while my work responsibilities pressed in from the other side. I could feel the weight of both roles\u2014parent and engineer\u2014pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my immediate attention, each unwilling to wait."}
