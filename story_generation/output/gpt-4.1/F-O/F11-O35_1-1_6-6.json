You promised you\u2019d be there this time.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, remembering how I\u2019d missed the last few outings. I wanted to show him he mattered, that I respected our bond enough to make time for him. But just as I started to reply, my work email pinged. The transit authority was offering a professional development seminar\u2014optional, but highly recommended for operators who wanted to advance. The sign-up deadline was today, and my supervisor had subtly hinted that those who participated would be looked upon favorably. I stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of expectation from both sides. My brother wanted me to be present, to include him and be included. My job demanded I show commitment and professionalism, even outside my regular hours. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between the two worlds, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role I would let down."}
