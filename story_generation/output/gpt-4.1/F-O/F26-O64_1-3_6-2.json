My phone vibrated in my pocket for the third time in ten minutes\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I knew what it was about: the family holiday was coming up, and everyone expected me to help coordinate, to be present, to keep the family connected. But right now, my manager was watching, and I had to focus. One wrong move with these high-value transactions, and the till wouldn\u2019t balance. I could almost hear my grandkids\u2019 voices, asking if I\u2019d be there for the big dinner, and my daughter\u2019s gentle reminders to call back soon. My hands trembled as I handed change to a customer, my mind split between the numbers in front of me and the family waiting for my attention. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the reliable grandparent everyone counted on and the diligent cashier my job demanded. I stared at the ringing phone, heart pounding, caught in the impossible tug-of-war between family and work."}
