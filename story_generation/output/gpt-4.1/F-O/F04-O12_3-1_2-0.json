I was determined to make the code as clean and maintainable as possible, knowing how much future headaches I could save. But the message was from my sister: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of her words. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, especially in tough times, and I could hear the strain in her text. But my mind kept drifting back to the lines of code, the logic I was untangling, the satisfaction of doing my job right. If I stopped now, I\u2019d lose my flow, and the code would be messier for it. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019d built as siblings. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, torn between being the brother she needed and the developer I wanted to be."}
