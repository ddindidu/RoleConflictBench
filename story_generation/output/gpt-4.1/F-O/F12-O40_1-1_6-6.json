He asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the little girl who clutched her broken wooden horse at the shop. Her mother\u2019s anxious eyes met mine as she asked if I could fix it, and I promised to look it over. Now, the toy sat in my bag, splintered and delicate, waiting for my attention. My husband\u2019s voice pulled me back\u2014he wanted to know how work was, if anything interesting happened. I wanted to share, to be open like he always hoped, but my mind raced with the cost of materials, the time it would take, and the pressure to give a fair quote. I felt torn, wanting to be present and honest with him, but also needing to focus on the repair, to meet the expectations of a mother and her child. The words caught in my throat, and I stared at my tea, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to give voice to first."}
