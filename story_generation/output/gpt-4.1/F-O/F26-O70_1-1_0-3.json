My grandchild, Sarah, had just texted me, \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I need advice about starting high school.\u201d My heart warmed\u2014she trusted me to help her through this big step. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned over the years, to be the steady presence she needed. But just as I was about to call her back, my delivery app pinged. A package needed to be delivered across town, and the customer had left strict instructions: \u201cLeave the package only if someone is home. If not, call me immediately.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I waited to talk to Sarah, the delivery window would close, and I risked a complaint or worse, losing my job. My mind raced, torn between being the wise, supportive grandparent Sarah expected and the reliable, rule-following delivery person my employer demanded. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
