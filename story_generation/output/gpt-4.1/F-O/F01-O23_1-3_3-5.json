My daughter had called last week, her voice bubbling with excitement as she told me how much the grandkids were looking forward to seeing me. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing their eager faces and the laughter around the dinner table. But as I scrolled through my emails, my heart sank. The court had just confirmed the start date for a high-stakes jury trial\u2014one I\u2019d been preparing for months. My client\u2019s future depended on my presence, my arguments, my focus. There was no room for postponement, no substitute for my role in that courtroom. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the steady, loving grandfather my family needed, and the duty to stand by my client when it mattered most. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the cold gravity of the law, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
