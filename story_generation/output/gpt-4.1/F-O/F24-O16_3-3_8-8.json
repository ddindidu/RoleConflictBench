The hospital needed me\u2014an emergency case, a patient with a severe infection, time was critical. As I read the message, I saw my step-brother step off the curb, distracted, not noticing the car speeding toward the crosswalk. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to protect him, make sure he was safe, especially after everything we\u2019d been through together. But as a doctor, I knew that every second I delayed could mean the difference between life and death for my patient. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of both responsibilities. Should I shout and pull him back, risking being late to the ER, or trust he\u2019d be okay and run to the hospital, knowing someone else\u2019s life depended on me? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds that defined me."}
