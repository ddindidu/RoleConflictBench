The trial was tomorrow, and the final briefs were dense, every word demanding my full attention. As a judge, I owed it to both parties to be meticulous, to ensure fairness and justice. My phone buzzed, and I saw my granddaughter\u2019s name. She rarely called during the week. I answered, and her voice trembled as she asked, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart clenched. She was at that age where life\u2019s problems felt enormous, and she trusted me to help her navigate them. But the clock ticked, and the files waited. I felt the weight of my robe and the warmth of my family pulling me in opposite directions. My mind raced with the expectations: to be wise and present for her, to be impartial and prepared for court. I closed my eyes, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left wanting."}
