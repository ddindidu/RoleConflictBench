Everyone\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d I smiled, remembering our promise to spend more time together, to make up for the years we\u2019d drifted apart. I wanted to be there, to show him he mattered, to build the kind of mutual respect we\u2019d both longed for. But just as I was about to reply, my pager shrieked\u2014an emergency call from the hospital. A life-support device in the ICU was flashing critical fault codes. I was the only machine repairer on call tonight, and the staff needed me to diagnose and fix the issue immediately. My heart pounded as I stared at my brother\u2019s hopeful message and the urgent hospital alert. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing against the life-or-death responsibility of my job. I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the sister my brother needed and the professional my patients depended on."}
