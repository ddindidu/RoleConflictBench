It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come over\u2014she needed to talk, really talk, about something she couldn\u2019t handle alone. I promised her, years ago, that I\u2019d always be there when she needed me. But as I hung up, my passenger slid into the back seat, chatting about the weather and how he had all the time in the world before his meeting. I glanced at the clock, calculating the route. If I took him now, I\u2019d be late getting to my sister. If I canceled, I\u2019d break my promise to the dispatcher about reliability, and maybe lose a regular customer. My hands tightened on the wheel. My sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, but so did the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d get this man safely and promptly to his destination. I sat there, torn, the meter ticking, my heart pounding, caught between being the brother she needed and the driver I was supposed to be."}
