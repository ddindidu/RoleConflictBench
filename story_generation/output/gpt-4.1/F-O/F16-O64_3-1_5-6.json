The house is a mess, and relatives will be there in a few hours. I promised I\u2019d help, but my shift at the grocery store drags on. A customer approaches, and I force a smile, scanning their groceries and asking about their day, even as my mind races with chores left undone. Each beep of the scanner is a reminder that I\u2019m not at home, not helping, not meeting my spouse\u2019s expectations. But here, I\u2019m expected to be cheerful and attentive, to make every customer feel welcome. I nod and chat, but my heart pounds with guilt and frustration, torn between the demands of my job and my promise at home. The line grows, and so does the pressure, as I wonder how I can possibly be in two places at once."}
