My grandson had called me yesterday, his voice bubbling with excitement about showing me his new train set. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture his face lighting up when I walked through the door. But as I sat at my desk, the spreadsheets on my computer glared back at me, numbers blurring together. The month-end closing deadline was looming, and the reports weren\u2019t adding up. My manager had sent a reminder this morning: accuracy was critical, and any errors could have serious consequences for the company. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting my presence, my job demanding my focus. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing my grandson, but my mind raced with the fear of letting my team down. I sat there, torn, unable to silence the competing voices in my head, knowing I had to choose but wishing I didn\u2019t have to."}
