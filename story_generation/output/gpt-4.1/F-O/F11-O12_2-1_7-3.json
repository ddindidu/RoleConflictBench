I need your advice.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just past six. I promised myself I\u2019d be more patient with him, to listen without judgment, to build the kind of mutual respect we never quite had growing up. But my laptop screen is still open to the team chat, where Product just announced a brainstorming session for tomorrow\u2019s sprint. Attendance is \u201coptional,\u201d but I know how these things go\u2014if I don\u2019t show up, I\u2019ll miss the chance to shape the new features, to collaborate and make my voice heard. \n\nI feel the tug in both directions. My brother needs me to be present, to listen and understand, to be the sister I want to be. But my team expects me to show up, to contribute, to be a part of the creative process. I stare at my phone, then at my calendar, feeling the pressure build in my chest. I want to be there for both, but I can already sense that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
