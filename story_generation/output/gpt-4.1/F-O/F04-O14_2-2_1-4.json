It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of her words. She never asked for help unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew I should be there, to listen and support her, especially when she was struggling. But as a scientist, I was under pressure to finalize my research summaries\u2014my supervisor had made it clear that accurate, timely reporting was non-negotiable. The meeting was in less than twelve hours, and my data still needed careful analysis. My mind raced, torn between the urge to drop everything for my sister and the responsibility to my team and my work. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding me of the importance of integrity and deadlines, while my heart ached at the thought of letting my sister down when she needed me most. I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
