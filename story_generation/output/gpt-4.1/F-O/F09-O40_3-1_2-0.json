They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss it. My heart twisted with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not be there for him when he needed me to guide him, to show him right from wrong? But as I glanced at the clock, panic rose in my chest. I was due at the construction site in twenty minutes, and as the lead carpenter, I was responsible for the morning safety briefing. If I was late, the crew might start without me, and any lapse in safety could mean someone getting hurt. My boss had made it clear: punctuality and vigilance were non-negotiable. I felt torn in two, the weight of my son\u2019s mistake pressing on me, the responsibility for my team\u2019s safety just as heavy. I gripped my keys, my mind racing, caught between the demands of motherhood and the duty of my trade, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
