My heart pounded, not just from the shock, but from the weight of what I was supposed to do next. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with fairness and firmness, even if it meant risking his trust in me. I opened my mouth to speak, but my phone buzzed insistently at my hip\u2014a call from the tower. Pre-dawn traffic was light, but a sudden equipment check required my attention. As an air traffic controller, I was expected to be alert, to keep the skies safe, even when the world was still asleep. I stared at my stepson, his eyes wide with fear, and then at my phone, the demands of both worlds pressing in. I felt torn, the urge to be present for him battling with the responsibility to my team and the pilots in the air. My mind raced, caught between the need to discipline and the duty to direct, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
