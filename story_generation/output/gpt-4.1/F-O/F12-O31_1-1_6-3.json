He asked about my day, his eyes warm and expectant. I wanted to tell him everything, to share the tension from the morning briefing and the adrenaline rush from chasing a suspect. But I hesitated, knowing how much he worries when I talk about the dangers of my job. I gave him a vague answer, mentioning paperwork and a quick stop at the gym. \n\nBut even as I spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: mandatory gym session in thirty minutes. Physical fitness is non-negotiable in my line of work\u2014lives depend on it. Yet, I saw the disappointment flicker in his eyes. He wanted me to stay, to talk, to be present. I felt torn, the weight of my badge on one shoulder and the warmth of my marriage on the other. The clock ticked louder, and I sat frozen, caught between the duty to protect and the promise to be open with the person I love most."}
