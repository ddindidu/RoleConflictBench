I knew it was Mom\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I was warm enough in the workshop. I usually replied right away, sending her a quick photo or a voice note, just to keep her from worrying. But today, I was behind schedule. The circular saw needed a thorough inspection before I could start cutting the new beams, and the foreman had reminded us\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions. Safety first, always. I could almost hear his voice in my head, stern and unyielding. My hands hovered over my phone, torn. If I answered Mom now, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking a lapse in focus. If I ignored her, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call, and I\u2019d feel that familiar guilt gnawing at me. The saw gleamed under the harsh light, waiting. My phone buzzed again. I stood there, caught between the expectations of a caring daughter and a responsible carpenter, my heart pounding with the weight of both."}
