Dad\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d As a son, I knew what was expected of me. I should check in, ask if everything\u2019s okay, offer comfort, maybe even head home if they needed me. But as a delivery person, I was already running behind. The last package had arrived late at the depot, and my supervisor had reminded me\u2014again\u2014how important it was to deliver every parcel on time. The address was only a few blocks away, but if I stopped to call my parents, I\u2019d risk being late and possibly getting a complaint. My parents counted on me for emotional support, especially when things felt uncertain at home. My job, though, demanded punctuality and reliability. I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the urge to call home and the pressure to get back on the road."}
