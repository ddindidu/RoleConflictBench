He was laughing, oblivious to the chaos he left in his wake, and I knew I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why we don\u2019t run indoors\u2014why we respect others\u2019 space. That\u2019s what a good father does: teaches, corrects, guides. But the phone\u2019s vibration was urgent, the special ringtone from the control tower. I was on call, and a sudden route closure meant dozens of flights were circling, waiting for instructions. My team needed me to help untangle the airspace, to keep hundreds of lives safe. I could almost hear the tension in their voices, feel the weight of their expectation. My son darted past a display, nearly toppling it, and a woman shot me a disapproving look. I felt split in two\u2014torn between the duty to my child and the responsibility to the skies. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the demands of fatherhood and the call of the tower, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
