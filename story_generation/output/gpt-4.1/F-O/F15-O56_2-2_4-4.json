My son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my warnings to stay close. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in and teach him discipline, to show I was a responsible parent. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the salon. My 2 p.m. client, a first-time visitor, was already there and seemed unhappy with her hair color. My manager wanted me to come in early to address it. I could picture her disappointed face in the mirror, the expectation that I would fix it, make her feel beautiful and heard. My heart pounded as I tried to corral my son, torn between the urge to kneel down and talk to him about respect and safety, and the pressure to rush out and save my professional reputation. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I stood frozen, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
