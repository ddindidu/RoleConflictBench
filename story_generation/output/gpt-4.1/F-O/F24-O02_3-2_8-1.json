My phone buzzed with another email from the project manager\u2014stakeholders were pushing for a demo, and I was the only engineer left in the office who could pull it off. My heart pounded with the pressure, every minute away from my desk felt like a setback.\n\nThen I saw my stepbrother, Ben, at the curb, headphones in, about to step into the street without looking. Instinctively, I reached out, but my mind screamed about the time I was losing. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe\u2014Mom had asked me to keep an eye on him after school. But the prototype was everything right now; if I missed this deadline, the whole project could collapse.\n\nI hesitated, torn between shouting his name and sprinting back to my laptop. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and for a moment, I couldn\u2019t move at all."}
