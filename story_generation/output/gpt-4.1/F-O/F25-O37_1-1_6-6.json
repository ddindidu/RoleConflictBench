My stepmother\u2019s voice drifted from the kitchen, tense and tired. I knew she\u2019d had a rough week, and as her step-child, I felt the urge to check in, to ask if she was okay, to offer the kind of support I knew she wanted from me. But the gloves on my hands reminded me of my other role\u2014the housekeeping cleaner\u2014where I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, especially now. I was supposed to keep the gloves on, not touch my face, not touch anything outside my cleaning zone. If I took them off to comfort her, I\u2019d risk breaking the rules and possibly spreading germs. If I kept them on, I\u2019d seem distant, cold, the opposite of the caring step-child I wanted to be. I hovered in the doorway, torn between the urge to reach out and the need to stay back, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what I should do next."}
