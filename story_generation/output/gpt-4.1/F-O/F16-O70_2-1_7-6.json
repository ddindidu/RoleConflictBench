I wanted to ask, to be the supportive spouse who listens and shares, but my phone buzzed\u2014another delivery, urgent, just a few blocks away. I promised I\u2019d be back soon, but as I drove, my mind spun with worry. Should I have stayed and talked? Was I being distant? \n\nWhen I reached the customer\u2019s door, I forced a polite smile, rehearsing the professional tone I was expected to use. \u201cGood afternoon, your package is here.\u201d But my mind was still at home, replaying my partner\u2019s anxious face.
