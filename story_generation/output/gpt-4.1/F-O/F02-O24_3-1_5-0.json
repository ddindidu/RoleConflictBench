My wife\u2019s voice was tense\u2014our son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the corner store. My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline, to show him that actions have consequences. But as a judge, I was already behind on my casework; the file in front of me needed my full attention if I was to uphold my duty to the court and ensure a fair process. The expectation to be thorough and impartial pressed on me, but so did the need to be present for my son, to turn this mistake into a lesson. I stared at the unopened file, my mind torn between the courtroom and my living room, feeling the weight of both robes I wore."}
