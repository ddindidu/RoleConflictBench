My mind was already running through the checklist\u2014oil levels, filter replacements, safety checks. The machines needed to be in top shape, and I was the one everyone counted on to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Just as I was about to log the last inspection, I glanced out the window and saw my younger brother on the sidewalk, headphones in, about to step off the curb. He didn\u2019t see the car speeding down the street. My heart lurched. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, just like Mom always said. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the final walkthrough with my supervisor, and any mistake could mean a costly breakdown next week. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention at the same impossible moment."}
