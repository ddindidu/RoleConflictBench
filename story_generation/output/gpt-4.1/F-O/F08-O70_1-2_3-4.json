The house was already filled with laughter and the scent of roasting chicken\u2014our family gathering was finally happening after weeks of planning. My daughter had asked me to tell stories from my childhood, and the little ones were waiting for me to join them in the living room. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A notification from the delivery app flashed: \u201cUrgent delivery\u2014signature required for valuable package. ETA: 30 minutes.\u201d My heart sank. I was the only one on shift for this route, and the company had been clear\u2014no missed signatures, no exceptions. The customer was counting on me, and my supervisor had warned me about the importance of reliability.\n\nI wiped my hands, torn. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be the grandmother they cherished. But my job demanded punctuality and responsibility, especially with valuable deliveries. I stood in the hallway, apron still on, wrestling with the impossible choice between the warmth of my family and the duty of my profession."}
