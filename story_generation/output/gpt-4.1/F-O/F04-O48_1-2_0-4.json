As her brother, I wanted to be there, cheering her on, making her feel proud. But at the hospital, my shift as a nursing assistant was far from over. One of my patients, Mr. Lee, was recovering from surgery. I noticed his temperature and pulse were a bit higher than normal. The protocol was clear: I needed to monitor him closely, maybe even alert the nurse in charge. My phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cWhen are you coming? We\u2019re waiting for you!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected me to show up, to be the supportive brother I always tried to be. But my patient needed me, too\u2014my job demanded my full attention, especially now. I stood in the hallway, torn, my heart racing as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once."}
