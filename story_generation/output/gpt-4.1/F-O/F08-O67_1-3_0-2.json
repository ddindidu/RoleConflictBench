Her eyes were wide, searching. \u201cGrandma, how do you know when it\u2019s time to take a big step? Like, really change your life?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling with uncertainty. I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of guidance only experience could offer. I reached for her hand, ready to share the stories and lessons I\u2019d gathered over the years.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 4, we have a multi-vehicle collision on Highway 17. Critical injuries reported. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. The expectation was clear: drop everything and go. But my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful gaze anchored me in place. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my wisdom and presence, the other my speed and skill. My mind raced, torn between the call of duty and the call of family, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
