She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her excitement. I knew she\u2019d be waiting for my reply\u2014she always said my words meant a lot. But as I reached a school zone, the road suddenly narrowed, orange cones forcing cars into a single lane. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and shouts mixing with the blare of horns. My hands tightened on the wheel. I wanted to pull over, send her a quick message, let her know how proud I was. But the traffic was thick, and the rules were clear: eyes on the road, especially here. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family, who expected my warmth and attention, and toward my duty as a driver, responsible for every life near my cab. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, demanding I choose which expectation to meet first."}
