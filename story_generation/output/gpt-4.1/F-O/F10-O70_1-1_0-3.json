It was a message from Mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you today. Everything okay?\u201d I glanced at the time\u2014already past noon. I\u2019d meant to text her this morning, but the rush of packages and addresses had swept me away. I typed a quick reply, but just as I was about to hit send, my work app pinged: \u201cUrgent\u2014confirm delivery with photo.\u201d I looked at the package in my passenger seat, the address matching the house in front of me. No one was home, and the porch was exposed to the street. I needed to find a safe spot, take a photo, and upload it immediately. My fingers hovered between my phone\u2019s messaging app and the delivery app. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s worried voice, but my supervisor\u2019s warning echoed too: \u201cNo shortcuts\u2014secure every package.\u201d My heart pounded as I stared at both screens, torn between reassuring my mom and meeting my job\u2019s demands."}
