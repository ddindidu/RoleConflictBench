The pharmacy world never stops changing, and I knew how important it was to stay sharp\u2014my license, my patients, my reputation depended on it. Just as the speaker began, I heard the front door slam. My stepbrother trudged in, backpack dragging, eyes red. He didn\u2019t say anything, but I could feel the weight of his day pressing into the room. As his step-sibling, I knew I should be there for him, listen, offer comfort\u2014he\u2019d always counted on me for that. But the webinar was starting, and missing it meant falling behind, risking my standing as a pharmacist. My heart twisted as I watched him disappear into his room, shoulders slumped. I stared at the screen, the lecturer\u2019s voice a distant hum, torn between the duty to my profession and the promise I\u2019d made to be the sibling he could lean on."}
