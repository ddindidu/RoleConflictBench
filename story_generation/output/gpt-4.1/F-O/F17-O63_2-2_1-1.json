I tried to focus, to remember the little stories she loved\u2014my new recipe, the neighbor\u2019s dog\u2014but my mind kept drifting. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d been at my telemarketing desk, headset pinching, as a customer grilled me about the new service\u2019s security features. The script offered only vague reassurances, and my supervisor\u2019s expectation was clear: never admit you don\u2019t know, always keep the call moving. But the customer\u2019s frustration echoed in my head, mixing with my mom\u2019s concern when I hesitated too long before answering her. I wanted to be present, to reassure her that I was okay, that I cared. But the pressure to be quick, confident, and knowledgeable at work lingered, making my words sound rehearsed even with her. My mom asked if I was distracted, and I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014her need for connection, my job\u2019s demand for composure\u2014pulling me in opposite directions."}
