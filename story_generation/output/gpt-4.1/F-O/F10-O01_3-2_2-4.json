I know she\u2019s waiting for my daily update\u2014she likes to hear about my day, every detail, and I usually respond right away. But right now, my laptop is open to a half-finished floor plan, and my mind is tangled in the challenge of fitting collaborative spaces and private offices into a limited footprint. My supervisor expects the first draft by tomorrow, and I can\u2019t afford distractions. Still, I picture my mother waiting, maybe worrying if I don\u2019t reply soon. I want to reassure her, to keep up the closeness we\u2019ve always shared, but the lines and measurements on my screen demand my full attention. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between typing a quick message and sketching out the next section of the plan. The pressure from both sides tightens in my chest, and I can\u2019t seem to move, caught between being the attentive daughter and the focused architect."}
