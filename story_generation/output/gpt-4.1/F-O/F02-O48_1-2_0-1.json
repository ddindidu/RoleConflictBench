My shift as a nursing assistant was supposed to end soon, but Mrs. Carter, who had just come out of surgery, needed help getting dressed and moving to her chair. She looked at me with anxious eyes, waiting for my steady hands. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was almost time to pick up my kids from school. They always looked for me at the gate, their faces lighting up when they spotted me. Today was special\u2014their last day before summer break, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there. My supervisor expected me to give every patient the care they deserved, especially someone as vulnerable as Mrs. Carter. But my children expected their dad to keep his word, to be present for the moments that mattered. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my heart torn between the hospital room and the schoolyard, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
