My foreman\u2019s voice cuts through the chaos, barking orders to drop everything and head to the muster point. My heart pounds, not just from the sudden rush, but from the time\u20143:15 p.m. My kids finish school in fifteen minutes, and I promised I\u2019d be there at the gate, waving as they spill out with their backpacks and stories. I can picture their faces, searching the crowd for me, the disappointment if I\u2019m not there. But the rules here are strict; no one leaves until the all-clear, and breaking protocol could mean more than just a warning. My phone buzzes in my pocket, probably my wife checking if I\u2019m on my way. I\u2019m torn, feet rooted to the concrete, mind racing between the muster point and the schoolyard. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, each demanding I choose them first."}
