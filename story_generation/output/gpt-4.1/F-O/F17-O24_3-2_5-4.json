The trial had been long and complex, and now it was my responsibility to write the final judgment\u2014thirty days to craft a document that would affect lives, set precedent, and reflect the law with clarity and precision. My mind kept circling the facts, the arguments, the nuances I needed to capture. Yet, as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the family ceremony this year.
