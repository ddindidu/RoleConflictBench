My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, \u201cDad, please come. It\u2019s urgent. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched\u2014my family needed me, my grandchildren needed their grandfather. But just outside the door, Mrs. Lee, my assigned patient, lay pale and sweating, her breathing shallow.
