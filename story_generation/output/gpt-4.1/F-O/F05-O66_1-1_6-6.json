She wanted to know more, to hear about the little things that happened, the people I met, the stories I carried home. I knew she expected me to open up, to share, to let her in. But my mind kept drifting to the cab parked outside, the faint smell of spilled coffee from my last passenger lingering in my memory. I remembered the crumbs on the back seat, the muddy footprints on the floor mat. I needed to get out there, to clean up before my next shift, to make sure the cab was spotless and ready. My wife\u2019s voice pulled me back\u2014she was asking about a difficult customer, wanting to understand how I felt. I wanted to give her my attention, to be the husband she needed, but the pressure of my other role pressed in. I felt torn, caught between the urge to meet her expectations and the responsibility to keep my cab in top shape. The clock ticked, and I sat there, wrestling with which role to answer first."}
