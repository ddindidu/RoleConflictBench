We\u2019d argued last night\u2014something stupid, but it had left a bitter taste. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew I should call him back, listen, and try to fix things. That\u2019s what a good brother does: communicates, builds trust, doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But my laptop screen glared at me, the code for the core module half-finished. My team was waiting; the whole project was stalled because of me. Emails kept pinging in, my manager asking for updates, teammates growing impatient. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014if I didn\u2019t deliver, the timeline would slip, and everyone would pay for it. My mind spun between the two worlds: the brother who needed to reach out, the engineer who needed to deliver. I could almost hear both voices in my head, each demanding my attention, each certain their need was more urgent. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn, as the minutes ticked by."}
