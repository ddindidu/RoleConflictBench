She was in the middle of finals week, and I knew how much she struggled with anxiety before big exams. I could almost hear her voice trembling, needing reassurance, needing me to listen. But as I pulled up to my next delivery stop, the pressure of my other role pressed in. The instructions were clear: leave the package only if someone was home, or else risk a failed delivery and a warning from my supervisor. I could see the empty driveway and dark windows\u2014no one was home. My phone buzzed again, my sister\u2019s anxious texts piling up. I felt torn, standing on the porch with the package in my hands, my mind racing between the responsibility to my job and the responsibility to my family. I wanted to be there for her, to offer comfort, but I also couldn\u2019t afford another mistake at work. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of being a good sibling and a reliable delivery person."}
