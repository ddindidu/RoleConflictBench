My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cSafety and punctuality, always.\u201d Just ahead, a yellow signal blinks\u2014a minor delay, but enough to throw off the schedule if I\u2019m not careful. I adjust the speed, heart pounding, knowing every second counts for the passengers relying on me.\n\nBut my phone vibrates in my pocket, a message from my mother. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family ceremony. It\u2019s important to us.\u201d Lately, my family has been insistent about upholding our traditions, especially after my grandmother\u2019s passing. They expect me to be there, to honor our values, to show respect.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s expectations tug at my heart, while the responsibility of hundreds of lives rests in my hands. I can\u2019t be late for the ceremony, but I can\u2019t rush the train either. My mind races, torn between the tracks and the ties that bind me at home, unsure which path to follow."}
