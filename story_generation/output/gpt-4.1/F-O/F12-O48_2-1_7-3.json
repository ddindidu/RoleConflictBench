My morning rounds had just begun, and I was already behind. Mrs. Lee was waiting for her blood pressure check, and I could see the anxious look in her eyes. I tried to steady my hands as I wrapped the cuff around her arm, but my mind kept drifting back to the text my husband had sent just before my shift started: \u201cCan we talk tonight? You seemed upset this morning.\u201d He always expected us to share our worries, to be open with each other, but I barely had time to breathe, let alone talk about my own stress. The beeping of the thermometer snapped me back to the present. I scribbled down the numbers, but guilt gnawed at me. My patients needed my full attention, but so did my marriage. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who depended on me most. As I moved to the next patient, my phone buzzed again in my pocket, and I wondered how I could possibly be the wife he needed and the nursing assistant my patients deserved."}
