He\u2019d just found out his best friend was moving away, and I knew he needed me\u2014he always did when things got rough. But I was on shift, headset already in place, and my supervisor had just reminded us about our call quotas. The line connected, and a customer\u2019s angry voice filled my ear, demanding to know why our offer was \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d I tried to focus, reciting the script, but my mind kept drifting to my brother, alone and hurting. I could hear him pacing, his distress almost tangible through the thin wall. My job demanded patience and professionalism, but my heart ached to drop everything and be there for him. The customer\u2019s questions grew sharper, my brother\u2019s sobs louder, and I felt myself pulled in two directions\u2014torn between being the supportive sibling he needed and the reliable employee my boss expected. My hands shook as I weighed which role I could afford to let down."}
