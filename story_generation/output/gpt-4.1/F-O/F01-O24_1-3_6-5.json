My grandchildren are eager to see me, and I promised them I\u2019d help decorate the tree this year. It\u2019s a tradition, one I\u2019ve missed too often. But as I hang up, my phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s the court clerk. The bail hearing just ended, and the defendant waits in a holding cell. The law is clear: I must draft and sign the release order now, with every condition spelled out precisely. Any delay could mean hours more in custody for someone who may not deserve it. My heart aches as I glance at the family photo on my desk. My family expects my presence, my warmth, my stories. The court expects my diligence, my clarity, my immediate action. I sit at my desk, torn between the laughter waiting at home and the solemn duty before me, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
