As a step-parent, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing on my mind\u2014groceries, rent, school supplies. Money was tight, and I knew I had to find new clients if I wanted to keep us afloat. That\u2019s why I was here, mingling, hoping to make connections that might lead to work.\n\nThen, a local business owner sidled up to me, someone who could be a valuable contact. He smiled and asked, \u201cSo, what kind of cases are you working on these days?\u201d It was a simple question, but my heart pounded. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality; I couldn\u2019t reveal details about my clients, not even to hint at the high-profile case that might impress him.
