Mom had been planning it for weeks, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories like always. But as I looked around the workshop, I saw sawdust piling up and tools scattered everywhere. My boss had just emphasized the importance of keeping the site spotless after a recent accident, and I knew if I left now, I\u2019d be cutting corners on safety. The pressure built in my chest\u2014my family wanted me present, but my job demanded responsibility. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s disappointed sigh if I missed dinner, but I also pictured my supervisor\u2019s stern face if he found the mess tomorrow. My hands trembled as I weighed the warmth of home against the cold reality of my duties, feeling torn between being the brother everyone counted on and the carpenter who couldn\u2019t afford to slip up."}
