I knew it was my mother\u2014she always worried when she saw news of protests on TV, and she expected me to check in, no matter what. Usually, I\u2019d send a quick message, reassure her, maybe even call if I had a moment. But tonight, the crowd was swelling, voices rising, and my radio crackled with urgent updates. As a police officer, I was expected to stay alert, focused, and ready to step in if things turned violent. My sergeant\u2019s eyes swept over us, making sure no one was distracted. I felt the weight of my badge and the responsibility to keep order, but my mother\u2019s anxious texts pressed on my conscience. I could almost hear her voice, asking if I was safe, needing to know I was okay. Torn between duty and family, I gripped my phone, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of a devoted son and a vigilant officer, unsure which role to answer first."}
