Mom says you have to be there.\u201d My chest tightened. I could already picture my family gathered around the table, laughter echoing, my absence a glaring gap. But the weight of the lumber in my hands reminded me where I was\u2014on site, sweat trickling down my back, the carpenter waving impatiently from across the lot. \u201cHey! I need that wood now, or I can\u2019t finish the frame!\u201d he shouted. I knew the foreman expected me to keep things moving, no delays, no excuses.
