She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, watching her read aloud. I promised her I would. But as I sipped my coffee, the radio crackled\u2014tower needed me early. There was a rare window of calm in the pre-dawn hours, and my supervisor wanted me to manage the airspace, prepping for the morning rush. I knew how crucial it was to keep things running smoothly, even when the skies were quiet. My team depended on me, and a single mistake could ripple through the day. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mia\u2019s expectant face flashed in my mind, but so did the responsibility of hundreds of lives in the air. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the control tower and the classroom, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
