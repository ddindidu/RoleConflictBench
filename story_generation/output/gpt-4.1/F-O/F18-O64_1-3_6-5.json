I\u2019m always watching out for him, making sure he doesn\u2019t dart into the street or get too close to strangers. That\u2019s what Mom expects\u2014keep him safe, no matter what. But today, my mind is split. My shift at the grocery store starts in an hour, and I know tonight is deposit night. The manager drilled it into us: no shortcuts, no distractions, count every bill twice, fill out every form. If I mess up, it\u2019s my job on the line.\n\nAs we turn the corner, my brother lags behind, kicking a rock. I want to hurry him along, but I\u2019m already running through the deposit steps in my head. What if I forget something? What if I\u2019m late because I\u2019m waiting for him? But if I rush him, what if he trips, or worse, steps into the street? My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder for my shift. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the rules of the store and the unspoken rule of being a good sibling. I slow my steps, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that won\u2019t wait for each other."}
