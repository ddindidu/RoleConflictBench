It\u2019s a text from Mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good day at work. Call us when you can.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last message from yesterday, and guilt pricks at me. I know she worries, especially with my job. I should text her back, let her know I\u2019m okay, but right now, I\u2019m supposed to be focused\u2014objective, fair, and by the book.\n\nThe car\u2019s owner approaches, apologetic, explaining they were just running in to check on their elderly father. I know the rules say I should issue the ticket, but there\u2019s room for discretion. My badge feels heavy on my chest, a reminder of the trust the community places in me. I want to be fair, but I also want to be the reliable child my parents expect, the one who checks in, who doesn\u2019t let them worry.\n\nI stand there, torn, the ticket half-written, my phone buzzing again. I can\u2019t seem to be both things at once, and the weight of both roles presses in, demanding an answer."}
