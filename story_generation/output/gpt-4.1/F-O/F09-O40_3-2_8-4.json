The home loan repayment looms over me like a storm cloud\u2014two months left, and I need every job I can get. As a mother, I feel the weight of my family\u2019s future pressing on my shoulders. I promised my kids we\u2019d keep this house, that I\u2019d make sure they never had to worry about where we\u2019d live. But as a carpenter, I\u2019m already behind on this custom cabinetry project. The contractor is waiting for my part so the electricians can move in, and the client is calling every day, anxious for updates. I know if I don\u2019t finish on time, I might lose future work\u2014and the money I desperately need. My phone buzzes with a message from my daughter\u2019s school: she\u2019s sick and needs to be picked up. My heart twists. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The sawdust in the air feels thick, almost suffocating, as I weigh the expectations of being a reliable worker and a dependable mother. I close my eyes, torn, knowing a choice has to be made."}
