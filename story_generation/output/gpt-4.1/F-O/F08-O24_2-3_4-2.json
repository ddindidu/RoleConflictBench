She had been waiting all week to share her news with the family\u2014her acceptance into the college of her dreams. I could see the excitement in her eyes, and I wanted nothing more than to be present, to listen, to celebrate this milestone with her.\n\nJust as she began to speak, my phone buzzed. The courthouse clerk\u2019s voice was urgent: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. I was the only judge available, and the law demanded I review the case immediately. Someone\u2019s safety could depend on my swift, careful attention. My heart pounded as I glanced at my granddaughter, her expectant face glowing in the candlelight, and then at the unopened case files on my laptop. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to ignore. I stood there, torn, the voices of family and duty pulling me in opposite directions."}
