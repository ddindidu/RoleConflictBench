The procedures were strict\u2014every bill had to be double-checked, every form filled out perfectly. I glanced up and saw my younger brother, Ben, waiting at the counter. He looked frustrated, shifting from foot to foot, holding a bag of groceries. I knew he\u2019d had a rough day, and I could almost hear our mom\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cBe patient with your brother, try to understand him.\u201d But the manager\u2019s words echoed, too: \u201cNo shortcuts, no distractions during deposits.\u201d Ben started to complain about how long I was taking, his voice rising. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my role as a sister demanded patience and understanding, but as a cashier, I couldn\u2019t break protocol.
