The store is quiet now, but my mind is racing. My phone buzzes with a message from my partner: \u201cRough day, just want to talk when you\u2019re home.\u201d I can almost hear the tiredness in their words, the way they need me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. But the deposit must be perfect\u2014every bill, every slip, every signature. The manager made it clear: no shortcuts, no mistakes, or the audit could come down hard on all of us. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to drop everything and call, to be the supportive spouse they expect, but the cash in front of me demands my full attention.
