The hum of the dishwasher was a gentle background to my thoughts as I checked off tasks, making sure the new library project was on track. My phone buzzed with a reminder: site meeting in an hour. I glanced up and saw my granddaughter, Emma, slouched on the couch, her eyes fixed on the floor, shoulders heavy. I recognized that look\u2014something was weighing on her, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. As her grandmother, I should go to her, offer comfort, share a story from my own tangled youth, and help her find her way. But the clock ticked louder in my mind, reminding me of deadlines, of the team waiting for my guidance, of the clients expecting progress. My heart ached with the urge to be present for Emma, yet my mind raced with project details and schedules. I sat frozen, torn between the wisdom I owed my granddaughter and the leadership demanded by my profession, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
