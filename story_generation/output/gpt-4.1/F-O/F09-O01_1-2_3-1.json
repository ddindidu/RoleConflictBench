He was slouched in his chair, fidgeting with his pencil, ignoring my gentle reminders to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d when asking for help. I knew I should focus on guiding him, teaching him the patience and respect I wanted him to carry into the world. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the site manager. The new stairwell design might not meet safety codes, and if I didn\u2019t review the plans tonight, construction could move forward with a dangerous flaw. My mind raced between the two worlds: the expectation to nurture my son\u2019s character, and the professional duty to ensure no one would be hurt by my oversight. I could see his eyes searching for my attention, but the weight of responsibility from the project pressed on me. I felt torn, my heart aching with the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
