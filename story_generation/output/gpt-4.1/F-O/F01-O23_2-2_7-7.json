She\u2019d just started her first job and wanted to share every detail\u2014her excitement was infectious, and I felt a warm responsibility to be present for her, to listen and encourage her as any good grandfather should. At the same time, my assistant knocked, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files. She said it would make her work easier, but I knew she wasn\u2019t briefed on the case and granting her access would breach my ethical obligations as a lawyer. My mind raced. My family expected me to be open and communicative, to share in their joys and support them. My profession demanded strict confidentiality, unwavering integrity. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between answering my granddaughter\u2019s call and addressing my assistant\u2019s request. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own set of expectations, and I sat there, caught in the middle, unsure which demand to answer first."}
