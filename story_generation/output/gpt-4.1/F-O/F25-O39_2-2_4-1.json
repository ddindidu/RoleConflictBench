It\u2019s tradition. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d She\u2019d said it with that look\u2014the one that meant she expected me to prove I belonged, to show respect for the customs that mattered so much to her and my step-siblings. But now, sweat stinging my eyes, I saw the carpenter waving impatiently. \u201cHey! I need that lumber now, or we\u2019re all behind!\u201d The foreman\u2019s glare made it clear: slacking wasn\u2019t an option. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another reminder about the dinner. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of expectation pressing down from both sides. If I left early, I\u2019d let the crew down and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe for good. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the lumber pile and the world I was still trying to fit into, not sure which demand would break me first."}
