My sister\u2019s excitement about the holiday trip was contagious, and Mom\u2019s reminders about how much it meant to everyone tugged at me. I knew how rare it was for all of us to be together, and I could almost hear Dad\u2019s voice, \u201cFamily comes first.\u201d But as I glanced at my laptop, the email from the external inspector glared back at me. The safety concerns were serious\u2014if I didn\u2019t address them immediately, our operations could be shut down, and the team was counting on me to ensure everything was up to code. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any slip-ups. You\u2019re the lead on this.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my family\u2019s expectations pulling me one way, my professional responsibility anchoring me the other.
