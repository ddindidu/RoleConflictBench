Lightning flashes outside the tower, and the radar screen blooms with rerouted flights, each one a puzzle piece I must fit into the sky. My fingers fly over the console, coordinating with the next sector, my voice steady even as my heart pounds. In the back of my mind, I remember it\u2019s Sunday\u2014my parents will be waiting for my call. I picture my mother glancing at the clock, my father\u2019s quiet anticipation. They expect to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m safe, to share their week and listen to mine. But the storm won\u2019t wait, and neither will the pilots depending on me. The pressure builds, two worlds pulling at me: the duty to my family, the responsibility to the skies. I glance at my phone, silent and untouched, and feel the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
