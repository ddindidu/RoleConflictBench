She smiled back, and I felt a small sense of pride\u2014being a friendly cashier meant making someone\u2019s day a little brighter. But as the store\u2019s quiet hum continued, my mind kept drifting to the family group chat buzzing on my phone in my pocket. Today was the day of our family gathering, the one I\u2019d promised my daughter and grandkids I wouldn\u2019t miss. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, see the table set for dinner, and feel the weight of their expectation for me to be there, present and attentive. Yet here I was, still behind the counter, my shift unexpectedly extended because a coworker called in sick. I felt torn, the pressure of being a dependable employee clashing with the longing to be the grandfather my family needed. My heart ached as I greeted the next customer, the decision looming over me, unresolved."}
