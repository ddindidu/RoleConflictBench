It was Sunday afternoon, and I knew my parents expected a message from me\u2014just a simple text to let them know I was okay. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but persistent: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to check in, even if you\u2019re busy.\u201d I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, trying to think of something reassuring to say. \n\nJust then, the radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 3, possible cardiac arrest, respond immediately.\u201d My heart jumped. I was trained to drop everything and move, to be the first line of help for someone in crisis. But my parents\u2019 last message blinked on the screen, unread. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my family, who worried in silence, and my duty to strangers who needed me now. My fingers trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between sending a quick message and racing to the ambulance bay, knowing that every second mattered in both roles."}
