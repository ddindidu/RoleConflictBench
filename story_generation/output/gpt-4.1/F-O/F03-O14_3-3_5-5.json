But as I nodded, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the journal submission deadline was less than 24 hours away. My research team was counting on me to finalize the report and upload the datasets. The integrity of our work, and my reputation as a scientist, depended on it.

How could I honor my family\u2019s trust without letting down my team? The ceremony preparations grew louder around me, but all I could hear was the ticking clock and the silent demand to choose."}
