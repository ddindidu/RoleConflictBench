It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute? Dad seems a bit down today.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past 7 p.m. The QA team had just flagged a critical bug, and users were complaining about random crashes. My manager\u2019s last email was clear: \u201cWe need a fix tonight.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents rarely reached out for emotional support, and I knew how much it meant to them when I checked in. But the code wasn\u2019t going to fix itself, and the team was counting on me. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between dialing home and diving back into the code, my heart pounding with the impossible choice."}
