My phone headset is pressed tight against my ear as I try to soothe a furious customer, her voice sharp and insistent. She wants every detail about the offer, and she\u2019s not letting up. My script is useless; she\u2019s demanding real answers, and my manager is watching my call time. At the same moment, my phone buzzes with a text from my spouse: \u201cCan you help with the living room? Relatives will be here in an hour.\u201d I picture the mess\u2014the dishes, the scattered toys, the dust on the shelves. I promised I\u2019d help, and I know how much it means to my partner that everything is perfect for the visit. But the customer is still talking, her frustration growing, and I can\u2019t just hang up. My stomach twists as I try to focus on her questions, but my mind keeps drifting to the chaos at home and the disappointment I\u2019ll cause if I don\u2019t step up. I feel pulled in two, unable to give either role what it demands from me."}
