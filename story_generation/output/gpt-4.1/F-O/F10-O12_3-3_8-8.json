I glanced at the screen\u2014urgent messages from my team: \u201cProduction outage. Users locked out. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew the bug was in my code, and the pressure to fix it was crushing. But before I could respond, my mom sat across from me, her eyes red and tired. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d she asked, voice trembling. She started sharing about her worries\u2014Dad\u2019s health, her own fears, how overwhelmed she felt. I could see she needed me, not just as her daughter, but as her anchor. My laptop chimed again, the team\u2019s messages growing more frantic. I felt torn in two, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. My parents needed my comfort, my team needed my expertise, and I was paralyzed, caught between the demands of being a good daughter and a responsible developer, not knowing which world to let down."}
