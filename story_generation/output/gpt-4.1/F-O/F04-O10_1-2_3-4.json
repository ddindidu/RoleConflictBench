My parents chimed in, asking if I could help plan the route and bring my famous sandwiches. I smiled and nodded, feeling the warmth of being included. But in the back of my mind, numbers and deadlines swirled. The quarterly tax filing for the company was due next week, and I still had piles of receipts to reconcile and forms to double-check. My boss had made it clear\u2014no mistakes, no delays. I could already picture the spreadsheets waiting for me at home, the regulations I needed to review. My family\u2019s laughter filled the room, but I felt a knot tightening in my stomach. They expected me to be present, to join in and make memories. My job demanded focus and precision, especially now. I wanted to be both the reliable brother and the diligent accountant, but the expectations pulled me in opposite directions. I stared at my plate, torn between the joy of family and the weight of responsibility, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
