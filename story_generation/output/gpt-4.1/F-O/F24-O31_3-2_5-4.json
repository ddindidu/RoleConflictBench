My stepbrother sent a photo of the packed car, everyone grinning, waiting for me. I could almost hear my stepmom\u2019s voice: \u201cWe want you here, part of the family.\u201d I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d try harder to fit in, to show up. But just as I reached for my jacket, my police radio crackled\u2014there\u2019d been a major traffic accident on the highway, not far from my route. Dispatch needed all available officers to assist, to keep the scene safe and direct traffic. I felt the weight of my badge, the unspoken oath to protect people, to be there when it mattered. My heart pounded as I looked between my uniform and my suitcase. My family expected me to be present, to belong. My duty demanded I serve, to put others\u2019 safety first. The two worlds pulled at me, each with its own claim, and I stood frozen, torn by the impossible choice."}
