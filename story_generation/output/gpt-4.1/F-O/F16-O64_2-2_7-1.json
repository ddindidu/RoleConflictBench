My hands move quickly, scanning items and counting change, but my mind is elsewhere. This morning, I noticed my spouse was quieter than usual, their eyes shadowed with worry. I wanted to ask, to listen, to be the partner who communicates openly and shares burdens. But now, as a cashier, the expectation is clear: keep the line moving, process every transaction accurately, don\u2019t let mistakes slip through. The customers are impatient, sighing and shifting their weight, and my manager\u2019s watchful gaze adds pressure. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my spouse, maybe reaching out. I feel torn, my heart aching to step away and be present for them, but my hands are tied to the register, my focus demanded by the endless stream of groceries and receipts. The roles pull at me from opposite sides, and I stand frozen for a moment, caught between the needs of the person I love and the responsibilities of the job I can\u2019t abandon."}
