Today was the day of my family\u2019s annual blessing ceremony, a tradition my father always led, but this year he asked me to take his place. My relatives gathered on the lawn, waiting for me to begin, their eyes full of expectation. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to honor our heritage, to show respect and leadership.\n\nBut as I glanced back at the pool, I saw a group of teenagers laughing, climbing onto the slippery edge, ignoring the bold red \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My training as a lifeguard screamed at me to intervene, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. If I left the ceremony, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even embarrass them. If I ignored the pool, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be failing in my duty as a lifeguard. My heart pounded as I stood frozen between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both sets of expectations pressing down on me, unsure which role I was supposed to honor first."}
