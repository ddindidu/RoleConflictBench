My father barely glanced up from his paperwork, his shoulders hunched in a way I hadn\u2019t seen before. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer the comfort only a daughter could give. But in the back of my mind, the data from today\u2019s experiment nagged at me. I was supposed to update the research logs, to document every detail while it was still fresh. The schedule was flexible, and technically, I could do it later, but accuracy mattered. If I waited, I might forget something important, and the integrity of my work was at stake. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of the kitchen and the cold glow of my laptop screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents\u2019 quiet need pulled at my heart, while my responsibility as a scientist tugged at my conscience. I hesitated, caught in the silent struggle between being the daughter they needed and the scientist I was meant to be."}
