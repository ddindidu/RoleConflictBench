I know it\u2019s my mother\u2014she always texts around this time, wanting to know if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m safe, if work is going well. She expects a quick reply, a sign that I\u2019m thinking of her, that I care. I glance at the screen: \u201cHow are you? Did you get enough sleep?\u201d I want to answer, to reassure her, but just then, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice comes through, uncertain and anxious, asking for directions to the hospital stop. My job demands my full attention; I need to keep everyone safe, answer questions, and stay alert. My mother\u2019s message tugs at me, a reminder of her love and her need for connection. But the passenger\u2019s voice is insistent, and the train speeds on. I feel torn, caught between the comfort of my mother\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I owe to the people in my care. My heart pounds as I weigh which role to answer first, knowing I can\u2019t be both the perfect daughter and the vigilant operator at the same time."}
