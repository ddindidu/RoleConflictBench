He didn\u2019t look up, but I could feel the weight of his silence. I knew I should sit beside him, ask what happened at school, offer the kind of support we promised each other after Mom and Dad married. But my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the site manager. The inspection report was worse than I\u2019d feared: the stairwell design didn\u2019t meet code, and if I didn\u2019t address it tonight, construction would continue, risking everyone\u2019s safety. My mind raced with calculations and liability, but my heart ached for my brother, who needed me now. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent responsibility to protect lives as an architect and the unspoken promise to be there for my family. The living room felt impossibly small, the blueprints heavy in my arms, as I wrestled with which role I could bear to let down."}
