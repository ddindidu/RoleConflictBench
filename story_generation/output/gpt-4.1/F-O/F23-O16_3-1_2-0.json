The next appointment was a routine check-up\u2014a patient with a runny nose and mild cough, nothing urgent. My phone buzzed with a message from the school: my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss his behavior. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up, to be present for him, especially now. He needed guidance, and I needed to prove I cared. But as a doctor, I had a waiting room full of patients who depended on me to listen, diagnose, and treat them with care. If I left, I\u2019d let my patients down and disrupt the clinic\u2019s schedule. If I stayed, I\u2019d fail my stepson when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing."}
