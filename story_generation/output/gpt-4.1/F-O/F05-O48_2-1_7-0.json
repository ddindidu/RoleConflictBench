I\u2019m worried about something.\u201d My heart tightened. As a husband, I knew I should be there for her, listen, and share my own worries too. We\u2019d promised to communicate openly, especially when things felt heavy. But right now, I was standing outside Mrs. Carter\u2019s room, her breakfast tray in hand. She depended on me to help her get ready for the day\u2014bathing, dressing, making sure she ate. My patients needed me to be present, attentive, and gentle. I could hear Mrs. Carter calling softly, \u201cIs that you?\u201d I felt torn, the weight of my wife\u2019s unspoken concerns pressing on me, while my duty as a nursing assistant demanded my full attention. My mind raced, caught between the urge to call my wife and the responsibility to care for my patient. I stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, breakfast tray in the other, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
