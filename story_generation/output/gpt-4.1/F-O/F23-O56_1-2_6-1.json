Jamie had been counting down the days, and I\u2019d seen the hope in his eyes every morning. I wanted to keep my word, to show him he could trust me, that I was really part of this family. But the cost of the console would mean dipping into the rent money, and I\u2019d been picking up extra shifts just to keep us afloat.\n\nJust then, the bell above the salon door jingled. A woman stepped in, clutching her purse, her eyes darting nervously. I recognized the look\u2014first-time jitters. My boss always said, \u201cFirst impressions matter. Make them feel at home.\u201d I was supposed to greet her warmly, offer tea, and put her at ease.

I forced a smile, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
