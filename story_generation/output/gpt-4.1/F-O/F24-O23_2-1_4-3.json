I knew how much it meant to her, and to my siblings, who still sometimes saw me as the outsider. I wanted to be there, to show I cared, to finally feel like I belonged.\n\nBut as I was about to reply, my work phone rang. It was the court clerk, reminding me of a procedural hearing scheduled for the same evening. It was a minor matter, one that could be postponed without much trouble. Still, as a lawyer, I prided myself on being reliable, never making excuses, always putting my clients first. I could almost hear my client\u2019s voice, grateful for my dedication.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I postponed the hearing, I\u2019d be letting down my professional standards. If I missed dinner, I\u2019d be letting down my family\u2014again. I sat at my desk, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
