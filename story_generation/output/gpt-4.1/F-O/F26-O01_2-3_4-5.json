Every detail mattered\u2014emergency routes, sterile corridors, the flow between operating rooms. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: \u201cGrandpa, can you come over tonight? I want to show everyone my science project!\u201d My heart squeezed. I knew how much this meant to my granddaughter; she\u2019d been working on it for weeks, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate her effort. But the hospital board\u2019s deadline loomed, and I was the only architect on the team who understood the intricacies of the design. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours, maybe miss a critical flaw. Yet, if I stayed, I\u2019d miss a moment my family expected me to cherish. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, the silent demand of the blueprints. I stared at the clock, torn between the promise of family and the responsibility of my profession, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
