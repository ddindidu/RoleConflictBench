As a judge, I knew I needed to stay sharp, to keep up with every shift in the law. But my mind kept drifting to the promise I\u2019d made to my son last month: if he kept his grades up, I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo he\u2019d been dreaming about. He\u2019d held up his end, and now he watched me with hopeful eyes every time I came home. But money was tight\u2014unexpected expenses had eaten into our savings, and I worried about making ends meet. I felt the weight of my robe and the warmth of my child\u2019s trust pressing on me from opposite sides. Should I spend the evening poring over legal articles, or take him to the store and risk our budget? My heart tugged in both directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, the law review and my son\u2019s hopeful gaze both demanding more than I felt I could give."}
