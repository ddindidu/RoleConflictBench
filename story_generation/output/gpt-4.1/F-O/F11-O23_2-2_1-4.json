It was my younger brother, his voice trembling. \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend, and I could hear the tears he was trying to hide. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when he was hurting. But tomorrow, I have a contested motion\u2014my client\u2019s business is on the line, and they\u2019re counting on me to be sharp, prepared, and present in court. I could hear the weight in my brother\u2019s voice, the same way I could feel the pressure of my client\u2019s expectations. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to comfort my brother, to be the sister he needed, and the duty to my client, who trusted me to fight for them. I stared at my calendar, torn, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
