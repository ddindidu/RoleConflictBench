She\u2019d finally graduated after years of hard work, and our family had planned a surprise party. I promised her I\u2019d be there, front and center, cheering the loudest. As I was getting ready, my radio crackled\u2014an emergency call. A man nearby was having a major heart attack. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My training kicked in; I knew every second counted for him. But my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you! It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My heart twisted. I could picture her scanning the crowd, hoping to see me, needing my support on her big day. But I also knew someone else\u2019s family was counting on me to save their loved one. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I sat frozen for a moment, torn between the siren\u2019s call and my sister\u2019s smile, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
