My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the emergency at home\u2014my grandson had fallen and was frightened, and everyone was asking for me. I could picture his tear-streaked face, the way he always reached for my hand when he was scared. My heart ached to be there, to comfort him, to be the grandmother my family needed in this moment.\n\nBut just outside my office, Mrs. Lee waited anxiously. She had just learned she had diabetes, and I could see the confusion and fear in her eyes. She needed me, too\u2014not just as a doctor, but as someone who could explain, reassure, and guide her through the first steps of a new, overwhelming reality. I knew how important it was to be present, to answer her questions with patience and empathy.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My family needed me. My patient needed me. I closed my eyes, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
