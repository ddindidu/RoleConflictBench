I knew I should remind him, gently but firmly, about table manners\u2014how important it is to be respectful and careful, to learn discipline in small, everyday actions. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the clinic: my patient, Mrs. Lee, was waiting for her check-up, and she had a list of questions about her health. I remembered her anxious face from last time, how she needed reassurance and clear explanations. My son looked up at me, eyes wide, waiting for my guidance. At the same time, I felt the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectations\u2014she needed my attention, my empathy, my time. My heart tugged in two directions: the father who should be present, teaching and nurturing, and the doctor who must be patient, attentive, and kind. I felt the pressure mounting, the impossible pull of both worlds demanding all of me at once."}
