My family gathered around, laughing and sharing stories, as they always did during these rare moments together. My father caught my eye, nodding toward the empty seat beside him, a silent reminder that I was expected to join in the family tradition of reciting the old blessing before dinner. I wanted to be present, to honor the rituals that meant so much to them.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the new pharmacy newsletter. I knew I should skim it, even just the highlights, to stay updated on the latest drug releases. My manager always emphasized the importance of being current, and I didn\u2019t want to fall behind. The pressure to be a good pharmacist tugged at me, just as the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations pulled from the other side.\n\nI stared at the screen, then at my family, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment, torn between the traditions that shaped me and the career that defined me."}
