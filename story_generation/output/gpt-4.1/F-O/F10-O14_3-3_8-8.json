She told me about her fears\u2014Dad\u2019s health, the bills piling up, the loneliness she felt when I was away. Her eyes searched mine, pleading for reassurance, for the steady comfort I\u2019d always tried to give. My phone buzzed on the table, a sharp, insistent alert from the lab. The new spectrometer was sending out warning signals\u2014possible coolant leak, a safety risk if not handled immediately. I knew the protocols: I was responsible for the equipment, for the safety of everyone in the building.
