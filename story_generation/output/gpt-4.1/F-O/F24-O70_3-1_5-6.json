It was our first holiday together as a blended family, and I knew how much it meant to her that I join in, to show I was really part of this new family. But as I zipped up my delivery jacket, my work phone pinged\u2014a last-minute delivery, and the address was across town. The customer had already called twice, sounding impatient. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cAlways be on time, always be polite. Our reputation depends on it.\u201d I could picture my family waiting, the car packed, my absence a silent disappointment. At the same time, I imagined the customer, checking the clock, ready to complain if I was late or curt. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the reliable step-sibling or the professional delivery person. I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
