She expects me to reply quickly, to share every detail, as if our bond depends on these constant updates. At the same time, my shift as a housekeeping cleaner starts early. The supervisor is strict about safety and hygiene\u2014gloves must be worn for every task, no exceptions. But my phone keeps buzzing in my pocket. If I stop to answer, I have to remove my gloves, risking contamination and breaking protocol. If I ignore the messages, I know my stepmother will worry, maybe even call my father, and I\u2019ll be accused of being distant or ungrateful. My hands hover over my phone, torn between the need to be a good step-child and the responsibility to do my job right. The pressure builds inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I can\u2019t see how to satisfy both without letting someone down."}
