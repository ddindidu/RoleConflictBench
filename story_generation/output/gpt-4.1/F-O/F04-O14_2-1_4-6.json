Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the roast chicken, hear the laughter echoing from the dining room. My family expected me there, present and engaged, not just physically but emotionally. But as I glanced at the lab calendar, my heart sank. The quarterly maintenance checklist was due tomorrow. No issues had come up, but protocol was protocol\u2014every piece of equipment needed to be checked, logged, and signed off. If I left it for the morning, I\u2019d be rushing, risking a missed step or a safety violation. My supervisor trusted me to keep the lab running smoothly, and I prided myself on never letting standards slip. Yet, the thought of disappointing my family, of missing another dinner, gnawed at me. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My hands hovered over my phone, torn between replying to my sister and opening the lab maintenance app, my mind racing with the consequences of either choice."}
