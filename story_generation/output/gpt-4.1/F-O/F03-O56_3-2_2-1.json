I glanced at the screen\u2014three unread messages from Mom, each more insistent than the last. She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, how my day was going, and if I\u2019d remembered to call Grandma. I always replied quickly, keeping up our daily ritual, but just then, the bell above the salon door chimed. A woman hovered at the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I could see she needed reassurance, a warm greeting, maybe a gentle joke to help her relax. My fingers itched to text Mom back, to keep her from worrying, but my training echoed in my mind: every client deserves your full attention from the moment they walk in. I stood frozen, torn between the comfort my mother expected and the welcome my client needed, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
