My mom\u2019s message popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t be late! We\u2019re counting on you for the group photo.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much these moments matter. As I pulled up to the curb, my next passenger slid into the back seat, breathless and anxious. \u201cPlease, can you get me to the station fast? My train leaves in twenty minutes.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of his urgency. The route to the station cut straight through the city, but traffic was already thickening. My mind raced\u2014if I took this fare, I\u2019d miss the start of dinner, maybe the photo, maybe disappoint my family. But if I turned him away, I\u2019d be letting down someone who depended on me to do my job, to get him where he needed to go safely and on time. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, torn between the pull of home and the duty of the road, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
