My husband had just called, his voice tense, reminding me that his parents would arrive in two hours. The house was still a mess\u2014dishes in the sink, laundry unfolded, and the guest room unprepared. He expected me to help, to make sure everything was perfect for their visit. I promised I\u2019d be home soon, but as I hung up, a customer approached the pharmacy counter. She handed me a prescription for her son\u2019s cold. I scanned the label, double-checked the medication, and felt the familiar pressure of my professional duty. I couldn\u2019t rush; accuracy was everything. If I made a mistake, even with something as simple as a cold remedy, the consequences could be serious. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from home. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. My family needed me, but so did my patients. I stood there, prescription in hand, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good wife and a responsible pharmacist."}
