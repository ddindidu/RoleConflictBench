Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call, to reassure her that I was okay and to keep up the daily rhythm we\u2019d established since I moved in. But I was hunched over the centrifuge, frowning at the error code blinking on its display. The safety audit was in two hours, and I still had to recalibrate the pH meter and double-check the chemical storage logs. My supervisor had made it clear\u2014any slip-up could mean a failed audit, and the lab\u2019s reputation was on the line. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: the warmth and concern of my family, the cold, precise demands of my work. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a reassuring message and diving back into the tangle of wires and protocols. The clock on the wall ticked louder, and I could feel my chest tightening as I tried to decide which world needed me more in that moment."}
