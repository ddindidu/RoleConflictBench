The phone queue is still packed, and I know management is watching every second I\u2019m away. But as I stand to stretch, I see my husband sitting at the kitchen table, his shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on his coffee. He\u2019s been quiet all morning, and I remember our promise to always talk things through, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. I want to sit beside him, ask what\u2019s wrong, and really listen. But my break is only ten minutes, and if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get another warning. My job expects me to be efficient, to stick to the schedule, but my heart aches with the need to be present for him, to be the wife who listens and supports. I hover in the doorway, torn between the blinking call light on my headset and the silent plea in my husband\u2019s eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
