My shift as a delivery driver is almost over, but I\u2019m running behind. The last package is still in the back, and the address is across town. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNo late deliveries, or it comes out of your pay.\u201d I can\u2019t afford another deduction\u2014not when I promised my son a Nintendo for his birthday. He\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, and I see the hope in his eyes every time I come home. I want to keep my word, to see his face light up, but the money is tight. If I rush and make the delivery on time, I might just scrape together enough for the Nintendo. But if I\u2019m late, that extra cost means breaking my promise. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from my wife about the Nintendo. I grip the steering wheel, torn between being the reliable father my son needs and the dependable worker my job demands. The weight of both roles presses down on me as I pull up to a red light, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019ll let down."}
