My script ran through my mind, but my eyes darted to my son, weaving between supermarket aisles, giggling as he knocked over a display of cereal boxes. I felt the heat rise in my cheeks\u2014he knew better, and I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to be respectful in public. But the customer\u2019s tone sharpened, \u201cAre you even listening? This sounds like a scam!\u201d My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: never lose a customer, always stay calm, answer every question.
