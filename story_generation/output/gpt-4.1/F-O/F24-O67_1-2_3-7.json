My stepmom smiled at me, expecting me to chime in, to show I was part of this family now. I wanted to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but my phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see the ambulance dispatch alert flash across the screen. A call had come in: a patient with a minor injury, but the address was across town, and traffic was already thick. I was expected to get there quickly, but above all, to drive safely\u2014no shortcuts, no risks. My stepbrother looked at me, waiting for my answer about the weekend, while my mind raced with the responsibility of the patient waiting for help. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the family\u2019s hope for connection and the city\u2019s expectation for calm, careful urgency. My heart pounded as I stood, torn between the warmth of belonging and the duty of care, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me in this moment."}
