My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cWe\u2019re running low on groceries. Can you bring home some money tonight?\u201d The weight of her words pressed on me. As a father, I knew I had to keep the family afloat, every fare mattered. The passenger slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a casual meeting, no rush. I felt a flicker of relief\u2014maybe I could take another fare after this, squeeze in a little more before heading home.\n\nBut as I drove, the city traffic thickened. I caught myself considering shortcuts, maybe pushing the speed a bit, just to finish this ride faster. But then, the other part of me\u2014the taxi driver\u2014reminded me of my duty to keep my passenger safe, to drive responsibly, no matter how much I needed the next fare. My hands tightened on the wheel, my mind torn between the urgency of my family\u2019s needs and the responsibility I owed to the person in my back seat. The pressure built inside me, each red light a reminder of the impossible balance I was trying to keep."}
