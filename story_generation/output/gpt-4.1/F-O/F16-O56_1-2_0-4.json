My phone buzzed with a message from Jamie: \u201cRough day, can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I pictured their tired face, the way they\u2019d want to talk, maybe just sit together in silence. I wanted to be there, to listen, to offer comfort. But right in front of me, my new client frowned at her reflection, lips pressed tight. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected,\u201d she said, voice trembling with disappointment. My heart sank. I needed to fix this, to reassure her, to make sure she left happy\u2014my reputation depended on it. But Jamie\u2019s words echoed in my mind, tugging at me. I felt split in two, torn between the urge to rush home and the duty to stay, to make things right for my client. My hands shook as I reached for the colour chart, my mind racing with what I owed to both of them, and the fear of letting either one down."}
