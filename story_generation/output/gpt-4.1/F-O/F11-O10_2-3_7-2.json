The email from the external auditor still glared at me, demanding the financial statements by the end of the day. My heart pounded with the pressure\u2014I couldn\u2019t afford a single mistake. Just then, my younger brother barged into my room, his voice tight with frustration. He wanted to talk about our latest argument, to clear the air and rebuild the respect we\u2019d always shared. I could see the hurt in his eyes, the hope that I\u2019d listen and be patient, like a good sister should. But my mind was racing with deadlines and the fear of letting my team down. I wanted to be there for him, to show understanding, but the weight of my responsibilities as an accountant pressed down on me. I sat frozen, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the fragile trust of my brother, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
