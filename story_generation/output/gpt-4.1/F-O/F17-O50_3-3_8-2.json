Her eyes were red, and she reached for my hand, her voice trembling as she confided in me about her fears for Dad\u2019s health. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. My phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a message from the hospital: the life-support device in the ICU was failing, and I was the only one who knew its quirks well enough to fix it quickly. My mind raced. My mother\u2019s grip tightened, her words growing more desperate, but the image of the blinking red lights and the vulnerable patient in the ICU pressed in on me. I felt split in two, the weight of my mother\u2019s need for comfort pulling me one way, the responsibility to save a life tugging me the other. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my breath, caught between the roles I couldn\u2019t abandon, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left waiting."}
