She tried to sound upbeat, but I could tell she was exhausted. I wanted to be there, to sit with her and listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. But as I hung up, I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was over. I had to check in on Mrs. Lee, who\u2019d been especially quiet today. When I entered her room, she looked up with hopeful eyes, clearly needing someone to talk to. I sat by her bed, trying to focus on her stories, but my mind kept drifting back to my parents at home, picturing my mom\u2019s tired face. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people who needed me. My heart ached with guilt\u2014how could I be the support my parents needed when my patients depended on me too? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for everyone."}
