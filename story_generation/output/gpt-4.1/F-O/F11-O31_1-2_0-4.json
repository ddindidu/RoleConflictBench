As his sister, I knew how much this meant to him\u2014he\u2019d always looked up to me, and I promised I\u2019d be there to cheer him on. But as I was getting ready to leave the station, a call came in: a major traffic accident on Main Street, multiple vehicles involved, injuries reported. My sergeant\u2019s voice was firm\u2014every available officer was needed. I grabbed my gear, heart pounding. I could already picture my brother\u2019s face if I didn\u2019t show up, the disappointment in my parents\u2019 eyes. But I also knew the city was counting on me to keep people safe, to bring order to chaos. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my family name\u2014pressed down on me as I raced to my patrol car, torn between the sister my family needed and the officer my community expected."}
