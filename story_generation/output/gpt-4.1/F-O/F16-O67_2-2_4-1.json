The pile of clothes was higher than usual\u2014my partner had an early meeting tomorrow, and our daughter needed her soccer uniform clean for practice. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d handle it tonight, and I could already hear the disappointment in their voices if I didn\u2019t. As I loaded the washing machine, the radio on my belt crackled to life: \u201cUnit 12, we have a call\u2014possible broken femur, Main and 5th, moderate traffic.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew the area; it would take time to get there, and every minute mattered for the patient. I glanced at the laundry, then at my keys.

I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet promise I\u2019d made to my family, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
