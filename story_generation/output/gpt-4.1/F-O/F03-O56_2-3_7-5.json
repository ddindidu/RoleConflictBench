My shift at the salon was almost over, but the angry voice of my last client echoed through the nearly empty room. She was upset about her haircut, her words sharp and insistent, demanding my full attention and a solution before she left. I tried to stay calm, listening and apologizing, knowing that my job depended on her satisfaction.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mom. She and Dad had seemed so worn out lately, their faces drawn and voices tired when I called. I knew they needed me, needed someone to talk to, someone to lean on. I promised myself I\u2019d be there for them, but right now, I was trapped between the expectations of my job and the needs of my family. My heart ached with guilt and frustration as I tried to focus on the client, all the while thinking of my parents waiting at home, hoping for comfort I wasn\u2019t sure I could give tonight."}
