He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. I could picture his face, the confusion and maybe fear, and I knew I needed to be there for him, to listen and help him understand what he\u2019d done. But my phone buzzed again\u2014Slack messages piling up. The production service was slowing to a crawl, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged last night. My team was counting on me to fix it, to keep the system running smoothly. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice: \u201cWe need this stable, now.\u201d My son needed his father, but my team needed their developer. I felt the pressure building, my mind racing between the two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
