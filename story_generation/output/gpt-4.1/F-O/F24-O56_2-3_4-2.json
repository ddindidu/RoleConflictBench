I knew how much these gatherings meant to him, how hard he tried to make us all feel like a real family. But as I tucked my phone away, the salon door chimed. The bride-to-be and her friends swept in, faces tense, eyes darting to the clock. They were early, and the wedding schedule was already tight. I could feel their nerves, their need for reassurance and calm. As a hairdresser, it was my job to greet them warmly, to make them feel at ease, to give them the best possible start to their big day. But my mind kept drifting to the dinner, the empty seat that would be mine, the disappointment I\u2019d cause if I stayed. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first."}
