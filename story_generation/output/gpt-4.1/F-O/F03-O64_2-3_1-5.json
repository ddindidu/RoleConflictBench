My hands moved automatically, counting the thick stack of bills for the end-of-shift deposit. The store was quiet, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my weekly call home. Mom and Dad would be waiting, probably sitting together on the couch, expecting to hear about my week and to tell me about theirs. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s gentle voice, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, okay?\u201d But the deposit procedure was strict: recount, log, double-check, lock away. If I missed a step, I could get written up or worse. My manager had drilled it into us\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my parents\u2019 expectations and the cold, unyielding rules of the store. My fingers hesitated over the bills, my phone vibrating again.
