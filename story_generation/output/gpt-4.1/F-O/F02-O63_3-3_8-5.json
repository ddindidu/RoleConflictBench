My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I glance at the family photo taped to my monitor\u2014my daughter\u2019s smile, my wife\u2019s hopeful eyes. The home loan repayment looms in my thoughts, just two months away. We can\u2019t afford to miss it; I promised them security, a roof over our heads. My call list blurs as I dial, voice rehearsed and cheerful, but my stomach knots with every rejection. If I don\u2019t close these sales, the bonus slips away, and with it, the extra money we desperately need. My phone buzzes\u2014a message from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we need to talk about the loan tonight.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the demands of my job clashing with my duty as a father. My hands tremble as I prepare for the next call, torn between the pressure to perform and the fear of letting my family down."}
