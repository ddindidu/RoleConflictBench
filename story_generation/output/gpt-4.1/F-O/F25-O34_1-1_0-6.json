Let us know you\u2019re okay.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling. I haven\u2019t checked in since last Sunday, and I know my mom worries if I go quiet. But right now, my headset crackles with the voice of a pilot requesting clearance to cross into the next sector. I need to coordinate with the controller on the other side, double-check the flight path, and make sure there\u2019s no conflict. My supervisor expects flawless communication\u2014one mistake could mean disaster. My stepdad\u2019s message sits unread, a reminder of the promise I made to keep in touch, to be present for my family even if I\u2019m not living at home. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to keep hundreds of lives safe in the sky, and the quieter, persistent pull to reassure the people who raised me that I\u2019m still part of their lives.
