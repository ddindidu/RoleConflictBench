My father barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to simply be present. Yet, as I cleared the dishes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab was prepped for my experiment, and the equipment was reserved for tomorrow. I\u2019d spent weeks designing this study, and while I could reschedule, I felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations and the momentum of my research. My parents\u2019 silent plea for comfort tugged at me, but so did the anticipation of discovery and the responsibility to my colleagues. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of the living room and the cold certainty of the lab, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need was greater."}
