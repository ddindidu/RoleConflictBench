The phone queue is still full, and I know management is watching every second I\u2019m away from my desk. As I log out, my phone buzzes\u2014a text from my partner: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just tired.\u201d I step into the kitchen, phone in hand, and see them slumped on the couch, eyes heavy. I know they expect me to listen, to offer a hug, to be present. But my mind is ticking down the minutes, calculating how long I can stay before the system flags me for an extended break. I want to sit beside them, ask about their day, and give them the comfort they deserve. At the same time, I feel the weight of my supervisor\u2019s expectations, the pressure to return to my headset before the queue grows even longer. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, torn between being the partner they need and the employee I\u2019m supposed to be."}
