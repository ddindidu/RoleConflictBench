My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my stepmom, reminding me that the family was waiting for me to join the holiday celebration at the lake house. She said it would mean a lot to my stepbrother if I showed up this year, that it was important for us to bond. I glanced over at the shallow end, where a group of kids had slipped past the rope, giggling as they darted in and out of the water without an adult nearby. As a lifeguard, I was supposed to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and never leave my post unattended. But my family expected me to be present, to show I cared, to help us feel more like a real family. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of keeping these swimmers safe against the hope of finally belonging at home. I felt torn, the demands of both worlds pressing in, and I didn\u2019t know which one I could let down."}
