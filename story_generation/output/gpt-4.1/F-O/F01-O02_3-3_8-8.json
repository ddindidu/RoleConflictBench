As an engineer, I knew the team was waiting for my time estimates\u2014without them, the client contract would stall, and the whole project could be jeopardized. My inbox was filling with reminders, and my manager\u2019s last message was clear: \u201cWe need your numbers today.\u201d\n\nBut the call wasn\u2019t from work. It was my daughter, her voice trembling as she told me about my grandson\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me\u2014not just as a father, but as a grandfather, someone who could listen, offer comfort, and help hold the family together. I could hear the strain in her words, the unspoken plea for support. I knew my family expected me to be present, to check in, to show I cared.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. My family needed me now, but so did my team. The weight of both worlds pressed down, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
