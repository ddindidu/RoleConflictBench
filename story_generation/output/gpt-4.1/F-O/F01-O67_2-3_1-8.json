The wail of the siren barely cut through the roar of thunder. In the back, the paramedics worked frantically over the patient, every second precious. My job was clear: keep the ambulance steady, get us to the hospital safely, no matter how slick the roads or how blinding the rain. But my mind kept drifting to my grandson, who had sat quietly at the kitchen table that morning, eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. I\u2019d wanted to sit beside him, offer the kind of advice only a grandfather can give, share a story from my own tangled youth, let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But duty called, and now, as I navigated the treacherous streets, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed my wisdom; my patient needed my focus. The storm outside was nothing compared to the one inside me, torn between the demands of the road and the silent plea in my grandson\u2019s eyes."}
