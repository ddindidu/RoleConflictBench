Attendance is optional, but I know how these things go\u2014those who show up get their voices heard, their ideas noticed. As a software developer, I want to be there, to help shape the new features and show I\u2019m invested in the team\u2019s future. But my mind keeps drifting back to the spreadsheet open on my other monitor: the home loan repayment is looming, just two months away. As a step-parent, I promised stability, a safe home, and I can\u2019t let anything jeopardize that. If I skip the session, I might miss out on opportunities for advancement or recognition, but if I go, I\u2019ll lose precious hours I could spend on freelance work to pad our savings. My partner trusts me to keep us afloat, and my stepdaughter looks to me for reassurance. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give. My cursor hovers over the RSVP button, heart pounding, torn between being present for my team and providing for my family."}
