We\u2019d both had long days, and as we shared a simple dinner, they asked, \u201cHow was work?\u201d I hesitated, thinking of the high-profile case I\u2019d spent hours on, the one that had everyone in the office buzzing. I wanted to share, to communicate openly like we always promised each other, but the details were confidential. I gave a vague answer, hoping it was enough.\n\nLater that evening, at a networking event, a colleague approached me with a knowing smile. \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re working on that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d The question was casual, but the expectation was clear\u2014networking meant sharing, building trust, maybe even impressing. But as a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything. The weight of my roles pressed on me: the spouse who should be open, the lawyer who must be discreet. I felt the tension coil inside me, torn between the trust of my marriage and the ethics of my profession, unsure which part of myself I could honor without betraying the other."}
