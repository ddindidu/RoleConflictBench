I glance at the screen\u2014my brother\u2019s name flashes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re leaving for Grandma\u2019s birthday in an hour. Mom says you have to be there.\u201d My heart sinks. I promised I\u2019d join the family for this trip, and I know how much it means to everyone, especially Mom. But the foreman\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. Missing it isn\u2019t an option; it\u2019s mandatory, and the team depends on each of us to be present and alert. I feel the weight of my hard hat pressing down, the expectations of my family and my crew pulling me in opposite directions. My hands tremble as I try to text a reply, torn between the warmth of home and the cold responsibility of the site. The clock ticks, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
