I could see she needed reassurance, maybe a story from my own tangled path to adulthood. My heart ached to give her my full attention, to offer the wisdom she sought.\n\nBut just then, my phone buzzed with an urgent email from the external auditor. They needed the quarterly financial statements\u2014immediately. My mind raced: the numbers weren\u2019t quite ready, and any delay could mean trouble for the firm. I felt the weight of professional responsibility pressing down, the expectation to be precise, reliable, and prompt.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter, her eyes searching mine, and then at the blinking cursor on my screen.
