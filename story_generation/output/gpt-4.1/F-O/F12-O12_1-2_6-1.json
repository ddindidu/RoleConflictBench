My husband pours us tea, settling across from me. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asks, his eyes warm, expecting more than the usual \u201cfine.\u201d I know he wants me to share, to really talk, to let him in. But my mind is tangled in lines of code and red-flagged performance warnings from today\u2019s review. The new feature is almost done, but the code isn\u2019t clean enough\u2014my team expects better, and I can\u2019t let them down. I want to close the laptop, look him in the eye, and talk about my day, but the urge to fix just one more function tugs at me. I feel the weight of his expectation for openness and my own for technical excellence pressing in from both sides. My heart pounds as I try to decide which role to honor in this moment, caught between the need to connect and the need to deliver."}
