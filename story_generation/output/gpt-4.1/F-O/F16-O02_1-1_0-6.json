They looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in their eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, dropping my bag. They shrugged, trying to play it off, but I caught the edge in their voice as they recounted a meeting that went sideways. I wanted to sit beside them, listen, and offer comfort\u2014just be present, like I know I should.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning call was starting in ten minutes. It wasn\u2019t a formal meeting, but my team was counting on me to help map out the next sprint and give a realistic estimate. If I missed it, the timeline might shift, but not disastrously so. Still, I knew my input mattered.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My partner needed me, even if they wouldn\u2019t say it outright. My team needed me, too, even if the stakes weren\u2019t sky-high. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to step into first."}
