My shift had just started, and the first few calls were easy\u2014polite voices, predictable questions, nothing I couldn\u2019t handle. But as I waited for the next call, I glanced across the room at my granddaughter, slouched on the couch, her eyes fixed on the floor. She\u2019d barely spoken all morning, and I could sense the weight she carried, the kind of heaviness I recognized from my own younger days. My heart ached to go to her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed, to remind her that storms always pass. But just as I stood, the phone beeped in my ear\u2014a new customer, another chance to meet my quota. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cStay on script, don\u2019t miss a call.\u201d I felt torn, caught between the duty to my job and the pull of my grandmother\u2019s heart, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
