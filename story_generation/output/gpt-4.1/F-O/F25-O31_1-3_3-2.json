My step-siblings laughed, passing around old family photos, and my stepfather caught my eye, nodding with approval. I knew how much it meant to him that I was here, finally taking part in their holiday tradition. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an alert: armed robbery in progress, just a few blocks away. My training kicked in, heart pounding. I was the closest officer. I could hear my stepfather\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cFamily comes first, especially on nights like this.\u201d But the police radio crackled, reminding me of my oath to protect and serve. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wore for the department, and the invisible one I wore for this family. My hand hovered over my badge, torn between the warmth of belonging and the cold urgency of duty, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
