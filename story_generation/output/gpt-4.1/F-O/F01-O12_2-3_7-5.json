She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her excitement. My wife had already replied, and I knew everyone expected me to chime in, to show her I was proud and engaged. But my laptop pinged again\u2014another urgent Slack message from the product architect. The launch date for our new feature had been moved up, and now three teams were waiting on my input before they could move forward. I could almost feel the weight of their impatience through the screen. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s celebration and the cold, pressing demands of the project. I wanted to be present for my granddaughter, to let her know I cared, but I also knew that any delay on my part at work would ripple out, stalling progress for dozens of people. My fingers hovered over both keyboards, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which world needed me more in this moment."}
