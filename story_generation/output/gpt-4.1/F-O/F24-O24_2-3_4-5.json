Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d The family dinner was tonight, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially since I\u2019d missed the last two gatherings. I could already picture the disappointed looks if I didn\u2019t show up again. But as I closed my office door, the bail hearing had just ended, and the defendant\u2019s lawyer was waiting outside, anxious for the release order. The defendant\u2019s family was counting on my signature to bring their son home tonight. My clerk reminded me, \u201cJudge, we need the order now. The jail can\u2019t process him without it.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting me at the table, my duty demanding I stay and write a clear, thorough order.
