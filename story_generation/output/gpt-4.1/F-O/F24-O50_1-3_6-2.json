The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, and I kept an eye on him, just like Mom asked. \u201cDon\u2019t let him out of your sight,\u201d she\u2019d said. Sam was chattering about his science project, but my mind was yanked away by the urgent message on my phone: \u201cICU ventilator failure\u2014critical. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart pounded. I was the only technician on call, and I knew how vital that machine was. But Sam was only twelve, and last week he\u2019d nearly darted into traffic. I couldn\u2019t leave him alone, not even for a minute. My hands shook as I weighed the responsibility of keeping Sam safe against the desperate need for my skills at the hospital. Both roles demanded everything from me at once, and I felt split in two, paralyzed on the sidewalk as Sam tugged at my sleeve, asking if I was listening."}
