They sighed, mentioning a tough meeting and a snide comment from their boss. I could see the need in their eyes\u2014just a quiet evening, maybe a hug, someone to listen. I reached for their hand, ready to be present, when my radio crackled to life. Dispatch: \u201cCode Red, possible major heart attack, Maple and 5th. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart lurched. I knew what was expected of me\u2014lives depended on my speed and skill. But my partner\u2019s hand tightened in mine, their eyes searching for comfort.
