Mom always said to keep an eye on him, especially after his fall last year. I watched him carefully, making sure he didn\u2019t dart into the road or trip over the uneven sidewalk. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the nursing home. Mrs. Carter, my favorite patient, was having a rough day and needed someone to talk to. I was supposed to check in on her soon, offer her comfort, maybe share a laugh or two. \n\nBut Sam was dragging his feet, clearly tired, and I knew he needed me to be present, to make sure he got home safe. My mind raced. If I rushed him, he might stumble. If I called Mrs. Carter, I\u2019d be distracted from Sam. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, fully. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the brother who trusted me and the patient who depended on me."}
