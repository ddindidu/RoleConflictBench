It was my daughter, her voice bubbling with excitement. \u201cDad, can you come to the living room? Jamie has something important to share with everyone!\u201d I glanced at the half-empty shelves\u2014bleach running low, sponges almost gone. The manager expected a full report by noon, and I still had two more rooms to check. But Jamie\u2019s big news\u2014whatever it was\u2014felt like a moment I shouldn\u2019t miss as a grandparent. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to keep the house running smoothly, and the longing to be present for my family.
