My mind races with the grocery list, the overdue rent, and the memory of my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes this morning when she asked if we could have chicken for dinner. I grip the steering wheel tighter, feeling the weight of every dollar I need to earn today. As a mother, I know I can\u2019t let my family down. Every fare counts.\n\nSuddenly, the road narrows ahead\u2014orange cones and flashing signs force all traffic into a single lane. I spot the school zone sign, and a group of children giggles near the curb, backpacks swinging. My next passenger\u2019s pickup time is ticking closer, and I know if I\u2019m late, I might lose the fare. But as a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to follow every traffic law, especially here, where the speed limit drops and the risk is highest.\n\nMy heart pounds. I feel the pressure of my family\u2019s needs pushing me to hurry, but the responsibility for these children\u2019s safety pulls me back. The expectations of both roles crash together, and I can\u2019t ignore either. I slow, torn between the demands of the road and the needs waiting for me at home."}
