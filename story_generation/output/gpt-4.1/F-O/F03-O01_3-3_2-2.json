I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from my mother, asking if I\u2019d eaten and how my day was going. Normally, I\u2019d reply right away, maybe send a photo of my lunch or a quick voice note. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done; it\u2019s how we stay close, even with my long hours. But right now, I was hunched over blueprints in the site office, red pen in hand, double-checking every emergency exit and fire suppression system for the new hospital tower. The city inspector was coming in an hour, and if I missed a single code violation, it could mean months of delays\u2014or worse, a safety risk for future patients. My father\u2019s message popped up too, asking about my weekend plans. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014always reachable, always sharing. But the plans and calculations in front of me demanded my full attention. My parents wanted reassurance and connection; my work demanded precision and vigilance. My heart tugged in both directions, and I stared at my phone, torn, as the minutes ticked by."}
