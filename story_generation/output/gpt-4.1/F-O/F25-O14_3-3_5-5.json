The journal\u2019s submission deadline was tomorrow, and I still needed to double-check the results, write the discussion, and format everything perfectly. My mind buzzed with statistical models and the weight of months of work. Just then, my stepmother called from the living room, her voice warm but expectant. \u201cWe need you to lead the family ceremony this year. It\u2019s important to your father and me. You know how much it means to keep our traditions alive.\u201d I looked at the family photos on the wall, feeling the pressure of their hopes. As a step-child, I always felt I had to prove I belonged, to honor their values and not let them down. But as a scientist, I owed my team and myself the integrity of our research. Both roles demanded my full attention, both felt urgent, and I could feel the tension knotting in my chest as I stared at the clock, time slipping away."}
