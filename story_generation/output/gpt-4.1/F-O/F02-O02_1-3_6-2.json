The team was waiting on me; without my code, the entire build was at a standstill. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, the knowledge that every hour of delay cost the company money and reputation. But then my phone buzzed with a message from home\u2014a picture of my son, grinning, holding up a drawing of the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. He\u2019d been saving up, counting the days, and I\u2019d told him this weekend we\u2019d go pick it out together. I knew how much it meant to him, how much I wanted to keep my promise, to be the father who provided not just for his needs, but for his happiness. Yet, the thought of leaving my desk now, with the project hanging by a thread, made my stomach twist. I stared at the screen, torn between the demands of my job and the promise I\u2019d made to my son, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
