My younger sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents hoped I\u2019d join, since I\u2019d missed the last few outings. I could see the hope in their eyes, and I felt the familiar tug of guilt\u2014I wanted to be there for them, to be the brother they expected. Just as I was about to agree, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a customer, asking about a package that had gone missing. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, even though my mind was still with my family. My manager always reminded us that clear, polite communication was essential, especially when things went wrong. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family waiting for my answer, the customer waiting for reassurance, both expecting my full attention. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility of my job, unsure which role to answer first."}
