Just an hour ago, I\u2019d gotten a call from the store manager\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But now, as I drove the ambulance to the satellite station for the shift change, my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you. He needs to talk.\u201d I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me\u2014the one that demanded I be a steady, safe driver, and the one that demanded I be a present, guiding parent. My hands gripped the wheel tighter. Should I pull over and call him, risking being late and possibly unsafe? Or should I focus on the road, knowing my son was at home, confused and hurting, waiting for me to help him understand what he\u2019d done? The siren was silent, but inside, everything was blaring at once."}
