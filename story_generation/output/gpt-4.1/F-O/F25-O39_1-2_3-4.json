My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my stepmother, reminding me that tonight was the family\u2019s annual holiday dinner. \u201cDon\u2019t be late. It means a lot to your father,\u201d she wrote. I knew how important these gatherings were, a chance to show I respected their traditions, to prove I belonged. But as I pocketed my phone, I caught sight of a small puddle of oil glistening on the walkway. It wasn\u2019t big, but it was right where the crew would be hauling materials in a few minutes. Safety rules were clear: spills had to be cleaned up immediately. If I left now, someone could get hurt. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late\u2014again\u2014and disappoint my family, maybe even fuel the quiet doubts about whether I really fit in. My heart pounded as I stared at the spill, torn between the weight of family expectations and the responsibility I owed my coworkers."}
