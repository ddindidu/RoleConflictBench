We need everything perfect.\u201d I glanced at the dashboard clock. My current passenger, a nervous traveler, kept checking his watch and the snow piling up outside. \u201cI can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he pleaded, voice tight with worry. The roads were slick, traffic crawling, and my mind raced with the weight of both worlds. At home, my partner was counting on me to share the load, to show I cared about our family and our home. Here, behind the wheel, I was responsible for this man\u2019s safe, timely arrival at the airport. Both needed me, right now, in different places, for different reasons. My hands gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of the road, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
