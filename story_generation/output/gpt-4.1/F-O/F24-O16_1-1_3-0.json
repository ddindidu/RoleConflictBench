My stepmother\u2019s eyes flicked to me, silently urging me to join in, to be present, to help knit our family closer. I wanted to say yes, to laugh and plan and belong. But my phone buzzed with a message from the clinic: a patient was waiting, someone with a runny nose and a cough, likely just a cold, but I knew I couldn\u2019t dismiss it without a thorough check. As a doctor, I was expected to be meticulous, to catch the rare but serious illnesses that sometimes hid behind ordinary symptoms. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the warmth of family, the other toward the responsibility of my profession. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart caught between the desire to be a good sibling and the duty to be a vigilant doctor."}
