My phone buzzed with a message from my project manager: \u201cWe need your estimates tonight, or the client walks.\u201d I stared at the numbers, knowing how much was riding on my calculations. Every hour I delayed, the team\u2019s stress mounted, and the contract hung in the balance.\n\nAcross from me, my partner\u2019s eyes were red. She\u2019d just come home, voice trembling as she described the impossible choice her boss had given her. She needed me\u2014needed my advice, my comfort, my full attention. I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for reassurance.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the project. If I didn\u2019t deliver, the fallout would be huge. Yet, if I turned away from her now, I\u2019d be failing her when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I tried to listen, but the weight of both worlds pressed in, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
