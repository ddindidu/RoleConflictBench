My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from my brother, \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of being wanted, of belonging. As I reached for my coat, my hospital pager vibrated urgently. The ER needed me. A patient had just arrived, barely conscious, with symptoms no one could immediately identify. The team was waiting for my expertise, my steady hands, my judgment. I stood in the hallway, torn. My family expected me at the table, to share stories and laughter, to be the sister who never missed a gathering. But my patient needed me, too\u2014needed the doctor who could make the right call, who could save a life. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I felt the sting of tears as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present in both places. My heart raced as I stared at the front door, caught between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of the hospital."}
