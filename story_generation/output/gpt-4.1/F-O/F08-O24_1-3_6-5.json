I know how much these moments mean\u2014my presence, my stories, the warmth I bring. Yet, as I glance at the clock, my heart tightens. The courthouse is waiting. A defendant\u2019s fate hangs in the balance, and I must draft the bail order with precision and care, ensuring every condition is clear and just. The law demands my focus, my impartiality, my time\u2014now, not later. My family expects my laughter and attention, but the court expects my diligence and swift action. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my hands trembling as I wipe flour from my apron and reach for my briefcase, torn between the call of home and the call of duty, knowing I cannot give both what they deserve at this very moment."}
