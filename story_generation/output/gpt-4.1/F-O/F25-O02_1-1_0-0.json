Let us know how you\u2019re doing!\u201d I stare at the screen, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I haven\u2019t replied to his last text from three days ago. I know my mom and stepdad expect me to check in, to keep the connection alive, especially since I moved out last year. But my laptop is open, and my engineering team\u2019s group chat is pinging with ideas for the new project. We\u2019re still in the brainstorming phase, and I\u2019m supposed to be thinking up alternative solutions for Monday\u2019s meeting. I feel the pressure to contribute something innovative, to prove I belong on this team. My mind is split\u2014should I pause and send a thoughtful reply to my parents, or keep my focus on the technical problem in front of me? The weight of both expectations presses down, and I can\u2019t seem to do either well. My fingers hover over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to answer first."}
