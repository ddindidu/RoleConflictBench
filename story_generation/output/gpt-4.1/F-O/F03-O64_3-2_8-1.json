My hands moved automatically\u2014scan, bag, smile, repeat. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down and saw a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad and I need to talk.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew what that meant\u2014something was wrong, and they needed me, not just as their son, but as someone to lean on. I could picture Mom\u2019s worried face, Dad\u2019s heavy sighs. But in front of me, customers shifted impatiently, tapping cards and glancing at their watches. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, reminding me with a look that speed and accuracy mattered. I felt torn, my mind split between the beeping register and the silent plea from home. I wanted to drop everything, step outside, and be the son my parents needed. But I was also the cashier, responsible for keeping the line moving, for not making mistakes. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between the demands of family and work, unsure which to answer first."}
