Their eyes were tired, searching mine for reassurance as they described the impossible choice their boss had given them at work. I knew they needed me to listen, to offer comfort and encouragement, to be the steady presence they could lean on. But my phone buzzed with a message from the station\u2014there was a car parked illegally outside a local business, blocking a fire hydrant. I was the closest officer. I knew the owner, a single parent who always struggled with timing, and I also knew the rules were clear. My badge demanded fairness and integrity, but my heart ached for the person behind the mistake. My partner\u2019s voice wavered, asking, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I felt the weight of both uniforms I wore\u2014one invisible, one pressed and blue\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. I wanted to be present, to give my partner the support they deserved, but duty called for impartiality and swift action. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of love and the demands of justice, unsure which role to answer first."}
