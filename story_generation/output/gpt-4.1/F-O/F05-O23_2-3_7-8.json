She asked if everything was alright, her voice gentle but insistent. I could see she needed me to open up, to share the weight I carried. As her husband, I knew I should communicate honestly, especially since she always confided in me about her own worries. But today, the burden was different. At work, opposing counsel had been relentless, pressing me for information that, if revealed, would devastate my client\u2019s case. The pressure was immense, and the ethical boundaries of my profession felt tighter than ever. My wife reached for my hand, searching my face for answers. I wanted to tell her everything, to let her in, but the rules of my profession held me back. The expectation to be open with her clashed painfully with my duty to protect my client\u2019s secrets. I felt torn, caught between the trust of my marriage and the trust of my client, both demanding loyalty, both deserving it. My heart pounded as I searched for words, knowing that whatever I said next would matter deeply."}
