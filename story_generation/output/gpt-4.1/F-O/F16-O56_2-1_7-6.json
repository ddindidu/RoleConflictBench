My mind was still tangled in thoughts of last night, when my spouse sat across from me at the kitchen table, eyes clouded with worry. I knew I should have asked what was wrong, opened up the conversation like we promised we would. But I was tired, distracted, and I let the moment slip by. Now, as my client arrived, she mentioned she\u2019d just washed her hair at home and it felt perfectly clean. The salon policy was clear: every client gets a wash and condition before a cut. My boss expected consistency, and clients expected the full experience. But I could see she was in a hurry, and I wanted to respect her time. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my spouse, probably hoping I\u2019d check in. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the need to be attentive and open at home, the need to follow rules and keep clients happy at work. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between what was expected of me in each role, unsure which demand to answer first."}
