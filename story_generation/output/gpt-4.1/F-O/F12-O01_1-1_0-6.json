He mentioned a tense meeting, his voice a little tighter than usual, but he brushed it off with a shrug. I nodded, glancing at the project dashboard on my screen. A contractor had just emailed about a delay, and I needed to check if it would push back our timeline. My mind flickered between the spreadsheet and my husband\u2019s words. I knew he expected me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe a hug or a reassuring word. But the project was at a delicate stage, and if I didn\u2019t catch these issues early, the whole team could be set back. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my husband\u2019s need for support, my team\u2019s need for leadership. My heart tugged toward him, but my mind raced with deadlines and dependencies. I wanted to be present for him, but I also couldn\u2019t let the project slip. The tension built inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, torn, unsure which demand to answer first."}
