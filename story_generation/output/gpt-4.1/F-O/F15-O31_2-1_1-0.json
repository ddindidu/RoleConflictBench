My daughter\u2019s open class was in half an hour, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. As I reached for my car keys, my radio crackled. A noise complaint\u2014neighbors upset about a loud party, tempers flaring, and I was the closest unit. Dispatch needed me there now. I could hear the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s voice already, see her searching the crowd for my face. But I also knew the neighborhood counted on me to keep the peace, to step in before things got out of hand. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my parenthood\u2014pressed down on me. I stood in the hallway, torn, the demands of duty and love pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which door to walk through."}
