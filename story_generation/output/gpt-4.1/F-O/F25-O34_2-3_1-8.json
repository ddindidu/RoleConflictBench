It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our weekly call, the one she always says means so much to her, the one Dad quietly listens in on, waiting for my stories. I know they expect me to check in, to share, to ask about their week, to remind them I\u2019m still part of their lives even though I moved out years ago. But tonight, the radar screen in front of me is a mess: a sudden storm has forced a passenger jet to divert, and its new path slices through three busy sectors. I\u2019m on the headset, coordinating with two other controllers, voices tense and clipped as we reroute traffic, every second critical. My supervisor\u2019s eyes are on me, expecting flawless communication, no distractions. My phone keeps buzzing. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my team\u2019s need for focus. My hand hovers over my phone, heart pounding, torn between answering the call and staying locked on the crisis unfolding in the airspace."}
