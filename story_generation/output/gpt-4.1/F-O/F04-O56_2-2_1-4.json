I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart clenched, but just then, my next client\u2014a first-time visitor\u2014settled into my chair. She wanted a bold new colour, and I\u2019d done my best, but as she stared into the mirror, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not quite what I expected,\u201d she said quietly, her disappointment clear. I could feel the weight of her expectation\u2014she needed me to listen, to fix it, to make her feel beautiful and heard. At the same time, my sister\u2019s message echoed in my mind, her need for support pulling at me. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the urge to step away and call my sister, and the responsibility to stay and help my client. My chest tightened as I wrestled with the impossible choice, both roles demanding all of me at once."}
