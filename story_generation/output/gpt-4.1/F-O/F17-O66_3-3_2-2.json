My passenger kept glancing at his watch, his voice tight as he reminded me\u2014again\u2014how important it was to reach the airport on time. I nodded, heart pounding, trying to focus on the slippery road. My phone buzzed in the cupholder. I knew it was my mom; we always texted at this hour, and she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply. She expected a quick update, maybe a photo of the snow, a reassurance that I was safe. But my passenger\u2019s anxious sighs pressed on me, and I knew even a glance at my phone could risk our safety. I felt torn, the weight of my mother\u2019s worry and my duty to this stranger both heavy on my chest. The storm outside was nothing compared to the storm inside me, as I wrestled with who needed me more in this moment."}
