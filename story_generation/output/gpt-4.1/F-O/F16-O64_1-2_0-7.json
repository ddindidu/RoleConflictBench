I want to be there, to show I care, but the lunch rush is in full swing. The line at my register snakes around the corner, and every customer expects a smile, a cheerful greeting, and quick service. My manager is watching, making sure I keep things moving. I feel the weight of my partner\u2019s need for support tugging at me, but the demands of my job press harder. I try to type a quick, thoughtful reply, but a customer steps up, impatient. My heart aches with guilt\u2014am I letting my partner down if I focus on work? Am I failing at my job if I pause to be a good spouse? The competing voices in my head grow louder as I stand at the register, torn between the person I love and the role I must play."}
