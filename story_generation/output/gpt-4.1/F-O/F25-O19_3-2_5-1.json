She depended on me to get her medications right\u2014her heart, her diabetes, her pain. Every pill mattered. My phone buzzed again. A message from my stepmother: \u201cWe need you to lead the family ceremony tonight. It\u2019s important to your father. You know how much this tradition means.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me that as the eldest step-child, I was expected to honor our family\u2019s values, to show unity and respect. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it in time, but I still had to finish my shift, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s prescription wasn\u2019t the only one waiting. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope for me to step up, my professional duty to ensure every patient\u2019s safety. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
