My partner had texted me twice already, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d handle it today, and I could almost hear the disappointment in their voice if I failed again. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a new ride request. The app showed a passenger waiting just a few blocks away, their messages popping up: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late for an interview.\u201d My rating depended on being prompt, and I couldn\u2019t afford another complaint. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family counting on me at home, and a stranger depending on me to get them somewhere important. My hands hovered between the laundry basket and my car keys, my mind racing with guilt and frustration, torn between being the reliable spouse I wanted to be and the professional driver I needed to be."}
