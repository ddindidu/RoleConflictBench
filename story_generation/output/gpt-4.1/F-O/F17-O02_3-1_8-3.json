The deadline was weeks away, but I knew the standards were strict, and every detail mattered. As I scrolled through the documentation, my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how the weight of everything seemed too much. She looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of support she\u2019d always given me. I wanted to close my laptop and be fully present, to reassure her and listen the way a good child should. But the thought of unfinished compliance reports gnawed at me\u2014if I didn\u2019t keep up, I risked missing something crucial. I felt torn, my heart pulled toward my mother\u2019s pain, my mind anchored to the responsibilities waiting on my screen. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, caught between being the child my parents needed and the engineer my job demanded."}
