Mom\u2019s voice, usually bright, was flat as she recounted her day. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. But my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the construction site. The contractor needed my approval to move forward, but I\u2019d just spotted a flaw in the stairwell design. If I didn\u2019t address it now, someone could get hurt. My mind raced between the two worlds: the expectation to be the steady, supportive step-child, and the responsibility to ensure every line I drew kept people safe. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the family I wanted to protect and the lives I was responsible for on paper."}
