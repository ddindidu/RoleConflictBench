He frowned, refusing to meet my eyes. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was the clinic\u2014my next patient had arrived early, a woman with a runny nose and a cough. I was expected to be thorough, to listen carefully, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything serious. But here, at home, my son needed my patience and guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to teach my child right from wrong, and the duty to my patient, who trusted me to diagnose her illness accurately. My mind raced, torn between the urge to stay and finish this lesson with my son, and the professional obligation waiting for me at the clinic. The clock ticked loudly, marking the seconds as I sat, caught between two lives, unsure which demand to answer first."}
