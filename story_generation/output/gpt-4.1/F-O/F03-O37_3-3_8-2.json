She called my name, her tone softer than usual. I wiped my hands and hurried over, only to find her sitting on the couch, eyes red, my father beside her looking lost. They told me about Dad\u2019s health scare, the fear and uncertainty weighing heavy in the air. I could see how much they needed me\u2014my words, my comfort, my presence. But as I sat there, the clock ticked louder in my mind. I still had the kitchen to sanitize, the bedrooms to dust, and the supervisor would be checking my work soon. If I didn\u2019t finish, I\u2019d risk a warning or worse. My parents\u2019 eyes pleaded for reassurance, but my mind raced with the checklist of chores left undone. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, unsure which role to answer first\u2014dutiful son or responsible cleaner."}
