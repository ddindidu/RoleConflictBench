My daughter\u2019s open class was today at 2 p.m.\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there to watch her. I promised I would. But just as I was about to leave the lab, my colleague burst in, breathless. \u201cThe conditions are perfect. If we don\u2019t run the experiment now, we might not get another chance this year.\u201d The data from this experiment could make or break our research, especially with the funding review looming. My mind raced: the pride in my daughter\u2019s eyes if I showed up, the disappointment if I didn\u2019t; the years of work, the team\u2019s hopes, the pressure to deliver results. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
