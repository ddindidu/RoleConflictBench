It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I glanced around at the crumbs on the counter, the muddy footprints by the door, and the pile of dishes in the sink. As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave the job half-done\u2014my supervisor expected spotless results, and I prided myself on meeting those standards. But as a sister, I could hear the strain in my brother\u2019s words, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless he was truly struggling. My mind raced with the pressure of both roles: the need to be there for my family, to listen and support him, and the responsibility to keep the house immaculate. I felt torn, guilt tugging at me from both sides, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
