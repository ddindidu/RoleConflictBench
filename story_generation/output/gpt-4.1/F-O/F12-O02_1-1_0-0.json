He looked up and smiled, but I caught the tiredness in his eyes. \u201cLong day?\u201d I asked, setting my bag down. He shrugged, \u201cJust a bit of a headache from all the meetings. Nothing major.\u201d I knew he wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just sit with him and let him unwind. But my mind was already racing with ideas from the project meeting earlier. We were still in the brainstorming phase, and I\u2019d thought of a new approach on the drive home\u2014one that could really make a difference. I felt the urge to open my laptop, jot down notes before the idea faded. But I also felt the weight of his unspoken need for me to be present, to be his partner, not just an engineer. I stood there, torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
