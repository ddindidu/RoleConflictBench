My younger brother wanted to go hiking, and my mom was already planning a picnic. I felt the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being a sister who was present, who joined in and made memories. Just as I started to suggest a movie night, my phone buzzed sharply. The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cWe have a call. Elderly patient, possible broken arm, needs immediate care.\u201d My heart clenched. I was the only ambulance driver on shift. I glanced at my family, their faces bright with anticipation, and then at my uniform hanging by the door. They expected me to be there, to be a sister, but someone out there needed me to be a medic, to bring calm and relief to their pain. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in opposite directions. I felt the familiar ache of being needed in two places at once, torn between the comfort of home and the urgency of the siren\u2019s call."}
