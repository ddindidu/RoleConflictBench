My son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in immediately. My heart twisted with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? At the same time, my laptop pinged with a message from the contractor: the steel delivery was delayed, and if I didn\u2019t resolve it now, the entire project would fall behind. I was supposed to be on-site in twenty minutes to walk through the plans and keep everything moving. My team was counting on me; the client was already anxious about deadlines. But my son needed me, too\u2014he needed a parent who would show up, listen, and help him make things right. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on my chest. I closed my eyes, trying to steady my breath, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
