Please, no more secrets.\u201d My chest tightened. She deserved honesty, especially now, with the medical expenses piling up. I promised her I\u2019d be open, that we\u2019d face everything together. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard Mrs. Carter calling from her room. She needed help getting out of bed, and breakfast was waiting. I was already running behind on my rounds, and the other aides were stretched thin. My supervisor expected me to be present, attentive, and reliable for my patients. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my wife\u2019s need for trust and my patients\u2019 need for care. I wanted to be the husband who listened, who shared everything, but right now, I was the nursing assistant who couldn\u2019t leave a patient waiting. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made at home and the duty I owed here."}
