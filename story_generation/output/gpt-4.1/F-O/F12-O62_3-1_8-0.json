We\u2019d agreed to talk about our finances today\u2014something we\u2019d both been avoiding. He wanted honesty, openness, and my full attention. I owed him that. But as he started to speak, my training kicked in. I noticed a group of teenagers drifting toward the deep end, laughing and splashing. No one was in trouble, but I knew how quickly things could change. My husband\u2019s voice grew tense, asking if I was listening. I tried to split my focus, nodding at him while keeping one eye on the water. The expectation to be present for him clashed with my duty to watch the swimmers. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest. If I looked away from the pool, I risked someone\u2019s safety. If I didn\u2019t give my husband my full attention, I risked our trust. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
