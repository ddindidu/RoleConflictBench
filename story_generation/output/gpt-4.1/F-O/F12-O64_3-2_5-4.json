His relatives are coming over tonight, and he\u2019s counting on me to make sure everything is spotless and welcoming. I promised I\u2019d handle the kitchen and living room before my shift at the store, but time slipped away as I scrubbed and organized. Now, at work, I\u2019m behind on my chores and can\u2019t stop thinking about the mess waiting for me at home. \n\nA customer approaches my register, holding a blender and no receipt. She insists she bought it here last week, but the store\u2019s policy is clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expects me to enforce the rules, but the woman looks desperate, pleading for an exception. I feel the pressure mounting: at home, I\u2019m expected to be a supportive wife, making our place shine for family; here, I\u2019m expected to be a diligent cashier, upholding company policy. My mind races, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibilities waiting for me at home, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll let down first."}
