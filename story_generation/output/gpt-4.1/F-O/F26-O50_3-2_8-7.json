My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: my grandson was struggling, and she needed me to talk to him. As a grandparent, I knew how important it was to be there, to offer comfort and wisdom, especially now when the family was facing a storm. But just as I reached for my phone, the operator from the floor appeared at my door, frustration etched on his face. He\u2019d been adjusting the press settings again, and the waste bin overflowed with ruined parts. He needed my guidance\u2014right now\u2014before the next batch was lost. I could see the expectation in his eyes, the silent plea for help. My heart tugged in two directions: toward my family, who needed my support, and toward my responsibility here, where my expertise could prevent costly mistakes. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being needed in two places at once, unsure which call to answer first."}
