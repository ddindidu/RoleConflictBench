We needed to talk about the hospital bills piling up, about how we\u2019d manage if my hours got cut again. She wanted me to be open, to share every worry and plan, to face this together. I owed her that. My phone buzzed\u2014work. I\u2019d just started my shift, and the foreman\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cThere\u2019s a spill in the main walkway. Someone needs to clean it up now before someone gets hurt.\u201d I was the closest. Safety was my responsibility, and I knew how quickly a small spill could turn into a disaster. But my wife\u2019s hand was on mine, waiting for answers, for trust. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding my honesty and presence, the other my vigilance and action. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
