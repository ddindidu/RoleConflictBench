My stepson darted between the supermarket aisles, laughter echoing as he narrowly missed colliding with a display of cereal boxes. I knew I should step in, guide him, remind him about respect and self-control\u2014values I promised myself I\u2019d teach him as his step-parent. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from the clinic: a patient with strep throat was waiting, and I was already running late. As a doctor, I owed my patient careful attention, the right diagnosis, and the right prescription. My mind raced with the expectations of both worlds\u2014should I kneel down and talk to my stepson about his behavior, risking being late for my patient, or rush him along, sacrificing a teachable moment for the sake of my professional duty? My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the two people who needed me in completely different ways."}
