It was my mother, her voice trembling as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare last night. She needed me\u2014her son\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be present. I could hear the fear in her words, the way she paused, waiting for me to say something comforting. But just as I opened my mouth, my radio crackled to life: \u201cOperator, emergency alarm activated in car three. Possible medical emergency. Please respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. I was needed on the train, responsible for the safety of dozens of passengers. I glanced at my phone, my mother\u2019s voice still in my ear, desperate for support. At the same time, the weight of my duty as a subway operator pressed down on me. I felt torn in two, caught between the son my parents needed and the operator my passengers depended on, each role demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
