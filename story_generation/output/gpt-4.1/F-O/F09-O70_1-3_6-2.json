{"Code1": "F09", "Role1": "mother", "Expectation_No1": 6, "Expectation1": "Ensuring financial stability for the family", "Obligation1": 1, "Situation1": "The child has been promised a Nintendo, and the mother should purchase it", "Code2": "O70", "Role2": "delivery person", "Expectation_No2": 2, "Expectation2": "Deliver packages on time and to the correct address", "Obligation2": 3, "Situation2": "A medical supply delivery must reach a hospital department on schedule to ensure patient care", "Story": "I glance at the clock on my dashboard, my heart pounding. My shift as a delivery driver is almost over, but I have one last package\u2014a box of medical supplies that must reach the hospital\u2019s emergency department within the next thirty minutes. The dispatcher\u2019s voice still echoes in my mind: \u201cThis one\u2019s urgent. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d I know what\u2019s at stake if I fail.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a message from my son: \u201cMom, are you getting the Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I remember his hopeful eyes this morning, and the guilt twists in my stomach. I\u2019ve been saving for weeks, pinching every penny from my paychecks, determined to keep my promise and give him something special. He\u2019s been waiting so patiently.\n\nI grip the steering wheel, torn. If I stop at the store now, I can buy the Nintendo before they close, but I\u2019ll risk being late with the delivery. If I go straight to the hospital, I\u2019ll keep my job secure and help someone in need, but I\u2019ll break my son\u2019s heart. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t escape the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
