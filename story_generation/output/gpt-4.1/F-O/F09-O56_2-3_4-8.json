I know I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why running indoors isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014teaches discipline, sets boundaries, and models patience. But my phone buzzes in my pocket: a reminder that my next client is due in twenty minutes. I picture her hair, thick with product, the kind that clings and knots, impossible to cut until it\u2019s washed and conditioned thoroughly. She expects me to be on time, to work my hands gently through the tangles, to make her feel cared for and beautiful. My heart pounds as I glance from my son\u2019s retreating figure to the checkout line. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my child\u2019s need for guidance, my client\u2019s need for my skill and attention. I can\u2019t be late, but I can\u2019t ignore my son\u2019s behavior either. My mind races, torn between the mother I want to be and the professional I\u2019m expected to be, caught in the impossible space between."}
