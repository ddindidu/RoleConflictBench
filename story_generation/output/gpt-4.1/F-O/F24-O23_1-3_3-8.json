My stepmother chimed in, asking if I could clear my schedule for Saturday. I wanted to say yes, to be present, to show I cared about this new family I was still learning to belong to. But my phone buzzed with a message from opposing counsel, demanding a call. The case I was working on was high-stakes, and the other lawyer was relentless, hinting that if I just shared a bit more about my client\u2019s strategy, things could be \u201ceasier\u201d for everyone. I felt the weight of my oath as a lawyer\u2014confidentiality was non-negotiable, and my client\u2019s trust was sacred. Yet, as my family looked at me, waiting for an answer, I felt torn. They wanted me to be present, to join in, to be a real sibling. But my mind was tangled in legal obligations and the pressure to protect my client. I smiled weakly, caught between the warmth of family and the cold demands of my profession, unsure which part of myself I could let down."}
