The QA team had flagged a critical bug\u2014users were getting kicked out of the app at random, and the product manager\u2019s messages were piling up, each more urgent than the last. I scrolled through the error logs, mind racing with possible causes, barely noticing my brother skipping ahead. He was humming, lost in his own world, and before I realized, he was at the curb, about to step into the street. My heart lurched. I knew I should drop everything and grab him, make sure he looked both ways. But my mind was still tangled in code, replaying stack traces and user complaints. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my brother\u2019s safety in one hand, the company\u2019s trust in the other. I stood frozen, torn between shouting his name and diving back into the bug that couldn\u2019t wait."}
