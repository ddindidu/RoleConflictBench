My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, always greet elders with a bow and use our family\u2019s respectful phrases.\u201d Lately, my family had been reminding me how important it was to keep our traditions alive, especially when meeting new people. But as a delivery person, I was trained to be brief, polite, and professional\u2014no time for elaborate greetings or personal touches, just a quick \u201cGood afternoon, here\u2019s your package.\u201d\n\nThe door opened, and an elderly woman smiled at me. My mind raced. Should I bow and use the traditional greeting, risking confusion or seeming unprofessional? Or should I stick to the company script, possibly disappointing my family if they ever found out? My heart pounded as I tried to balance the weight of my family\u2019s expectations with the demands of my job, feeling the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
