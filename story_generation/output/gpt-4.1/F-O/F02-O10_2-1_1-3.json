My daughter\u2019s open class was scheduled for Thursday afternoon\u2014her first one since starting third grade. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class presentation and asking if I\u2019d be there. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Dad?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her eyes wide with hope. I promised I would.\n\nBut just this morning, my manager sent an urgent email: a seminar on upcoming tax law changes was scheduled for the exact same afternoon. Attendance was strongly encouraged, especially for those of us handling compliance. Missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates, risking mistakes that could cost the firm dearly. I could already imagine the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s face if I didn\u2019t show up, and the subtle disapproval from my boss if I skipped the seminar. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between being the father my daughter needed and the accountant my company relied on."}
