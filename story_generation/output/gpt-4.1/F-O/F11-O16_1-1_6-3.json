Please come!\u201d I smiled, remembering our promise to include each other in plans, to keep our bond strong. But as I greeted my patient, Mrs. Lee, I saw the worry in her eyes. She had a list of questions about her health, and I knew she needed my full attention and empathy. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014my sister\u2019s hope for togetherness, and my patient\u2019s need for reassurance. I felt the weight of both expectations: to be the supportive sister who shows up, and the compassionate doctor who listens. My heart ached as I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s concerns, all the while feeling the pull of my sister\u2019s invitation and the fear of letting her down."}
