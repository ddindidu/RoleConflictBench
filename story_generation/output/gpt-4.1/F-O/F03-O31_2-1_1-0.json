It was Saturday night, the time I usually called my parents. I could already imagine my mother waiting by the phone, expecting to hear about my week, wanting to know I was safe. But tonight, I was responding to a noise complaint\u2014a rowdy party spilling into the street, neighbors glaring from their windows. As a police officer, I was expected to handle the situation firmly, enforce the law, and restore peace. But as a son, I felt the weight of my parents\u2019 expectations, the guilt of missing our weekly call, the worry that they\u2019d think I was neglecting them. My radio crackled with updates, and the party\u2019s music thumped in the background. I stared at my phone, torn between duty and family, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing my chest. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the decision I made next would disappoint someone I cared about."}
