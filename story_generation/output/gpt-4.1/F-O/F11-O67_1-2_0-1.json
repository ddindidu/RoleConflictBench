He\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss this moment for anything. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014dispatch was calling. There was a patient with a broken bone just a few miles away, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. I could already picture the pain and fear on the patient\u2019s face, the expectation that help would arrive quickly. My brother caught my eye, his smile faltering as he saw my expression change. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the sister who should be here, celebrating, and the ambulance driver who should be out there, saving someone from suffering. The voices around me faded as I stood frozen, torn between the family I loved and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold."}
