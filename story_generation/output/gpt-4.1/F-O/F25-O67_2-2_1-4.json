It was Sunday evening\u2014my stepdad\u2019s name flashed on the screen, right on schedule. Every week, I called to check in, to reassure him and Mom that I was okay, to hear about their garden and the neighbor\u2019s new dog. They expected it, and I knew how much it meant, especially since I\u2019d moved out. But tonight, the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cElderly woman, possible broken arm, pain level high.\u201d My partner was already grabbing the stretcher. I could hear a woman\u2019s cries through the open door. My hands shook as I silenced the call, guilt prickling at my skin. I was supposed to be there for my family, to show I cared, but right now, someone else needed me\u2014needed me to be calm, focused, and quick. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest as I hesitated, torn between the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices and the urgent responsibility waiting just a few steps away."}
