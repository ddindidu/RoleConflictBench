His text was frantic: \u201cCan you come over? I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d I knew how much this final meant to him, how hard he\u2019d worked, and how much he needed someone to calm him down. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay.\n\nBut I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat, chatting idly about the weather. She was heading to a coffee shop for a meeting, not in any rush, but I had a route to follow, a schedule to keep. My job demanded I drive safely, get her there on time, and be polite, focused, professional.\n\nMy mind raced. If I took a detour to drop her off early, I\u2019d be breaking protocol. If I ignored my brother\u2019s plea, I\u2019d be letting him down when he needed me most. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my passenger. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding choices I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
