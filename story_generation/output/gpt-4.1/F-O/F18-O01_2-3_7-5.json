My younger brother, helmet askew, eyed the steep, cracked ramp with a wild grin. \u201cWatch this!\u201d he called, clutching his skateboard. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, but he craved my encouragement, my trust in his abilities. At the same time, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the hospital project team. The new wing\u2019s design was under review, and I needed to ensure every corridor and operating room was perfectly placed\u2014lives would depend on it. My heart pounded as I watched my brother position himself at the top of the ramp, while my mind raced through emergency routes and sterile zones. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. Should I rush to stop him, or answer the call and focus on the hospital\u2019s safety? The demands of being a good sibling and a dedicated architect collided, leaving me frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
