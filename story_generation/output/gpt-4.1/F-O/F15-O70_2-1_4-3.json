She darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls to stay close. I knew I should stop her, kneel down, and explain why running in public places isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014teaches discipline, sets boundaries, models the right behavior. But just as I reached for her, my phone buzzed with a notification: a customer\u2019s package needed to be delivered within the next thirty minutes, and the address was on my route home. The app reminded me to ensure the package was left securely, with a photo for proof, or risk a complaint. My mind raced. If I left the store now, I could make the delivery on time, but I\u2019d be letting my daughter\u2019s wild behavior slide. If I stayed to correct her, I might miss the delivery window and face a penalty. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
