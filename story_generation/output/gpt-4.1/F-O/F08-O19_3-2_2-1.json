It was a message from my granddaughter, Emma: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. Emma never reached out like this unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014there was a line of patients waiting, and Mr. Lee\u2019s medications required my full attention. One mistake could be dangerous for him. But the thought of Emma, maybe crying or lost, needing my wisdom and comfort, pulled at me. I could almost hear her voice, small and uncertain, asking for guidance only a grandmother could give. Yet, as a pharmacist, I knew I couldn\u2019t let my focus slip, not even for a moment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. My hands hovered over the pills, my phone vibrating again, and I felt torn in two, caught between the needs of my family and the responsibilities of my profession."}
