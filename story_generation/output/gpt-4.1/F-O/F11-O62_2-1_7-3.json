He was clearly upset, his face flushed from an argument with our parents. As his sister, I knew he needed someone to listen, to be patient and understanding, especially since he always felt misunderstood at home. I wanted to give him my full attention, to show him the respect he deserved by hearing him out.\n\nBut as a lifeguard, I was also responsible for keeping the pool area safe and orderly. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a few pool chairs left askew by the last group of swimmers. They weren\u2019t a hazard, but I knew my supervisor expected everything to be perfectly aligned. If I didn\u2019t fix them soon, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking a reprimand.\n\nEthan started talking, his voice low and uncertain. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on him, offering the patience and understanding he needed from his sister, or should I step away to realign the chairs, fulfilling my duty as a lifeguard? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the two roles."}
