My client\u2019s email was clear: \u201cPlease review the liability clauses by tonight.\u201d I knew the stakes\u2014missing a loophole could cost them millions.

He\u2019d been struggling with table manners, and I\u2019d promised myself to be patient, to teach him gently, not just scold. He needed my attention, my guidance, right now.
