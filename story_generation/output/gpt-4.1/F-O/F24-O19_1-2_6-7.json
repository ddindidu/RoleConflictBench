Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s younger and still learning the ropes of our blended family. I keep an eye on the traffic, making sure he doesn\u2019t dart across the street without looking. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder about the pharmacy workshop tonight, the one on new prescription guidelines. My manager expects me to attend, to stay sharp and up-to-date for our patients\u2019 safety. \n\nSam tugs at my sleeve, asking if we can stop for ice cream. I glance at the time, feeling the pressure mount. If I take him home first, I\u2019ll be late for the workshop. If I rush him, I\u2019ll break the promise I made to always be there for him. My mind races, torn between the duty to my profession and the responsibility I feel as his step-sibling. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the knot of anxiety tightening in my chest as I try to figure out what to do next."}
