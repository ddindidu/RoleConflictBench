My spouse\u2019s voice echoes from the living room, reminding me that the relatives will arrive in a few hours and the house still looks like a whirlwind passed through. I promised I\u2019d help\u2014scrub the bathroom, vacuum, set the table. But my shift as a telemarketer just started, and the phone is already ringing. \n\nOn the line, a customer bombards me with technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely covers. My supervisor expects me to keep the call going, handle every objection, and not let a single prospect slip away. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My spouse expects me to be present, to share the load, to not leave everything until the last minute. My manager expects me to be focused, persuasive, and available. \n\nI feel my chest tighten as I try to listen to the customer and mentally plan which chores I can squeeze in between calls. Both worlds tug at me, demanding more than I can give at once."}
