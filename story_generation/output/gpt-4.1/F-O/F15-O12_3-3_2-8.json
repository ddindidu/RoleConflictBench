The first is an email from my child\u2019s school: my son was caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wants to meet with me today. The second is a Slack message from my manager\u2014our production system is down, and the outage is traced to a bug in my code. Customers are locked out, and the team is scrambling for a fix. I stare at my screen, heart pounding. My son needs me to show up, to listen, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. But my team is counting on me too; the company\u2019s reputation and our users\u2019 trust are on the line.

My mind races, torn between the urgent needs of my child and the crisis at work, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
