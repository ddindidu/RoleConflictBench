The living room still needed vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror was streaked with toothpaste. As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew the expectation was to keep every corner spotless, to make the house shine even if it meant picking up after everyone else. But just as I reached for the mop, I heard my son\u2019s voice from the hallway. He was arguing with his sister, voices rising, toys scattered everywhere. I remembered my promise to teach them about sharing and respect, to guide them through these little conflicts and help them grow into kind, disciplined people. Yet, the mess around them gnawed at me\u2014should I stop and teach them to clean up after themselves, reinforcing responsibility, or should I quickly tidy up myself to meet the standards of cleanliness expected of me? My heart tugged in both directions, torn between being the patient mother and the efficient cleaner, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in as I stood frozen, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
