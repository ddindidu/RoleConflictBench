As a police officer, I was expected to keep the peace, to step in and enforce the law if things got out of hand. My radio crackled with updates, and I could hear the rising shouts from the crowd as I approached. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my mom. She rarely called during the day unless something was wrong. I hesitated, torn. As a daughter, I was supposed to check in, to be there for my parents, especially since Dad\u2019s health had been shaky lately. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s voice, needing reassurance, needing me. But the protest was escalating, and my team was counting on me to help manage the chaos.
