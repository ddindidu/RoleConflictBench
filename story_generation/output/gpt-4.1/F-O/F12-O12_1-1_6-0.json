He asks, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and I know he wants more than just a one-word answer. He wants me to open up, to share the little frustrations and victories, to let him in. But my mind is still tangled in lines of code from work. I\u2019m a software developer, and today I finished a tricky module. The deadline is generous, so I could have left it as is, but I kept thinking about how I could refactor it, make it cleaner, more efficient. The expectation at work is clear: write code that others can understand and maintain. But here, at home, the expectation is different\u2014communicate, be present, share. I want to tell him about the bug I squashed, the satisfaction of seeing my code run perfectly, but I worry it will sound boring or distant. I feel the pull from both sides, the need to be a good wife and a good developer, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unsure which part of me to give voice to tonight."}
