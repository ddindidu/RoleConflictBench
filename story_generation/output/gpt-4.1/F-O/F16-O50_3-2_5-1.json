My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, \u201cCan you help me move the sofa? The guests will be here in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. The house was still a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry unfolded, and the guest room needed fresh sheets. I knew how much it meant to my spouse that everything looked perfect for the relatives\u2019 visit.\n\nBut then, another call came in\u2014this time from the factory. The supervisor\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cThe main production unit is down again. We\u2019re losing time. Can you come in right away?\u201d I could picture the blinking red lights, the frustrated operators, and the mounting costs with every minute the line stayed silent. They needed me to diagnose the sensor errors, to get things running before the backlog became unmanageable.\n\nI stood in the hallway, mop in one hand, phone in the other, heart pounding. Both worlds demanded all of me, right now. I felt torn, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
