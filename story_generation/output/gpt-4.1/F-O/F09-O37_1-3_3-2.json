The checklist from my supervisor echoed in my mind: every corner spotless, every surface sanitized. I had only an hour left before the inspection, and the kitchen still needed mopping. Just then, I heard a crash from the living room. My son had spilled his juice all over the carpet, and I saw him freeze, eyes wide, waiting for my reaction. I knew this was a moment to teach him about responsibility, to guide him through cleaning up his own mess and learning from it. But the pressure of my cleaning job pressed down on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. My heart pounded as I stood between the mop and my son, torn between being the patient mother he needed and the diligent cleaner my job demanded."}
