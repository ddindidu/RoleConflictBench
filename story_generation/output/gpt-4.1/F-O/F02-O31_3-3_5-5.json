My heart sank as I saw the half-eaten candy bar in his pocket. As a father, I knew this was a moment to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him gently but firmly. I knelt down, ready to talk to him about right and wrong, about trust and respect. But then, my police radio crackled to life\u2014a violent assault was happening just outside, and people were screaming for help. My training kicked in; I was needed to protect lives, to stop someone from getting hurt. I looked at my son, his eyes wide with fear and confusion, and then at the door where chaos waited. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me\u2014one as a father, the other as a police officer. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
