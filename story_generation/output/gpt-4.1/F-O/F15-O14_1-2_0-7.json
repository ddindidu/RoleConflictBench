My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school\u2014last day!\u201d I picture their eager faces, waiting for me at the gate, backpacks slung over their shoulders, eyes scanning the crowd for a familiar face. I promised I\u2019d be there, just like I promised last year and the year before. But as I turn back to the lab bench, my stomach knots. The safety audit is in less than an hour, and the autoclave\u2019s pressure gauge is still acting up. If I leave now, I risk failing the audit, letting down my team, and possibly jeopardizing our research schedule. If I stay, I\u2019ll break my promise to my kids, missing a moment they\u2019ll remember. The weight of both worlds presses on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I stand frozen, keys in one hand, lab checklist in the other, torn between the people who need me and the work that defines me."}
