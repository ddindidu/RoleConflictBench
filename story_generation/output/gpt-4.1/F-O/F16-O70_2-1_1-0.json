It was my partner, voice trembling, asking if I could talk. They\u2019d just gotten news about a possible promotion, but it meant moving to a new department with a boss they didn\u2019t trust. I could hear the anxiety in their words, the way they needed me to listen, to reassure them, to help them sort through the mess of feelings. But as I glanced at the package in my hand, I saw the address was across town, and the customer had already called once, worried about the delay. My supervisor had reminded me this morning: \u201cNo late deliveries, not even by an hour.\u201d I felt the weight of the box and the weight of my partner\u2019s need pressing down on me at the same time. I wanted to be there for them, to give them my full attention, but I also knew that if I didn\u2019t get this package delivered soon, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking my job. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between the person I love and the job that keeps us afloat."}
