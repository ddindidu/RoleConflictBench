It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My mind raced with worry, but just then, the foreman walked by, reminding everyone about the optional safety training next week. \u201cIt\u2019ll look good if you show up,\u201d he said, glancing at me. I knew what he meant\u2014being seen as reliable could mean more hours, maybe even a shot at team lead.\n\nBut my sister\u2019s message weighed on me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. I could almost hear her voice, shaky and uncertain, needing her brother. At the same time, I felt the eyes of my coworkers, the silent expectation to be part of the team, to show commitment.
