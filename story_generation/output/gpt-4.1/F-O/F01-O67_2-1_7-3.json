It was a routine I took seriously\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen. It was a message from my granddaughter, Sarah. She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her first-day excitement. My daughter had already called earlier, reminding me how important it was to keep in touch, to be present for these moments. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDad, it means a lot to Sarah when you respond right away.\u201d\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I noticed a missing vial of epinephrine in the kit. My mind raced\u2014protocol demanded I report and replace it immediately. Every second spent texting was a second not spent ensuring the ambulance was ready for the next emergency.
