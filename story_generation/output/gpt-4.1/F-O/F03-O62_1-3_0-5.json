Call us when you can.\u201d I hadn\u2019t checked in with my parents all week, and guilt pricked at me. I knew they worried if I went too long without a message. I started typing a reply, but just then, I heard the pool\u2019s filtration system sputter and groan. I went to check and realized the filter wasn\u2019t working\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it right away, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. My supervisor always emphasized that equipment maintenance was a top priority, and I could already picture the disappointed faces of the morning swim team if the pool had to close. My phone buzzed again in my hand, another message from Mom. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me: the son who should call home, and the lifeguard responsible for everyone\u2019s safety."}
