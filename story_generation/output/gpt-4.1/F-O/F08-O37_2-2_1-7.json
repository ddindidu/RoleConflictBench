My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways wear gloves, always mask up, no exceptions.\u201d I glanced down at my hands, raw from constant scrubbing, and felt the weight of the rules pressing on me. Just then, I heard a soft sniffle from the living room. My granddaughter sat curled on the couch, her eyes red and distant. I knew that look\u2014she needed me, not just as someone who cleaned, but as her grandmother, the one who listened and offered comfort. My heart ached to sit beside her, to hold her hand and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But I was still in my work clothes, gloves on, mask tight, and the protocols were clear: no cross-contamination, no exceptions. I hesitated in the doorway, torn between the urge to comfort her and the responsibility to keep her safe. The two parts of me\u2014grandmother and cleaner\u2014pulled in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, unsure which role to answer first."}
