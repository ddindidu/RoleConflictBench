The trial had been long and complex, and the parties were waiting anxiously for my decision. I knew the law required me to be thorough, to write a clear and detailed opinion that would stand up to scrutiny. The deadline loomed, and I could already feel the pressure building in my chest.\n\nAcross from me, my partner paced the floor, phone in hand, eyes red from stress. They had just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating\u2014leaving behind friends, family, and everything familiar. They looked at me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of support I always tried to give. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d they asked, voice trembling.\n\nI wanted to be present, to listen, to help them weigh their options. But my mind kept drifting back to the judgment, the legal arguments, the responsibility I carried. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who needed me most. My heart ached with the weight of their expectations, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
