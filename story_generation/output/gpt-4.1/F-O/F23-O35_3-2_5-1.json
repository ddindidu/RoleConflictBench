Just an hour ago, I\u2019d caught my stepson slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the corner store. The store manager had looked at me, waiting for me to do the right thing, and my stepson\u2019s eyes were wide with fear and shame. I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, but I also didn\u2019t want to crush his trust in me. Now, as the subway rumbled through the tunnel, a signal delay flashed on my panel. I needed to adjust the speed carefully\u2014too fast, and I\u2019d risk passenger safety; too slow, and I\u2019d throw off the whole schedule. My mind kept drifting back to my stepson, wondering what I should say to him, how to balance discipline with compassion. But the train demanded my full attention, and the weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expecting me to do the right thing, right now."}
