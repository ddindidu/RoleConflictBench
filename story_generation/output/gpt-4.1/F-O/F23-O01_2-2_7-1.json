The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014rent, groceries, her school trip next month. I needed to make sure we had enough, to keep things steady for her and my partner. My phone buzzed with an email from the site manager: the contractor was pushing to move forward, but I\u2019d flagged a load-bearing wall that didn\u2019t meet code. If I insisted on halting the project for corrections, it would mean delays, angry clients, and possibly losing the bonus I was counting on to cover our expenses. But if I let it slide, I\u2019d be risking safety\u2014something I\u2019d sworn never to compromise as an architect. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the responsibility I owed to the people who would live and work in that building. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
