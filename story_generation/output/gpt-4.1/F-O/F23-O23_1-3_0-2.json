It\u2019s 2:45 p.m.\u2014fifteen minutes until the final bell rings at the kids\u2019 school. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up Emma and Josh.\u201d I promised them I\u2019d be there today, the last day before summer break, and Emma\u2019s been talking about it all week. But my desk is covered in papers, and the merger contract I\u2019m reviewing is a minefield. Buried in the fine print are clauses that could cost my client millions if I don\u2019t catch them before the deal closes this afternoon. My managing partner expects a full analysis within the hour. I can\u2019t let my client down, not with so much at stake. But I can\u2019t let the kids down either\u2014not again. My mind races, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the hopeful faces waiting for me at school. I grip my pen, paralyzed, as the minutes slip away."}
