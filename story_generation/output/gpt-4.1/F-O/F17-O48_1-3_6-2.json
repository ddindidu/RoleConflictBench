Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d My chest tightens. I know what she wants\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to check in on Dad and make sure everything\u2019s okay at home. I want to be there for them, to ask if they\u2019re really alright, to offer comfort. But just as I\u2019m about to call, I hear Mr. Jenkins, my patient, groan in pain. He\u2019s struggling to lift his spoon, his hands trembling. He looks at me, eyes pleading for help. I\u2019m supposed to be present, attentive, helping him eat, easing his discomfort. My mind races\u2014my parents need me, but so does Mr. Jenkins. I feel pulled in two directions, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turn. I stand frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the family who raised me and the patient who depends on me right now."}
