My phone buzzed with another message from my project manager, reminding me of the looming deadline for the prototype. The pressure to deliver a flawless design weighed heavily on my mind; the entire team was counting on me to pull through so we could move forward. Yet, just as I was about to dive into another round of calculations, my mother called from the living room, her voice gentle but insistent. She reminded me that tonight was the annual family gathering\u2014a tradition my grandparents started decades ago, one my parents now expected me to uphold. I could hear the expectation in her tone, the unspoken plea not to let work overshadow family values. My heart twisted as I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I found myself paralyzed, unable to choose which expectation to meet."}
