My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the hallway, reminding me that his parents will arrive in a few hours. The house needs to be spotless, the guest room made up, and dinner prepped. I nod, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a wife, I want to share these responsibilities, to make our home welcoming and show I care.\n\nBut my mind keeps drifting to the code I left unfinished. There\u2019s a module I could refactor now, making it cleaner and easier to maintain. The deadline isn\u2019t pressing, but I know if I leave it, the mess will grow, and future me will curse today\u2019s shortcuts. I want to be the developer who takes pride in her work, who doesn\u2019t just patch things up for later.\n\nI glance between the mop and my laptop, heart pounding. Both roles tug at me, each demanding my best. I feel the tension rising, the sense that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone\u2014maybe myself\u2014down."}
