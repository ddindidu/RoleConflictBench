My daughter had asked me to stay for dinner, to be present, to listen and celebrate these small but important moments. I wanted nothing more than to be the attentive grandfather they expected, to laugh and clap and make my granddaughter feel special.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently. It was the plant manager\u2014again. The new operator was making mistakes, adjusting the machine settings without understanding the process, and the material waste was piling up. They needed me to guide him, to prevent further loss, to be the reliable expert they counted on. I could hear the frustration in the manager\u2019s voice, the urgency in his words.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, then at my phone, my mind pulled in two directions. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being needed in two places at once, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both."}
