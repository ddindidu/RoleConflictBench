Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I stare at the screen, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I know he and Mom expect me to check in, to show I care, especially since I moved out. But my laptop is open, IDE glowing, and my Slack is blowing up. The production service is lagging, and the logs point straight to the functions I merged on Friday. My team lead is pinging me, asking for a hotfix\u2014now. I\u2019m supposed to be the reliable one, the developer who writes code others can trust. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between typing a reassuring message to my parents and diving into the code to fix my mistake. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I do next, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
