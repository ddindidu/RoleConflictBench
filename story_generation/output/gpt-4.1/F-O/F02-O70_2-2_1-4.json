My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in twenty minutes, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play. She\u2019d asked me, \u201cDaddy, will you be there?\u201d and I\u2019d promised, \u201cOf course.\u201d But now, my phone buzzed with a new delivery assignment\u2014an urgent one, a moderately valuable package that required a signature. The address was across town, and the customer had already called twice, anxious to receive it before noon. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo missed signatures, no exceptions.\u201d I could picture my daughter scanning the classroom, searching for my face, and the customer waiting at their door, checking the time. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I sat at a red light, torn between the two worlds that needed me at the same moment."}
