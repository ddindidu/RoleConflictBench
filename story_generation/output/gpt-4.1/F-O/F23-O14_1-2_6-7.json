The safety audit was in two days, and the list of flagged equipment issues was longer than I\u2019d hoped. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to make sure everything was up to code\u2014one missed detail could mean a shutdown, or worse, someone getting hurt. I started calculating the cost of the repairs, already knowing it would eat into my personal funds. \n\nJust then, my stepson burst into the room, eyes shining. \u201cDid you get the Nintendo yet? You promised!\u201d His birthday was coming up, and I\u2019d assured him I\u2019d make it special. He\u2019d been through so much with the divorce and moving in with me. I wanted to keep my promise, to show him he mattered. But the price tag of the console echoed in my mind, clashing with the urgent need to fix the lab equipment. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to keep my family happy and secure, and my obligation to keep my lab safe and running. I sat at my desk, torn, the two demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
