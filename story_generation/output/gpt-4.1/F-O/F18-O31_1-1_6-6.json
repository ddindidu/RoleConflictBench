We laughed about our day, but my mind was half on the patrol car parked a block ahead. I was off-duty, but my uniform still carried weight. As we neared, I noticed a car parked in a no-parking zone, hazard lights blinking. My brother nudged me, whispering that it belonged to his friend\u2019s mom, who\u2019d run inside to grab her sick child. He pleaded with me, \u201cCan\u2019t you just let it go this time? She\u2019s only there for a minute.\u201d\n\nAs a sibling, I wanted to protect my brother\u2019s world, to show him I cared about the people he cared about. But as a police officer, I was expected to uphold the law impartially, to act with integrity even when it was inconvenient. My brother\u2019s eyes searched mine, full of hope and trust, while my training echoed in my mind, reminding me of fairness and responsibility. I stood there, torn between the warmth of family loyalty and the cold clarity of duty, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
