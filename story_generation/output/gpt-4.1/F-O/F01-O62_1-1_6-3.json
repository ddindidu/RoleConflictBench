The kids miss you.\u201d I promised I\u2019d call my grandson that evening, maybe even set up a video chat so he could show me his latest drawing. But as I hung up, I glanced around the pool deck. A few chairs were out of place, not dangerous, but not up to standard either. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe expect everything to be perfect, especially before the weekend rush.\u201d I knew I should realign the chairs, check the bolts, make sure nothing would cause a problem. Yet, my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder to call my grandson before his bedtime. I felt the tug in both directions: the duty to my family, the responsibility to my job. My heart ached with the pressure, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
