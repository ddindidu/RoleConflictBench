Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter and smell the food already, the warmth of being together after a long week. As a sister, I knew how much these dinners meant to my family, especially to my mother, who always insisted we all be present, no matter how busy we were.\n\nBut on my desk, the latest issue of the law review journal sat unopened, its crisp pages promising insights into new legal theories that could shape my next case. As a judge, I was expected to stay ahead, to be informed and prepared, to never let my knowledge lag behind. The pressure to maintain my professional reputation was relentless.\n\nI stared at the journal, then at my phone, torn between the comfort of family and the demands of my career. My heart ached with the knowledge that whichever choice I made, I would be letting someone down\u2014either my family or myself."}
