The line stretches down the aisle, and I can feel the impatience of customers behind each beep of the register. My manager expects speed and accuracy, and I know mistakes will only slow things down more. In the middle of this, my daughter appears at the end of my lane, her face tight with worry, and my grandson clings to her side. He looks up at me, eyes rimmed red, and I can tell something is weighing on him. As a grandmother, I want nothing more than to step away, kneel down, and offer the comfort and wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over the years. But the line grows longer, and the customers\u2019 sighs grow louder. My heart aches with the urge to be there for him, to guide him through whatever storm he\u2019s facing, but my hands are tied to the register, and my mind is pulled in two directions, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family."}
