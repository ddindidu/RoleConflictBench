My parents had called earlier, reminding me how important it was to be there\u2014especially this year, with my grandmother\u2019s health declining. They spoke of tradition, of the meal we always shared, and how my presence would mean everything. I promised I\u2019d make it, but as I glanced at the radio, I knew any moment it could crackle to life with an emergency call. My duty as an ambulance driver was clear: when the call came, I had to go, no matter what. The weight of both roles pressed on me. My family expected me to honor our customs, to be the devoted son, while my job demanded I be ready to save lives at a moment\u2019s notice. I felt torn, anxiety twisting in my chest, knowing that soon I might have to choose between the people I love and the people who might need me most."}
