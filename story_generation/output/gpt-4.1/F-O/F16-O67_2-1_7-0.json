They looked tired, eyes darting away when I tried to meet their gaze. I knew something was wrong, and as a partner, I was supposed to be there\u2014listen, share, and support. I reached out, gently asking what was on their mind, and finally, they began to open up about the stress at work and worries about our future. My heart ached, wanting to give them my full attention, to reassure them that I was here, that we could face anything together. But my radio crackled on the counter, a sharp reminder that I was still on call. Any second, a dispatch could come through, demanding I drop everything and race to someone else\u2019s crisis. I tried to focus on my spouse\u2019s words, but my mind kept flickering to the possibility of the alarm sounding. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my partner and the duty to strangers in need, both expecting me to be present, both needing me now."}
