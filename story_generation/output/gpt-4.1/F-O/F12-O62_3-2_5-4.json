The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry half-folded, and the guest room still needed fresh sheets. He looked at me with that hopeful, expectant smile, silently asking for help to make everything perfect before our relatives arrived. I promised I\u2019d be back in time to help, then rushed off to my shift at the pool.\n\nAs soon as I got there, I noticed the broken lane rope floating in the water. Swim lessons were scheduled in less than an hour, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the whole session would be thrown into chaos. My supervisor\u2019s text was clear: \u201cPlease make sure all equipment is ready before lessons start.\u201d I stared at the rope, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My mind raced\u2014should I stay and fix the rope, risking being late to help at home, or leave it for someone else and disappoint my team? My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between the two places I was needed most."}
