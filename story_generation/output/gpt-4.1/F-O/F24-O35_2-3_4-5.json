My stepmom had made it clear\u2014being there mattered, especially since I\u2019d missed the last one. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me that family is built by showing up. I promised I\u2019d make it, even if it meant rushing from my shift as a subway operator.\n\nBut as the train rattled through the tunnel, the emergency alarm blared. My heart jumped. The intercom crackled with a passenger\u2019s panicked voice\u2014someone had collapsed in the next car. Instantly, my training kicked in: I had to stop the train, alert emergency services, and check on the passenger. Every second counted for their safety. I could feel the weight of dozens of eyes on me, expecting calm and decisive action.\n\nYet, in the back of my mind, I pictured my family waiting at the table, my empty chair a silent disappointment.
