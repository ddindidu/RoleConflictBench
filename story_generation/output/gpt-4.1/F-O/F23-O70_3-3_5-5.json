Just an hour ago, I\u2019d caught my stepson, Jamie, slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the grocery store. My heart had sunk. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that honesty matters, even when it\u2019s hard. But Jamie\u2019s wide, anxious eyes made me hesitate\u2014he\u2019d only been living with me for a year, and I worried about pushing him away if I came down too hard.\n\nNow, as I grabbed the high-value package from the van, my phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cWe need to talk about Jamie.\u201d I was supposed to hand-deliver this package, check the recipient\u2019s ID, and get a signature\u2014no mistakes allowed. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. I couldn\u2019t let my work slip, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore what happened with Jamie. The pressure built in my chest, torn between the responsibility to my job and the responsibility to my family, both demanding my full attention at the same time."}
