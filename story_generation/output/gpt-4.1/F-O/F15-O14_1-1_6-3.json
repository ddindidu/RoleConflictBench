She\u2019d been saving up for months, and I\u2019d promised her that today, after work, we\u2019d finally buy the Nintendo she\u2019d been dreaming of. But as I glanced at the spreadsheet on my screen, I saw the numbers from my latest experiment\u2014results that needed to be logged and analyzed. The data wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew how easy it was to forget details if I put it off. My supervisor expected meticulous records, and I prided myself on my accuracy. Yet, the cost of the Nintendo nagged at me; money was tight, and I worried about our budget. I wanted to keep my promise, to see her face light up, but I also felt the weight of responsibility\u2014to my family\u2019s finances, to my research, to my own standards. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up Nintendo.\u201d I stared at the screen, torn between the roles that defined me, feeling the pressure of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
