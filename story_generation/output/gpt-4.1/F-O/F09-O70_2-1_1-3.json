The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, waving and smiling. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, and I knew how much it meant to her. But as I pulled up to my next delivery stop, I saw the note: \u201cPlease ensure package is not left unattended. Call if no one is home.\u201d My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no exceptions, no shortcuts. If I left the package and it went missing, I\u2019d be held responsible. If I waited for the customer, I\u2019d miss the open class. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the school, and I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s hopeful voice. I stared at the package in my hands, torn between the trust my job demanded and the promise I\u2019d made as a mother, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
