My daughter\u2019s text buzzed in: \u201cDad, can you come over? Jamie wants to tell everyone her college news before school.\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s eager face, the way she\u2019d want her grandpa there, part of the moment.

Pre-dawn was usually calm\u2014no holding patterns, just a handful of flights, the kind of morning where I could almost hear my own heartbeat over the radio static.
