The kids need their uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d As a husband, I wanted to share the load, to be the partner she could rely on. But as I moved toward the washing machine, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my cleaning client. They needed their house spotless for a gathering tonight, and I\u2019d just realized I was out of the specialized wood cleaner they insisted on. I could picture their disappointment if the job wasn\u2019t perfect. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my family counting on clean clothes, my client counting on my professionalism. Both roles demanded my time, my attention, my care. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, laundry basket in the other, torn between the home I built and the work that helped sustain it, feeling the pressure of letting someone down no matter which way I turned."}
