My mom barely touched her coffee, her eyes distant. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to offer a hug, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted to sit down, ask what was wrong, and just be there for them. But my phone buzzed, and the message from work flashed on the screen: \u201cCritical bearing screeching\u2014possible breakdown. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t get to the shop soon, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company thousands.
