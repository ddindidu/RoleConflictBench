My mom\u2019s text blinked on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner starts at six. Grandma\u2019s expecting you to help with the prayers.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family traditions, especially during the holidays. I wanted to be there, to show respect, to be the son my family expected.\n\nBut as I rang the doorbell, the minutes ticked by. No answer. I called the customer, but it went to voicemail. Company policy was clear: I needed a signature for this delivery. If I left the package, I\u2019d be risking my job. If I waited, I\u2019d be late for dinner, letting my family down. My heart pounded as I stood on the porch, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
