As a lifeguard, my eyes swept the water, counting heads, scanning for raised hands or sudden splashes. Every second mattered. Then my phone buzzed in my bag. I glanced down: a text from my little sister. \u201cCan you call? I need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. As her sister, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to comfort her when she was hurting. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t look away from the water, not even for a minute. The expectation to protect every swimmer clashed with the urge to protect my sister. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest, my hands gripping the rescue tube tighter. I stared at the phone, then back at the waves, caught between two worlds, both needing me at the same time."}
