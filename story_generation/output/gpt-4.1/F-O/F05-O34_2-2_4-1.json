My wife\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, reminding me that the kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised her I\u2019d handle the laundry tonight, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to keep that promise. But as I reach for the basket, my phone buzzes\u2014dispatch is calling. There\u2019s a holiday travel surge, and the approach fixes are jammed with holding patterns. They need every available controller on deck to manage the congestion and keep the airspace safe. My mind races: if I leave now, the laundry won\u2019t get done, and I\u2019ll let my family down. If I stay, I\u2019ll be shirking my duty at the tower, risking delays and safety. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I stand frozen, torn between the demands of the skies and the needs of my home."}
