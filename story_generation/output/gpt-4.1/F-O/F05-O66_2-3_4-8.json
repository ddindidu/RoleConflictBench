My wife had reminded me this morning\u2014today was my turn to do the laundry, and the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow. I could almost hear her voice in my head, gentle but firm, asking me to share the load at home. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. A new ride request flashed on the screen, the app showing a passenger waiting just a few blocks away. The message was urgent: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late for an important meeting.\u201d As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable, never keeping a customer waiting. My hands hovered between the laundry basket and my car keys. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my family counting on me at home, a stranger counting on me for their day to go right. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my two worlds, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
