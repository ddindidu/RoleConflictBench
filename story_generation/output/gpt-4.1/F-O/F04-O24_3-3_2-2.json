It was my younger sister, her name lighting up the screen. She never called during work hours unless it was serious. I answered, and her voice trembled as she told me about a crisis\u2014her partner had left suddenly, and she was alone, scared, and needed me. My heart twisted; I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to listen, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But just then, my clerk knocked, handing me an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The law demanded my immediate attention; I had to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my sister, who needed her brother, and my responsibility as a judge, who must be impartial and thorough. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, phone in one hand, case file in the other, feeling the impossible pull of both roles."}
