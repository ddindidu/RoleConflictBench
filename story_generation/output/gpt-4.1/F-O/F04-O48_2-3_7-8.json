He was upset, and I knew I needed to be patient, to listen without judgment, to show him the respect he deserved even when we disagreed. That\u2019s what being a good brother meant\u2014being there, understanding our differences, not letting frustration get the better of me. But just as he started to open up, my pager buzzed. Room 214. I knew that room\u2014Mrs. Carter, who had just received a devastating diagnosis. She needed me, too. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to provide comfort, to sit with her, to offer a shoulder to cry on. I could hear her sobs from the hallway. My brother\u2019s voice wavered in my ear, \u201cAre you even listening?\u201d My heart twisted. Both needed me, both expected my full attention and compassion. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure how to be the brother my sibling needed and the caregiver my patient deserved, all at the same time."}
