I know I should stop him\u2014teach him about respect for public spaces, about discipline and self-control. That\u2019s what a good parent does. But my phone buzzes again, another email from the project manager. The team is waiting for my feedback on the revised blueprints, and the client expects an update by noon. I glance at the clock. If I don\u2019t review the timelines now, we might miss a critical deadline. My son\u2019s laughter echoes down the aisle, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. I feel the weight of their expectations, too. I want to kneel down, look him in the eye, and explain why his behavior isn\u2019t okay. But I also want to be the architect who keeps projects on track, who doesn\u2019t let details slip. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility of shaping my child\u2019s character, knowing I can\u2019t give both my full attention at this moment."}
