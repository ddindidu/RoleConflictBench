The radio crackled with news of a minor signal delay up ahead\u2014nothing dangerous, but it meant I\u2019d have to adjust the speed carefully, keep the train on schedule, and avoid any sudden jolts for the passengers. My hands gripped the controls, mind focused on the rhythm of the rails. Then my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I need advice about starting high school.\u201d I knew she was anxious, looking for the kind of guidance only I could give, the wisdom I\u2019d promised to share whenever she needed it. But right now, every second demanded my attention on the train. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s trust in me as her guide, and the responsibility of every passenger behind me, counting on my focus and skill. My heart ached to be there for her, but my duty to the train was just as urgent. I stared at the phone, torn, as the train rolled steadily forward."}
