I could sense she needed me\u2014needed the kind of gentle advice only a grandmother could give. My heart ached to reach out, to share a story from my own tangled youth, to remind her that storms do pass. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed urgently. The factory\u2019s main production line was down again, and the supervisor\u2019s message was clear: \u201cSensor errors, production halted, need you now.\u201d I could almost hear the hum of the machines in my mind, the pressure of lost time and mounting costs. My hands, skilled at both comforting and repairing, trembled. I felt torn\u2014my family needed my wisdom, my team needed my expertise. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, caught between the quiet pain of my granddaughter and the relentless demands of the machines."}
