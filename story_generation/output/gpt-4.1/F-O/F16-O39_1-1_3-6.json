My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve got a late meeting.\u201d I nod, but my thoughts are already drifting to the construction site. This morning, the foreman posted a notice about an optional training session next week\u2014extra safety protocols, new equipment. He said it\u2019s not mandatory, but everyone knows the guys who show up are the ones who get noticed for promotions. I want to be that guy. But the session is in the evening, the only time I have to catch up at home. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I\u2019m expected to pull my weight, not just drop my boots and disappear. At work, I\u2019m expected to be committed, to show I\u2019m serious about the job. I look at the laundry, then at the training notice in my hand, and my chest tightens. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both places need me."}
