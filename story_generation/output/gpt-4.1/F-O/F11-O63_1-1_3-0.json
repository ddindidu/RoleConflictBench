My family was gathered around, tossing out ideas for the weekend\u2014hiking, a movie, maybe a barbecue. My little brother looked at me, eyes hopeful, waiting for my input. I wanted to join in, to laugh and plan with them, but my shift had just started. The phone rang, and I straightened, slipping into my professional voice. The caller asked a question I\u2019d answered a hundred times, and I recited the script, but my mind was half on my family\u2019s conversation. My mom called my name, asking what I thought about the beach. I muted the call for a second, torn. I was expected to be present, to help make the weekend special, but I also had to handle this customer, to do my job well. The pressure built in my chest as I tried to balance both, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
