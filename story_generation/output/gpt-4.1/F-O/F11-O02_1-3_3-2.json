My younger brother\u2019s eyes lit up as he described a hiking trail he wanted us all to try, and my mom smiled, nudging me to join in. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages,\u201d she said, her voice hopeful. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed with another message from my project manager: \u201cAny update on the module? The team\u2019s waiting.\u201d I was the only one who could finish the core piece, and without it, the entire build was at a standstill. I could feel the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, knowing they were counting on me to deliver. At the same time, I saw the anticipation in my family\u2019s faces, wanting me to be present, to laugh and share in the plans. My heart twisted as I tried to balance the pull of both worlds, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
