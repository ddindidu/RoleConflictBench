My wife\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to be present, especially now. But as I glanced at the open lab notebook on my desk, I felt the weight of my other life pressing in. The latest batch of results from our experiment was ready to be logged, and while the schedule was flexible, I prided myself on keeping meticulous, timely records. My team relied on my accuracy, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. I felt torn, the expectations of fatherhood and science pulling me in opposite directions. My son needed me, but so did my research. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, the cursor blinking on the screen as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
