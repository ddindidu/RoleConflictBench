The hospital\u2019s name was bold on the label, and I knew the delivery had to be on time\u2014lives could depend on it. But the message on my phone made my hands tremble: my daughter was in tears, telling me that my grandson had been rushed to the ER after a bad fall. As a grandparent, I felt the pull to drop everything, call her back, and be the comforting voice she needed. My family expected me to be present, to check in, to offer support in moments like this. But as a delivery person, I was expected to keep my route, to get this package to the hospital department without delay. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My heart ached for my family, but my hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the road ahead and the call I so desperately wanted to make."}
