My partner\u2019s message blinked on the screen: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you right now.\u201d He\u2019d been wrestling with a huge decision at work, and I knew how much he counted on me to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through the mess in his head. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to wrap him in a hug and tell him it would be okay.\n\nBut the delivery app chimed insistently. My next stop was across town, and the customer had left a note: \u201cPlease, I need these groceries for dinner tonight. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d If I was late, it wouldn\u2019t just be a bad review\u2014it could mean a ruined evening for someone else, maybe a family waiting for their meal.\n\nI sat in my car, torn. My husband needed me, really needed me, but so did this stranger.
