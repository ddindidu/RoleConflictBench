My stepmom\u2019s messages flashed on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we need you at the family brunch. It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before the big holiday celebration. But right then, the salon door swung open and the bride-to-be, along with her bridesmaids, rushed in, all nerves and chatter. They were early, and I could see the tension in their faces. As a hairdresser, I was expected to greet them warmly, calm their nerves, and make sure everything ran smoothly for their big day. But my mind kept drifting to my family, waiting for me to show up and be part of the celebration, to prove I belonged. My heart pounded as I tried to smile and welcome the bridal party, all the while feeling the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the warmth of family and the duty to my clients, not knowing which world I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
