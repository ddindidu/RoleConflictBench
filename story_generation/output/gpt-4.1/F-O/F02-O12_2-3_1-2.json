She\u2019d been talking about it for days, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised I would. But as I closed the email, my phone buzzed with a Slack notification\u2014production was slowing down, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged last night. My manager\u2019s message was terse: \u201cCan you look into this ASAP? We need a fix before peak traffic.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. My daughter\u2019s hopeful face flashed in my mind, but so did the expectation that I\u2019d own my code, keep things running smoothly. If I left now, I\u2019d let my team down, risk a bigger outage. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to my daughter. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that both needed me, both expecting me to show up."}
