I knew how much it meant to her, to the whole family, that I step up and honor the tradition, even though I still felt like an outsider sometimes. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a delivery notification. I was on the clock, and the customer was waiting outside for their package. As a delivery person, I was expected to be prompt, polite, and professional, no matter what. But here I was, torn between the family\u2019s expectations and my job\u2019s demands. My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, calling me to join the ceremony. At the same time, the customer texted, asking if I was nearby. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I was about to let down."}
