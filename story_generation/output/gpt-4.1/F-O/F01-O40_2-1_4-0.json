My daughter called, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first school award, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see the pride in his eyes, to be the grandfather he could look up to. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again: a reminder from the site manager. We had a big delivery coming in, and I was responsible for the safety briefing. If I was late, the crew might start without me, risking shortcuts and accidents. My hands, rough from years of carpentry, trembled as I looked at the clock. I could already picture my grandson\u2019s face searching for me in the crowd, and at the same time, I imagined the anxious glances of my coworkers, waiting for my lead. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the laughter of my family and the responsibility of keeping my team safe."}
