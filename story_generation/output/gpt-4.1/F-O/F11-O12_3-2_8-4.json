I think you misunderstood what I said earlier.\u201d I know he\u2019s upset, and as his sister, I want to be there for him, to listen and clear the air. We\u2019ve always promised to communicate openly, to never let misunderstandings fester. But as I glance at my laptop, I see a dozen Slack notifications piling up. The design documents for our new feature are due tomorrow, and the product and QA teams are waiting for my technical input. They\u2019re counting on me to collaborate, to help define the details so everyone can move forward. My heart pounds as I stare at the two screens\u2014one with my brother\u2019s plea, the other with my team\u2019s expectations. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my attention, each too important to ignore."}
