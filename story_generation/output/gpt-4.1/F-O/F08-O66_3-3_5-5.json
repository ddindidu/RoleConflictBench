We need you. It\u2019s serious.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I knew my family expected me to be there, to comfort and help, especially in moments like this. But just then, the road ahead narrowed\u2014orange cones funneled traffic into a single lane, and a school zone sign flashed. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and shouts piercing the air. I felt the weight of my other role pressing in: as a taxi driver, I was responsible for every life around me, expected to drive slowly, obey every law, and keep everyone safe. My foot hovered over the brake, torn between the urge to rush to my family and the duty to protect these children. The seconds stretched, my mind racing with the impossible choice between being the grandmother my family needed and the careful driver my job demanded."}
