He darted away from me, weaving between carts and displays, laughing as he went. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. I called his name, my voice sharp, but he only giggled louder. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the site: \u201cEvacuation alarm, all staff must report to muster point now.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew the rules: when the alarm sounds, you drop everything and go, no exceptions. My team was counting on me to be there, to follow protocol, to keep everyone safe. But here I was, torn between chasing after my son to correct his behavior and rushing to the site as a responsible worker. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, caught between the expectations of a good mother and a reliable laborer, unsure which way to turn."}
