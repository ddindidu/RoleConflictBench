It was important to them, and to me, to show I was there, that I cared. As I started the car, my radio crackled. \u201cUnit 12, we\u2019ve got a noise complaint on Maple Street. Can you respond?\u201d I hesitated. Maple Street was only a few blocks away, and I was the closest unit. Dispatch was expecting me to handle it\u2014enforce the law, keep the peace. But if I went, I\u2019d be late for the kids, maybe miss them entirely. I could already picture their disappointed faces, the way they\u2019d look for me in the crowd and not find me. My badge felt heavy on my chest, a reminder of my duty. But so did the promise I\u2019d made to my family. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the call of the radio and the promise waiting at the school gates, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
