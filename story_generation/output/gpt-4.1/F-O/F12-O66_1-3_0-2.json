My husband\u2019s text pops up: \u201cRough day. Just want to talk when you get home.\u201d I can almost hear the tiredness in his words, and I know he needs me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. But right now, my focus is split. In the back seat, my passenger checks his watch for the third time, anxiety etched on his face. \u201cI really can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he says, voice tight. The roads are slick, traffic crawling, and every minute feels like an hour. I want to reassure him, to drive faster, but safety comes first. My mind races\u2014how can I be the supportive wife my husband needs tonight, when I\u2019m already stretched thin trying to get this man to the airport on time and in one piece? The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I grip the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the two worlds that need me right now."}
