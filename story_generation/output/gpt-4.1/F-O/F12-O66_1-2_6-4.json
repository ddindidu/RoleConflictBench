He asked about my day, and I wanted to share everything\u2014the stress, the close calls, the exhaustion. As a wife, I knew he expected me to open up, to let him in, to talk about what was weighing on me. But my mind kept drifting back to the afternoon, when the rain was coming down in sheets and cars were weaving unpredictably in and out of lanes. As a taxi driver, I had to stay hyper-focused, following every traffic law, driving defensively, my hands tight on the wheel, my eyes darting between mirrors. The tension from the road still clung to me, making it hard to switch gears and be present as a wife. I could sense his disappointment as I hesitated, torn between the need to protect him from my stress and the expectation to communicate openly. The words caught in my throat, and I wrestled with which role to honor in that moment, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
