My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you please fold those tonight? I\u2019ve done the dishes and cooked.\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised I\u2019d help more, that I\u2019d be present at home, not just a shadow passing through. But my phone buzzes, and I see the hospital\u2019s number. My heart sinks. There\u2019s a patient in the ER, a young woman with a raging infection, her chart flashing red with urgency. The nurse\u2019s voice is tight: \u201cWe need you to prescribe the right antibiotics now, or she could lose her leg\u2014or worse.\u201d I glance at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in. My partner expects me to be a reliable teammate at home, to share the load. My patient needs me to act fast, to make the right call that could save her life. My chest tightens as I stand frozen, torn between the demands of the person I love and the oath I swore."}
