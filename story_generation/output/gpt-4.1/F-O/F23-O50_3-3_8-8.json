Two months left, and I needed to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. My partner trusted me to keep us afloat, and my stepdaughter was finally starting to feel secure in our home. I couldn\u2019t let them down. Just as I was calculating our budget, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the factory floor: the new staff were about to start a batch on the press, but none of them had been properly trained on the safety protocols. If I didn\u2019t step in, someone could get hurt\u2014or worse. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the call with the bank manager, the one chance to negotiate a lower interest rate. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks. My family needed financial stability, but my team needed my expertise to stay safe. I felt pulled in two directions, the pressure mounting as the minutes ticked by, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
