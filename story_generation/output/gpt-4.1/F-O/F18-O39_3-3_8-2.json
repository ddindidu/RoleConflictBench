The crane operator shouted for me to help guide the heavy steel beam swinging above us. My gloves were already on, and I knew every second counted\u2014if I didn\u2019t move fast, the whole crew would be delayed, and the beam could become unstable. Just as I stepped forward, I caught a glimpse of my little brother on the sidewalk across the street, his head down, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart lurched. I was always the one who looked out for him, the one who promised Mom I\u2019d keep him safe. But the foreman\u2019s voice cut through my panic, demanding I get in position. I felt torn in two\u2014my brother\u2019s safety on one side, my responsibility to my crew on the other. My hands shook as I hesitated, caught between the urgent demands of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
