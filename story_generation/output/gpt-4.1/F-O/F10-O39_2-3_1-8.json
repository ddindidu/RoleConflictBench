I froze for a split second, heart pounding. It was Thursday\u2014my day to call Mom and Dad, to reassure them I was safe, to listen to Dad\u2019s stories and Mom\u2019s gentle reminders to eat well. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d never miss a call, not after last winter when Mom got sick and I hadn\u2019t known for days. But now, the foreman\u2019s voice was sharp, echoing over the clamor: \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d My crew was already moving, hard hats bobbing in the crowd. Site protocol was strict\u2014no exceptions, no delays. My phone vibrated again, my parents\u2019 number lighting up the screen. I felt torn, the weight of my promise to my family pressing against the urgent, unyielding rules of the site. My hand hovered over my phone, caught between the need to reassure my parents and the responsibility to my team and my own safety. The alarm wailed, and I stood there, heart racing, pulled in two directions, not knowing which demand to answer first."}
