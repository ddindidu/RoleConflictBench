My phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just tired.\u201d I could hear his voice in my head, hoping for a little comfort, maybe a joke or a gentle word. I wanted to call him, to be the wife who listens and soothes, but the school zone sign flashed ahead, and a group of children clustered near the curb, their laughter piercing through the hum of engines. My hands tightened on the wheel. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra vigilant\u2014slow down, watch for sudden movements, obey every rule. The pressure built inside me: my husband\u2019s need for support tugged at my heart, but the safety of these children demanded my full attention.
