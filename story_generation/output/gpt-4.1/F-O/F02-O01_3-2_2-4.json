The deadline was tight, and my phone buzzed with reminders from my team about the client meeting tomorrow. Just as I was finalizing the layout for the collaborative spaces, my phone rang again\u2014this time, the school. My heart sank as the principal explained that my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in and discuss the incident immediately. \n\nAs a father, I knew I needed to be there for my son, to understand what happened and help him make things right. But as an architect, I was under immense pressure to deliver a flawless design, and any delay could jeopardize the project and my reputation.

I stared at the clock, torn between the needs of my child and the expectations of my profession, feeling the stress knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
