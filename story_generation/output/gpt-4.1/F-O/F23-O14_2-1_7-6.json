The numbers on the page didn\u2019t add up\u2014rent, groceries, her school trip, all pressing in on me. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of making sure we had enough, that she never felt the insecurity I\u2019d known as a child. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab\u2019s quarterly maintenance checklist was due tomorrow. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was checked, every safety protocol followed, even if nothing seemed wrong. Skipping it wasn\u2019t an option; one missed detail could mean disaster. But the overtime pay I\u2019d counted on wasn\u2019t coming unless I picked up an extra shift at the weekend job. My mind spun with the impossible choice\u2014stay late at the lab to do the checklist myself, or leave early to work the shift that would keep food on our table. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
