Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of being together. But as a taxi driver, I had a passenger in the backseat, tapping his foot impatiently, glancing at his own watch. He needed to get to the train station, and he\u2019d made it clear he was in a hurry. The roads were clear, the speed limit tempting me to push just a little faster, but I knew the rules\u2014no shortcuts, no speeding, always drive safely.
