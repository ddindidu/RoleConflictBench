My stepbrother had sent a photo of the table already set, and my stepmother\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt means a lot to us if you\u2019re here.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were, especially since I\u2019d promised to make more of an effort to bond with them. But just as I was about to leave the hospital, my pager went off\u2014an emergency. A patient had come in with a rapidly spreading infection, and the nurse\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe need you to assess and prescribe treatment now.\u201d I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected my presence, my effort to belong. My patient needed my expertise, my responsibility as a doctor. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the warmth of a family dinner and the cold, clinical urgency of the ER, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which part of myself I would have to let down tonight."}
