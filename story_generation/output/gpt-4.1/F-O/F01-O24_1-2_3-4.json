My grandson had called me yesterday, his voice bubbling with excitement about showing me his new model train. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I meant it. But as I sat at my desk, the thick trial file stared back at me, a silent reminder of my other life. The bench trial had just ended, and the parties were waiting for my written judgment\u2014thirty days, the law said, and the lawyers would expect nothing less than clarity and thoroughness. My chambers were quiet, but inside, my thoughts clashed. I wanted to be the grandfather who kept his word, who was present and attentive. Yet, I was also the judge, entrusted with the responsibility to deliver justice, to write opinions that would stand up to scrutiny. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, my focus, my heart. I sat there, torn, the laughter of my family and the silent demands of the law pulling me in opposite directions."}
