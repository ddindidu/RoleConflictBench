Two months left before the next big repayment, and I could feel the weight of my promise to provide stability for my new family. My stepdaughter\u2019s laughter drifted in from the living room, a reminder of what was at stake. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from work: the new safety standard for our project was now in effect, and I was responsible for ensuring every detail was compliant before the product launch. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no shortcuts, no delays, or the company could face penalties. I knew overtime was inevitable, but that meant less time at home, less time to reassure my partner that we\u2019d be okay, less time to help my stepdaughter with her homework. The pressure to be both the reliable provider and the meticulous engineer pulled at me from opposite directions, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which demand to answer first."}
