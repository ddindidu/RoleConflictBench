Pilots called in, voices tense, requesting updates on holding times. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the delays minimal, safety first.\u201d I toggled between frequencies, issuing instructions, my mind racing to keep up with the congestion. \n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. I knew it was my stepbrother, probably pacing the living room, textbooks scattered, anxiety gnawing at him before his final exam. He\u2019d asked me to be there, to help him calm down, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents married\u2014support, no matter what. \n\nBut right now, the sky demanded my full attention. Every second counted. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to keep hundreds of passengers safe, and the promise to be the sibling he could lean on.
