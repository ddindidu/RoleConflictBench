It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I glanced at the patient\u2019s door in front of me\u2014Mr. Harris was due for his morning vitals, and I knew how anxious he got if I was late. The hospital expected me to be efficient, to keep the routine running smoothly, and I prided myself on being reliable. But my granddaughter\u2019s words echoed in my mind, her trust in me as her grandmother, the one she turned to for wisdom and comfort. I felt torn, standing in the sterile hallway, the weight of my stethoscope around my neck and the invisible pull of family in my chest. I could almost hear both voices\u2014my supervisor\u2019s reminder to stay on schedule, and my granddaughter\u2019s quiet plea for help. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
