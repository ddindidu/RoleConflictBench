My hands hovered over the console, every muscle tense as I rerouted planes circling in the congested airspace. Suddenly, my phone buzzed\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I hesitated, but answered, only to hear my grandson\u2019s trembling voice. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d His words were heavy, desperate for the kind of wisdom only a grandfather could give. But in the tower, every second counted.
