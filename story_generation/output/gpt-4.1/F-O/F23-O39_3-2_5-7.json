My heart pounded as the store manager\u2019s eyes flicked between us, waiting for me to respond. I knew what was expected of me as a step-parent: to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is never acceptable, no matter how small the item. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the safety briefing at the construction site was about to start. Missing it meant risking a write-up, maybe even losing my job if it happened again. My foreman had made it clear: no exceptions, everyone attends, no matter what. I looked down at my stepson, his eyes wide with fear and shame, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I needed to be a good parent, to guide him through this mistake, but I also needed to keep my job, to provide for our family. My mind raced, torn between the lesson he needed and the rules I couldn\u2019t break."}
