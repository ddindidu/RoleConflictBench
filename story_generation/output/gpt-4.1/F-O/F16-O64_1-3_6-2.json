My spouse poured us tea and asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I wanted to tell them about the stress, the pressure of handling thousands in cash, the fear of making a mistake that could cost me my job. But as I started to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my manager reminding me to double-check the final till count tomorrow. My spouse looked at me, expecting me to share, to be open, to let them in. But all I could think about was the numbers, the receipts, the possibility that I\u2019d missed something. I felt torn\u2014should I open up and risk sounding distracted, or keep my worries to myself and focus on the accuracy my job demanded? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expecting something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
