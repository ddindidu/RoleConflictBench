My stepbrother, Jamie, was tightening his helmet, eyes fixed on the steep, uneven ramp. He grinned at me, \u201cWatch this!\u201d My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But my other ear was tuned to the urgent chatter from the tower\u2014an aircraft was about to cross into the neighboring sector, and I needed to coordinate the handoff smoothly. \n\n\u201cSector Bravo, confirm handoff for Flight 218,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Jamie\u2019s skateboard clattered as he positioned himself at the top of the ramp.
