My heart ached; I could tell something was weighing on her. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer a gentle word, and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But just then, two travelers approached my cab, arms full of heavy suitcases, asking if I could help load their bags and take them across town. They were in a hurry, eager to split the fare and get moving. I felt the familiar tug of duty\u2014professionalism demanded I greet them with a smile, help with their luggage, and get them to their destination promptly. Yet, my granddaughter\u2019s quiet distress pulled at me even more. I stood there, torn between the expectations of a caring grandparent and a reliable taxi driver, my mind racing as I tried to decide which role needed me most in that moment."}
