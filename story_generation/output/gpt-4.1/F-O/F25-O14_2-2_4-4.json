The numbers from my latest experiment were still raw, unpolished, but the departmental meeting was tomorrow. My advisor had stressed the importance of presenting honest, thorough summaries, even if the results were inconclusive. As I tried to focus, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d My father had recently reminded me how much these gatherings meant, especially now, and how important it was to show respect for our customs. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014be present, be grateful, uphold the family\u2019s values. But my mind kept drifting back to the data, the need to prepare, the responsibility to my team and to science. The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the call of family and the call of my work, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved."}
