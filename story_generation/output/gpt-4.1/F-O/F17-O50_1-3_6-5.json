Dad\u2019s been quiet all day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift wasn\u2019t over for another hour, and the factory floor was humming with tension. The old conveyor\u2019s bearing was screeching, a high-pitched wail that cut through the noise and made my skin prickle. If I didn\u2019t get it fixed soon, the whole line could grind to a halt, and I knew how much the team depended on me to keep things running smoothly.\n\nBut Mom\u2019s message tugged at me. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more, be there for them, especially since Dad\u2019s health scare last winter. They needed me to ask, to listen, to be present. Yet here I was, torn between the urgent demands of the machines and the quiet, persistent needs of my family. My hands hovered over the toolbox, my phone heavy in my pocket, my mind pulled in two directions, each one feeling like a test I couldn\u2019t afford to fail."}
