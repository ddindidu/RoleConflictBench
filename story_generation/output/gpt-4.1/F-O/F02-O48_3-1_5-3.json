It was the store manager from the corner shop, his voice tense as he explained that my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. As a father, I knew I needed to be there, to teach my son about honesty and consequences, to guide him through this mistake with patience and firmness.

The ward was short-staffed, and my absence would mean delays and possible risks for those in my care.
