It was the school. My heart sank as I listened to the principal explain that my son had been caught bullying another student. They wanted me to come in and discuss the situation immediately. I glanced at the half-finished plans on my workbench and the list of materials I still needed to order for a new client\u2019s furniture set. The deadline was tight, and any delay could mean losing the job\u2014and the client\u2019s trust. But my son needed me, and I knew I was expected to show up as a parent, to address his behavior and support him through this. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my child and the commitment to my work. Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I could feel the pressure building inside me as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
