The family gathering was circled in red on my calendar at home\u2014my daughter\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t be late this time.\u201d I\u2019d promised her, and myself, that I\u2019d be there, laughing and sharing stories, making up for all the missed birthdays and holidays. But now, as I navigated the city streets, I was on shift, responsible for moving the ambulance to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackled with updates, and I knew I couldn\u2019t rush or cut corners; safety was everything. My supervisor expected me to follow every protocol, no exceptions. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family waiting, my duty demanding focus. My heart tugged me toward home, but my mind replayed the training: every second behind the wheel, lives depended on me. I felt torn, the clock ticking louder, the city blurring past, as I wrestled with which promise I would have to break."}
