It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about my exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in his words, and I knew he needed me. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d always be there, especially during times like this. But at that exact moment, the control room radioed in\u2014a passenger had reported a suspicious, unattended bag in car three. My heart thudded. As a subway operator, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety. I was expected to act quickly, follow protocol, and keep calm for the hundreds of people on board. My brother\u2019s anxiety tugged at me, but so did the weight of my duty. I stared at my phone, torn between stepping up as the sibling he needed and the operator everyone depended on. The train rumbled forward, and I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
