Just this morning, my mother had called, reminding me of the importance of our family\u2019s traditions\u2014how we always honor the past, never stray from the values passed down through generations. She spoke of respect for elders, for customs, for the way things have always been done. Now, in the courtroom, my clerk rushed over, whispering that the Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was about to instruct the jury on. The law demanded I adapt immediately, to set aside what was familiar and follow the new ruling. My heart pounded. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, urging me to honor tradition, to respect what came before. But as a judge, I was expected to uphold the law as it stood, not as it once was. The courtroom waited, silent and expectant, as I wrestled with the pull of my family\u2019s values and the unyielding demands of justice."}
