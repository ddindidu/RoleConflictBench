It\u2019s important to us.\u201d Her words echoed the recent talks at home about keeping our traditions alive, especially now that my grandparents were getting older. I wanted to be there, to show I cared about our customs, to be the daughter my family expected.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my work app pinged. A customer was asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s my order? I\u2019ve been waiting for an hour!\u201d I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, keeping my tone calm and polite, even though I was already running behind on my deliveries. My boss had reminded us last week: \u201cCustomer service is everything. Be courteous, no matter what.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the cold professionalism my job demanded. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how to be both the dutiful daughter and the reliable delivery person at the same time."}
