It was just a few coins off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for. My manager expected me to report even the smallest mistake, no exceptions. As I stared at the numbers, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my stepdad: \u201cRough day. Can we talk later?\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to ask if everything was okay at home, to be the emotional support he and Mom counted on. But if I reported the discrepancy, I\u2019d be late getting home, and I\u2019d miss the chance to be there for him. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be breaking store policy. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: the reliable step-child, the responsible cashier. I could feel the pressure building, torn between the rules of my job and the needs of my family, unsure which role I was supposed to put first."}
