The deadline was tight, and my client expected a design that would transform their business. Every detail mattered\u2014where the windows faced, how the rooms connected, the comfort of each workspace. My phone buzzed. It was my daughter, her voice bubbling with excitement. \u201cDad, can you come over tonight? Lily wants to show everyone her first piano recital video. She\u2019s been practicing for weeks, and it would mean the world to her if you were there.\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face, the family gathered in the living room, laughter and applause filling the air.
