I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of wisdom I was expected to offer, the kind that comes from years of living and learning. But my supervisor had just reminded me, again, about the strict hygiene protocols: gloves on at all times, no exceptions, especially in the kitchen. I could see the longing in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes for a comforting touch, maybe a reassuring squeeze of her hand, something I always did when she was little. My hands, though, were encased in latex, damp and impersonal. I felt torn\u2014between the urge to be the warm, wise grandfather she needed and the responsibility to keep everything safe and clean. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the rules of my job and the needs of my family."}
