She called, her voice bubbling with excitement, asking if I could come over after my shift. I promised I would, knowing how much it meant to her. But as I was about to leave work, Mrs. Thompson, one of my patients, received devastating news about her health. She broke down in tears, clutching my hand, begging me not to leave her alone. My supervisor glanced at me, silently reminding me of my duty to provide comfort and support. My phone buzzed again\u2014my sister, asking if I was on my way. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My sister needed me to celebrate her joy, to be the supportive sibling I always promised to be. But Mrs. Thompson needed me too, in a way that felt urgent and raw. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unable to move, caught between the needs of family and the needs of those I care for at work."}
