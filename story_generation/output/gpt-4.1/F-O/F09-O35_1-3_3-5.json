He looked up at me, eyes wide, and I could see the lesson slowly sinking in. Just then, my phone buzzed urgently. My shift as a subway operator was about to start, and I had to leave for the control room. As I settled into the operator\u2019s seat, the train rattling beneath me, the emergency alarm blared. A passenger needed help\u2014my responsibility was to ensure everyone\u2019s safety and respond immediately. My mind raced: my son still needed my guidance at home, but now, dozens of passengers depended on me for their safety. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, calm, and capable. My heart pounded as I stared at the emergency indicator, torn between the lessons I owed my child and the duty I owed my passengers."}
