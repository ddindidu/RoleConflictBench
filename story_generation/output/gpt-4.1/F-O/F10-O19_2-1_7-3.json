My father\u2019s voice was quieter than usual, and I could feel the heaviness in the room. I wanted to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to be the daughter they needed\u2014someone who could listen and offer comfort. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my shift at the pharmacy was about to start.\n\nAt work, a patient approached the counter, her eyes anxious as she asked about over-the-counter pain relief. I gave her a quick answer, but I could see she wanted more\u2014maybe reassurance, maybe a little extra time. My mind kept drifting back to my parents, wondering if they were okay, if they needed me. I felt torn, pulled between the daughter I wanted to be and the pharmacist I was expected to be. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between the needs of my family and the needs of my patients, unsure which part of me should come first."}
