My mind raced with deadlines and material deliveries, every minute counted if I wanted to keep the project on schedule. Just then, my granddaughter slipped into the room, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandma, can I ask you something?\u201d she said softly. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of the looming site meeting. She hesitated, then asked about handling friendships as she started high school, her voice tinged with worry. I knew she needed my full attention, my wisdom, the comfort only a grandmother could give. But the contractor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, waiting for my decision. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the project that demanded my focus, and toward the child who needed my guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
