My husband had mentioned this morning that he\u2019s out of shirts, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform is somewhere in that heap. I promised I\u2019d take care of it today. But my sketchbook is open on the kitchen table, and the ideas for my personal studio renovation are finally coming together after weeks of creative drought. The layout needs to be functional, every inch purposeful, and I can almost see the finished space in my mind. My pencil hovers, but my eyes drift back to the laundry. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my family counting on me to keep things running smoothly, and my own need to create, to design something that\u2019s just for me. My heart pounds with the pressure of choosing, torn between the expectations of being a good wife and the demands of my work as an architect. I stand in the middle of the kitchen, unable to move, wrestling with which part of myself to honor first."}
