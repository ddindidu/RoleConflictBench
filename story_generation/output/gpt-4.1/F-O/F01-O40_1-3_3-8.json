My grandson had called me last night, his voice bubbling with excitement about showing me his new train set. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture his face lighting up when I walked through the door. But this morning, my phone buzzed with a different kind of urgency\u2014a client\u2019s frantic message about termite damage spreading through their living room beams. The house was old, the wood brittle, and the family inside depended on me to keep their home safe. They needed an immediate assessment, maybe even repairs today, before the damage got worse. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest: the expectation to be the reliable grandfather, present and loving, and the duty to be the dependable carpenter, skilled and responsive. My hands, rough from years of work, trembled slightly as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
