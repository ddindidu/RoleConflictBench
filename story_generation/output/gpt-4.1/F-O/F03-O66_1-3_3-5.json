It was the holidays, and my mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways be home for the family dinner, no matter what.\u201d I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d make it, just like every year. But work was work, and I needed the extra fare before heading home. As I turned onto Maple Street, orange cones forced all traffic into a single lane. Up ahead, a group of children in bright coats clustered near the curb, their laughter ringing out. The school zone sign flashed, reminding me to slow to a crawl. The clock on my dashboard ticked closer to dinnertime. My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014don\u2019t let the family down. But as a taxi driver, I knew I couldn\u2019t rush, not here, not with kids so close. My foot hovered over the brake, my heart caught between the urge to hurry home and the duty to drive safely. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I gripped the wheel, torn by the demands of being a good son and a responsible driver."}
