Their eyes were red from crying, and I could feel the weight of their pain pressing down on both of us. They needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to reassure them that I was here, that everything would be okay. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. The hospital. I was on shift, and one of my patients, Mrs. Lee, had just come out of surgery. Her chart showed a slight spike in her temperature and pulse. I knew I had to be there, to check her vitals, to make sure she was safe. My partner\u2019s grip tightened, silently begging me not to leave. My heart twisted as I looked between them and the door, torn by the demands of love and duty, feeling the impossible pull of both roles at once."}
