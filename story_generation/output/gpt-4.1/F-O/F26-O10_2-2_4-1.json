The end-of-month deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew every number had to be perfect. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message from my daughter: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Dad\u2014Emma\u2019s school play is tonight! She\u2019s so excited to see you in the audience.\u201d My heart tightened. Emma had been practicing her lines for weeks, and I\u2019d promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But the ledger on my screen was only half reconciled, and my supervisor had reminded me just this morning how crucial this month\u2019s close was. I could almost hear Emma\u2019s voice, full of hope, and at the same time, the echo of my boss\u2019s stern warning about accuracy and timeliness. The clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
