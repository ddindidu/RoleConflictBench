My mind tried to focus on the legal arguments, but the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses from the living room kept pulling me away. Tonight was our family\u2019s annual holiday gathering, a tradition my parents cherished. Every year, I was expected to join in, to honor our customs, to be present\u2014not just in body, but in spirit. Yet, as a judge, I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to skim these files. The case was complicated, and my decision would affect lives. My father\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, calling me to join the family for the midnight toast. I felt the weight of his expectation, the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show. But the briefs demanded my attention, my duty to the court and to justice pressing just as hard. My heart pounded as I sat, torn between the warmth of family and the cold responsibility of the law, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved."}
