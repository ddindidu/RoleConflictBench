Mom had made my favorite dish, and everyone was already at the table, waiting for me to join the family dinner. My brother sent a photo of the spread, and I could almost smell the food through the screen. I knew how much these gatherings meant to them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. They expected me to be there, to laugh, to share stories, to be present.\n\nBut my laptop glowed with urgency. The merger contract on my screen was dense, and the deadline was tonight. Buried in the fine print were clauses that could cost my client millions if I missed something. My firm trusted me to catch every detail, and my client\u2019s future depended on my diligence. The pressure was suffocating.\n\nI felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. My family needed me, but so did my client. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles pressed down on me, leaving me paralyzed at my desk, unable to move."}
