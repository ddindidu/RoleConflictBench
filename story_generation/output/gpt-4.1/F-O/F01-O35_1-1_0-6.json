Her eyes were wide, searching. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when you started something new? I feel lost.\u201d I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of guidance only experience could give. My mind raced with memories, words of comfort forming on my tongue. But then my phone buzzed. An email from work: a professional development seminar, optional but highly recommended, and the sign-up deadline was today. As a subway operator, I knew how important it was to stay current, to show commitment to my job. Management expected us to be proactive, to respond promptly. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful gaze, the silent demand of my profession. My heart tugged in two directions, wisdom for her or duty to my career. I hesitated, caught between the roles that defined me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
