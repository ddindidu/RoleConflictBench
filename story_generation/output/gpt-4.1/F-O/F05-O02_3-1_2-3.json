My wife\u2019s voice, shaky and tired, drifted from the living room. She\u2019d barely slept in days, her father\u2019s illness weighing on her like a storm cloud. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to anchor her. But the audit was coming up, and though it was weeks away, I knew the documentation was a mess. If I didn\u2019t start now, the pressure would mount, and any oversight could mean a safety violation. My team counted on me to keep everything in line, to catch the small errors before they became disasters. I heard her sniffle, and my heart twisted. I wanted to close the laptop, to be the husband she deserved. But the engineer in me saw the looming deadline, the responsibility to my colleagues and the company. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of me should win."}
