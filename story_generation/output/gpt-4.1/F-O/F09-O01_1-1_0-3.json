The lines of the new studio layout are coming together, but my mind keeps drifting. I promised myself I\u2019d finish the basic usability plan before the end of the day\u2014my client expects a draft by tomorrow. I erase a wall, redraw it, then pause. My phone buzzes: a reminder that school ends in fifteen minutes. My kids will be waiting, scanning the crowd for my face. I picture their hopeful eyes, the way they light up when I\u2019m there on time. But the layout isn\u2019t right yet; the storage space feels cramped, and the flow is off. I know if I leave now, I\u2019ll lose my train of thought, and the design will suffer. But if I stay, my children will be the last ones standing by the gate, wondering if I forgot them. My heart pounds as I stare at the unfinished sketch, torn between the demands of my work and the needs of my children, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
