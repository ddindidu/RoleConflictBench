Mom always said to look out for each other, and I took that seriously\u2014especially after what happened last year. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: a customer was asking about their package, the one I\u2019d just realized was delayed at the depot. My heart thudded. As a delivery person, I was supposed to respond quickly and professionally, but my brother was chattering about his day, and I needed to keep an eye on him crossing the busy intersection ahead. The customer\u2019s message pinged again, more insistent this time. I felt torn\u2014should I stop and type out a polite, reassuring reply, risking my brother darting ahead without me? Or should I focus on him, knowing my job expected me to be responsive and courteous? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I hesitated, caught between the two worlds I was supposed to manage."}
