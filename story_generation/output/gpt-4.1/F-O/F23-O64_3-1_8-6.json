The store is quiet, and I greet each customer with the warmth expected of me. But my mind is elsewhere, calculating numbers, replaying the conversation I had with my partner last night about the looming home loan repayment. Two months isn\u2019t long, and every dollar counts. As a step-parent, I feel the weight of making sure our family is secure, that my stepchild never senses the anxiety gnawing at me. Yet, here I am, expected to be cheerful and attentive, to ask about loyalty cards and weekend plans, when all I want is to check my bank app and run through the budget again. My heart pounds as I hand a receipt to a customer, my voice steady but my thoughts racing. I know I can\u2019t let my worries show, not here, not now. But the pressure builds, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I wonder how much longer I can keep up this balancing act."}
