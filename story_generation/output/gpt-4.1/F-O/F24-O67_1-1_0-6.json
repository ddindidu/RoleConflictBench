My phone buzzed in the cup holder\u2014another message from my stepbrother, his words frantic: \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d He had his final exam in an hour, and I knew how much this meant to him. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to calm him down, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But right now, I was behind the wheel, responsible for a vehicle that demanded my full attention. The expectation was clear: drive safely, no distractions, no exceptions. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014one mistake could cost lives. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me. If I ignored my brother, I\u2019d be letting him down when he needed me most. If I answered, even for a moment, I\u2019d be risking everything I\u2019d trained for. The phone buzzed again, louder this time, as if demanding a choice. My heart pounded, torn between the sibling he needed and the professional I was supposed to be."}
