The emergency room is tense; a young woman has been rushed in, her breathing ragged, her skin clammy. The nurses look to me for answers, and I know every second counts. I scan her test results, searching for a clue, my mind racing through possible diagnoses. Then, another buzz\u2014this time, a message from my son\u2019s school. The final bell is about to ring, and he\u2019s waiting for me at the gate, eyes scanning the crowd for his parent like he does every afternoon. I promised him I\u2019d be there today, that I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way again. My heart aches at the thought of his disappointment, but the weight of the patient\u2019s life presses on me just as heavily. I feel torn in two, pulled by the desperate needs of a stranger and the quiet hope of my child. Both expect me to be there, fully present, and I can\u2019t bear the thought of letting either down."}
