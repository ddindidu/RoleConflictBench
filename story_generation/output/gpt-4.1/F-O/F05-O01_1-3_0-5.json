My mind raced with questions\u2014had I accounted for every possible scenario, every inch of space? Just then, my wife walked in, her shoulders a little slumped. She mentioned her day at work, how a colleague had dismissed her idea in a meeting. She laughed it off, but I could hear the edge in her voice. I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. But the deadline for the hospital design loomed, and every minute away from the plans felt like risking someone\u2019s safety in the future. I wanted to close my laptop and give her my full attention, but the weight of responsibility pressed down on me. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward her, needing reassurance, and toward the hospital, needing precision. I sat there, torn, the expectations of husband and architect pulling me apart."}
