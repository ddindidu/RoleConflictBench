He started talking about how overwhelmed he felt at work, his voice trembling a little. I could see he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the supportive step-child he hoped for. Just as I reached out to comfort him, my phone rang\u2014a customer, frustrated, asking about a package that hadn\u2019t arrived. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, explain the delay, and keep my tone calm. But my stepdad\u2019s eyes were pleading for my attention, and I felt torn. I wanted to be there for him, to show I cared, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my job\u2019s demand for immediate, polite communication. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, caught between the expectations of being a good step-child and a responsible delivery person, not sure which role to choose in that moment."}
