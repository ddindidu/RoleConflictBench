She\u2019s really looking forward to it.\u201d My family had planned this celebration for weeks, and I\u2019d assured them I\u2019d make it, even though my shift as a subway operator ended just an hour before. I could already picture my mom\u2019s hopeful smile, my siblings\u2019 laughter, the warmth of home. But as I returned to the operator\u2019s cabin, a message from the control center flashed: \u201cMinor signal delay ahead. Adjust speed, maintain schedule, avoid abrupt stops.\u201d My hands tightened on the controls. The passengers behind me depended on a smooth, timely ride. I couldn\u2019t risk their safety or comfort, not even for family. My mind raced\u2014if I slowed too much, I\u2019d be late for dinner; if I rushed, I\u2019d compromise the train\u2019s safety. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at the tracks ahead, heart pounding, torn between duty and love, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved."}
