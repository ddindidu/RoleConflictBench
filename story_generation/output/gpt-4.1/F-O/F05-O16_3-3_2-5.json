My wife\u2019s voice trembled through the speaker, her words heavy with the weight of her father\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to steady her. I promised I\u2019d be home soon, but as I hung up, my pager beeped urgently. A family waited inside, desperate for answers about their loved one\u2019s prognosis. I could picture their anxious faces, the hope and fear mingling in their eyes. They needed me, too\u2014needed my calm, my compassion, my ability to explain the unexplainable. My heart ached, pulled in two directions. I wanted to be the husband my wife deserved, her anchor in the storm. But I was also a doctor, and these families counted on me to guide them through their darkest moments. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
