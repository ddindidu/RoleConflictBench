The laundry basket at home was overflowing, and my spouse had gently reminded me last night that we were running out of clean clothes for the kids\u2019 activities. I promised I\u2019d take care of it this morning before work. But now, here I was, standing in the hospital corridor, clipboard in hand, ready to start my morning rounds. My first patient was waiting for me to take her vital signs, and I knew how important it was to keep to the schedule\u2014her health depended on it, and my supervisor expected nothing less. I could almost hear the washing machine humming in my mind, the guilt of leaving my spouse to handle everything alone pressing on my chest. I felt torn, pulled between the needs of my family and the responsibilities of my patients. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I hesitated, caught in the impossible space between home and work, unsure which demand to answer first."}
