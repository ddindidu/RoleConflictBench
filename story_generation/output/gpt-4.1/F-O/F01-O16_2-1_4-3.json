Today was special\u2014my grandson had just won his first art competition, and the whole family was gathered to celebrate. He tugged at my sleeve, eyes shining, eager to show me his painting and tell me every detail. My heart swelled with pride; I wanted nothing more than to be present, to listen, to make him feel how important he was to me.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was the clinic. Mrs. Patel, one of my regular patients, was in for her check-up and had asked if I could speak with her. She was anxious, the nurse said, and had a list of questions about her health. I knew how much she valued clear, compassionate answers\u2014how much reassurance she needed from me as her doctor.\n\nI looked at my grandson, his face full of hope, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of responsibility. Both needed me, both deserved my full attention. My chest tightened as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the family I loved and the patients who depended on me."}
