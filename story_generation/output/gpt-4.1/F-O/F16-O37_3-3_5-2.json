As a spouse, I knew my partner expected me to help coordinate the whirlwind of chores before the relatives arrived. We had agreed to split the tasks, but as the housekeeping cleaner, my employer had left a detailed checklist: every room needed to be deep cleaned, every surface sanitized, and not a speck of dust left behind. My phone buzzed with reminders from both sides\u2014my partner asking if I\u2019d started on the guest room, my supervisor reminding me to double-check the bathrooms. I could feel my anxiety rising as I scrubbed the kitchen floor, knowing I was falling behind on the living room, where my partner was waiting for help. The pressure to meet both sets of expectations pulled me in opposite directions. I wanted to be a supportive spouse, but I also couldn\u2019t risk disappointing my employer. My hands trembled as I glanced at the clock, torn between the demands of my home and my job, unsure which responsibility to tackle next."}
