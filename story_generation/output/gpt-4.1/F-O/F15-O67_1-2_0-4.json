My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up the kids.\u201d I pictured their faces, waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for me. I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t be late again. Then the radio crackled, \u201cUnit 3, respond to a fall\u2014possible broken arm, 12th and Maple.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew the address; it was only a few blocks away. I could already imagine the pain in the patient\u2019s voice, the relief when help arrived. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. My children needed me to be there, to show up like I said I would. But someone else needed me too, someone in pain, counting on the ambulance to come quickly. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the parent, the responder\u2014pulling me in opposite directions.
