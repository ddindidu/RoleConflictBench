My parents looked at me, hopeful, as they discussed possible weekend plans. I knew they wanted me to join, to be present, to laugh and make memories together. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my shift as a subway operator. I glanced at the clock. It was almost time for the routine pre-departure check of the train\u2019s non-critical systems. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of punctuality and thoroughness, even for the smallest checks. The safety and schedule of hundreds depended on me. My family\u2019s voices grew louder, their eyes searching for my answer, while my mind raced with the weight of responsibility. I felt torn, the warmth of home pulling me one way, the duty of my job tugging the other. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, caught between the expectations of being a good sibling and a reliable subway operator."}
