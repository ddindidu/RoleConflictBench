My heart warmed at the thought of my grandchildren\u2019s laughter, the smell of my son-in-law\u2019s barbecue, and the stories we\u2019d share. I promised myself I\u2019d be present, truly present, for them tonight. But as I slipped on my white coat at the pharmacy, my phone buzzed with a reminder: a high-risk chemotherapy prescription needed to be filled before the end of my shift. The patient\u2019s life depended on my precision\u2014one decimal point off, and the consequences could be catastrophic. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cDouble-check everything, no shortcuts.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest.
