His voice trembled as he told me about the news: our dad\u2019s health had taken a sudden turn for the worse. He needed me, just to talk, to help him process it. I could hear the panic in his words, the way he tried to hold himself together. I wanted nothing more than to stay on the line, to be the sibling he could lean on, just like we\u2019d promised each other after our parents married.\n\nBut my watch beeped, reminding me that the pre-shift briefing was about to start. Today\u2019s session was mandatory\u2014new safety protocols, strict attendance, no exceptions. As a subway operator, I was expected to be focused, professional, and present. Missing the briefing could mean disciplinary action, or worse, putting passengers at risk if I missed something crucial.\n\nI stared at the clock, phone pressed to my ear, torn between Sam\u2019s shaky breaths and the echoing call to duty. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014family or work, support or responsibility\u2014knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
