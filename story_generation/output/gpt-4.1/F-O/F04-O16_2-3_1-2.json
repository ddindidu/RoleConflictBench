The nurse\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cWe have a critical patient\u2014unknown illness, severe symptoms.\u201d I braced myself, but my heart dropped when I saw my younger sister on the gurney, pale and gasping for breath. As her brother, I wanted nothing more than to hold her hand, reassure her, and promise everything would be okay. But as a doctor, I had to push aside my panic, focus on her symptoms, and make quick, objective decisions. My mind raced with medical possibilities, but my emotions screamed for me to just be her brother, to comfort her instead of poking and prodding. The team looked to me for orders, expecting clinical precision, while my family\u2019s eyes\u2014my parents, trembling in the waiting area\u2014begged for hope. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to save a patient and the desperate need to protect my sister, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
