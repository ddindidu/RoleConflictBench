He needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: Mrs. Lee\u2019s appointment in fifteen minutes. At the salon, Mrs. Lee was already in the chair, smiling as she asked if I could trim her fringe just a bit more. She was always so understanding, but I knew how much she valued these little details. My mind kept drifting back to my husband, picturing him alone, waiting for comfort I wasn\u2019t there to give. I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee, to listen and reassure her, but my heart was split. I felt the weight of both their needs pressing on me, each expecting my full presence, each deserving it. My hands trembled slightly as I picked up the scissors, torn between the woman in my chair and the man at home, both looking to me for something only I could give."}
