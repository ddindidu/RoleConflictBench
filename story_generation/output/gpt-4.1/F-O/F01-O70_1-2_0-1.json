Her eyes were wide with uncertainty as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re making the right choice about your future?\u201d I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of thoughtful conversation only a grandfather could give. But as I opened my mouth to respond, my phone buzzed. It was a notification from work: a customer\u2019s grocery delivery was due in less than thirty minutes, and the address was across town. The message was marked urgent; the customer had called twice already, saying they needed the groceries for dinner guests arriving soon.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My granddaughter\u2019s hopeful gaze reminded me of my responsibility to guide her, to be present and wise. Yet, the ticking clock and the company\u2019s strict delivery policy echoed in my mind\u2014late deliveries meant complaints, maybe even losing my job. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being the steady presence my granddaughter needed and the reliable worker my job demanded. I sat there, caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
