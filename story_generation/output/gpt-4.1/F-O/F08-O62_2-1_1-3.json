My granddaughter, Emma, sat on the edge, her shoulders slumped, toes tracing circles in the water. I could see the worry in her eyes, the way she avoided my gaze. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she\u2019d always come to me for. I wanted to ask her what was wrong, to remind her she was never alone with her troubles.\n\nBut then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a few pool chairs left askew by the last group. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep the area tidy and safe, to make sure everything was in order. The supervisor had been strict about it lately, and I knew I\u2019d be held accountable if I let things slide. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Emma, who needed her grandmother, and toward my duty, which demanded my attention elsewhere. I sat frozen, torn between the roles, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
