As a grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to spend the afternoon with my children and grandchildren, sharing stories and laughter over homemade pie. The calendar reminder blinked on my phone as I set up the picnic table near the pool, my heart full of anticipation. But as I glanced over the water, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. I spotted a child\u2014someone else\u2019s, not my own\u2014struggling in the deep end, a place clearly marked off-limits. My training screamed at me to act, to enforce the safety rules and protect every child, not just my own flesh and blood. Yet, I could feel the eyes of my family on me, expecting me to be present, to cherish these rare moments together. My chest tightened as I stood at the edge, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to every swimmer in my care. The laughter behind me faded into a blur as I wrestled with what I had to do next."}
