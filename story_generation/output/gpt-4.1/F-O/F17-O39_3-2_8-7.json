She starts talking, her voice trembling, about how hard things have been lately\u2014her worries about money, about Dad\u2019s health, about everything. She looks at me, searching for comfort, and I feel the weight of her need settle on my shoulders. I want to stay, to listen, to be the child she can lean on, but my phone buzzes with a reminder: the safety briefing at the site starts in two minutes. If I\u2019m late, the foreman will call me out in front of everyone, maybe even send me home for the day. The team depends on me to be there, to pull my weight, to follow the rules. My mother\u2019s voice cracks, and I reach for her hand, but my mind is already at the construction site, picturing the crew gathering without me. My heart pounds as I sit there, torn between the person my mother needs and the worker my team expects."}
