My little brother\u2019s text flashed on the screen: \u201cAbout to try the new trick. Wish me luck!\u201d I pictured him, helmet askew, grinning at the top of that cracked, steep ramp behind our house. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But right now, I was on duty, expected to drive the ambulance safely to the satellite station for the shift change. I couldn\u2019t just pull over or speed up to get there faster. My supervisor had drilled it into us\u2014no distractions, no rushing, no exceptions. But my brother\u2019s safety gnawed at me. What if he fell? What if he needed help and I wasn\u2019t there? My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the urge to call him, to warn him, and the responsibility to keep the ambulance steady and safe. The city blurred past, and my heart pounded, caught between the flashing lights of duty and the tug of family."}
