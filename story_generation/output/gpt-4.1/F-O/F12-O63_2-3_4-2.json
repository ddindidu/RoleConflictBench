The kids\u2019 uniforms are buried somewhere in that pile, and I know if I don\u2019t get to it now, we\u2019ll be scrambling in the morning. But just as I reach for the detergent, my work phone rings. I\u2019m still on the clock as a telemarketer, and the name flashing on the screen is one of our oldest customers. I answer, and immediately, he\u2019s raising his voice, questioning the legitimacy of our latest offer, demanding details I barely have time to explain. My supervisor expects me to handle these calls with patience and professionalism, to keep the customer satisfied and the account intact. I can hear the washing machine\u2019s empty hum behind me, and my mind races\u2014do I put the call on hold and risk my job, or do I let the laundry wait and risk disappointing my family? The weight of both worlds presses in, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
