She looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in her eyes. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, her voice light, but I caught the hint of strain. I wanted to sit beside her, listen, and offer comfort\u2014she deserved that from me as her husband. But as I glanced around, I noticed dust gathering on the shelves and crumbs scattered on the floor. The kitchen sink was full, and the bathroom needed scrubbing. My mind raced with the checklist of chores I was expected to complete as the housekeeper. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, caught between the urge to drop everything and be the supportive partner she needed, and the pressure to keep the house spotless, as was expected of me. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, paralyzed, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
