My wife poured herself some tea and sat across from me, her eyes tired but warm. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked, her voice gentle. I knew she wanted more than a quick answer\u2014she wanted me to share, to really talk. That\u2019s what we promised each other: open communication, no matter how busy we got.\n\nBut my break was almost over. The telemarketing compliance system was ruthless; if I wasn\u2019t back on calls exactly on time, it would flag me. Too many flags, and I\u2019d be called in for a warning\u2014or worse. I glanced at the clock, feeling the seconds slip away. My wife waited, expecting me to open up, to be present. My job demanded I return to my headset, no excuses. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
