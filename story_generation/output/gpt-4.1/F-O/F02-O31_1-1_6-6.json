The minivan in front of me was double-parked, blocking a hydrant, but the driver\u2014a tired-looking woman\u2014pleaded that she was only inside for a minute, picking up her sick child. I knew the rules: as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to treat everyone fairly, and not let personal feelings sway my decisions. But my mind wandered to my own son, who had been begging for a Nintendo for months. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it if I could save enough this month, but money was tight. Issuing this ticket would mean a fine for her, but it would also mean a little overtime for me\u2014just enough to keep my promise. My heart twisted as I weighed the badge on my chest against the look of hope in my son\u2019s eyes. The pressure of being a good father and a fair officer pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, the pen hovering over the ticket book, unable to move."}
