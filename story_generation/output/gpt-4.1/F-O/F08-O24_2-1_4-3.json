My daughter had planned this evening for weeks, hoping we could all be together to celebrate her promotion. I wanted nothing more than to be present, to listen, to share in their joy. But my laptop sat open in front of me, the blank document for the scheduling order blinking accusingly. The court expected my draft by Friday, and I knew the attorneys would be waiting for my guidance. My mind kept drifting to the legal arguments and deadlines, even as my heart tugged me toward the warmth of my family. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be a wise, loving grandmother and a diligent, impartial judge. I closed my eyes for a moment, torn between the laughter in the next room and the silent demands of my profession, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my best at the same time."}
