It was my younger brother, his name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, knowing the rules\u2014no personal calls during shift, especially not when I was responsible for making sure everything was ready for the next emergency. But I also knew that when he called during the day, it meant something was wrong. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. That was what being a sister meant: dropping everything when he needed me, being his safe place. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to put patients first, to be prepared for any call that might come in. My supervisor trusted me to keep the kit stocked and ready, and any mistake could cost someone dearly. I stared at the phone, torn between the duty to my patients and the promise I\u2019d made to my brother. My hands shook as the phone kept ringing, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, demanding I choose."}
