My stepchildren\u2019s school was letting out early today, and I\u2019d promised to be there\u2014my first time picking them up alone, a small but important step in building trust. I could already picture their anxious faces scanning the crowd, hoping I\u2019d show up. But just as I reached for my coat, the ER doors burst open. A nurse rushed in, wheeling a patient whose arm was swollen and red, the infection spreading before our eyes. The team looked to me for orders, expecting swift, decisive action. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the children waiting for me, needing reassurance and presence; the patient needing my expertise, my immediate attention. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids\u2014don\u2019t be late.\u201d My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the oath I\u2019d taken at work, each demand urgent, each expectation absolute."}
