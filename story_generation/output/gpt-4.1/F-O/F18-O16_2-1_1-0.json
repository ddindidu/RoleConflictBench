But as a doctor, I knew I had to be thorough, to listen carefully, to not overlook anything that could be serious. My phone buzzed with a reminder to review her test results, but before I could sit down, I saw my younger brother slumped at the kitchen table, his backpack tossed aside, eyes red and puffy. He didn\u2019t look up when I called his name. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide his feelings, but I could see the pain etched on his face. As his sibling, I wanted to drop everything, sit beside him, and let him talk about his day, to be the support he needed. But the weight of my responsibility as a doctor pressed on me; my patient was waiting for answers, and I couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake. Torn between comforting my brother and fulfilling my duty to my patient, I stood frozen, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
