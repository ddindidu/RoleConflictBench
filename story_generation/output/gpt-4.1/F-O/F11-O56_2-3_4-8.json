Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the garlic bread, feel the warmth of everyone gathered around the table. As a sister, I knew how much these family dinners meant, especially to Mom, who always worried we were drifting apart. But right now, I was standing behind my client, her hair thick with product, the strands clinging together in stubborn knots. As her hairdresser, I was expected to take my time, wash and condition thoroughly, and make sure every tangle was gone before I even thought about picking up my scissors. She had a big event tonight, and she was counting on me to make her look her best. My heart pounded as I checked the clock\u2014if I rushed, I\u2019d disappoint my client; if I stayed, I\u2019d let my family down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, torn, hands trembling slightly as I reached for the shampoo."}
