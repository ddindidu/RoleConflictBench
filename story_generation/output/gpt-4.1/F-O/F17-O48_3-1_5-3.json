Today was the day of my grandmother\u2019s memorial, and my parents had asked me to lead the incense offering\u2014a role usually reserved for the eldest child. They said it was important, that I honor our family and keep our traditions alive. I could see the pride and hope in their eyes, and I wanted so much to make them happy. But as I buttoned my uniform, my phone buzzed with a reminder: morning rounds at the care home. Mrs. Lee needed her blood pressure checked at 8:00 sharp, and Mr. Carter always waited for me to take his temperature before breakfast. My supervisor had stressed the importance of punctuality and accuracy, especially with the new health protocols. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectations pulling me home, my patients\u2019 needs anchoring me at work. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the incense and the stethoscope, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
