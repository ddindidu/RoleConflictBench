Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014an urgent Supreme Court ruling had just overturned the very precedent I was referencing. My heart pounded. I knew I had to stop, reassess, and ensure the trial remained fair and lawful. But as I paused, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my sister: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight\u2019s the big dinner! I can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you.\u201d She\u2019d always been there for me, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her. The expectation was clear\u2014family comes first, we celebrate each other\u2019s milestones. Yet, the courtroom demanded my undivided attention, especially now. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the duty to uphold justice clashing with the promise I\u2019d made as a brother. My mind raced, torn between the bench and the dinner table, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
