It was my stepbrother, his voice trembling as he told me about the bad news\u2014something about our dad\u2019s health. He needed me, just to talk, to be there. My heart twisted; I knew he counted on me, especially since we\u2019d promised to support each other after our parents married. But just then, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, glancing at the meter. I glanced at my phone, my brother\u2019s name still on the screen, and then at the travelers, who were clearly in a hurry. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be professional, efficient, and helpful\u2014no time for personal calls or distractions. But as a step-sibling, I was supposed to be present, to listen, to comfort. My hands hovered over the trunk, my mind racing between the weight of my brother\u2019s pain and the immediate demands of my job. I could feel the pressure building, torn between being the sibling he needed and the driver my passengers expected."}
