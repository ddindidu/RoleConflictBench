Mom had been planning this family dinner for weeks, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories like always. But my laptop screen glared back at me, lines of code and error messages taunting me. The project deadline loomed, and the team was waiting on my core module to move forward. Every minute I spent away from my work meant the build stayed stalled, and I could almost feel my manager\u2019s disappointment through the terse emails. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations against the cold urgency of my engineering responsibilities. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, the one who showed up, but I was also the linchpin engineer, the one who couldn\u2019t let the team down. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which one I would let down tonight."}
