My son, eyes wide and cheeks flushed, had been caught slipping a chocolate bar into his pocket at the grocery store. The store manager\u2019s stern voice echoed in my ears, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a mother\u2014to teach him honesty, to show him right from wrong. I wanted to rush home, to sit him down and talk about trust and consequences, to be the mother he needed in that moment.\n\nBut here I was, white coat on, standing behind the counter. A customer handed me a prescription for her daughter\u2019s cold. I checked the label, my hands moving automatically, but my thoughts kept drifting. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t afford distraction. Every pill, every instruction mattered. The expectation was clear: accuracy, focus, professionalism. Yet my heart tugged me in another direction, torn between the duty to my patients and the urgent need to guide my child. The phone rang, snapping me back, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
