We\u2019d argued that morning\u2014something about him borrowing my headphones without asking. I knew I should talk to him, clear the air, and rebuild the trust between us. That\u2019s what a good sister would do: communicate openly, resolve the tension, and show him respect.\n\nBut just then, Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walked in. She always expected a warm greeting and a few minutes of friendly conversation before her appointment. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Patel looked straight at me, her eyes lighting up in anticipation. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my brother waiting for a sign that I cared, Mrs. Patel expecting the comfort and attention she\u2019d come to love. My heart pounded as I stood between them, torn by the demands of being both a sister and a hairdresser, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
