He asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and I wanted to tell him about the stress, the endless calls, the rude customers. But just then, my work phone buzzed\u2014an irate customer on the line, voice sharp and demanding, questioning every detail of the offer I\u2019d just explained. My training echoed in my mind: stay calm, answer every objection, don\u2019t let frustration show. But my husband was waiting, expecting me to share, to be open, to let him in. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me wanting to close the laptop and talk honestly, the other needing to keep my professional mask on, to handle the customer with patience and clarity. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to both voices at once, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides."}
