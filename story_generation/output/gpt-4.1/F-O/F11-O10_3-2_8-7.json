My mind raced, searching for the right words to clarify the numbers, knowing how important it was to maintain professionalism and accuracy. Just as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed with a message from my younger sister. She was upset about a misunderstanding we\u2019d had the night before, asking if we could talk and clear the air. I could almost hear her voice, hurt and uncertain, and I knew how much it mattered to her that we resolve things openly and respectfully.\n\nMy client\u2019s voice brought me back, their tone growing impatient. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my responsibility as an accountant demanded my full attention, but as a sister, I couldn\u2019t ignore my sibling\u2019s need for reassurance and understanding. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt torn, my heart heavy with the weight of choosing which role to honor in this moment."}
