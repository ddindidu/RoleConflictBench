It\u2019s my stepdad, asking if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m feeling okay, if I can call him and Mom tonight. I know they expect me to check in every day, to share how things are going, to reassure them that I\u2019m not drifting away. But my laptop screen is filled with Slack messages from the product and QA teams, all waiting for my feedback on the new feature specs. The design document deadline is tomorrow, and everyone\u2019s depending on my technical input to move forward. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family wanting connection, my team needing collaboration. I stare at the blinking cursor in my chat window, torn between typing a message to my parents or jumping into the team call. My chest tightens as I realize I can\u2019t give both what they want at the same time."}
