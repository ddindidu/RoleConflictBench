I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her voice, the way she always did when she was overwhelmed. As her older sibling, I knew she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to remind her she was capable. But as I glanced up, the blinking red light on the centrifuge reminded me of my other reality. The lab was tense\u2014our safety audit was in two hours, and I\u2019d already been warned about the equipment issues. If I didn\u2019t fix them now, the whole team could be in trouble. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between calling my sister and logging the maintenance report. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest: the expectation to be the steady anchor for my family, and the responsibility to keep my lab safe and my colleagues out of harm\u2019s way.
