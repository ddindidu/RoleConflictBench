He\u2019d barely spoken since he arrived, and I could sense the weight he carried. As his grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to offer him comfort, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned over the years, to remind him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed urgently on the table beside me\u2014a call from the station. A protest downtown was turning volatile, and all available officers were being summoned. \n\nDuty pressed on me like a heavy coat. As a police officer, I was expected to be there, to help keep the peace, to enforce the law no matter how tense things became.
