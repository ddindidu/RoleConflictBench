The radio crackles\u2014there\u2019s a minor signal delay up ahead. I know I need to adjust the speed, keep the train on schedule, and make sure every passenger feels safe. My mind is calculating distances and timing, but my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad seems down today.\u201d I remember how I promised to check in more, to be the daughter who notices when things aren\u2019t right at home. My heart aches with guilt.
