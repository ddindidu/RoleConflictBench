I wanted to tell her everything, to be the open, honest partner she deserved. But my mind kept drifting back to the storm, the wipers barely keeping up as I gripped the wheel, the siren wailing. The patient in the back was fading fast, and every second counted, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I had to drive fast, but not so fast that I\u2019d risk all our lives. My wife reached for my hand, expecting me to share, to let her in. But how could I explain the fear, the pressure, the split-second choices? She wanted my words, my vulnerability, but all I could think about was the weight of the steering wheel in my hands, the responsibility to get everyone to safety. I felt torn, caught between the need to be present with her and the memory of being utterly present behind the wheel, both roles demanding everything from me at once."}
