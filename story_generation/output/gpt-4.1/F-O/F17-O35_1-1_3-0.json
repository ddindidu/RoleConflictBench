Every year, I\u2019m expected to be there, to light the candle, to recite the blessing, to show I still value what they taught me. But here I was, in the operator\u2019s cabin, the hum of the subway beneath my feet. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cPre-departure checks are non-negotiable. Safety and punctuality come first.\u201d I looked at the checklist in my hand, the clock ticking closer to departure. If I rushed, maybe I could call in, but if I missed a step, even a non-critical one, I\u2019d be letting down my team, risking a delay, maybe even a safety issue. My family\u2019s faces swam before my eyes, their disappointment palpable. I felt torn in two, the weight of their expectations pressing from both sides, unsure which part of myself I was about to betray."}
