My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in fifteen minutes, and she\u2019d begged me all week to be there. I could still hear her voice this morning, \u201cPromise you\u2019ll come, Mom?\u201d I\u2019d promised, knowing how much it meant to her, how she\u2019d scan the crowd for my face. But the radio crackled, dispatch calling all available units to a protest downtown. The situation was escalating\u2014shouting, shoving, the threat of violence hanging in the air. As a police officer, I was expected to respond, to help keep the peace, to protect the community. My uniform felt heavier than ever, the badge on my chest a reminder of my duty. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the classroom where my daughter waited, hoping to see me, and the city streets where my presence might make a difference. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
