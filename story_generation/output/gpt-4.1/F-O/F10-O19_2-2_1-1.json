It was for Mr. Lee, a regular with a complicated list of medications. I knew how much he depended on getting everything right, and I could already feel the pressure mounting as I double-checked the dosages and interactions. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Thursday, the day I always called my parents. Mom would be waiting, probably already sitting by the phone, eager to hear about my week and to tell me about Dad\u2019s garden or her new recipe. I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant. My hands trembled slightly as I measured out the pills, torn between the duty to my patient and the promise I made to my family. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
