Dispatch had just radioed in: a man in his fifties, chest pain, shortness of breath\u2014classic signs of a heart attack. My mind should have been focused on the route, the patient, the protocols. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from home: \u201cDid you get the Nintendo? He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d My stepson\u2019s hopeful face flashed in my mind, the promise I\u2019d made to him echoing louder than the siren. I knew how much it meant to him, how much it meant to my partner that I keep my word and help build trust. But the overtime shifts I\u2019d picked up to afford the game left me exhausted, and now, with a life on the line, I was torn. The weight of my uniform pressed against me, a reminder of my duty to the patient. But the weight of my promise pressed just as hard. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I approached the intersection where I\u2019d have to choose which role to answer first."}
