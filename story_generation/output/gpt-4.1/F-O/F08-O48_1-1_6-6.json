It\u2019s my daughter, reminding me about the family video call tonight\u2014our tradition before every holiday. I know how much it means to everyone, especially the grandkids, to see me and hear my voice. But right now, I\u2019m sitting beside Mrs. Carter, one of my patients, who\u2019s been unusually quiet all afternoon. She looks at me with tired eyes, her hands fidgeting with the blanket. I can sense her loneliness, the way she lingers on every word I say, hoping for a little more time, a little more warmth. My heart aches, torn between the comfort my family expects from me and the comfort Mrs. Carter needs right now. I want to be present for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. My phone vibrates again, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which one I should answer first."}
