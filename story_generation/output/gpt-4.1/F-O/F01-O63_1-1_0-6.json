My grandson, Ethan, plopped down across from me, his eyes searching. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do after high school?\u201d he asked, voice uncertain. I could see he needed more than a quick answer\u2014he needed the kind of talk that takes time, the kind I always promised I\u2019d give.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: break time was almost over. The call volume was light today, and my supervisor had said we could be flexible, but I knew the expectation\u2014don\u2019t stretch it too far, don\u2019t make a habit of it. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Ethan\u2019s hopeful face tugged at my heart, while the ticking clock in my mind reminded me of my job\u2019s demands. I wanted to give him the wisdom he deserved, but I also needed to keep my work record clean. My hands fidgeted on the table, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which voice to answer first."}
