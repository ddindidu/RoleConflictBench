My wife\u2019s voice floats in from the living room, reminding me that her parents will arrive in just a few hours. The list of chores is endless\u2014vacuuming, dusting, setting the table\u2014and she\u2019s counting on me to help make everything perfect. I nod, promising I\u2019ll be right there, but my phone buzzes with a calendar alert: my break is over in two minutes. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to stick to my schedule, every second accounted for, every call logged. Management has been strict lately, watching for anyone who stretches their break, even for a moment. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my wife\u2019s hopeful eyes, my supervisor\u2019s stern emails. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the ringing phone in my home office and the vacuum cleaner waiting in the corner. I know I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demand it."}
