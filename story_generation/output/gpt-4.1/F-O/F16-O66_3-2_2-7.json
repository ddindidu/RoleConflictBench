They\u2019d barely slept in days, and I could see how much they needed me\u2014just to listen, to be there, to reassure them that things would be okay. My phone buzzed. It was a ride request: two travelers at the train station, lots of luggage, and a long trip across town. I knew the station was busy, and if I didn\u2019t take the job, I might not get another fare for hours. The travelers would expect me to help with their heavy suitcases, to be patient as they sorted out splitting the fare, to be the professional driver they needed. But my partner\u2019s eyes pleaded with me not to leave, not now. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to stay and be the support my partner needed, the other knowing that missing work meant less money for bills and groceries. My heart pounded as I stood between the door and the table, caught between the demands of love and responsibility, not knowing which way to turn."}
