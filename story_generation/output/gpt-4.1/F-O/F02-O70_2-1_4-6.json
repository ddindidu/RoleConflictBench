My phone buzzed\u2014my customer was already at the entrance, expecting a quick, professional handoff. At the same moment, I saw my son darting between aisles, laughing and nearly knocking over a display. As a father, I knew I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, to calmly but firmly correct his behavior right then and there. But as a delivery person, I was expected to greet my customer with a smile, be polite, and not keep them waiting. My heart pounded as I glanced between my son and the entrance. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my immediate attention. I hesitated, torn between the lesson my son needed and the professionalism my job required, feeling the stress of not knowing which expectation to meet first."}
