She\u2019d just gotten her dream job, and our family group chat was buzzing with plans for a surprise dinner. I wanted to be there, to celebrate her, to be the supportive sister she deserved. But at the same time, my headset buzzed with the voice of Mr. Harris, a long-time customer, his tone sharp and skeptical. \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t just another scam?\u201d he demanded, his frustration palpable. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever let a customer feel unheard.
