My phone buzzed with a message from my spouse: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, your family\u2019s coming in two hours. Can you vacuum and tidy the living room?\u201d I looked around at the scattered shoes and dust on the floor, knowing how much it mattered to both of us that the house looked perfect for our guests. But as I turned to grab the vacuum, my radio crackled\u2014one of the pool attendants was calling in sick. I hurried outside to the pool deck, where a few chairs were out of line, not dangerous but not up to standard either. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe expect everything to be in order, always.\u201d I felt torn, standing between the messy living room and the poolside, both demanding my attention, both expecting me to step up. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my spouse\u2019s eyes against the stern look of my supervisor. I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
