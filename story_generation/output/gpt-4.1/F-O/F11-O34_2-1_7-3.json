My sister\u2019s text buzzed on my phone: \u201cCan we talk? I need you.\u201d She and I had argued last night, and I knew she wanted to patch things up. I was supposed to be patient, to listen, to show her I respected her feelings, even when we disagreed. But right now, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through my headset, requesting the altimeter setting. My job demanded precision, calm, and immediate response\u2014no room for distraction or delay. My sister\u2019s words replayed in my mind, guilt gnawing at me for not being there for her. At the same time, the responsibility of guiding aircraft safely through the sky pressed on me. I felt torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, patient, and clear. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, caught between the voice in my ear and the message on my phone, unsure which role to answer first."}
