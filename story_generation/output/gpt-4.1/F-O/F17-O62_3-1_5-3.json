My family watched, waiting for me to honor our tradition, to show that I understood the importance of our heritage. But my mind kept drifting back to the pool, where I worked as a lifeguard. I remembered the supervisor\u2019s reminder that morning: \u201cEverything must be perfect\u2014no exceptions. Even the smallest detail matters.\u201d I had noticed the pool chairs were a bit out of line, not enough to be dangerous, but enough to break the standard I was supposed to uphold. My hands trembled as I held the candle, feeling the weight of my family\u2019s hopes and the responsibility of my job pressing in from both sides. I wanted to make my parents proud, to show respect for our traditions, but I also couldn\u2019t shake the nagging thought that I was letting my team down. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
