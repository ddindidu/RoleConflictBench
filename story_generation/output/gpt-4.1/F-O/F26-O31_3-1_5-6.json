My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she told me that my grandson had fallen and needed stitches. \u201cCan you come to the hospital?\u201d she pleaded. My heart clenched; I promised I\u2019d be there as soon as I could. But as I stepped outside, I spotted a car parked illegally in a spot reserved for ambulances. The driver, a frazzled young woman, explained she was rushing her sick child inside. Technically, I should issue a ticket\u2014rules are rules, and fairness is part of my duty. But I also know what it\u2019s like to be desperate for help, to need a little understanding. My mind raced between the badge on my chest and the ache in my heart for my family. I could hear my grandson\u2019s cries in my mind, but I also felt the weight of my uniform and the trust the community places in me. I stood there, torn, the ticket book heavy in my hand, my family waiting, and my sense of duty pulling me in the opposite direction."}
