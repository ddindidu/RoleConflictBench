It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how important it was to show up, to be part of the family, especially since I was still the \u201cnew\u201d one. I wanted to be there, to prove I belonged. But the clock on the wall said 3:30, and my shift didn\u2019t end until 6. \n\nA couple walked up to my register, arms full of groceries. I forced a smile, scanning their items, asking about their day, trying to sound cheerful. My manager expected me to be friendly, focused, and never distracted. But my mind kept drifting to the family van, probably already packed, my dad waiting, hoping I\u2019d make the effort. I felt torn, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety. I wanted to be a good step-sibling, but I also needed this job. As I handed the couple their receipt, I wondered how I could possibly choose between letting down my family or my boss."}
