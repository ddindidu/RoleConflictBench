The national continuing education program was mandatory, and I knew how important it was to stay updated for my patients\u2019 sake. But my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? Mom\u2019s not doing well.\u201d My heart clenched. My son-in-law had lost his job, and the whole family was reeling. I knew they needed me, not just as a grandmother but as the steady voice that kept everyone connected. Yet, the webinar was live, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss it\u2014my license renewal depended on these credits. I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent need to be present for my family and the professional responsibility that defined so much of my daily life. The voices from the webinar faded into the background as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
