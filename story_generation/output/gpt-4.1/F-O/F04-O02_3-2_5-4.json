It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My family had planned a big holiday celebration, something we hadn\u2019t done in years. As a brother, I knew how much it meant to them, especially to my parents who rarely asked for anything. But as I sat at my desk, blueprints and safety checklists spread out before me, my mind raced with the new engineering standard that had just been released. The deadline for compliance was tight, and my team was relying on me to ensure everything was up to code before the product launch. If I missed something, it could mean a costly delay or worse, a safety risk. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectation for togetherness, and my professional duty to uphold safety and standards. My heart ached with the thought of disappointing either side, and I found myself frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the gravity of my responsibility."}
