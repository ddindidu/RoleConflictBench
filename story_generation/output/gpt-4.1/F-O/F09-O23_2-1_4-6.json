I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to gently but firmly remind him that running in public places wasn\u2019t acceptable. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the networking event starts in ten minutes.\u201d I glanced at my watch, feeling the pressure mount. At the event, I was approached by an acquaintance who, with a friendly smile, asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story behind your latest client?\u201d I felt the weight of my professional responsibility\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between the urge to correct my son\u2019s behavior and the need to uphold my ethical duties as a lawyer. The expectations pressed in from both sides: be a good mother, be a good lawyer. My heart pounded as I stood in the supermarket, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
