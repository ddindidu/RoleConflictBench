He asked, as he always did, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I wanted to answer honestly, to share the weight pressing on my chest, but the words caught in my throat. As a wife, I knew he expected openness, a window into my world. But as a lawyer, I was bound by a different code\u2014one that demanded silence, especially now, with opposing counsel circling and pressing for information that could devastate my client. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for more than the vague, \u201cIt was busy.\u201d I could feel his disappointment, the subtle shift in his posture. Inside, I wrestled with the urge to confide in him, to let him in, and the unyielding duty to protect my client\u2019s trust. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding loyalty, each with its own cost. I stared at my plate, the conversation hanging unfinished, my heart torn between the woman he married and the lawyer I had to be."}
