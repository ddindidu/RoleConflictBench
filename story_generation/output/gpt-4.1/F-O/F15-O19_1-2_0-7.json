The workshop on the new prescription guidelines was in full swing, and I knew how important it was to stay updated\u2014my patients depended on me to give them the best advice. The speaker\u2019s words blurred as my phone buzzed with a reminder: school pick-up in thirty minutes. My kids would be waiting, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I could picture their disappointment if I was late, the way their shoulders would slump, the questions in their eyes. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the most crucial part of the workshop, the section on drug interactions that had already caused issues in our community. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my children and my responsibility as a pharmacist. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my phone, caught in the impossible space between being the parent my children needed and the professional my patients trusted."}
