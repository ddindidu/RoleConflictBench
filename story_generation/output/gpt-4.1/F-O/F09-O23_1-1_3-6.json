At home, I was the mother, gently reminding her to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d teaching her why honesty and respect matter. Later, at the event, I found myself chatting with an acquaintance who, between sips of wine, asked about a high-profile client\u2019s case. \u201cYou must have some juicy details,\u201d she laughed, nudging me for gossip. I felt the weight of my roles pressing in\u2014at home, I preached integrity and discipline, but as a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality and professional ethics. My daughter\u2019s expectant eyes flashed in my mind, echoing the lessons I\u2019d tried to instill. Yet here, the expectation was to be sociable, to share just enough to fit in. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads of my two worlds, torn between the values I taught and the professional standards I lived by."}
