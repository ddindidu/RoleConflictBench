Mom had just reminded everyone about the family trip this weekend, her words laced with excitement and that gentle pressure only she could manage. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone needs to be there. It\u2019s been too long since we were all together.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to my brother, who\u2019d been looking forward to catching up.\n\nJust as I was about to reply, my work phone rang. It was a new client, sounding a bit anxious. \u201cHey, I know this is just a check-in, but could you walk me through the basics of the machine again? I\u2019m still not confident.\u201d I could hear the uncertainty in his voice, and I remembered how overwhelming these machines could be at first. My job wasn\u2019t just to fix things, but to make sure people felt supported and capable.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my presence, my laughter, my stories. My client needed my patience and expertise. I wanted to be there for both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and restless, unsure which call to answer first."}
