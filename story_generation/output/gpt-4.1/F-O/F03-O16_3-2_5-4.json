Our traditions meant everything to her, and I knew how much it would mean for me to step up, to honor our ancestors and show respect for our heritage. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from the hospital: my patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis and was waiting for me to explain what it meant for her life. She was anxious, her family desperate for answers and reassurance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family needing me to uphold our values, my patient needing my compassion and clarity. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, torn between the son my family expected and the doctor my patient needed."}
