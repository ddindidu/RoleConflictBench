Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at it, guilt pricking at me. I know she worries, especially since I moved out. She expects a quick reply, just a few words to let her know I\u2019m okay. But right now, I\u2019m at my station, headset on, eyes fixed on the radar. A pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cTower, request altimeter setting.\u201d It\u2019s routine, but every word matters. My supervisor expects me to be focused, precise\u2014lives depend on it. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. My thumb hovers over my phone, but my hand stays on the mic. I want to reassure my mom, but I can\u2019t risk distraction. The pilot waits, my mom waits, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, heart pounding, torn between the sky and home."}
