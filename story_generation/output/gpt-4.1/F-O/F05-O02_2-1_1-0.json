My wife paced the living room, her face tense. She\u2019d just come home, voice trembling, telling me about a major decision her boss had dropped on her\u2014one that could change her career. She needed me to listen, to help her sort through her fears and hopes. I could see it in her eyes: she wanted my full attention, my reassurance, my support.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the project at work. We were in the early stages, and my team was waiting for my input on a new design approach. I knew I could propose alternatives later, but the ideas were fresh in my mind now, and I worried they\u2019d slip away if I didn\u2019t capture them. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s need for comfort, my team\u2019s need for innovation. My heart ached as I tried to be present for her, but the engineer in me kept tugging at my thoughts, urging me not to lose momentum. I sat there, torn, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
