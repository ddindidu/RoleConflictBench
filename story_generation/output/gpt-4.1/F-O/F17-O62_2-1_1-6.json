It\u2019s our ritual\u2014me sitting on the break room bench, phone pressed to my ear, their voices filling the space between my lifeguard shifts. They expect to hear about my week, my classes, my friends, and I always ask about their health, their garden, the neighbors. Tonight, as I dial, I glance through the window and spot a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, giggling, no adult in sight. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNever leave the pool unsupervised, even for a minute.\u201d But my mom answers, her voice warm and expectant, and I hear the hope in her tone\u2014she wants to know I\u2019m okay, that I care enough to call. My heart pounds. I can\u2019t be both the attentive child and the vigilant lifeguard at this moment. The phone feels heavy in my hand as I watch the kids, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to keep others safe."}
