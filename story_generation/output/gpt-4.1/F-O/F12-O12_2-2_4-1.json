My mind races, searching for a cleaner, more efficient solution, but I can\u2019t focus. From the hallway, I hear the washing machine\u2019s insistent beep\u2014laundry\u2019s been sitting there since morning. My husband texted earlier, reminding me that our daughter needs her soccer uniform clean for tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d handle it tonight. \n\nI glance at the clock. If I dive into the code now, I might lose track of time and forget the laundry again. But if I get up to sort and fold, I\u2019ll break my flow, and the code review will have to wait. My team expects me to deliver polished work, but my family counts on me to keep things running at home. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, unable to satisfy either role without letting the other down."}
