It was Sunday, the day I always called my parents. I could already picture my mother waiting by the phone, eager to hear about my week, and my father chiming in with his usual questions about my health and work. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved out of town. But as I glanced up, I saw a young woman hesitating at the entrance, clutching her purse and scanning the salon with wide, uncertain eyes. She was clearly nervous, and I remembered how important it was to greet every client warmly, to make them feel at ease from the moment they walked in. My phone vibrated again, a reminder of my promise to my parents, while the new client\u2019s anxious gaze met mine, silently pleading for reassurance. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach, torn between the comfort my parents expected and the welcome my client needed."}
