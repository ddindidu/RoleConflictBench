The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow that pressed on my chest. I needed to take on more jobs, work longer hours, make sure there was enough in the bank for my family. My kids depended on me to keep a roof over their heads, and I couldn\u2019t let them down.\n\nBut as a carpenter, I knew the risks of rushing. Every nail, every saw blade, every piece of equipment needed careful inspection before I started the day\u2019s work. Skipping safety checks could mean an accident\u2014an injury that would keep me from earning anything at all. My boss expected me to follow every protocol, and my crew relied on me to set the standard.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I took the time to check every tool, I\u2019d lose precious hours\u2014hours I needed to finish the job and get paid. But if I hurried, I risked everything. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, torn between my family\u2019s needs and the safety of my hands."}
