Their eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance as they spoke about the impossible choice looming at work. I could feel the weight of their anxiety, the silent plea for comfort and guidance. I wanted nothing more than to hold their hand, to listen, to be the anchor they needed. But my radio crackled on the counter, a constant reminder that I was on standby. Any second, a call could come in\u2014a life hanging in the balance, waiting for me to respond without hesitation. My partner\u2019s voice trembled, and I reached out, but my mind was split. I was torn between the duty to be present for the person I loved and the responsibility to be ready for strangers in crisis. The tension twisted in my chest, knowing that whatever happened next, I couldn\u2019t fully be there for both."}
