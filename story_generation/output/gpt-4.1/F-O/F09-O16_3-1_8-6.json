My next patient, a young woman with a sore throat, waits outside. I know the symptoms\u2014red throat, fever, swollen glands\u2014likely strep. I should take my time, ask the right questions, and ensure I prescribe the correct antibiotics. But my mind keeps drifting to the bills stacked on the kitchen table at home. The home loan repayment is looming, and I need to pick up extra shifts to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. My son\u2019s school fees are due soon, too. The weight of being the family\u2019s provider presses on me, urging me to work faster, see more patients, bring in more income. But as a doctor, I owe each patient my full attention and care. I feel the tension in my chest\u2014torn between the need to be thorough and the pressure to move quickly. My hands hover over the patient\u2019s chart, my thoughts tangled between my duty as a mother and my responsibility as a doctor."}
