My mind was already running through the checklist for next week\u2019s shutdown\u2014every machine needed to be cleaned, oiled, and checked, and I was the only one trusted to do it right. The schedule was tight, and any delay could mean hours of lost production. As I sipped my coffee, I noticed my grandson slouched on the couch, his eyes fixed on the floor, shoulders heavy. He\u2019d barely spoken since he arrived, and I could sense something was weighing on him. I knew, as his grandfather, I should sit beside him, offer the kind of advice only years of living can provide. He needed me to listen, to help him find his way. But the thought of the machines, the pressure from the foreman, and the responsibility to keep everything running gnawed at me.
