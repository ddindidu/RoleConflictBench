My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that her parents would arrive in just a few hours and the house still needed vacuuming, dusting, and the guest room bed made. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation that we\u2019d present a spotless, welcoming home. But the text on my phone was from the plant manager: \u201cCritical bearing on Line 3 screeching\u2014possible shutdown. Need you ASAP.\u201d I could almost hear the grinding metal in my mind, knowing that if I didn\u2019t get there soon, the whole line could go down, costing hours of production and putting my reliability into question. My heart pounded as I looked at the half-mopped floor and the untouched laundry basket. I felt torn in two, the demands of my job and my home life pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting me to be fully present, fully responsible, and fully dependable. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
