She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, and if I could call her tonight. I\u2019d always made it a point to reply quickly, to keep our daily conversations going. It was something she cherished, and honestly, so did I. But as I typed out a response, my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that the upcoming shutdown was our only window for thorough machine maintenance. The schedule was tight, and every minute would count. I was expected to be on-site, focused, and available for any issues that might arise. The thought of missing a call or delaying a reply to my parents gnawed at me. I could already imagine my mother\u2019s worried tone if I went silent, but I also knew the team was counting on me to keep the machines running smoothly. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the comfort of family and the weight of responsibility at work, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
