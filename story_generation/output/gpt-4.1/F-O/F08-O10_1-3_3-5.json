The house was already filled with laughter and the scent of cinnamon, the family gathering in full swing just as I\u2019d promised everyone. My daughter called from the living room, asking if I\u2019d join them for a board game. I smiled, but my heart thudded with unease. \n\nOn the counter, my phone buzzed again. The email from the tax authority glared at me: a discrepancy in last quarter\u2019s filings, requiring an immediate response. As an accountant, I knew the gravity of such notices\u2014delays could mean penalties or worse. My mind raced through spreadsheets and regulations, the weight of professional responsibility pressing down. \n\nBut then, a small hand tugged at my apron, and my grandson\u2019s eyes sparkled with anticipation. I felt torn, the expectations of being the reliable grandmother clashing with the urgent demands of my career. The laughter from the living room mingled with the anxious thoughts swirling in my head, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
