As an architect, I knew the importance of every inch\u2014how a misplaced door or an awkward window could ruin the flow. I was deep in thought, mapping out the most functional arrangement, when my younger brother barged in, his voice loud and insistent. He wanted to talk about something that had upset him earlier, something I\u2019d brushed off as trivial. \n\nHe stood there, waiting for me to listen, but my mind was tangled in measurements and lines. I could feel the tension rising inside me. As a sister, I was supposed to be patient, to respect his feelings and differences, to put aside my own priorities and be present for him. But as an architect, I felt the pressure to get this design right, to not lose my train of thought. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I could sense my patience thinning, my focus splintering. I stared at my unfinished sketch, my brother\u2019s expectant face, and felt the weight of choosing which role to honor in that moment."}
