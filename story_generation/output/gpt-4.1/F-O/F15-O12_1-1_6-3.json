Attendance is optional, but I know how these things go\u2014if I don\u2019t show up, I\u2019ll miss out on shaping the new features, and my absence might be noticed. Collaboration is key in my role, and I want to be seen as a team player, someone invested in the product\u2019s future. But then, my mind drifts to the promise I made to my son last month: if I got my bonus, I\u2019d buy him that Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about. The bonus came, but with bills piling up and groceries costing more, I\u2019m not sure if I can justify the expense. I feel the weight of wanting to keep my word, to see his face light up, but also the pressure to be responsible, to make sure we\u2019re financially secure. My heart aches as I juggle these expectations\u2014being the reliable parent and the committed developer. The calendar reminder for the brainstorming session pops up, and I feel the knot in my stomach tighten, torn between two worlds that both need me, in different ways."}
