My screen flashes with another incoming call, and I force a smile into my voice, ready to handle the next customer\u2019s questions. The script is second nature by now, and most days, the objections are easy to manage. But today, my mind is somewhere else\u2014at home, with my partner. They\u2019re in the middle of a personal crisis, and I promised I\u2019d be there, emotionally present, a steady anchor in their storm. My phone buzzes with a message from them: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart aches. I know they expect me to listen, to reassure, to be the spouse they can lean on. But the call queue is long, and my supervisor is watching. I can\u2019t just step away. The customer on the line asks a question I\u2019ve answered a hundred times, but my thoughts are split, torn between the script in front of me and the person I love who needs me now more than ever. I grip the mouse, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I can let down."}
