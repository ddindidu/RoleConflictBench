Mom really wants you there.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken plea for me to be part of the family, to show up and belong. But as I tucked my phone away, Mrs. Carter, my patient, reached for my hand. Her eyes were wide, her voice trembling. \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer? I\u2019m just\u2026 scared to be alone tonight.\u201d I felt the weight of her need, the trust she placed in me as her nursing assistant.
