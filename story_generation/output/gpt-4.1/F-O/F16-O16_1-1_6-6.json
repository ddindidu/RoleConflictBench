They asked about my day, and I hesitated, thinking of the patient I\u2019d seen just hours before\u2014a young woman with strep throat, anxious for relief. As a doctor, I\u2019d carefully explained the treatment, prescribed antibiotics, and reassured her. But now, at home, my spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to share. I wanted to be open, to let them in, but my mind was still tangled in clinical details and the responsibility of making the right call for my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to communicate honestly with my partner, and the duty to remain professional and focused as a doctor. My spouse\u2019s gentle question hung in the air, and I wrestled with how much to reveal, torn between the intimacy of home and the boundaries of my profession."}
