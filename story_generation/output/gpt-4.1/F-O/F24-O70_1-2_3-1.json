My stepsister grinned, nudging me to vote for the amusement park. I knew how much it meant to Mom that I joined in, that I acted like part of the family. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a notification from work: a customer had requested a rush delivery\u2014groceries, needed before dinner. The address was across town, and the time window overlapped with our family planning session. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late. Customer is counting on you.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe make them think I didn\u2019t care. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk a bad review, maybe even my job. My heart pounded as everyone looked at me, waiting for my answer, while my phone vibrated again, reminding me of the promise I\u2019d made to someone else."}
