My shift as a telemarketer is still on, and I\u2019m squeezing in a quick grocery run during my scheduled break. My son darts between aisles, giggling, ignoring my whispered warnings. I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running in public isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014teaches discipline, sets boundaries, models values. But my break is almost over. If I\u2019m late, the compliance system will flag me, and I\u2019ll get another warning. Too many, and I could lose my job. My heart pounds as I watch him nearly collide with an elderly woman. I want to grab him, but my phone buzzes: \u201cBreak ending in 1 minute.\u201d I\u2019m torn\u2014do I risk my job to parent my child, or do I rush back to my car, headset on, pretending everything is fine?
