My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDinner starts in an hour. Don\u2019t be late\u2014everyone\u2019s counting on you to lead the blessing.\u201d It was our family\u2019s tradition, one I\u2019d honored since childhood. But in front of me lay a stack of files from the bail hearing I\u2019d just concluded. The defendant was still in custody, waiting for my written order to be released. The law demanded clarity and thoroughness, and I knew any delay or error could have serious consequences. My family expected me to be present, to uphold the rituals that defined us. The court expected me to be precise and prompt. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind torn between the warmth of home and the cold necessity of justice, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved at the same time."}
