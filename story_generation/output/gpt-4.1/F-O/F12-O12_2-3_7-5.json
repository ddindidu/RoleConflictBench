My husband walked in, his face drawn, and I could tell something was weighing on him. He hesitated, then asked if we could talk. I knew he expected me to listen, to share what was on my mind too\u2014like we always promised. But my mind was tangled in code and deadlines. The launch date for our new feature had just been moved up, and architects from three different teams were waiting on my decisions before they could move forward. My phone buzzed again: \u201cNeed your input ASAP.\u201d I looked at my husband, saw the worry in his eyes, and felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to be present for him, to communicate openly like we vowed, but the demands from work were screaming for my attention. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the wife he needed and the developer my team depended on, both at the exact same moment."}
