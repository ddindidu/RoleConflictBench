My heart pounded, not just from the adrenaline of duty, but from the name I\u2019d heard whispered in the background of the 911 call\u2014my brother\u2019s. As a police officer, I was trained to act swiftly, to enforce the law and protect lives at all costs. But as a sister, I was supposed to be patient, to understand his struggles, to build trust and respect even when we clashed. Now, those two worlds collided. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the badge on my chest and the blood in my veins. The dispatcher\u2019s voice urged me to be ready, to do what was necessary. But all I could think about was the boy I grew up with, the one I promised to always look out for. The sirens wailed louder, echoing the turmoil inside me, as I raced toward a moment that would test every part of who I am."}
