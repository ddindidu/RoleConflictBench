I knew I should remind him\u2014gently but firmly\u2014about putting things away, about respect for shared spaces, about the little habits that build good character. But my phone buzzed with a message from the foreman: a surprise inspection at the job site, and I\u2019d left my tools scattered after a rushed repair. If the site wasn\u2019t spotless, we could face a fine, or worse, someone could get hurt. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014here, the expectation to guide and nurture, to be the steady adult; there, the demand for vigilance and order, the responsibility for everyone\u2019s safety. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each urgent, each important, and I stood frozen, torn between the lesson my stepson needed and the duty waiting for me at the site."}
