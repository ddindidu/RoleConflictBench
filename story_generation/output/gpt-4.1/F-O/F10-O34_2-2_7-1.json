The holiday surge is in full swing, and the approach fixes are stacked with holding patterns. Pilots are requesting updates, and my supervisor\u2019s voice crackles in my ear, reminding me to keep delays minimal. My mind races, calculating separation, scanning for conflicts, trying to keep the airspace safe and efficient. \n\nBut in the back of my mind, I can\u2019t stop thinking about my parents. I saw them this morning, their faces drawn and tired, voices softer than usual. Mom barely touched her coffee, and Dad\u2019s hands trembled as he read the paper. I know they need me\u2014just a call, a few words to let them know I care, to ask if they\u2019re okay. I feel the weight of their unspoken worries pressing on my chest.\n\nYet, every second here demands my full attention. One mistake could mean disaster. My heart aches with the pull between the daughter I want to be and the controller I have to be. The radio blares another request, and my phone buzzes in my pocket. I close my eyes for a split second, torn between two worlds, not sure which one needs me more right now."}
