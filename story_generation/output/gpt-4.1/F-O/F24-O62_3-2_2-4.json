I knew he\u2019d just gotten the call about his dad\u2014bad news, the kind that leaves you hollow. My instinct was to drop everything and go to him, to be the sibling he needed, to sit beside him and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I took a step forward, my supervisor\u2019s voice crackled over the radio: \u201cLane three rope\u2019s snapped. Swim lessons start in ten. Fix it now, please.\u201d\n\nMy heart twisted. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything running smoothly, to make sure the pool was safe and ready. If I ignored the broken rope, the lessons would be delayed, kids would be disappointed, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. But if I walked away from Jamie, I\u2019d be failing him when he needed me most. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my job and the duty to my family, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which way to turn."}
