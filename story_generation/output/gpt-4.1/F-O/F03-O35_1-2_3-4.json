My mother had called twice already, reminding me to bring the special dish my grandmother used to make. It was a tradition, one I\u2019d never missed, and I could hear the hope in her voice that I\u2019d be there on time, upholding the values she\u2019d worked so hard to instill in me.\n\nBut as the subway rumbled beneath the city, my radio crackled with urgency. \u201cUnattended bag reported in car three. Possible threat. Operator, please respond.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew the protocol\u2014secure the train, alert the authorities, keep the passengers calm. Their safety was in my hands, and every second counted.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I acted now, I\u2019d be late for dinner, maybe miss it entirely. If I left it to someone else, I\u2019d betray the trust placed in me as an operator. My phone buzzed again\u2014my mother, no doubt checking if I was on my way. I stood at the edge of two worlds, torn between the warmth of family tradition and the cold responsibility of duty, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
