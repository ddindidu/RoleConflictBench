My manager had already reminded me twice to keep things moving, and I could feel the impatience in every sigh and shifting foot. As a cashier, I knew I had to stay focused, process each transaction quickly and accurately, and not let the pressure get to me. But then my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter. \u201cDad, it\u2019s urgent. We need you at home. Please come as soon as you can.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I was expected to be there for my family, especially in times of crisis. I imagined my grandchildren\u2019s worried faces, my daughter\u2019s trembling voice. But here I was, stuck behind the register, responsible for a growing crowd and a job that demanded my full attention. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, torn between the duty to my family and the obligation to my work."}
