We always took this route home, and I was supposed to keep an eye on him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let him out of your sight.\u201d But the urgent notification flashing on my screen made my heart race. The lab\u2019s gas chromatograph was sending out warning alerts, and if I didn\u2019t get there soon, a hazardous leak could occur. My supervisor had drilled it into me: \u201cYou\u2019re responsible for the equipment\u2019s safety.\u201d I glanced at my brother, who was chattering about his day, oblivious to my growing panic.
