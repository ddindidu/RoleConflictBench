Her voice was thin, her words heavy with exhaustion. Dad barely spoke, just sighed and rubbed his temples. I know they need me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them that things will be okay. But now, behind the wheel, I have a different responsibility. The road ahead is a mess: orange cones, flashing signs, and a detour squeezing traffic into a single lane. Just as I slow down, I spot a group of children giggling near the curb, backpacks swinging. My heart pounds. I have to be extra careful, follow every rule, keep everyone safe. But my phone buzzes in the cupholder\u2014Mom again, probably needing to talk. I grip the wheel tighter, torn between pulling over to call her back or focusing on the road and the kids. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and for a moment, I can\u2019t breathe, caught between being the daughter they need and the driver these children depend on."}
