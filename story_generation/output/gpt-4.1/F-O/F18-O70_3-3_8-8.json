My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another customer message. I glanced down and saw a text: \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? It\u2019s late.\u201d I knew I had to reply quickly and professionally, but just as I started typing, I saw my brother step off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart jumped. I wanted to shout his name, to grab his arm, but the customer\u2019s message blinked on my screen, demanding a calm, polite response. My job depended on keeping customers happy, but my brother\u2019s safety was suddenly at risk. I felt torn, my fingers frozen over the phone, my eyes darting between my brother and the message. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest\u2014should I drop everything and yell, risking a rude reply to the customer, or keep my cool and trust my brother would be okay? The world seemed to pause as I stood there, caught between being a good sibling and a responsible delivery person."}
