I feel the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and explain why running in public isn\u2019t safe or polite. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another Slack notification from QA about that UI glitch.
