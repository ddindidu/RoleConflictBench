My children would be finishing school soon, waiting for me at the gate, their faces searching the crowd for mine. I promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014today was the last day before summer break, and they\u2019d been talking about it for weeks. But on my desk, the latest law review journal lay unopened, its crisp pages promising insight into new legal theories that could shape my next case. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay ahead, to know the law\u2019s every shift and nuance. My colleagues would be discussing these articles by tomorrow, and I dreaded being left behind. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d I stared at the journal, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My children\u2019s trust, my professional duty\u2014each pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down, knowing that either way, I would feel the sting of disappointment."}
