I can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and our family was gathering to celebrate her achievement. As her sister, I knew how much this meant to her\u2014and to me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other\u2019s milestones, no matter what.\n\nBut as I set my phone down, my work phone buzzed. The court clerk\u2019s voice was brisk: \u201cOfficer, you\u2019re required to testify in court tomorrow morning. Please review your notes and be prepared.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to uphold the law, and to never shirk my duty\u2014especially not when a case depended on my testimony.\n\nThe two worlds collided in my mind. My sister\u2019s shining face, her trust in me to show up. The weight of my badge, the oath I\u2019d taken. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations pulling me in opposite directions. I sat in silence, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
