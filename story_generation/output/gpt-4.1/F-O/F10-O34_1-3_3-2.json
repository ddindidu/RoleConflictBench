It was Lunar New Year, and my family\u2019s laughter echoed from the living room, where my father was preparing the ancestral altar. I was expected to join them soon, to light incense and recite prayers\u2014an unbroken tradition. But my phone buzzed urgently: a major route closure had just been reported, and dozens of flights were now circling, waiting for my instructions. My supervisor\u2019s message was clear\u2014every second counted to prevent chaos in the sky. My mother called my name, her voice warm and expectant, while my screen flashed with flight numbers and fuel warnings. My heart pounded as I stared at the headset, torn between the sacred rituals of my family and the lives depending on my calm command. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
