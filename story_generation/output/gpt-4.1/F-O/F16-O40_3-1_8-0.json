My partner sat across from me at the kitchen table, eyes searching mine, voice gentle but firm. \u201cWe need to talk about the medical bills,\u201d they said, \u201cand what we\u2019re going to do if your hours get cut again.\u201d I knew I owed them honesty, that we needed to lay everything out\u2014no secrets, no half-truths. But as the clock ticked closer to seven, my phone buzzed with a reminder: safety briefing at the site in thirty minutes. If I was late, I\u2019d miss the rundown on new equipment, and I couldn\u2019t risk cutting corners or putting anyone in danger. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made to always be open with my spouse and the responsibility to keep my crew\u2014and myself\u2014safe. I could see the worry in their eyes, feel the urgency in my own chest. I wanted to be present, to listen, but the job demanded my presence too. The silence stretched, heavy with everything unsaid, as I tried to figure out which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down."}
