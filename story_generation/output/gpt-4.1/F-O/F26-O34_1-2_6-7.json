My headset crackles with voices\u2014colleagues coordinating, pilots requesting new headings. Every second demands my full attention; a single lapse could mean disaster. Yet, my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s my daughter, reminding me about the family call tonight. The holiday is coming, and everyone expects me to be there, to share stories and laughter, to keep our tradition alive. I can almost hear my grandson\u2019s voice, asking if I\u2019ll bring his favorite cookies. But the storm outside grows fiercer, and the airspace is a tangled web. My team needs me focused, alert, present. My family needs me warm, attentive, connected. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I stare at the screen, the phone still buzzing in my hand."}
