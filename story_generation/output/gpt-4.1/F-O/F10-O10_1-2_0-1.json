Call us when you can.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past 8 p.m. on Sunday. I hadn\u2019t called home all week, only sent a quick text on Saturday. Guilt pricked at me; I knew how much my parents valued hearing my voice, especially since I moved out. But the numbers on my screen demanded my attention. The month-end close was looming, and I still had to reconcile two more accounts before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. My manager had reminded us all how crucial accuracy was, and I couldn\u2019t afford a mistake. I stared at my phone, torn. If I called home now, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk missing errors. If I waited, I\u2019d disappoint my parents again. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which role to let down tonight."}
