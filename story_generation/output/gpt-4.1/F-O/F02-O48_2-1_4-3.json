My son darts between the supermarket aisles, laughter echoing, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. As a father, I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and gently explain why we must respect public spaces, why discipline matters. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my shift at the hospital started ten minutes ago. I\u2019m supposed to be on the ward, checking Mrs. Lee\u2019s blood pressure, recording Mr. Patel\u2019s temperature, making sure no one is missed. My supervisor expects punctuality and precision; my patients depend on me. My son tugs at my sleeve, eyes wide and expectant, while my mind races with the knowledge that I\u2019m already late. I feel torn, the demands of fatherhood and duty to my patients pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
