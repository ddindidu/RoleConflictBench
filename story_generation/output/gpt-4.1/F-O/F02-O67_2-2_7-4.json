As I started the engine, my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cWe\u2019re out of groceries. Can you bring home some food? The kids are hungry.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew our bank account was nearly empty, and my overtime hours were the only thing keeping us afloat. Every shift I took meant a little more money for rent, for food, for my children\u2019s needs. But every call also meant I had to be fully present, focused on the patient in front of me, ready to offer comfort and care. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014my family\u2019s needs at home, and the stranger waiting in pain for my help. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to the patient who needed me now."}
