It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My family\u2019s holiday dinner was a tradition, and as the eldest brother, I was expected to help set the table, make the toast, and keep everyone laughing. But as I tucked my phone away, I heard quiet sobs from Room 214. Mrs. Evans, who\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, sat hunched on her bed, tears streaming down her face.
