I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, promised my daughter too. They expect me to show up, to laugh, to be present, to be the grandparent who never misses a moment. But as I buttoned my uniform, the radio crackled with urgency\u2014reports of a protest downtown, tempers flaring, crowds swelling. My sergeant\u2019s voice was clear: all available officers needed, now. I felt the weight of my badge pressing against my chest, the duty to protect and keep order, to be the officer my community relies on. My phone buzzed with a photo from my wife\u2014my granddaughter already setting the table, her smile wide with anticipation. My heart twisted. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family waiting at home and the call of the city needing my presence. Both sides expected me, both needed me, and I could feel the storm of disappointment and responsibility brewing inside me as I reached for my keys."}
