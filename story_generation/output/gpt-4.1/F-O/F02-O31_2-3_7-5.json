The fridge was nearly empty, and the kids needed new shoes. I knew I had to pick up extra shifts\u2014anything to keep us afloat. My phone buzzed, and dispatch\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress at Main and Fifth. Bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart pounded. I was off duty, but I was close by. I could be there in minutes, maybe save someone\u2019s life. But if I went, I\u2019d miss the meeting with my supervisor about overtime\u2014my only shot at getting the extra hours we desperately needed.
