The reminder flashed: \u201cOpen class at 2:00 PM.\u201d My stepdaughter had been talking about it for days, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But now, as the crane swung a heavy load overhead, I caught sight of my coworker, headphones in, oblivious, stepping right into danger. My supervisor always said safety was everyone\u2019s job, and I knew the risks\u2014one second could mean disaster. My heart pounded, torn between the urgent need to shout and stop an accident, and the guilt of knowing that if I did, I\u2019d be late for the open class, maybe miss it entirely. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
