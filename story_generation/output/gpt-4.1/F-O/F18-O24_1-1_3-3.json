My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us this time, right?\u201d she asked, and everyone looked at me expectantly. I wanted to say yes, to laugh and plan with them, to be the sibling who always showed up. But in the back of my mind, the unfinished scheduling order for a new case loomed. The deadline was tight, and I knew the attorneys and parties involved were counting on me to be thorough and clear. My mother\u2019s voice pulled me back: \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you with us.\u201d I felt the weight of their hopes, but also the professional responsibility pressing on my shoulders. My fingers itched to type, but my heart ached to belong. I smiled weakly, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold, precise demands of the law."}
