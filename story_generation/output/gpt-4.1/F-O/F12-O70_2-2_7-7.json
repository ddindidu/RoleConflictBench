I knew I should ask him what was wrong, open up about my own worries at work, and be the supportive wife he needed.

As a delivery person, I was expected to respond quickly, politely, and with all the right information. My husband glanced at me, waiting for me to say something, maybe to share what was on my mind or to ask about his day.
