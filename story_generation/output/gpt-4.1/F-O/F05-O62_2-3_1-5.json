She needed me\u2014my advice, my encouragement, my full attention. I could see the anxiety in her eyes, and I wanted nothing more than to be the supportive husband she deserved. But my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the pool: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if I didn\u2019t fix it right away, swimmers could be at risk. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and the thought of something going wrong gnawed at me. My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she asked what I thought she should do, but my mind was already racing through the steps to repair the filter. I felt torn in two, pulled by the need to be present for her and the duty to protect others. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to answer first, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
