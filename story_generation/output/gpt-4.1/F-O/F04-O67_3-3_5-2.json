My sister nudged me, reminding me it was my turn to share a story, and my father raised his glass, toasting to family. This holiday celebration was the first time in months we\u2019d all managed to gather. I felt the warmth of belonging, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d be present, fully engaged, not just in body but in spirit. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down. Dispatch: multi-vehicle collision, highway 17, critical injuries, immediate response needed. My heart pounded. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. Lives depended on me getting there fast, focused, ready. But as a brother, I saw my family\u2019s faces, their hope that I\u2019d finally put them first. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding all of me at once. I gripped my phone, torn between the call of duty and the call of home, feeling the impossible pull of two lives I couldn\u2019t live at the same time."}
