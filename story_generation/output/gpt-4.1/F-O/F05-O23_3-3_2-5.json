Her eyes, red from crying, searched mine for comfort. She needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my steady presence. The weight of her crisis pressed on me, and I wanted nothing more than to stay, to hold her, to promise that I\u2019d be there for every tear and every sleepless night. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder about the trial starting tomorrow. Months of preparation, a client\u2019s future on the line, and no room for postponement. My mind raced with legal arguments and cross-examinations, but my heart ached for the woman in front of me. I felt split in two, torn between the vows I made at the altar and the oath I took in the courtroom. Each expectation pulled at me, demanding all of me, and I sat there, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left wanting."}
