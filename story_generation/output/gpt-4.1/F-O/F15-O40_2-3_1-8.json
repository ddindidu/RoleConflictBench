My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there to watch. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was a client, frantic\u2014termites had eaten through a support beam in their living room, and the ceiling was starting to sag. They needed me there immediately to assess the damage and prevent a collapse. I could hear the panic in their voice, and I knew how dangerous it was to wait. My toolbox sat by the door, ready to go. My daughter\u2019s backpack was there too, with her handmade invitation sticking out. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be the parent she could count on, but I also knew the responsibility I had as a carpenter. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
