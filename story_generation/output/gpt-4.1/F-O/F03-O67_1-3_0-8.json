The siren wailed, echoing my own racing heart. In the back, the paramedic shouted updates about the patient\u2019s dropping blood pressure. Every second counted, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I had to keep the ambulance steady, safe\u2014lives depended on it.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket, a familiar vibration. I knew it was my mom. She always texted on weekends, just to check in, to make sure I was okay. I hadn\u2019t replied to her last message yet. I could almost hear her voice, worried, hoping for a quick \u201cI\u2019m fine, love you.\u201d I wanted to reassure her, to be the son she expected\u2014present, communicative, caring.\n\nBut right now, my hands were needed on the wheel, my focus on the road and the fragile life behind me.
