He\u2019s been patient, but I see the fatigue in his eyes after his long shifts. I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight, but my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the pharmacy. An urgent prescription has come in: a high-risk chemotherapy order, the kind that demands my full attention and absolute precision. One slip, one distracted moment, and the consequences could be devastating for someone\u2019s life. My mind races, torn between the comfort of home and the gravity of my professional duty. I feel the weight of my husband\u2019s expectations, the warmth of our shared life, and the cold, clinical responsibility of my job pressing in on me. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the wife I want to be and the pharmacist I must be."}
