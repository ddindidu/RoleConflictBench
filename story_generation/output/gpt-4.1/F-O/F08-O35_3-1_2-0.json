My radio crackled with updates, but my phone vibrated insistently in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my grandson\u2019s name flashed, followed by a message: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. He never reached out like this unless it was serious. I knew he was struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to always be there for him, to listen and guide him through life\u2019s storms.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. The train was scheduled to depart soon, and I was responsible for ensuring everything was in order. The passengers depended on me for their safety and a timely journey. My supervisor expected diligence, and any delay\u2014even for non-critical checks\u2014could ripple through the whole system. I stared at my phone, torn. My family needed me, but so did the hundreds of strangers waiting on the platform. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between duty and love."}
