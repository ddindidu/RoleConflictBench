It was my younger brother, and the message was short: \u201cCan you call? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his sister, I was always the one he turned to when things got rough. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility, the expectation that I\u2019d be there for him, no matter what.\n\nBut at that moment, alarms blared in the tower.
