He grimaces, and I steady him, careful not to jostle his bandaged side. The text is from Mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you this weekend.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014almost noon. I promised I\u2019d check in, but the morning\u2019s been a blur of call lights and medication rounds. Mr. Thompson\u2019s hand trembles as he reaches for his shirt, and I gently guide his arm through the sleeve, my mind half on him, half on the unread message. I know Mom worries when I go silent, especially since Dad\u2019s health scare last month. She expects a quick reply, a sign I\u2019m okay. But here, my patients need my full attention, especially Mr. Thompson, who\u2019s still weak and anxious. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for reassurance, my patient\u2019s need for care. My phone vibrates again, and I swallow, torn between the roles I can\u2019t seem to balance."}
