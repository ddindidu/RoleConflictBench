My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my stepbrother, who was at home, panicking about his final exam tomorrow. He needed me, wanted me to talk him through his anxiety, like I always did. But the manager had just handed me the deposit bag, reminding me of the strict policy: count, recount, fill out the forms, and lock it in the safe before leaving. No shortcuts, no distractions, or I could get written up. My hands shook as I rang up the last customer, my mind split between the numbers on the register and the words I wanted to send my brother. I could picture him pacing, waiting for my call, expecting me to be there for him. But the store\u2019s rules were clear\u2014no personal calls, no mistakes with the deposit. I felt the pressure building, torn between being the supportive sibling he needed and the responsible cashier I was expected to be. My heart pounded as I stared at the deposit bag, my phone buzzing again, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
