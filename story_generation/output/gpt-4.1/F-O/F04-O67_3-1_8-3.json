It was my younger sister, her name flashing on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night\u2014harsh words, old wounds reopened. She wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew I owed her that. As her brother, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to help us rebuild the trust we\u2019d lost. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t ignore my duty. The kit had to be perfect; lives depended on it. My supervisor expected nothing less, and I couldn\u2019t risk a patient\u2019s safety because I was distracted. My hands trembled as I held the phone, torn between the urge to answer and the responsibility in front of me. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my family needed me, but so did the strangers who might soon rely on this very kit. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, caught between the brother I wanted to be and the professional I was expected to remain."}
