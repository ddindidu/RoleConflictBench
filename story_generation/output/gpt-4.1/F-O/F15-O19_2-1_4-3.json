As I scanned the shelves for cereal, my phone buzzed. It was a text from the pharmacy: a patient was waiting for advice about over-the-counter pain relief. I knew I was expected to provide clear, thorough counseling, even for simple questions. At the same moment, I caught sight of my son darting between aisles, giggling and nearly bumping into an elderly shopper. My heart clenched\u2014he needed to learn respect and discipline, and I was the one responsible for teaching him. But the patient was waiting, and I could imagine their confusion and frustration if I delayed. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I step away to answer the patient\u2019s question, or should I focus on correcting my son\u2019s behavior right now, in front of everyone? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood frozen, caught between my duty as a parent and my responsibility as a pharmacist."}
