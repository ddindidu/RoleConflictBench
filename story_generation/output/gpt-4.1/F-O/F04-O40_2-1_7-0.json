We\u2019d argued last night\u2014again\u2014about our different choices in life, and I knew he wanted to talk it out before I left for work. As his brother, I wanted to be patient, to listen, to show him the respect he deserved even when we disagreed. But as a carpenter, I had a different set of expectations waiting for me. My foreman had made it clear: be on time, follow every safety protocol, or risk not just my job, but the safety of everyone on site. I glanced at the clock. If I stayed to talk, I\u2019d be late, and rushing could mean missing a crucial safety check. But if I left now, I\u2019d be turning my back on my brother when he needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hand hovered over the doorknob, heart pounding, caught between the pull of family and the demands of my trade."}
