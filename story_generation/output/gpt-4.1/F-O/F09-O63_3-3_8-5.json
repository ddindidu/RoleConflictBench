My son\u2019s school bag lies on the floor, a silent reminder of the home loan repayment looming in two months. I need this job, need the commission, need to keep our home. My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe must hit the target today, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just a few hours left in the quarter. My fingers tremble as I dial another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts drift to my son\u2019s worried face when he asked if we\u2019d have to move. The pressure mounts\u2014every call, every rejection, every second wasted feels like a step closer to failure. I want to be present for my son, to reassure him, but I can\u2019t afford to step away. The demands of my job and my family pull me in opposite directions, and I feel myself caught in the middle, heart pounding, unable to choose which role to let down."}
