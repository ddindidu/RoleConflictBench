My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me to help set the table for our holiday dinner\u2014her way of making sure I honored the family\u2019s traditions, even if I sometimes felt like an outsider. I wanted to show her I cared, to prove I belonged, so I promised I\u2019d be there in a minute.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the garage, where my half-finished cabinet waited. As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping my workspace spotless\u2014one stray nail or wood shaving could mean a nasty accident. I\u2019d left my tools scattered, sawdust everywhere, and the thought gnawed at me. If I didn\u2019t clean up soon, I\u2019d be breaking every safety rule I\u2019d learned, risking not just my project but my reputation.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions: the warmth of the family I was trying to fit into, and the responsibility of my craft. My hands hovered between the dish towel and the work gloves, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role needed me more."}
