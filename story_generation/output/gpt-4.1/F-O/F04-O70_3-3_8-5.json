She sounded upset, saying she needed to talk right away\u2014something about a misunderstanding with our parents that had left her feeling alone and misunderstood. As her brother, I knew how important it was to listen, to show her respect by being present and helping her work through things. But just as I was about to call her, I pulled up to my next stop: a high-rise apartment where I had to hand-deliver a high-value package. The company\u2019s policy was strict\u2014I had to verify the recipient\u2019s identity and get their signature, no exceptions. My supervisor had warned me that any mistake could cost me my job. I could see Mia\u2019s name flashing on my phone, her call coming in again, but the recipient was already waiting in the lobby, checking their watch impatiently. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the brother Mia needed and the reliable delivery person my job demanded."}
