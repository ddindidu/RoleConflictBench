He was upset about something I\u2019d said last night, and he wanted to talk it out. As his sister, I knew I should call him back, listen, and try to clear the air. We\u2019d always promised to be honest with each other, to work through misunderstandings instead of letting them fester. But as I glanced at the maintenance schedule pinned above my desk, my stomach tightened. The factory\u2019s planned shutdown was next week, and I was already behind on prepping the machines for their deep clean. My supervisor had reminded me twice that everything had to be ready\u2014no excuses. If I didn\u2019t get the parts ordered and the checklists finished tonight, I\u2019d be scrambling. I felt torn, the weight of my brother\u2019s hurt and my team\u2019s expectations pressing in from both sides. My hands hovered over the keyboard, caught between sending a message to my brother or finishing the maintenance logs, my mind racing with the fear of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
