As an accountant, I know how crucial it is to stay updated\u2014my clients depend on me to interpret every new regulation, and missing this seminar could mean falling behind. But just as I\u2019m about to confirm my spot, I hear laughter and the unmistakable sound of sneakers squeaking. My son is darting between carts, weaving dangerously close to a display of glass jars. Other shoppers are starting to stare, and I feel the weight of their judgment. As a parent, I\u2019m supposed to teach him discipline, to correct him right now and show him what\u2019s appropriate. But if I don\u2019t finish this registration in the next minute, I\u2019ll lose my chance to attend the seminar. My heart pounds as I glance between my son and my phone, torn between the urgent needs of my profession and my responsibility as a parent."}
