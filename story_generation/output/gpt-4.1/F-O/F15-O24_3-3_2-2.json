My heart sank as I read: my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me as soon as possible. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to listen, to guide, to show my son that his actions had consequences and that I cared enough to be present. But just as I was about to grab my coat, my clerk rushed in, breathless, holding an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The law demanded my immediate attention; I had to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced, torn between the courtroom\u2019s urgent call for impartial judgment and my child\u2019s need for a parent\u2019s presence and guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my undivided attention, each unwilling to wait."}
