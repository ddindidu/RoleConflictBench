The home loan repayment looms in my mind, a heavy shadow reminding me that every fare counts. I need to keep driving, keep earning, for my family\u2019s sake. My phone buzzes with another message from the passenger\u2014he\u2019s growing impatient, asking if I can get there faster. I know the app tracks my response time, and a bad rating could mean fewer rides, less income. But my son\u2019s school just called; he\u2019s not feeling well, and they want me to pick him up. My heart aches, torn between the responsibility of being a mother and the demands of my job. If I cancel the ride, I risk losing money we desperately need. If I ignore my son, I feel like I\u2019m failing him. The city\u2019s traffic blurs outside my window as I sit at a red light, caught between two worlds, both expecting me to be there, both needing me now."}
