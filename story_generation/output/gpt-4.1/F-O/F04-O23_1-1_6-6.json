He\u2019d always wanted to feel included in my world, and I wanted to show him respect by making him part of my social circle. As we mingled, one of my clients, a high-profile entrepreneur, joined our group. My brother, eager to impress, asked, \u201cSo, what kind of cases do you handle for him?\u201d The question hung in the air, innocent but loaded. My colleagues glanced at me, expecting a clever, maybe even entertaining, response. My brother\u2019s eyes sparkled with anticipation, wanting to be part of the conversation, to feel like he belonged. But as a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, unable to share even the smallest detail. The pressure built inside me\u2014my brother\u2019s need for inclusion and respect clashing with my professional duty. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my mind racing for a way to honor my brother without betraying my client\u2019s trust."}
