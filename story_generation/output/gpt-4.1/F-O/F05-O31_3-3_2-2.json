It was my wife\u2014her voice trembling, barely holding together. She needed me home, now more than ever. The past few weeks had been a storm for her, and I\u2019d promised to be her anchor, to listen, to hold her hand through the darkness. But before I could even respond, the radio crackled: \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and Fifth. Immediate backup required.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew the area\u2014families, kids, innocent people. My training kicked in, the duty to protect, to act without hesitation. But my mind was split.
