My heart sank as the principal\u2019s voice explained that my stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss the situation. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up for Ethan, to be present and supportive, especially now when he was in trouble. But as I hung up, my pager buzzed\u2014my patient\u2019s family was waiting for me in the consultation room. They were anxious, desperate for answers, and I had to tell them that their loved one\u2019s prognosis was grim. I could hear their muffled voices through the door, and I felt the weight of their hope and fear. My mind raced between the two worlds: Ethan needed me to guide him through this crisis, to show him I cared, but my patient\u2019s family needed compassion and clarity from their doctor. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen in the hallway, unable to move toward either door."}
