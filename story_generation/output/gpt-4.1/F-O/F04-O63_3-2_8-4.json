My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, feeling the pressure build in my chest. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, Sam. We\u2019d argued last night, and I knew he was reaching out to clear the air. As his brother, I owed him honesty and patience, a chance to talk things through and rebuild the trust we\u2019d always valued. But every minute on the phone with him meant one less chance to make a sale, one step closer to disappointing my boss and risking my bonus. My headset felt heavier than usual as I stared at the two phones, torn between the brother Sam needed and the employee my manager expected. My heart pounded as I weighed which call to answer first, feeling the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
