The deadline loomed, and my client expected a plan that would transform their workplace\u2014every detail had to be perfect. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message from my daughter: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Lily\u2019s piano recital is tonight. She\u2019s so excited to show you what she\u2019s learned.\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face, the way she\u2019d asked, \u201cWill you be there, Grandpa?\u201d The weight of her expectation pressed against the urgency of my work. I wanted to be the grandparent who never missed a moment, who cheered the loudest in the audience. But the architect in me knew that if I didn\u2019t finish this plan, I\u2019d let down a team counting on me to create a space where they could thrive. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I sat there, blueprint in hand, recital program on the table, torn between the worlds that needed me most."}
