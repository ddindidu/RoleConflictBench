Can you fold it tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I sigh, picturing the overflowing basket in our bedroom, the silent expectation that I\u2019ll step in and help keep our home running smoothly. But as I tuck my phone away, I hear soft sobs from down the hall. Mrs. Carter, one of my patients, has just learned her cancer has returned. She\u2019s alone, her shoulders shaking, and I know she needs someone to sit with her, to listen, to offer comfort. My heart aches for her, but my mind is already racing ahead to the evening\u2014my spouse, tired and waiting, the laundry still untouched. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I want to be there for Mrs. Carter, to give her the support she needs, but I also want to be the partner my spouse can rely on. The clock ticks, and I stand frozen, torn between the demands of my work and the needs of my home."}
