My stepmom had called earlier, her voice warm but firm, reminding me how important it was for me to be there, to help the family feel whole. I knew they wanted me to join in, to laugh and share stories, to show I was really part of them. But as I tucked my phone away, I glanced at Mrs. Carter, my patient for the afternoon. She sat by the window, her eyes searching the gray sky, her hands twisting in her lap. She\u2019d told me earlier how lonely she felt, how much she looked forward to our talks. My shift was almost over, but I could see she needed me to stay a little longer, to listen, to just be there. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the family that wanted me present, and the patient who needed my care. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which part of me should come first."}
