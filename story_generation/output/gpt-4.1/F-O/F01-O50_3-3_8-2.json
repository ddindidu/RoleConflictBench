My hands, steady from years of repairs, hesitated for a moment. The message was from my daughter: \u201cDad, please call. It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. My heart clenched. I knew I should call immediately, be the steady presence my family needed, the grandfather who always listened, always cared. But the machine before me was failing, and a patient\u2019s life hung in the balance. The nurses watched me, waiting for answers, their expectations clear in their anxious eyes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s crisis and the hospital\u2019s emergency. My mind raced, torn between the urge to comfort my daughter and the duty to fix the machine. I could not be in two places at once, and the pressure of choosing left me paralyzed, caught between the demands of love and responsibility."}
