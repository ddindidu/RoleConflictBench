The radar screen is a blur of shifting blips\u2014thunderstorms have thrown the airspace into chaos, and every controller is on edge, coordinating reroutes and handoffs with barely a breath between transmissions. My supervisor\u2019s expectation is clear: stay sharp, stay focused, keep the skies safe. But my phone vibrates with a reminder\u2014today is the open class at my daughter\u2019s school. She\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines, asking if I\u2019ll be there. I promised I would. The guilt gnaws at me as I picture her scanning the classroom for my face.
