My grandson had a high fever, and she needed me at the hospital. As a grandfather, I knew my family expected me to be there, to comfort and support them in this crisis. But at that very moment, my phone buzzed with a new ride request\u2014someone across town, urgently needing a lift to the airport. The app showed the passenger was already waiting, sending anxious messages about missing their flight. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen, and I knew my company expected me to be reliable and professional, especially during busy hours. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I sat in the car, torn between the desperate needs of my family and the responsibility I owed to my passenger. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, heart pounding, unable to decide which road to take."}
