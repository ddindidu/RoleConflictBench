My husband\u2019s soccer gear and my daughter\u2019s school uniform are buried somewhere in the mess, and I promised I\u2019d have everything clean for tomorrow. Guilt prickles at me\u2014I know how much my family relies on me to keep things running smoothly at home. But my phone buzzes, and I see the hospital pharmacy\u2019s number flash on the screen. There\u2019s a high-risk chemotherapy prescription waiting, and I\u2019m the only pharmacist on shift who\u2019s trained to handle it. The patient\u2019s life could depend on my accuracy; even the smallest mistake isn\u2019t an option. My mind races, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the critical responsibility at work. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
