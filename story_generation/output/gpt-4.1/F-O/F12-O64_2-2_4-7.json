The lunch rush was in full swing, and the line of customers seemed endless. Each person expected a smile, a kind word, and quick, efficient service. I did my best, scanning groceries and making small talk, but my mind kept drifting home. The laundry basket was overflowing, and my husband had texted earlier, reminding me that our daughter needed her soccer uniform clean for tonight. I could almost hear the disappointment in his message, the unspoken expectation that I would handle it, as I usually did. My heart twisted with guilt. Here, I was supposed to be the friendly, unflappable cashier, but inside, I was a wife worrying about letting my family down. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt stretched thin, caught between the needs of strangers and the needs of the people I love most. As the next customer stepped forward, I forced a smile, my mind racing with what I should do next."}
