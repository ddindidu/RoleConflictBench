She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, and if I could call her for a few minutes. I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes left before I had to be back behind the counter. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d use this break to skim the latest pharmacy newsletter, to keep up with the new drugs and protocols. My supervisor had reminded us just yesterday how important it was to stay updated, and I didn\u2019t want to fall behind. But my mom expected daily updates, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. I stared at my phone, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s familiar questions and the professional responsibility pressing on me. My thumb hovered over the screen, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
