My stepson, Jamie, had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he asked if I\u2019d be there. I promised him I would. But as I packed up my tools at the workshop, my phone buzzed with a message from my boss: \u201cSite inspection at 2:30. Make sure your area is spotless\u2014no shortcuts.\u201d I looked around at the sawdust, scattered nails, and half-finished cabinets. If I left now, I\u2019d be rushing, and I knew what could happen if safety protocols slipped. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss Jamie\u2019s big moment, the one he\u2019d been counting on me for. My chest tightened as I weighed the responsibility of being the adult he could rely on against the duty to keep my crew and myself safe. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
