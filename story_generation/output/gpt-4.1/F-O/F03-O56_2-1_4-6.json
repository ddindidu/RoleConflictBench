She smiled, mentioning she\u2019d just washed her hair at home, and asked if we could skip the usual wash. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to follow the salon\u2019s protocol\u2014every client gets a wash and condition, no exceptions. It\u2019s about hygiene, consistency, and the reputation of our shop. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered my mother\u2019s words from breakfast: \u201cWe must never cut corners, not in our family. Our traditions are what set us apart.\u201d Lately, my family has been insistent that I honor our values, especially at work. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice, reminding me that our name means something in this community. Yet, Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair was spotless, and she looked tired, clearly hoping for a quicker visit. My hands hesitated, torn between the expectations of my family and the practical needs of my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, unsure which expectation to honor."}
