My mind ticked through checklists and compliance forms, knowing I had weeks to prepare, but the pressure to ensure everything was perfect gnawed at me. Across the room, I watched my parents move quietly, their faces drawn and voices softer than usual. Lately, they seemed weighed down by something unspoken, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility to be present for them, to offer comfort and support.\n\nBut every time I tried to close my laptop and join them, a wave of anxiety crashed over me\u2014what if I missed a detail in the documentation? What if something slipped through the cracks and the audit went poorly? My parents needed me, but so did my team.
