My client\u2019s contract wasn\u2019t urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely. As I highlighted a clause, my phone buzzed. It was my daughter, her voice trembling as she explained that my grandson had fallen ill and needed me. My heart clenched. I was the grandmother who always showed up, the one who baked cookies and soothed fevers. They needed me now, not later.\n\nBut the lawyer in me whispered about deadlines and professional standards. Even if the contract wasn\u2019t due soon, I hated leaving work unfinished. My mind raced with the expectations: my family counting on my warmth and presence, my client trusting my diligence. I stared at the contract, then at the family photo on my desk, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role to answer first, torn between duty and love, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my all at the same time."}
