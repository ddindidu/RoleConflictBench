The radio crackled with routine chatter, but my mind was elsewhere. Just before my shift, I\u2019d seen my granddaughter sitting on the porch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the ground. She barely looked up when I called her name. I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her, something she didn\u2019t want to say. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to stop, sit beside her, and offer the comfort and wisdom she needed. But now, behind the wheel, I was the ambulance driver, responsible for this vehicle, for the safety of everyone on the road, and for being on time for the shift change. My heart tugged me back home, but my duty kept me moving forward. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the impossible choice: to be the steady hands on the wheel, or the open arms my granddaughter needed."}
