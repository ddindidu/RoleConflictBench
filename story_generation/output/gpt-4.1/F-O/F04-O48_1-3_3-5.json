Mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I wanted to say yes, to be the brother who showed up, who made memories. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the hospital. I was scheduled for a shift, and not just any shift. I was assigned to Mr. Harris, a patient whose condition could change in an instant. My supervisor had stressed how crucial it was to monitor his vitals every few minutes, to be vigilant, precise. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations, the gravity of my responsibility at the hospital. My heart pounded as I tried to smile, torn between the brother they needed and the nursing assistant my patient depended on."}
