It\u2019s Mom, asking if I\u2019ve eaten lunch and how my day is going. I know she expects a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my meal, and a few lines about work. We\u2019ve always kept in touch like this\u2014her way of making sure I\u2019m okay, my way of showing I care. But my laptop screen is filled with Slack messages from the product and QA teams, all waiting for my feedback on the new feature specs. The design document deadline is tomorrow, and everyone\u2019s depending on my technical input to move forward. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides: the warmth and worry of my parents, the urgency and responsibility of my team. My fingers hover over my phone, then my keyboard, my mind pulled in two directions. I want to be a good child, attentive and present, but I also need to be a reliable developer, focused and responsive. The weight of these expectations presses on my chest as I sit, torn, not sure which message to answer first."}
