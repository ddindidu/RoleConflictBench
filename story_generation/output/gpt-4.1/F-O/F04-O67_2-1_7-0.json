It was my younger brother, Sam. He was upset, his voice tight as he told me about another argument with our parents. He needed someone to listen, to be patient, to understand his side without judgment. I could hear the frustration and loneliness in his words, and I knew how much it meant for him to have me there, to build that trust and respect between us.\n\nBut as I tried to focus on his words, the radio crackled to life\u2014an emergency call, a car accident just a few blocks away. My heart raced. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to respond immediately, to drop everything and get to the scene as fast as possible. Lives could depend on my speed and focus.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother\u2019s voice was still in my ear, needing me to be present and patient, while my duty demanded I act without delay. I stared at the radio, my mind spinning, caught between the expectations of family and the urgency of my job."}
