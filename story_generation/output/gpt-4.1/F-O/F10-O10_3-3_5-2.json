It means so much to your grandmother.\u201d My heart squeezed with the weight of her words. Being the eldest daughter, I knew how important it was to uphold our family\u2019s traditions, especially now, when everyone looked to me to keep them alive. But as I glanced at my laptop, the email from the external auditor blinked insistently. They needed the quarterly financial statements by the end of the day\u2014no exceptions, no delays. My manager had stressed the importance of accuracy and timeliness, especially with the company\u2019s reputation on the line. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my profession. The pressure built in my chest as I imagined my grandmother\u2019s hopeful eyes and my manager\u2019s stern voice. I sat frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
