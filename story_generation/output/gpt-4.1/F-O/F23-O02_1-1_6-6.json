My stepson, Ethan, bounced into the room, eyes bright with hope. \u201cAre we getting the Nintendo this weekend?\u201d he asked, voice full of trust. I remembered the promise I\u2019d made\u2014one I knew meant the world to him. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder popped up: project planning call in ten minutes. My manager expected me to join, to give precise estimates for the new design phase. The team was counting on my input, even if the session was informal and the timeline still flexible. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Ethan\u2019s expectant gaze tugged at my heart, but the numbers on my screen reminded me of our tight budget. I needed to show up for my family, to keep us secure, but I also needed to be present for my team. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the responsibility I carried at work, unsure which demand to answer first."}
