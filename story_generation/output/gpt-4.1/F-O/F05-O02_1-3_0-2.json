She looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in her eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, setting my bag down. She nodded, telling me about a meeting that went nowhere and a colleague who kept interrupting her. I wanted to sit beside her, listen, and offer the comfort she deserved. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another Slack message from the team. The build was stalled, and everyone was waiting on my module. The project deadline was looming, and I knew the team was frustrated, counting on me to deliver. My mind raced between the code I needed to write and the woman I loved who needed me to just be present. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be fully there. I stood in the kitchen, torn, heart and mind pulled in opposite directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
