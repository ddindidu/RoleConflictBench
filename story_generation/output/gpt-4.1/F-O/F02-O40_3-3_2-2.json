The school\u2019s number flashed on the screen, and my heart sank. The principal\u2019s voice was stern\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, to talk, to show I cared and would help set things right. I glanced at the half-assembled beams and the crew waiting for my inspection. As the lead carpenter, it was my job to check every tool, every harness, to make sure no one got hurt. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my team down, risking their safety and the project\u2019s schedule. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be the father who wasn\u2019t there when his child needed guidance most.
