My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCould you fold those tonight? I\u2019ve got an early meeting.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. I know he\u2019s been busy, and we promised to share the chores, but my mind is already elsewhere.\n\nOn my desk, a thick manila folder sits unopened. The case is routine, a procedural hearing in two weeks, but I pride myself on being thorough. The court expects me to be prepared, to catch every detail, no matter how minor. I glance at the clock, calculating how long it would take to review the file, how long to fold the laundry, how long before exhaustion overtakes me.\n\nMy hands hover between the laundry and the file, heart pounding with the familiar tug-of-war. I want to be a good partner, to keep our home running smoothly. I want to be a diligent judge, to honor the trust placed in me. The demands pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which part of me will have to wait."}
