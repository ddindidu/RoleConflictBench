He told me about a rough meeting at work, nothing dramatic, but I could hear the fatigue in his words. I knew he wanted me to sit with him, maybe listen, maybe just be there. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the next delivery was groceries, and the customer had messaged twice, stressing how important it was to get them before dinner. I could picture their anxious face, waiting for me to show up on time. My husband looked at me expectantly, hoping for comfort, while my work app flashed red, demanding urgency. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the man I love and the job I need to do right. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between being the supportive wife he deserved and the reliable delivery person my customer depended on."}
