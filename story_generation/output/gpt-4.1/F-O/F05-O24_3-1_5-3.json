The hum of the washing machine and the clatter of dishes reminded me that her expectations were clear: the house had to be spotless before her relatives arrived tomorrow. She\u2019d already done the shopping and was counting on me to vacuum, mop, and tidy the guest room. But my mind kept drifting to the courthouse, where a new case file sat on my desk, waiting for my scheduling order. The deadline was looming, and the attorneys would be calling soon if I didn\u2019t get it done. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s hopeful glances, the silent demand of the law. I wanted to be the partner she could rely on, but I also knew the importance of my judicial duties. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to serve first, feeling the tension build with every passing minute."}
