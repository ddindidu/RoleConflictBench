My stepson, Ethan, had been talking about his open class for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he asked if I\u2019d be there. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me,\u201d he\u2019d said, and I\u2019d promised I would come. But now, my phone buzzed with a reminder: final design review for the hospital wing, the one I\u2019d been working on for months. The lead surgeon was flying in, and my team needed me to walk them through the emergency routes and operating room layouts\u2014no one else knew the design as intimately as I did.\n\nI could almost hear Ethan\u2019s voice in my head, hopeful and nervous, and then the voices of my colleagues, counting on me to ensure the hospital would function flawlessly. My chest tightened as I imagined disappointing either side. I wanted to be the parent Ethan could rely on, but I also couldn\u2019t let my team down when lives might depend on my work. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
