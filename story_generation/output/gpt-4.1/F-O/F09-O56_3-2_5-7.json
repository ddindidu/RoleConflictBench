My heart pounded with worry\u2014my son had been caught stealing snacks at the corner store. As a mother, I knew I needed to teach him right from wrong, to help him understand why honesty matters. But right now, I had a client in my chair, her hair damp and greasy from her gym session. She expected me to wash and condition her hair before styling, to give her the best service possible. I could see her glancing at her watch, probably on a tight schedule herself. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, the school\u2019s number flashing on the screen. I felt torn\u2014my son needed me to guide him, to be present and firm, but my client expected my full attention and care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hands trembled as I reached for the shampoo, my mind racing with what I should do next."}
