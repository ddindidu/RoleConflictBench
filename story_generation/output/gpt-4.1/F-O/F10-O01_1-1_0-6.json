Miss you!\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, just sent a few quick texts. I know my parents want more\u2014real conversations, not just updates. But my laptop is open, blueprints scattered across the table. The project deadline is looming, and as the lead architect, I\u2019m supposed to keep everything on track. I\u2019ve been reviewing timelines, making sure things are moving, but not with the intensity my boss expects. I should be double-checking every detail, sending reminders, pushing the team harder. Instead, I\u2019m half-distracted, torn between the ping of my phone and the blinking cursor on my screen. I want to be the attentive daughter my parents hope for, but I also need to be the efficient architect my team relies on. The weight of both expectations presses down, and I sit there, phone in one hand, mouse in the other, not sure which role to answer first."}
