My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 voices, each one depending on me to keep them safe, to keep the sky moving. At that moment, my phone buzzed\u2014a text from my grandson, who was sitting in the break room just down the hall, waiting for me to finish my shift. \u201cGrandpa, can we talk? I\u2019m not sure what to do about college. I need your advice.\u201d He\u2019d always looked to me for guidance, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be there whenever he needed to talk. But right now, the airspace was packed, and every second demanded my full attention. The expectation to be the steady hand for hundreds of passengers clashed with the promise I\u2019d made to my grandson. My heart ached as I stared at the screen, torn between the lives in the sky and the life I\u2019d helped bring into the world, both needing me in different ways, both right now."}
