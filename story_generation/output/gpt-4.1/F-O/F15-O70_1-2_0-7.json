I promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every Friday. But my phone buzzed, and I saw a message from a customer: \u201cWhere is my package? I need it urgently. Please respond.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting. As a delivery person, I was expected to reply quickly, reassure the customer, and keep things professional. But as a parent, I was supposed to be present, on time, and attentive for my children. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I stopped to type a polite, thorough response, I might be late to pick up my kids. If I ignored the customer, I risked a complaint or worse. My mind raced, torn between the two worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between my roles."}
