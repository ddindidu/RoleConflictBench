It was a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you call? It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d My heart clenched. Jamie, my grandson, had been having a tough time lately, and I\u2019d promised to always be there for my family, to check in, to listen. I knew how much my daughter needed me right now, how much Jamie needed to hear my voice.\n\nBut as I glanced up, I saw a small boy flailing in the deep end, right where swimming was off-limits. My training kicked in\u2014no hesitation, no distractions. I was responsible for every life in this pool, and the rules were clear: safety first, always. Yet, my phone vibrated again, a reminder of the crisis unfolding at home, the expectation that I\u2019d be present for my family in their moment of need.\n\nI stood at the edge, torn between the urgent call of my family and the immediate danger in the water, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
