She was frustrated, demanding clarification about a charge on her invoice. I scrolled through spreadsheets, trying to find the answer, my mind racing to form a clear, professional response. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from my mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute? Dad seems a bit down today.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past six. I knew my parents valued our evening check-ins, and I could picture my dad waiting for my call, hoping for a few comforting words. But the client\u2019s impatience was growing, and I couldn\u2019t risk losing her trust. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of my client\u2019s needs against my parents\u2019 quiet expectation for support. Torn between being the reliable son and the dependable accountant, I felt the pressure mounting, unsure which call to answer first."}
