My headset feels heavier with every call that ends in a polite rejection or a click. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I know what\u2019s at stake\u2014my bonus, my reputation, maybe even my job. I take a deep breath and dial the next number, rehearsing my pitch in my head.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzes with a message from my stepdad: \u201cHey, can we talk? Your mom\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I remember promising myself I\u2019d check in more, be there for them, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through as a family. I know they expect me to ask how things are, to listen, to show I care. But if I stop now, I\u2019ll fall even further behind at work. My thumb hovers over the phone, torn between calling home and making another sales pitch. The pressure from both sides squeezes my chest, and I can\u2019t decide which voice to answer first."}
