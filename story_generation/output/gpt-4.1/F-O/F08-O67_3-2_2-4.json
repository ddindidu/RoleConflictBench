She\u2019d never come to me like this before, and I could see the weight of her worry. My heart ached to gather her close, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d earned over decades, to be the steady presence she needed. But then the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through the room: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall, possible fracture, urgent.\u201d My hands shook as I reached for my keys. I knew someone out there was in pain, waiting for me to bring relief, to do my duty as an ambulance driver. My granddaughter\u2019s hand tightened on mine, her need pulling me one way, the call of my profession pulling me another. I stood frozen, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my family and the oath I\u2019d taken to help strangers in crisis. The seconds stretched, my heart pounding, as I wrestled with which role I could bear to let down."}
