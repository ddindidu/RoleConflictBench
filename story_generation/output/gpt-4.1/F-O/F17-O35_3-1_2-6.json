My mother\u2019s message pops up: \u201cHow was your day? Did you eat?\u201d I know she expects a quick reply, a little story about my morning, maybe a photo. It\u2019s our routine\u2014she worries if I don\u2019t answer right away. At the same time, my work tablet pings with an email from the transit authority: a professional development seminar, optional but encouraged. They want us to show initiative, to respond promptly, to prove we\u2019re committed to our roles. I glance at the clock. My break is short, and I\u2019m supposed to use it to check messages like this, but not for personal texting. My fingers hover over my phone and the tablet, my mind racing. If I answer my mom, I risk being seen as unprofessional. If I focus on work, I know she\u2019ll worry, maybe even call. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can feel my heart beating faster as I try to decide which message to answer first."}
