I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed messages from my stepmom, each more urgent than the last. She expected me to check in every day, to reassure her that I was okay, to keep our fragile connection alive. But right now, the train had jolted to a stop, and the intercom crackled with panic. A passenger needed help\u2014maybe a heart attack, maybe worse. My hands shook as I reached for the radio, my mind split between the duty to the people in my care and the voice in my head reminding me that my stepmom would worry if I didn\u2019t reply. I could almost hear her disappointment, the fear that I was pulling away again. But the passengers\u2019 anxious faces pressed against the glass, waiting for guidance, demanded my full attention. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the family I was trying to build and the strangers whose safety depended on me."}
