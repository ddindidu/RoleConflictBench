The quarterly tax filing deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew every detail had to be perfect\u2014no room for error, no excuse for delay. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the family gathering is tomorrow. We need you to help with the preparations. It\u2019s important to honor our traditions.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, reminding me how much these customs meant to our family, especially now. My chest tightened. I wanted to be there, to show respect, to be the child my parents expected\u2014present, involved, upholding our values.
