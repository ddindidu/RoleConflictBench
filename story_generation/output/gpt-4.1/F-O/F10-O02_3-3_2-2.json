I could picture her waiting for my daily update, expecting a call filled with stories about my day, just like always. But my laptop screen glared back at me, lines of code and error messages demanding my attention. The project deadline loomed, and the entire team was waiting on my module to move forward. Every minute I spent away from my work meant another delay for everyone. Yet, every minute I ignored my mother\u2019s messages, I felt a pang of guilt, imagining her worry growing with each unanswered text. I wanted to be the reliable daughter she counted on, but I also needed to be the dependable engineer my team relied upon. My hands hovered over my phone and keyboard, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
