He was fiddling with his phone, oblivious to the busy street as he stepped off the curb. My heart leapt\u2014my role as his step-sibling demanded I protect him, to shout or run out and pull him back to safety. But at that exact moment, my patient, Mrs. Lee, coughed and called my name. She was waiting for me to finish her check-up, expecting my full attention and expertise as her doctor. I could see her symptoms matched a common cold, but I needed to be thorough, to listen and diagnose carefully. My mind raced, torn between the urge to dash outside for Max and the responsibility to stay with Mrs. Lee. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations, and I felt the weight of choosing between them pressing down on my chest."}
