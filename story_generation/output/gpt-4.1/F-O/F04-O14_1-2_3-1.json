My younger sister\u2019s eyes sparkled as she suggested a hiking trip, and my parents looked at me, waiting for my input. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present, to laugh and share in the planning. But my mind kept drifting back to the lab. The specialized equipment I needed for my experiment was only available this weekend, and I\u2019d spent months preparing for this window. If I missed it, I\u2019d have to wait another six months, maybe longer, to gather the data I needed. My family\u2019s voices grew louder, their excitement contagious, but I felt a knot tightening in my stomach. I wanted to be the supportive brother, the one who never missed a family outing. But I was also a scientist, and this experiment was crucial for my research. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stared at my plate, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
