My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that her parents would arrive in two hours. The house was a mess, and she needed my help moving furniture and vacuuming. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectations. My phone buzzed\u2014my foreman\u2019s number. \u201cWe need you now,\u201d he barked. \u201cThe crane\u2019s here, and the beam\u2019s swinging. If you\u2019re late, we can\u2019t secure it.\u201d I pictured the massive steel beam dangling, my crew waiting, the job site tense. My hands shook as I dried the last plate.
