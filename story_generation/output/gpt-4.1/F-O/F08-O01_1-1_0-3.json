The lines needed to be clean, the flow logical\u2014every inch had to serve a purpose. My mind was deep in the geometry of walls and windows when my granddaughter wandered in, her eyes uncertain. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when it\u2019s time to try something new?\u201d Her voice was soft, but the question was heavy, the kind that demanded more than a quick answer. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014she wanted wisdom, reassurance, a story from my own life. But my mind was still tangled in measurements and spatial logic, the demands of my work pressing in. I wanted to give her my full attention, to be the grandmother she needed, but the unfinished sketch on my desk seemed to pull at me, reminding me of deadlines and professional pride. I looked at her, then at my plans, feeling the tension rise inside me, torn between the roles that defined me."}
