My little sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents were excited about a movie night. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my input, hoping I\u2019d be there this time. Just as I was about to suggest a picnic, my phone buzzed. It was a notification from work\u2014a package had just arrived at the depot, later than scheduled, but still within the day. As a delivery person, I knew the customer would be waiting, probably checking their tracking app every few minutes. My boss expected me to deliver every package on time, no excuses. I glanced at my family, their faces full of hope, and then at my phone, the address blinking on the screen. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of home against the responsibility of my job, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
