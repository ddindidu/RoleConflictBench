My mind, though, kept drifting back to the promise I\u2019d made to Jamie last week\u2014if I picked up an extra shift, I\u2019d buy him that Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of wanting to prove I could provide, to show him he could count on me. But as I counted the gauze pads, I realized the overtime pay would barely cover the game console after bills. My supervisor expected me to be thorough, to never let a patient down because of missing supplies. Yet, my partner texted, reminding me the store\u2019s sale ended tonight. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my duty to my patients, and my promise to Jamie. My hands hesitated over the checklist, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which responsibility should come first."}
