It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted\u2014I knew he\u2019d been struggling since his breakup, and as his sister, I wanted to be there, to listen, to support him like we always promised we would.\n\nBut at the same time, my manager\u2019s email sat unread in my inbox, subject line: \u201cNeed your estimates by 3 PM for the roadmap meeting.\u201d The team was waiting on me to finalize the planning, and I knew how critical my input was. If I delayed, the whole project could slip, and everyone was counting on me to be precise and reliable.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My brother\u2019s name glowed on the screen, a silent plea.
