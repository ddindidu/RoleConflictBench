I knew she wanted more than just a quick answer\u2014she always hoped I\u2019d open up, share the little details, let her in. I started to tell her about a difficult passenger, but my mind kept drifting back to the afternoon\u2019s downpour. The rain had hammered the windshield, and cars darted in and out of lanes, making every second behind the wheel tense. I remembered gripping the steering wheel, heart pounding, as a car cut me off and I barely managed to brake in time. \n\nNow, as she waited for me to talk, I felt the pressure to be present, to communicate honestly, but my nerves were still frayed from the stress of driving in that weather. I wanted to reassure her, to be the attentive partner she deserved, but my thoughts kept circling back to the chaos on the road and the responsibility to keep everyone safe. I hesitated, torn between the need to be open with her and the urge to retreat into silence, still wrestling with the day\u2019s tension."}
