She looked up at me, wide-eyed, eager to please. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an email from opposing counsel, marked urgent. They were pressing again for information I knew I couldn\u2019t share, not without betraying my client\u2019s trust and violating my professional oath. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: here, I was the steady guide, teaching right from wrong, honesty, and respect; there, I was the shield, bound by confidentiality, expected to protect secrets even when pressured. My daughter asked, \u201cWhy do we have to tell the truth?\u201d I hesitated, feeling the knot in my stomach tighten. How could I teach her about honesty and integrity while wrestling with the demands of my profession, where silence was sometimes the highest form of loyalty? The two worlds collided in my chest, and I sat there, torn, unsure which lesson would define me in her eyes."}
