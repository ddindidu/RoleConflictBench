He needed my advice, my encouragement\u2014he needed me to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d make the right choice. I reached for his hand, trying to focus on his words, but my mind kept drifting to the pool. Through the window, I could see a group of kids splashing in the shallow end, their parents chatting nearby. I knew the rules: no one was supposed to be in that area without a lifeguard present. My supervisor had been clear\u2014safety came first, always. But here I was, torn between being the supportive wife my husband needed and the vigilant lifeguard I was expected to be. My heart pounded as I glanced from my husband\u2019s anxious face to the pool outside, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, demanding my attention, my care."}
