I knew it was my mom\u2014she always sent a good morning message, and she expected a reply right away. We\u2019d made it a habit to check in every day, ever since Dad\u2019s health scare last year. I could already picture her waiting anxiously for my response, worrying if I didn\u2019t answer quickly.\n\nBut the foreman was strict about punctuality and safety. Phones weren\u2019t allowed on site, and we had to be present for the safety briefing before starting any work. If I was late, I\u2019d get a warning, maybe even sent home for the day. The guys were already gathering, hard hats on, ready to go.\n\nI stood at the edge of the site, phone in hand, heart pounding. If I replied to Mom, I\u2019d risk being late and breaking site rules. If I ignored her, I\u2019d break our promise and leave her worrying. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, caught between the expectations of a good son and a responsible carpenter."}
