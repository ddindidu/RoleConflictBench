I wanted to be there, to show respect, to be the daughter who honored our roots. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning session at work was starting soon. As an engineer, my team relied on me to provide accurate time estimates, even if today\u2019s meeting was informal and the timeline still flexible. My manager expected me to be present, to contribute, to show commitment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s hopes on one side, my professional responsibilities on the other. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the pull of tradition and the demands of my career, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
