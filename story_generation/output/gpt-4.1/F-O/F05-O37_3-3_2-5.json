My wife\u2019s eyes were red, her hands trembling as she tried to explain what had happened at work. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to anchor her. I could see the expectation in her face, the silent plea for me to stay, to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. But my phone kept buzzing. It was my supervisor from the cleaning agency. I\u2019d just discovered that the client\u2019s house was out of the only product that could get the stains out of their marble counters, and the next job was in less than an hour. If I didn\u2019t act fast, I\u2019d risk a complaint, maybe even my job. My wife\u2019s voice wavered, and I felt the weight of her crisis pressing on me, but the demands of my other role pulled just as hard. I stared at the floor, heart pounding, torn between the person who needed me most and the job that kept us afloat."}
