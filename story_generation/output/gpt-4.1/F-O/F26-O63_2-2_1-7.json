My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo extra minutes, please. The queue is packed.\u201d I glanced across the room at my granddaughter, slumped over her homework, her eyes red-rimmed and distant. She\u2019d barely spoken since she arrived, and I could sense the weight she carried. My heart ached to reach out, to offer the comfort and wisdom she\u2019d always found in my stories and gentle advice. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014break time, exactly ten minutes, not a second more. If I lingered, management would notice, and I\u2019d risk a warning. Yet, if I rushed, I\u2019d miss the chance to be the grandmother she needed right now. The pressure built inside me, torn between the demands of my job and the silent plea in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes. I stared at the clock, my hands trembling, caught between the world of ringing phones and the quiet, urgent need for love at my kitchen table."}
