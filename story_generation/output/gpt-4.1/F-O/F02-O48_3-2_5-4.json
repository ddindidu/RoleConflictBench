My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is unacceptable. I could see the fear in his eyes as I knelt down to talk to him, but before I could say anything, my phone buzzed. It was the hospital. One of my patients, recovering from surgery, had slightly elevated vital signs, and the nurse on duty needed me to come in and check on her immediately. \n\nI felt torn. My son needed me to guide him, to help him understand the consequences of his actions. But my patient depended on me too; her health could be at risk if I didn\u2019t respond quickly. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention. I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good father and a dedicated nursing assistant, unsure which role to answer first."}
