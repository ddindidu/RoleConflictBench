It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Need to talk.\u201d I called her right away, and her voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the daughter who could hold her together. My heart ached, wanting nothing more than to be there for her, to offer comfort and strength.\n\nBut as I listened, my next client arrived, hair damp and sticking to her forehead from her workout. She smiled apologetically, \u201cSorry, I just came from the gym.\u201d I knew I needed to wash and condition her hair before starting, to give her the best service and keep the salon\u2019s standards. My boss glanced over, expecting me to stay on schedule.\n\nI clutched the phone, torn between my mother\u2019s shaky voice in my ear and the client waiting in my chair. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
