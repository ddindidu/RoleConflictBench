My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you come? We need you. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew my family needed me, my presence as a grandmother was expected, especially now with the serious situation unfolding at home. But as I glanced up, I noticed a young swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. The expectation here was just as clear: I had to be vigilant, ready to leap in at any sign of distress. My mind raced, torn between the desperate pull of family and the immediate responsibility for every life in the water. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My hands trembled as I gripped the armrests, caught in the impossible space between duty and love, not yet knowing which way I would turn."}
