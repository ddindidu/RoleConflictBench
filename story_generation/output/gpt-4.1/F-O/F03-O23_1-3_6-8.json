I knew she worried about me, about the long hours and the stress, and I wanted to reassure her, to be the son she needed\u2014open, supportive, honest. But my mind was tangled in the day\u2019s events at the firm. Opposing counsel had cornered me, pressing for details about my client\u2019s case, details I could never share. The weight of my oath as a lawyer pressed down on me, demanding silence, discretion, and unwavering loyalty to my client\u2019s trust. Yet here was my mother, hoping for a glimpse into my world, wanting to help, to understand. I felt the words rising in my throat, the urge to confide, to let her in.
