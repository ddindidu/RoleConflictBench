They worried about me, living alone in the city, working long hours at the hospital. I knew how much these calls meant to them, and to me too\u2014I missed their voices, their gentle questions, their laughter.\n\nBut tonight, as I glanced at the clock, I was still at my desk, reviewing the chart of a patient with a rare autoimmune disease. She needed a precise combination of medications, and her symptoms had changed suddenly. I was the only doctor on call, and the pharmacy was waiting for my updated prescription. If I delayed, her treatment could be compromised.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. I felt the weight of my parents\u2019 expectations, their hope for a daughter who remembered to call, who cared. At the same time, I felt the responsibility of my patient, relying on me to make the right decision, right now. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between two worlds that both needed me."}
