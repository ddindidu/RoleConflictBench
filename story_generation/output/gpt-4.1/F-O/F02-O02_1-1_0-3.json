As an engineer, I knew the routine safety audit was scheduled for next week, and I had plenty of time to update the documentation. Still, my manager\u2019s reminder email echoed in my head: \u201cLet\u2019s make sure everything is perfect this time.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if anything slipped through, it would be on me. But then my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pick up the kids. It\u2019s their last day of school!\u201d My heart tightened. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there, waiting at the gate, just like all the other parents. I imagined their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to see me. The expectation to be a reliable father clashed with the pressure to be a diligent engineer. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between finishing the audit prep and grabbing my keys. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
