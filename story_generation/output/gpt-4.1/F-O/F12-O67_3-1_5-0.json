My husband was bustling around, dusting shelves and arranging the guest room. Relatives would arrive in just a few hours, and the house had to be spotless. I could feel his expectation\u2014he needed my help, my attention, my partnership in making our home welcoming. But my phone, always at my side, buzzed with the constant threat of a new emergency call. As an ambulance driver, I was on standby, ready to drop everything and rush to someone\u2019s aid at a moment\u2019s notice. Every time the phone vibrated, my heart jumped. I saw the tension in my husband\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for me to stay, to finish folding the laundry, to help set the table. But I also felt the weight of my uniform in the closet, the responsibility to be there for strangers in crisis. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I stood in the hallway, mop in hand, torn between the home I\u2019d built and the lives I might save."}
