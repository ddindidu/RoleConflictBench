I know it\u2019s my mom\u2014she always texts on weekends, just to check in, to make sure I\u2019m eating and sleeping enough. I\u2019m supposed to reply, even just a quick \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d so she doesn\u2019t worry. But right now, a customer is frowning at me, voice rising about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to stay calm and friendly, just like my manager expects. My fingers itch to grab my phone, to send that reassuring message, but the line behind this customer is growing, and I can feel impatient eyes on me.
