My husband had asked if I could get the laundry done before the kids\u2019 soccer game tomorrow\u2014he needed his uniform, and the pile was growing. I knew it was my turn; we\u2019d agreed to share the chores, and I wanted to keep my promise. But my phone buzzed with a message from the site manager: \u201cInspection at 2. Make sure your work area is spotless. Safety first.\u201d I pictured the sawdust and scattered tools I\u2019d left behind in my rush to get home. If I didn\u2019t get back soon, I\u2019d be risking a safety violation, maybe even a fine. My chest tightened as I looked from the overflowing laundry basket to the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be reliable at home, but I couldn\u2019t ignore my responsibility as a carpenter. I stood frozen, torn between the laundry room and the job site, wishing I could split myself in two."}
