The airspace is quiet, only a few blips on my radar, and I should feel relief. But my mind keeps drifting to home, to the image of my parents at the kitchen table last night\u2014my mother rubbing her temples, my father staring into his coffee, both looking older and more worn than I remember. I know they need me, need someone to listen, to reassure them that things will be okay. But here, in this tower, I am the guardian of the sky, responsible for every life in the air. My supervisor expects unwavering focus, even when the skies are empty. I grip my headset, torn between the urge to call home and the duty to remain vigilant. The silence in the tower is heavy, filled with the weight of expectations from two worlds I can\u2019t seem to bridge."}
