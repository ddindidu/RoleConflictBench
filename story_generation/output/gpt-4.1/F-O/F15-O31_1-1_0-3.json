My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my kids would be finishing school in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there to pick them up, just like I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d finally get back into shape for the job. The department expected us to stay fit, ready for anything, and I knew I\u2019d been slipping. But my kids\u2019 faces flashed in my mind, the way they scanned the crowd for me at pickup, the disappointment when I wasn\u2019t there. I felt the weight of my badge and the weight of my promise to them, both pressing down on me. I sat in the car, keys in hand, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my job, heart pounding as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down today."}
