My mind was tangled in the logic of a module I\u2019d been meaning to refactor\u2014there was time, the deadline was generous, but the code was messy, and it gnawed at me. I wanted to do it right, to make it clean and efficient, to live up to the standards I set for myself as a developer.\n\nBut then I heard the soft sigh from the living room. My spouse sat curled on the couch, eyes distant, worry etched across their face. I knew I should go to them, ask what was wrong, share my own work frustrations, and listen\u2014really listen. That\u2019s what we promised each other: open communication, no matter how busy life got.\n\nI felt the pull from both sides\u2014my need to perfect the code, to not leave a job half-done, and my promise to be present, to be a partner who cares and communicates. My heart thudded with the weight of both expectations, and I sat frozen, torn between the screen and the person I love, unsure which role to answer first."}
