As I stepped inside, I saw my younger brother slump onto the couch, his eyes red and shoulders tense. He barely looked up when I asked how his day was, but I could tell something was wrong. I wanted to sit beside him, to listen and offer comfort like I always tried to do when things got tough for him. But my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. The passenger\u2019s message was urgent: their train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was all the way across town. I knew I was the closest driver, and if I didn\u2019t accept, they\u2019d probably miss their train. My brother needed me, but so did this stranger. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between being the supportive sibling he expected and the reliable taxi driver my passenger depended on. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my brother\u2019s eyes against the anxious plea in the passenger\u2019s message, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
