The customer on the other end was relentless, firing questions about the legitimacy of our latest offer, his tone growing sharper with every word. I could feel my heart pounding, knowing my supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly and keep the customer satisfied. Just then, I caught sight of my son slipping a candy bar into his pocket, his eyes darting nervously toward me. My stomach dropped. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to address this moment and guide him toward honesty and discipline. But the customer was still talking, demanding answers, and I couldn\u2019t afford to lose this sale or risk a complaint. My son\u2019s guilty face tugged at me, while the customer\u2019s voice grew louder in my ear. I felt torn in two, pulled by the urgent needs of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to my child and the expectations of my job, unsure which to answer first."}
