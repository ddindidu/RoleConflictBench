It was a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew my son had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to check in more often, to be the steady presence my family needed. But before I could even dial, the radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling me to a nearby home. A woman had fallen, broken her arm, and needed immediate care. I grabbed my bag, adrenaline kicking in, but my mind was split. My family expected me to be there, to listen, to comfort. My patient would expect calm, capable hands and reassurance. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I stood for a moment, phone in one hand, medical kit in the other, torn between the voices calling out for me."}
