As her brother, I was expected to be there, clapping the loudest, making her feel like a champion. But as the lifeguard on duty, my eyes were trained on the water, scanning for trouble. That\u2019s when I noticed her and her friends, giddy with excitement, edging dangerously close to the deep end, ignoring the bold NO DIVING signs. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions, not even for family.\u201d I could see my sister\u2019s expectant smile, waiting for me to join the celebration, but I also saw the risk\u2014one wrong move, and someone could get hurt. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads of being the proud brother she needed and the strict lifeguard I was supposed to be. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, torn between enforcing the rules and not wanting to embarrass her in front of her friends."}
