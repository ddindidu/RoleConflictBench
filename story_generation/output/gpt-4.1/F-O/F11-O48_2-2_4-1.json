It was my dad\u2019s birthday, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories around the table. But as I tucked my phone away, I glanced at Mrs. Carter, my patient, who was struggling to sit up in bed. She\u2019d just had surgery, and her face tightened in pain as she tried to move. My shift was supposed to end soon, but the evening nurse had called in sick, and the supervisor asked if I could stay a little longer to help. I could see the expectation in Mrs. Carter\u2019s eyes\u2014she needed me to help her bathe and get dressed, to make her comfortable for the night. My heart twisted as I thought of my family waiting for me, plates set and candles lit, while here, someone else depended on me just as much. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which need I should answer first."}
