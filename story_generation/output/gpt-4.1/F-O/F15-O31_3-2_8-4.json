The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a weight pressing on my chest. I needed to pick up extra shifts, maybe even overtime, to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind.

I grabbed my uniform, heart pounding, knowing my presence could mean the difference between chaos and safety for those involved. But as I drove, my thoughts kept drifting back to my family, to the promise I\u2019d made to keep a roof over their heads. The city needed me now, but so did my family. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, torn between duty and responsibility, unsure which way to turn."}
