Today was the day of our family\u2019s annual ceremony, and my mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cYou must lead this year, it\u2019s your turn to honor our ancestors.\u201d I felt the weight of her expectation, the pride in her eyes, and the importance of not letting my family down. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from my supervisor blinked on the screen: \u201cFull house deep clean today. Every room spotless. No exceptions.\u201d My job as a housekeeping cleaner paid our bills, and I knew how much my boss relied on me to keep the standards high. I could picture the dust in the corners, the streaks on the windows, the checklist waiting for my signature. My heart pounded as I stood between the altar and the mop, torn by the pull of tradition and the demands of work. Both roles needed me, both expected my best, and I could feel the pressure building, unsure which path to take."}
