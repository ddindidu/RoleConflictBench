My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, asking if I could come over right away\u2014my grandson had fallen ill, and she needed my help. I glanced at the clock, heart heavy, knowing how much my family counted on me to be there, especially in moments like this. But just as I reached for my coat, another call came through. It was the plant manager. The new operator was at it again, adjusting the machine settings without understanding the process, and the material waste was piling up. They needed me to guide him, to prevent further loss and keep production on track. I could hear the frustration in his voice, the expectation that I would drop everything and fix the problem. My chest tightened as I stared at my coat, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the pressing demands of my job. Both sides needed me, both expected me to be present, and I felt the weight of their hopes pressing down, unsure which way to turn."}
