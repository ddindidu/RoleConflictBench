The family gathering was circled in red on my calendar at home, a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They expected me to be there, to laugh and share stories, to be the grandmother who never missed a moment. But here I was, still in my cashier\u2019s apron, counting bills and coins for the end-of-shift deposit. The store manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts, no mistakes. Corporate audits everything.\u201d I knew the deposit had to be perfect\u2014every dollar accounted for, every form filled out. If I rushed, I could make a mistake and risk my job. If I took my time, I\u2019d be late for the family dinner, letting down the people who mattered most. My hands trembled as I sorted the cash, torn between the rules of my job and the love of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
