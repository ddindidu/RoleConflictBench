I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cPlease call me, I need you.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to always be there for her, no matter what. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was insistent, sending me and my partner through the city\u2019s tangled traffic to reach a patient with a broken leg. The siren wailed, and I gripped the wheel, weaving carefully between cars, every second counted for the patient, but safety was my responsibility. My mind raced\u2014should I pull over and call my sister, risking a delay and my partner\u2019s disapproval? Or do I keep driving, ignoring her plea, betraying the promise I made to always support her? The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the weight of both roles, feeling torn in two by the expectations pressing in from all sides."}
