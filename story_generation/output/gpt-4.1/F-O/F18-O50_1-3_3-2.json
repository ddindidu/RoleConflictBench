My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d vote for her favorite trail. I knew how much these moments meant to them, especially after the long weeks we\u2019d all had. Just as I was about to chime in, my phone buzzed urgently. The hospital\u2019s number flashed on the screen. My heart skipped. I was the on-call machine repairer tonight, and the message was clear: a life-support device in the ICU was showing critical fault codes. They needed me to diagnose and fix it\u2014fast. I looked at my family, their faces expectant, and felt the weight of their unspoken wish for me to be present. At the same time, I pictured the hospital room, the beeping alarms, the patient\u2019s life hanging in the balance. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold, pressing responsibility waiting for me at the hospital."}
