My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him move the heavy coffee table before his cousins arrived. The house was a flurry of activity\u2014vacuuming, dusting, making sure every corner was spotless for our guests. My phone buzzed insistently on the counter. I dried my hands and glanced at the screen: an urgent message from the factory. The main production unit had stopped again, sensor errors halting everything. They needed me to diagnose the issue immediately. My mind raced\u2014if I left now, the house wouldn\u2019t be ready, and my husband would be left to handle everything alone. But if I stayed, the factory would lose precious time and money, and my team would be waiting for my expertise. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me not to fail. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the home I built and the machines that depended on me."}
