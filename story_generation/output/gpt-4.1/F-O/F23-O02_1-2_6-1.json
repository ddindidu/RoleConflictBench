My phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Jamie\u2019s expecting the Nintendo tomorrow. You promised.\u201d I stared at the text, guilt gnawing at me. As a step-parent, I wanted to keep my word, to see Jamie\u2019s face light up, to prove I could provide. But the numbers in my bank account told a different story\u2014money was tight, and the project at work was behind schedule. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need that prototype, or we risk losing the contract.\u201d The pressure to deliver a technical solution was crushing, every bug fix and design tweak eating into my time and energy. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be a reliable parent and the demands of my engineering role. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing Jamie, but my mind raced with the consequences of missing the project deadline. I stared at the unopened Nintendo tab on my browser, my cursor hovering over the \u201cBuy Now\u201d button, paralyzed by the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
