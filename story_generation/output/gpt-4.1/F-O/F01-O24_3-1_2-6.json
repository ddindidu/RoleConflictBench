As a judge, it was my duty to stay sharp, to keep up with every shift in the law so I could serve justice fairly. My eyes scanned the first paragraph, but then I heard a soft knock. My granddaughter stood in the doorway, her face troubled. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? I really need your advice about something important.\u201d \n\nI saw the worry in her eyes, the trust she placed in me as her grandfather. She needed my wisdom, my time, my undivided attention. But the journal on my desk seemed to weigh heavier, reminding me of the cases waiting, the responsibility to remain informed. I felt torn\u2014my heart pulled toward my granddaughter, my mind pulled toward my duty as a judge. Both roles demanded my best, but in this moment, I could not give both what they deserved. I took a deep breath, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I had to choose which expectation to meet first."}
