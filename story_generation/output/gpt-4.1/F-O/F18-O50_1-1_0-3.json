He looked up at me, eyes wide with worry, and I knew he needed me to be there for him, to reassure him that he could get through his final exam. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the factory\u2019s machines were due for their annual maintenance next week, and I was responsible for making sure everything was ready for the shutdown. If I didn\u2019t prepare the tools and parts list tonight, I\u2019d risk missing something crucial, and the whole line could be delayed. My brother\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, asking if I could quiz him on formulas. I felt torn\u2014he needed my support, but so did my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I could feel my chest tighten as I tried to figure out how to be the sibling he needed and the reliable repairer my team depended on."}
