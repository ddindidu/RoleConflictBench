My partner\u2019s words echo in my mind\u2014how important it is that we both share the load, especially with the kids\u2019 soccer game tomorrow and everyone needing clean uniforms. I promised I\u2019d handle the laundry tonight.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a new email from work. The subject line makes my stomach clench: \u201cURGENT: Updated Safety Standard Compliance Required.\u201d The new regulation goes into effect with our next product release, and I\u2019m the lead engineer responsible for ensuring every box is checked, every document in order. If I don\u2019t review the evidence tonight, we risk a costly delay\u2014or worse, a safety issue.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family counts on me to be present, to keep our home running smoothly. My team counts on me to keep our project safe and on track. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the hum of the washing machine and the ping of my inbox pulling me in opposite directions."}
