I reached for her hand, trying to be present, to listen, to reassure her that she could share anything with me. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my next patient was waiting at the clinic. I was already running late. \n\nShe needed me to listen, to be open, to share my own worries and let her in. But as a doctor, I knew my patient was likely sitting in the exam room, feverish and uncomfortable, expecting me to diagnose and prescribe the right treatment for their strep throat. My mind raced between the two worlds: the expectation to be a supportive spouse, and the duty to care for my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
