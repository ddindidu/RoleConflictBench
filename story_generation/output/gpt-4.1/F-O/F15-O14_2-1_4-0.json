My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cCheck reagent delivery for tomorrow\u2019s run.\u201d I glance up just in time to see my son darting down the cereal aisle, giggling, weaving between startled shoppers. Instinctively, the parent in me wants to call him back, kneel down, and explain\u2014again\u2014why we don\u2019t run indoors, why we respect others\u2019 space. I know I should use this moment to teach him about discipline and kindness, to reinforce the values I want him to carry into adulthood.\n\nBut my mind is split. The scientist in me is already cataloging the variables for tomorrow\u2019s experiment, thinking about the data I need, the hypotheses I\u2019m eager to test. I know the experiment can wait, that missing this slot won\u2019t derail my research, but the pressure to stay on schedule, to not fall behind, tugs at me. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s expectant eyes, the silent judgment of other shoppers, the persistent buzz of scientific curiosity and responsibility. I stand frozen, torn between the urge to parent and the pull of my work, heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
