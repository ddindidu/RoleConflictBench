My manager was asking for time estimates on the new feature, and I knew I needed to chime in soon. The planning session was informal, but everyone expected me to give a realistic timeline. My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute? Dad seems a bit down today.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I called now, I\u2019d miss my chance to speak up in the meeting, but if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my parents down when they needed me. I could hear the expectation in my mom\u2019s words\u2014she wanted me to check in, to be the daughter who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home. At the same time, my team was waiting for my input, trusting me to help shape the project\u2019s direction. My heart pounded as I weighed the pull of both worlds, feeling the pressure of being needed in two places at once."}
