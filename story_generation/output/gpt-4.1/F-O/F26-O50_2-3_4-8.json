The living room was filled with laughter and the smell of fresh-baked cookies, and I could feel the warmth of being surrounded by those I love. Just as she began her story, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a message from the factory\u2014new staff were about to start a batch on the old press, and they didn\u2019t know the safety procedures. My mind raced. If I didn\u2019t guide them, someone could get hurt. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss this moment, the one my granddaughter had been waiting for all week.
