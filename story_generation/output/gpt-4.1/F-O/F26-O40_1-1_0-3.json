It was my granddaughter, her voice uncertain as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d She was on the verge of starting college, and I could hear the worry in her words. I wanted to set down my tools, sit with her, and share the stories of my own leaps into the unknown, to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed. But just then, my work phone rang\u2014a client with a rush order for a custom bookshelf. They needed an estimate by noon, and I hadn\u2019t even started calculating the lumber or hardware. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be the steady, guiding presence for my granddaughter and the responsibility to keep my business running smoothly. The scent of sawdust hung in the air as I stood there, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
