I was about to log off when I heard the front door slam. My younger brother trudged in, his backpack hanging off one shoulder, eyes red and puffy. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew that look; something had gone wrong at school, probably with his friends again. As his sibling, I felt the pull to sit beside him, to ask what happened, to be the support he needed. But my headset was still on, and technically, my break hadn\u2019t started yet. If I left my desk now, I\u2019d be bending the rules, even if the supervisors were lenient today. My heart twisted as I watched him wipe his eyes, torn between the urge to comfort him and the responsibility to stick to my work schedule."}
