I think you misunderstood what I said earlier.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in his words, and I knew I owed him a conversation\u2014one where I listened, explained, and tried to rebuild the trust that had frayed between us. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, the plant manager\u2019s voice echoed through the workshop: \u201cWe need you at the main line, now! The sensor\u2019s down again\u2014production\u2019s at a standstill.\u201d I glanced at the blinking red light on the control panel, the pressure mounting with every minute the machines sat idle. My team expected me to jump in, diagnose the fault, and get the line running. My brother expected me to be present, to care enough to clear the air. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urgent demands of the factory and the fragile bond with my brother. Both needed me, both right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
