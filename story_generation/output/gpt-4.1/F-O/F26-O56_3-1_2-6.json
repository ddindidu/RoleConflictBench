It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I wanted to drop everything and call her, to be the wise, steady presence she needed. But just then, my next client arrived, her hair still damp and smelling of fresh shampoo. \u201cI washed it right before I came,\u201d she said, settling into the chair. Salon policy was clear: every client gets a wash and condition, no exceptions. My boss expected consistency, and clients expected the full treatment. But her hair was spotless, and she looked anxious, maybe in a hurry. I glanced at my phone, torn between the rules of my job and the pull of my family. My hands hovered over the sink, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
