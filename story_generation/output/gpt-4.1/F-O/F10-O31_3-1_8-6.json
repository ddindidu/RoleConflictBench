She confided in me about her recent anxiety, her eyes searching mine for comfort. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her vulnerability, knowing she needed me to be her daughter\u2014her safe place, her support. My phone buzzed with a message from work: a car was parked illegally outside, and I was the closest officer. I stepped outside, only to see my father\u2019s car in the spot, his hurried morning forgotten in his rush to help my mother. The law was clear, but so was the expectation to be fair and compassionate. My badge felt heavy on my chest, my heart torn between the duty to uphold the rules and the urge to shield my parents from more stress. I stood on the curb, ticket book in hand, my mother\u2019s tearful face and my father\u2019s anxious glance both echoing in my mind, caught between the daughter they needed and the officer I was sworn to be."}
