The line stretches past the candy racks, and I can feel the impatience radiating from the customers. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAccuracy and speed, especially during rush hour.\u201d I try to focus, but my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Jamie\u2014my partner. \u201cCan you talk? I need you. Big decision at work. I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d I know how much Jamie relies on me for support, especially in moments like this. I want to be there, to listen, to reassure.
