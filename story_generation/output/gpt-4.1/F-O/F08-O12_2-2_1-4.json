The design documents for the new feature were due by the end of the day, and the product team was already asking for clarifications. My mind raced with technical details, diagrams, and dependencies.

But the clock was ticking, and my team was counting on my input to move forward. I felt torn, my heart aching to offer comfort and wisdom, to listen and help her find her way, while my mind screamed about deadlines and responsibilities.
