The living room still needed dusting, the guest towels had to be folded, and I\u2019d promised to help with dinner. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the networking event at the firm was in an hour. I dried my hands, changed quickly, and hurried out, guilt gnawing at me for leaving so much for my husband to handle alone.\n\nAt the event, I tried to focus on small talk, but my mind kept drifting back to the unmade beds and cluttered hallway. Then, a colleague\u2019s friend leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story with that high-profile client of yours?\u201d she asked, curiosity gleaming in her eyes. I felt the weight of my professional oath pressing down, the need to protect my client\u2019s privacy absolute.

My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the demands of my home and my career, feeling the tension of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
