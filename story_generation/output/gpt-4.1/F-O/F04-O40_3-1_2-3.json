It was my sister, her voice trembling as she asked if I could come over. She never called unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew I should be there\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me, and we\u2019d promised to support each other, no matter what. But just as I hung up, my boss walked in, dropping a new order on my workbench. \u201cWe need this cabinet done by Friday,\u201d he said, \u201cand I need your material estimates by the end of the day.\u201d I glanced at the plans, already calculating the wood and hardware I\u2019d need. The pressure was on; if I didn\u2019t get the order right, the whole project would be delayed. My mind raced between the urgent needs of my sister and the demands of my job. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each expecting me to drop everything for them.
