Everyone\u2019s counting on you to help with the celebration.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Grandma\u2019s holiday dinner was a big deal\u2014my family expected me there, not just to show up, but to be present, to help, to laugh, to make memories. But at the same time, my work laptop chimed with reminders: \u201cFinal day of the quarter. Every call counts. We need you to close those last deals.\u201d My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind, the pressure of sales targets heavy on my shoulders. If I missed this window, my team could lose bonuses, and I\u2019d let them down. I felt torn, my stomach twisting as I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I bailed, and my coworkers\u2019 frustration if I didn\u2019t pull my weight. I sat at my desk, phone in one hand, car keys in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the brother my family needed and the telemarketer my team depended on."}
