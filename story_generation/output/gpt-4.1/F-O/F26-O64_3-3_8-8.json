My cheeks ache from smiling, and I nod sympathetically at the woman in front of me, her voice rising as she complains about a missing discount. I remind myself to stay calm, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, especially during the holiday rush. But my phone vibrates in my apron pocket, and I know it\u2019s my daughter. She texted earlier\u2014my grandson is in trouble, and the family is reeling. I should be there, offering comfort, checking in, being the steady grandparent they need. Instead, I\u2019m here, forced to swallow my worry and focus on the next customer\u2019s coupons. My mind races with guilt. I want to call, to reassure them, to be present. But the store is packed, and my manager is watching. I can\u2019t leave, not now. I grip the counter, torn between the family who needs me and the strangers who expect my patience."}
