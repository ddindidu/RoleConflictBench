They reached for my hand, voice trembling as they spoke about the overwhelming weight of their father\u2019s illness. I squeezed their fingers, trying to offer comfort, but my mind kept drifting to the lab. The safety audit was in two hours, and I knew the autoclave\u2019s pressure gauge was still malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the whole lab could be cited, or worse, shut down. My partner\u2019s words blurred together as guilt gnawed at me\u2014how could I leave them now, when they needed me most? But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my team, risking everyone\u2019s work and safety. I felt split in two, heart pounding, as both worlds pulled at me with equal force."}
