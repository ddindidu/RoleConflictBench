My grandson was struggling at school, and she needed advice, comfort\u2014just someone to listen. I felt the familiar tug of family, the expectation that I would be present, supportive, the steady hand in a storm. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again: an urgent email from the office. Reviewing the latest building plans, I spotted a few minor inconsistencies. They weren\u2019t likely to cause immediate problems, but as the lead architect, I was responsible for every detail, every line. Safety and compliance weren\u2019t just words\u2014they were my duty. My mind raced between the two worlds: the warmth and worry of my family, the cold precision of my profession. I could hear my daughter\u2019s voice in my head, pleading for help, while my team waited for my decision. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, torn between the needs of those I love and the responsibilities I cannot ignore."}
