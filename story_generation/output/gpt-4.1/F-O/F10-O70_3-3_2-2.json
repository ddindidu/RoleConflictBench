I knew the delivery had to be on time\u2014lives could depend on it. The address label was clear: Emergency Department, 10:30 a.m. sharp. I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes left. \n\nBut my phone kept vibrating. I knew it was Mom. We always texted at this time, sharing little updates, and she worried if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. I could almost hear her voice in my head, \u201cAre you okay? Did you eat? How\u2019s work?\u201d She expected me to answer, to keep our daily ritual going. \n\nMy heart pounded as I reached the hospital doors. If I stopped to text, I might be late with the delivery. If I ignored Mom, she\u2019d worry all day, maybe even call my boss. The weight of the box pressed into my arms, but the weight of their expectations pressed even harder on my chest. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the urgent needs of strangers and the gentle, persistent love of my mother, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
