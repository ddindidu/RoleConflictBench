And please help set the table.\u201d The house is a whirlwind of last-minute cleaning, and I promised I\u2019d help. But just as I reach for the vacuum, my work phone rings\u2014an emergency diversion, a passenger jet with engine trouble, is cutting across three sectors. I\u2019m needed at the radar screen, now. My team is counting on me to coordinate with two other controllers, to keep the skies safe and clear. My heart pounds as I glance at the mess in the living room, then at the blinking light on my work phone. I can almost hear the tension in my spouse\u2019s voice, the expectation that I\u2019ll be present and helpful, just this once. But the voices of my colleagues echo in my mind too, the unspoken demand that I\u2019ll be focused, decisive, and unflappable. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I stand frozen, torn between the chaos at home and the crisis in the sky."}
