The family group chat buzzed with excitement\u2014tonight was the long-awaited family gathering, and my daughter had reminded me how much the grandkids were looking forward to seeing me. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being together. But as I made my rounds at the care home, I paused outside Mrs. Carter\u2019s room. She\u2019d been especially quiet today, her eyes searching mine for comfort during my last visit. I knew she counted on me for more than just medication\u2014she needed someone to talk to, someone to make her feel less alone. My supervisor expected me to be present, attentive, and compassionate, especially with patients like Mrs. Carter. Yet, my family expected me to be there, to be the grandparent who never misses a moment. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, unsure which door I should walk through next."}
