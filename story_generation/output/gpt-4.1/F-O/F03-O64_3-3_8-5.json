The deposit had to be exact\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions. The manager had reminded me twice: follow every step, or the audit would be on me. As I was double-checking the bills, my phone buzzed. It was Mom. Her voice trembled, and she told me Dad had lost his job. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the son who could hold her together. But the cash drawer was open, and the policy was clear: no personal calls, no leaving the money unattended, no mistakes. I could hear Mom\u2019s tears, her hope that I\u2019d say something to make it better. My hands shook as I tried to focus on the numbers, but my heart was with her, wanting to drop everything and be the comfort she needed.
