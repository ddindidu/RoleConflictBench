My partner\u2019s text pings: \u201cCan you fold the laundry before I get home? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I know they\u2019ve been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d help more around the house. But my headset buzzes, and the call queue on my telemarketing dashboard is already flashing red. Management sent another reminder this morning: \u201cBreaks must be logged and strictly timed. No exceptions.\u201d If I step away now, even for ten minutes, I\u2019ll be flagged for an unscheduled break, and I can\u2019t afford another warning. My chest tightens as I glance between the laundry and my screen. I want to be the supportive spouse my partner needs, but I also need to keep my job. The pressure from both sides squeezes me, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy everyone. My hand hovers over the \u201cpause\u201d button, heart pounding, as I weigh which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
