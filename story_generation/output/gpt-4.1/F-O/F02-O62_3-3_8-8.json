My mind kept drifting to the bills stacked on the kitchen table, the looming home loan repayment that was due in two months. I needed to pick up extra shifts, maybe even a second job, to make sure my family stayed afloat. My wife was counting on me, and so were the kids. But right now, I was a lifeguard, responsible for every life in this pool. Suddenly, I spotted a child flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits. My heart pounded. I knew the rules\u2014no one was allowed there without supervision. If I let this slide, I\u2019d be failing as a lifeguard. But if I enforced the rules too harshly, I risked complaints, maybe even losing this job I desperately needed. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, my family\u2019s future on one side, the child\u2019s safety on the other. I felt frozen, torn between the expectations of a father and the duties of a lifeguard, unsure which demand to answer first."}
