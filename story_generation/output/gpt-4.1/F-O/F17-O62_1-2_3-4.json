As the youngest, I\u2019m expected to help set the table, join in the prayers, and listen to stories about our heritage. Today, I was supposed to be home early to help my mom prepare for the big dinner, a tradition she insists we all honor. But as I finished my shift at the pool, I noticed the lane rope was broken\u2014frayed and tangled, a hazard for tomorrow\u2019s swim lessons. As a lifeguard, I\u2019m responsible for making sure everything is safe and ready, and I know if I leave it, the morning staff will be scrambling. My phone buzzes with a text from my mom: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I stare at the broken rope, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job."}
