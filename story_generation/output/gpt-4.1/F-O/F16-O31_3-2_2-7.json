Please call when you can.\u201d My heart twisted. Jamie\u2019s father had just been diagnosed with cancer, and every night, I promised I\u2019d be there, to listen, to hold them, to help them through the fear. But tonight, I was called to a fender-bender on Main Street. Two drivers, both angry, both insisting the other was at fault. As a police officer, I had to be calm, impartial, and thorough\u2014no shortcuts, no rushing, even though my mind was with Jamie. The drivers expected fairness, and my badge demanded integrity. But Jamie needed me, too, and every minute I spent here felt like a betrayal. I could feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wore and the one I put on at home\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. My radio crackled, the drivers argued, and my phone vibrated again. I stood there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and dreading the choice I\u2019d have to make."}
