He asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and I hesitated, the memory of my shift still fresh. As a cashier, I\u2019d spent the last hour of work handling a string of high-value transactions, my mind laser-focused on every bill and receipt.

Now, at home, I was expected to open up, to share honestly about my day. But I worried that if I let my guard down, the stress and anxiety would spill out, making him worry too.
