Every bill, every coin had to be accounted for, double-checked, and signed off. The manager had warned us: one mistake, and the audit would be a nightmare. As I was halfway through, my phone buzzed. It was my sister, her name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, but answered. Her voice was shaky, on the verge of tears. She needed me\u2014right now. She\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew she expected the same in return. But the cash drawer was open, and the deposit had to be finished before I could leave. If I walked away, even for a minute, I\u2019d be breaking store policy, risking my job. My heart pounded as I looked from the money to my phone, torn between the sister who needed me and the cashier who had to follow the rules."}
