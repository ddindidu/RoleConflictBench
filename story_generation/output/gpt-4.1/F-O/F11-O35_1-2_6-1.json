It\u2019s a message from my younger sister: \u201cAre you coming to dinner tonight? Everyone\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d make time for family, especially after missing her birthday last month. She wants us to be closer, to show up for each other, and I want that too. But as I glance at the signal indicator, a yellow light blinks\u2014there\u2019s a minor delay up ahead. I need to adjust the speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost seconds without risking anyone\u2019s safety. The passengers trust me to get them home on time, and my supervisor expects nothing less than precision. My sister expects me to be present, to prove she matters. My job expects unwavering focus. My heart pounds as I grip the controls, torn between the family waiting for me and the hundreds of strangers depending on me. I can\u2019t be late for both."}
