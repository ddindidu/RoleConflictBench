My stepmom had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, to help everyone feel more connected. I knew they wanted me to show I cared, to be present and make an effort. But as I wiped sweat from my brow, the foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, \u201cHey, we need that lumber now! The carpenter\u2019s waiting!\u201d The pressure was on\u2014if I didn\u2019t keep up, the whole crew would fall behind, and I\u2019d be letting everyone down. My hands ached, and my mind raced. I could already picture my stepbrother\u2019s disappointed look if I missed dinner again, but I also saw the frustration on the carpenter\u2019s face as he waited for me. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which responsibility I should let down."}
