She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she mentioned showing me her art project. I knew how much it meant to her for me to be there, to sit in the front row and wave when she looked up. But as I glanced at the stack of tax documents on my desk, my stomach tightened. The quarterly tax filing deadline was looming, and I still had to double-check the expense reports and reconcile the accounts. Missing a detail could mean penalties for the company, and my boss had made it clear that compliance was non-negotiable. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my daughter\u2019s hopeful face on one side, the weight of professional responsibility on the other. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
