My daughter and grandkids would arrive any minute for our long-awaited family gathering. I\u2019d promised to teach my granddaughter how to make her favorite cookies, and my son-in-law was counting on my stories from the old days. Just as I was setting out the plates, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling during my routine check-in. \u201cSorry to bother you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut could you walk me through the basics of the new machine? I\u2019m a bit lost.\u201d I could hear the uncertainty in his voice, and I knew how important it was to make a good impression, to be reliable and helpful. But as laughter echoed from the driveway, my heart twisted. I wanted to be present for my family, to be the grandmother they expected, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a machine repairer. The phone felt heavy in my hand as I stood between the kitchen and the call, torn by the demands of both worlds."}
