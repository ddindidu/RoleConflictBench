My husband had texted earlier, asking if I could fold the clothes tonight since he\u2019d cooked dinner. I\u2019d promised I would, but now, standing behind my client, I felt the weight of another expectation. The woman in my chair, a first-time visitor, stared at her reflection, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I thought,\u201d she said quietly, not meeting my eyes. I could sense her disappointment, and my stomach twisted. I knew I needed to listen, reassure her, maybe even redo the colour. But my shift was almost over, and the thought of the laundry waiting at home gnawed at me. I felt torn\u2014between being the attentive hairdresser my client deserved and the reliable wife I wanted to be. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
