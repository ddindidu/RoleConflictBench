He was upset about our argument last night, and his words stung: \u201cCan we talk? I hate fighting with you.\u201d I wanted to call him right away, to clear the air and show him I cared, to be the sister who listens and helps us both move past misunderstandings. But at that moment, a new client stepped inside, her eyes darting nervously around the salon. She looked lost, clutching her purse tightly. As a hairdresser, I was expected to greet her warmly, put her at ease, and make her first visit comfortable. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my brother, who needed reassurance and open communication, and toward the anxious client, who needed my professional attention and kindness. I stood there, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
