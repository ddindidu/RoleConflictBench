My grandson had a high fever, and the doctor wanted to see him right away. \u201cCan you come watch the baby?\u201d she pleaded. My heart clenched\u2014I knew how much my family needed me, especially in moments like this. But as I hung up, my work phone buzzed. A package, delayed at the warehouse, had finally arrived. It was marked urgent, and the customer had already called twice, anxious for its arrival. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTimeliness is everything. One late delivery, and we lose trust.\u201d I looked at the clock, calculating the time it would take to drop off the package versus heading straight to my daughter\u2019s house. My hands shook as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the family that needed my comfort and the job that demanded my reliability. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
