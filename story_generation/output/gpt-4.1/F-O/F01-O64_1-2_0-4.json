It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can we talk? I\u2019m scared about starting high school.\u201d My heart ached to be the wise, steady presence she needed, to offer stories and reassurance like my father once did for me. But just then, a customer approached, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded, \u201cPlease, I just want to return this. I lost the slip, but it\u2019s brand new.\u201d Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, no exceptions. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the urge to step away and call my granddaughter, to be the grandfather she counted on, and the responsibility to uphold my job\u2019s standards, knowing my supervisor was watching. My hands trembled as I looked from the customer\u2019s anxious face to my phone\u2019s glowing screen, torn between the demands of family and work, both needing me in different ways at the very same moment."}
