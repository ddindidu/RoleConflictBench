He tells me his train leaves in twenty minutes, and the station is all the way across town. I know the route, know the shortcuts, but traffic is thick and the city is crawling with red lights. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my wife, reminding me that we\u2019re short on groceries and the kids need lunch money for school tomorrow. Every fare counts, and I need this one to keep us afloat. But as I weave through traffic, the passenger urges me to go faster, to beat the lights, to take risks. I feel the weight of his urgency pressing against the responsibility I have to my family\u2014not just to earn, but to come home safe. My hands tighten on the wheel, my mind torn between the desperate need for money and the duty to drive safely. The city blurs past, and I wrestle with the impossible choice, heart pounding, as the next intersection approaches."}
