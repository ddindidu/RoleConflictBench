I could tell something was wrong\u2014the way their shoulders slumped, the way they barely touched their dinner. I knew I should ask, should open the door for them to share what was weighing on their mind. That\u2019s what we promised each other: to communicate, to be there, especially when things got tough.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. The hospital needed me back on the floor. One of my patients, Mrs. Carter, was recovering from surgery, and her last set of vitals showed a slight spike in her temperature and pulse. I was expected to check on her, record her vital signs, and alert the nurse if anything changed. I could hear the urgency in my supervisor\u2019s voice\u2014patients like Mrs. Carter needed close monitoring.\n\nI looked at my spouse, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the person I loved and the patient who depended on me."}
