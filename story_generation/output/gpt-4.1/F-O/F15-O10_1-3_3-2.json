The email from the external auditor was clear: they needed the quarterly financial statements now, not later. My mind raced through numbers, deadlines, and the weight of professional responsibility. Just then, my daughter spilled her juice, the bright orange liquid spreading across the floor. She looked up at me, wide-eyed, waiting for my reaction. I remembered my promise to teach her about responsibility and cleaning up after herself, to guide her with patience and consistency. But the clock was ticking, and the auditor\u2019s request echoed in my mind. I felt the tug of both worlds\u2014my child needing gentle guidance, my job demanding immediate precision. My heart pounded as I stood between the sticky mess and the blinking cursor, torn by the impossible expectation to be fully present in both roles at once."}
