Today was the open class at Lily\u2019s school\u2014the first one since I became her stepdad. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, asking if I\u2019d be there, her eyes shining with hope. I promised I would. But just as I was about to leave, my radio crackled to life: \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and Fifth. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me as a police officer\u2014lives were at stake, and I was trained to act, to protect. But as a step-parent, I was supposed to show up, to prove to Lily that she could count on me. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, one invisible but just as real. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the flashing lights of duty and the quiet, hopeful smile of a little girl waiting at her desk."}
