My mind was already picturing my kids\u2019 eager faces, waiting for me at the gate, backpacks slung over their shoulders. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every Friday. As I grabbed my keys, my work phone buzzed. It was a new client, sounding nervous, asking for some basic machine operating tips. I could hear the uncertainty in his voice, and I knew how important it was to make a good first impression, to be patient and thorough. My company expected me to be available, to guide clients and build trust. But my children expected me to be there, to show up, to keep my word. My heart pounded as I glanced between the ringing phone and the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I stood frozen, torn between the call I should answer and the promise I needed to keep, wishing I could split myself in two."}
