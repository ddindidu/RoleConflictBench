She needed me to be present, to talk openly about our finances and the tough choices ahead. I could see the worry in her face, the way her hands twisted together. I wanted to reassure her, to give her the time and attention she deserved. But my radio sat on the counter, volume low but always threatening to crackle to life. I was on standby, uniform still on, ready to jump into action at any second. Every time her voice wavered, I felt the urge to reach for her hand, but my mind kept drifting to the possibility of an emergency call. I knew that if the radio sounded, I\u2019d have to leave her mid-sentence, no matter how important our conversation was. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my wife needed my honesty and focus, but the city needed my speed and readiness. I could feel the tension building, torn between the promise I made to her and the duty I owed to strangers."}
