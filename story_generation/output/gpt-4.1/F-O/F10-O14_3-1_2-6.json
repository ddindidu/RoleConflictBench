I know it\u2019s my mother\u2014she always texts around this time, wanting to hear about my day, asking for little details about my lunch or the weather. I usually reply right away, sending her a quick photo or a reassuring message. But today, the lab feels different. The maintenance checklist is due soon, and even though everything seems fine, I can\u2019t shake the responsibility of double-checking every piece of equipment. Safety protocols are strict, and as the lead scientist, I\u2019m expected to set the standard. My team relies on me to keep things running smoothly, and any oversight could have serious consequences. I glance at my phone again, feeling the weight of my mother\u2019s expectations\u2014her need for connection, her worry if I don\u2019t respond quickly. At the same time, the silent hum of the lab reminds me of my duty here. I stand frozen, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s familiar words and the pressing obligation to ensure the lab\u2019s safety, my heart pulled in two directions."}
