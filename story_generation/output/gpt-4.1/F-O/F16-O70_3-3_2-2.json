My partner\u2019s text was short, but I could feel the weight behind it: \u201cCan you call? I really need you right now.\u201d Lately, they\u2019d been struggling, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to listen, to help them feel less alone. But the hospital was waiting for this delivery\u2014lives might depend on it arriving on time. My supervisor had made it clear: no delays, no mistakes. I stared at my phone, torn. If I called my partner, I\u2019d risk being late. If I kept driving, I\u2019d be letting them down when they needed me most. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding, caught between the person I loved and the job that demanded my responsibility."}
