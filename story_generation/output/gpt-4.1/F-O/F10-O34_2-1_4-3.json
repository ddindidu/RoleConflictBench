My mother\u2019s words from breakfast echoed in my mind: \u201cTonight\u2019s the family ceremony. You know how much it means to your grandmother.\u201d The weight of tradition pressed on me, the expectation to be present, to recite the prayers, to honor our ancestors. But now, as the aircraft\u2019s call sign crackled through my headset, I was the air traffic controller, responsible for every soul in the sky. \u201cRequesting altimeter setting,\u201d the pilot\u2019s voice came, routine but urgent in its own way. My hand hovered over the mic, but my thoughts tangled\u2014family or duty? My family needed me to uphold our customs, to be the dutiful daughter. The pilots needed me to be precise, focused, unflinching. I felt the two worlds pulling me apart, the pressure building in my chest.
