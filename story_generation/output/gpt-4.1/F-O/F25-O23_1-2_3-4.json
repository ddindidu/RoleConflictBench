The annual family holiday dinner was circled in red\u2014a tradition my stepmother cherished, a night when I was expected to be present, to laugh, to belong. But this year, the date clashed with a court hearing I couldn\u2019t reschedule. My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and they depended on me to argue a crucial motion. I could hear my stepmother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how much it meant to her that I show up, how family comes first. Yet, my client\u2019s anxious emails echoed too, pleading for reassurance that I\u2019d be there to fight for them. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing on my chest. I wanted to honor my family, to prove I was part of them, but I also couldn\u2019t abandon my professional duty. As the day approached, I found myself torn, rehearsing explanations for both sides, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
