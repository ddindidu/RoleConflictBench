The family holiday was just days away, and everyone expected me to be there, to share stories and laughter, to be the steady presence my grandchildren looked forward to. I could almost hear their voices, asking about my old tools and begging for another bedtime tale. But as I glanced at the calendar, my mind drifted to the urgent call I\u2019d received that morning\u2014a homeowner\u2019s deck was splintered and unsafe, and they needed it fixed before their own gathering. As a carpenter, I knew the responsibility: someone\u2019s safety depended on my hands, my skill, my time. The pressure built inside me, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My family needed me present, attentive, and warm. My client needed me reliable, skilled, and prompt. I stared at my phone, torn between the promise of family and the duty of my craft, my heart aching as I tried to decide which role I would have to let down."}
