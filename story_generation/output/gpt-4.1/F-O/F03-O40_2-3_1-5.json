Tomorrow was the start of the biggest project I\u2019d ever taken on\u2014a custom kitchen for a client who expected nothing less than perfection. I needed to study every detail tonight, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss a single measurement or instruction. But as I reached for my pencil, my phone buzzed. It was Thursday evening\u2014time for my weekly call with my parents. I could already hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, asking about my week, wanting to know if I was eating well, if I was happy. They looked forward to these calls, and so did I, usually. But tonight, the weight of the blueprints pressed on me. If I called, I\u2019d lose precious hours of preparation. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d disappoint them, maybe even worry them. My thumb hovered over the call button, heart pounding, torn between being a good son and a responsible carpenter, wishing I could be both at once."}
