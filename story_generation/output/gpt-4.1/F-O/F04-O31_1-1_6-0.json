As I pulled up to the house, my heart sank\u2014it was my younger brother\u2019s place, and I could already hear the thumping bass and laughter spilling out onto the street. I knew he\u2019d invited me earlier, hoping I\u2019d join the fun, but I\u2019d declined, citing work. Now, as a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law and maintain order, but as a brother, I was supposed to support him, include him, and build mutual respect. I could already imagine the disappointment in his eyes if I shut the party down, the embarrassment in front of his friends. Yet, if I let it slide, I\u2019d be failing my duty and setting a bad example. My badge felt heavier than ever as I stood at the door, torn between the brother he needed and the officer I was sworn to be."}
