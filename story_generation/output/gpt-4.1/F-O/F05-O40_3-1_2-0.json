She\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and lately, she needs me more than ever\u2014someone to hold her, to listen, to just be there. I sat on the edge of the bed, torn. My phone buzzed: a reminder that I had to be at the site in thirty minutes. As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to be late. The foreman\u2019s strict about safety briefings, and missing one could mean risking not just my job, but the safety of everyone on site. But how could I leave her like this? She looked at me with red, pleading eyes, and I felt the weight of her need. My heart ached to stay, to comfort her, but my mind raced with the consequences of being late. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between the person she needed and the worker I was expected to be, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
