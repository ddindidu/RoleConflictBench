She looked tired, her eyes red, and Dad sat beside her, silent. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. They started sharing about Dad\u2019s job troubles, the bills piling up, and how scared they both felt. I could see how much they needed me to listen, to reassure them, to be the strong one for once. But as I sat there, I kept glancing at the clock, thinking about the rest of the house\u2014crumbs on the dining table, the bathroom that still needed scrubbing, the laundry waiting in the basket. My supervisor had already mentioned that the house wasn\u2019t up to standard last week. I felt torn, my heart aching for my parents, but my mind racing with the pressure to keep everything spotless. I wanted to be the child they needed, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility of my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which role to choose."}
