His message was long, anxious\u2014he was facing a tough decision at work and needed my advice. I could almost hear his voice, hoping I\u2019d reassure him, help him sort through the mess. I started to type a reply, but just then, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases behind them. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. I forced a smile, knowing I needed to be professional, efficient, and courteous. My mind raced: my husband needed me, but so did these customers. If I took too long texting, I\u2019d seem inattentive, maybe even rude. If I focused on the travelers, I\u2019d leave my husband alone with his worries. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the man I loved, needing comfort, and toward the job that paid our bills, demanding my full attention. I stood there, phone in hand, suitcase in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
