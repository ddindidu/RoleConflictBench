Can you get me to the station?\u201d I hesitated, glancing at the time again. My children\u2019s school let out at 3:00, and they always looked for me at the gate, their faces lighting up when they spotted me. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, just like I promised myself I\u2019d never let them wait. But the woman\u2019s urgency pressed on me\u2014she was counting on me to get her across town, safely and quickly. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I could feel the weight of both worlds: my children\u2019s trust, the passenger\u2019s need, and the impossibility of being in two places at once. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
