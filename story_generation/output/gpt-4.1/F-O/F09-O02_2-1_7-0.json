My son\u2019s shoes are worn thin, and the rent is due next week. As a mother, I feel the weight of every dollar, the constant pressure to keep our lives afloat. My phone buzzes with a message from my manager: \u201cCan you join the project call at 7 p.m.? We need your input on the new design.\u201d I know the project is still in its early stages\u2014nothing is set in stone, and my ideas could wait until tomorrow. But as an engineer, I\u2019m expected to be proactive, to shape the direction of our work, to prove my value. I glance at the clock. My son will be home soon, expecting dinner and maybe a little help with his homework. My heart aches with the tug-of-war between the demands of my job and the needs of my family. I feel the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to answer first."}
