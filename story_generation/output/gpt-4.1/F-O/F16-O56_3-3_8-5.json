The salon was nearly empty, the last rays of sunlight slanting through the window. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my spouse, waiting at home for the conversation we\u2019d been putting off for weeks. We needed to talk about our finances, about the medical bills piling up, and I\u2019d promised to be home early, to be honest and open, to finally face it together.\n\nBut in my chair sat Mrs. Carter, her voice rising as she ran her fingers through her hair. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for! I can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d Her frustration echoed through the quiet salon. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, the expectation that I would fix it, make her feel beautiful again, no matter how late it was.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My spouse needed my honesty and presence; my client needed my patience and skill. I could feel the stress building, my mind racing between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the duty I had here, unsure which demand to answer first."}
