My heart pounded. Being the eldest daughter, I knew how much this meant to her, to our family\u2014upholding tradition, showing respect, keeping our heritage alive. But as I glanced around, I saw dust gathering on the shelves, crumbs scattered under the table, and muddy footprints trailing across the floor. My supervisor at the cleaning agency had just reminded me yesterday: \u201cEvery corner spotless, every shift.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family needed me to be present, focused, honoring our customs. My job demanded thoroughness, attention to every detail, no excuses. I could hear my mother calling for me to begin, but my eyes kept darting to the mess, my hands itching for the mop. The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, torn between the daughter my family wanted and the cleaner my job required."}
