My hands were still damp from cleaning up the last station when my spouse walked in, eyes clouded with worry. I could tell something was weighing on them, and I remembered our promise to always talk things through, to never let concerns fester. But just as I opened my mouth to ask what was wrong, my client entered, hair matted and greasy from a workout, clearly expecting the full wash and condition before her cut. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my spouse needed me to listen, to be present, but my client expected my undivided attention and professional care. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urge to comfort my partner with the obligation to provide the best service to my client. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between being the supportive spouse and the attentive hairdresser, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at the same time."}
