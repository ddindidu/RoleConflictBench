The street is familiar, lined with neighbors\u2019 hedges and the scent of cut grass. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the procedural hearing scheduled for this afternoon. It\u2019s a minor matter, one that could be postponed without much trouble, but I know my client expects me to be there, to show commitment and reliability. \n\nAs we cross the intersection, I notice a group of older kids loitering near the corner, their voices loud and sharp. My brother tenses beside me, and I feel the old instinct to protect him flare up. He\u2019s counting on me to get him home safe, just like always. But the courthouse is only a short detour away, and if I leave now, I can make it in time. My client\u2019s trust, my professional reputation\u2014they\u2019re on the line. I glance at my brother, then at the time on my phone, my heart pounding as I weigh the pull of family against the demands of my career, caught in the impossible space between who I am and who I need to be."}
