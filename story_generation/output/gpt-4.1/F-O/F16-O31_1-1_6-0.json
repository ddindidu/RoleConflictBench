I nodded, half-listening, until they mentioned the late-night party next door that kept them awake. \u201cIt was so loud, I almost called the police,\u201d they said, laughing. My stomach tightened. I knew the address\u2014they\u2019d filed a noise complaint at the station earlier. As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to respond impartially and maintain order. But as a spouse, I was supposed to be open, to share my thoughts and feelings, to be present in this conversation. I wanted to tell them I\u2019d be the one responding to the complaint tonight, but I hesitated. Would they see me as the enforcer, not their partner? Would my duty to the law overshadow my role at home? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the uniform I wore and the person I was at this table, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
