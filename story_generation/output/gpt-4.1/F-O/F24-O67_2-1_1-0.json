The radio on my belt crackled softly, a constant reminder that I could be called out at any second. Just then, my stepbrother walked in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. He dropped his backpack and slouched into the chair across from me. I could tell something was wrong\u2014he barely looked at me, just stared at the table, silent. I knew I should ask him what happened, be there for him like a good sibling, especially since our parents always said we needed to support each other, no matter what. But as I opened my mouth, the radio blared: \u201cUnit 12, emergency call, respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. I looked at my stepbrother, then at the radio. I could see he needed me, but I also knew someone out there needed me too, maybe even more urgently. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just sat there, torn, unable to move."}
