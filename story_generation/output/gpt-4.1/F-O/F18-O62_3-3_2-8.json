He needed me\u2014he needed his big sister to listen, to hold him, to tell him it would be okay. I could feel his pain, and I wanted nothing more than to wrap him in a hug and let him cry. But as I reached for his hand, my eyes caught a sudden commotion in the deep end. A child, much too small to be there, was flailing, his head barely above water. My training kicked in: I was the lifeguard, responsible for every life in this pool, expected to act instantly, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. My brother\u2019s grip tightened on my arm, silently begging me not to leave him alone in this moment. My heart pounded as I stood, torn between the desperate need in my brother\u2019s eyes and the urgent danger in the water."}
