The plant was quiet, the lull in production making every clank and whir echo louder. My supervisor expected me to find the source of the glitch, even though it only happened once in a while and never when anyone else was watching. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it soon, it would look like I wasn\u2019t doing my job.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute?\u201d Lately, I\u2019d been trying to check in more, knowing Dad\u2019s health wasn\u2019t great and Mom got anxious when things felt uncertain. I knew she wanted to talk, maybe just to hear my voice and know I cared. But I was already behind, and the machine\u2019s next hiccup could be my only clue. I stared at my phone, torn between the quiet plea from home and the silent demand of the machine in front of me, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
