My phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just tired. Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I could almost hear the fatigue in his words, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d be there to listen, to offer comfort. As his wife, I wanted to be that safe place, to wrap him in understanding and warmth the moment I got home.\n\nBut right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat, and the meter ticking. As a taxi driver, I had to keep my eyes on the road, obey every sign, every rule. My passenger was in a hurry, shifting impatiently, urging me to go faster. I felt the pressure to speed up, to cut a corner, to get them there quickly. But I knew the risks\u2014one mistake, and I could lose my license, or worse.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions: the urge to rush home and be the supportive wife my husband needed, and the duty to drive safely, to be the responsible professional my job demanded. The weight of both expectations pressed on me as I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
