My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a critical alert from the subway control center. As a subway operator, I was on call for emergencies, and the message was urgent: a brake system malfunction on the train I was scheduled to operate in less than an hour. I was expected to report in immediately, assess the situation, and ensure the safety of hundreds of passengers. But right now, my brother was skipping ahead, laughing, and I knew I was supposed to keep him safe, especially with the busy intersection coming up. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to protect my brother and the duty to prevent a possible disaster underground. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen on the sidewalk, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
