The open class at my daughter\u2019s school started in thirty minutes, and she\u2019d begged me to be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time. But as I pulled up to the curb, a passenger flagged me down, suitcase in hand, desperation in his eyes. \u201cPlease, my train leaves in forty minutes. Can you get me to the station?\u201d The station was clear across town, traffic was unpredictable, and I knew it would be close. My mind raced. As a parent, I was expected to show up, to be present for my child, to prove she mattered more than anything. As a taxi driver, I was expected to provide safe, timely rides, to help people get where they needed to go, especially when it really counted. I could see my daughter\u2019s hopeful face in my mind, and the anxious passenger in my rearview mirror. Both needed me, both counted on me. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from all sides."}
