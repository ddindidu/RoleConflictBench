I reached out, asking gently, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d She smiled, but I could see the worry in her eyes. As her daughter, I felt the weight of her unspoken fears, the expectation that I would be her confidante and support. My phone buzzed suddenly\u2014dispatch reporting a violent assault downtown, bystanders in danger. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was trained to respond immediately, to protect citizens and property, to run toward danger when others ran away. But as a daughter, I saw my mother\u2019s need for comfort, her hope that I would stay just a little longer. The demands of both roles crashed over me, each urgent, each impossible to ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my badge and the love for my family, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
