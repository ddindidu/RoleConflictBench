The office is unusually quiet today, the lull in call volume a rare gift. My supervisor\u2019s email pings: \u201cFeel free to take your break whenever you need.\u201d I should feel relieved, but my mind is elsewhere. The home loan repayment looms over me like a shadow, just two months away. I promised myself I\u2019d pick up extra shifts, maybe even some overtime, to make sure we\u2019re covered. My family depends on me to keep us afloat, to keep our home safe.\n\nBut now, with the chance to step away for a moment, I hesitate. If I skip my break and keep dialing, maybe I\u2019ll land a few more sales, inching us closer to that payment. Yet, the rules are clear\u2014breaks are mandatory, and I\u2019m expected to follow them. My body aches for rest, but my mind races with numbers and deadlines. I stare at the break room door, torn between the father who must provide and the employee who must comply. My hand hovers over the \u201cpause\u201d button, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that refuse to meet."}
