He\u2019d just gotten the news\u2014his biological father, the man he\u2019d only recently reconnected with, had passed away suddenly. I could hear him sobbing, and every instinct told me to go to him, to sit by his side and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But then my radio crackled: \u201cUnit 14, we have a call\u2014possible femur fracture, Main and 5th. Respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded.
