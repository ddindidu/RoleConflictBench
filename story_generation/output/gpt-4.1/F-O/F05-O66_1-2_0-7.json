She sighed, mentioning how her boss had been nitpicking all afternoon, and I could see she needed someone to listen, maybe even just a hug. But the app showed two travelers waiting nearby, their destination across town, and the fare looked good. I glanced at the clock\u2014rush hour. If I left now, I\u2019d be gone for at least an hour. The travelers messaged, asking if I could help with their heavy suitcases and if I\u2019d be okay with them splitting the fare. I knew I should be there for my wife, offer her comfort, but as a taxi driver, I also had to be reliable and professional, especially with customers who needed extra help. My wife looked at me expectantly, her eyes tired but hopeful, while my phone buzzed again, the travelers growing impatient. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of home and the call of duty, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
