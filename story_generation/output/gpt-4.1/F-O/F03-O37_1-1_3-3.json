As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew I had to make sure everything was stocked and ready for the next shift. My supervisor expected nothing less than perfection, and I took pride in my work. But today was different. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother, reminding me that the family was gathering for our annual holiday lunch. She wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring the special dish Grandpa loved. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, full of hope and expectation.\n\nI glanced at the half-empty shelves and the list of supplies I still needed to order. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my team down, risking a reprimand. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the family tradition, the laughter, and the stories that made me feel like I belonged. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
