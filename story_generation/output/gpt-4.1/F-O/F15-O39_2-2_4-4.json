He darts away from me, weaving between carts and displays, laughing as he goes. I know I should stop him, teach him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014sets boundaries, explains right from wrong, keeps their child and others safe. But just as I reach for his arm, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my foreman: there\u2019s a spill on the walkway at the site, and I\u2019m the closest one. If it isn\u2019t cleaned up right away, someone could get hurt. I can almost hear his voice in my head, reminding me that safety is everyone\u2019s responsibility, that I need to set an example for the crew. My heart pounds as I look at my son, still running, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I know I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both expect me to act now."}
