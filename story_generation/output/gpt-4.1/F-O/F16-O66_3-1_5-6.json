The house was a mess, and she expected me to help scrub the floors, dust the shelves, and make everything spotless. I promised I\u2019d be home early to help, but as I grabbed my keys, another message popped up: the taxi company was short-staffed, and they needed me to cover an extra shift. My cab was due for a deep clean, and I couldn\u2019t risk a bad review from a passenger if it wasn\u2019t immaculate. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my spouse counting on me to share the load at home, my boss and passengers expecting me to keep my car pristine and be available. I stared at the cleaning supplies in the hallway, then at my cab keys in my hand, torn between two worlds, both demanding more than I felt I could give."}
