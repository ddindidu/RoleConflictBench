My younger brother, always impatient, was with me for a quick visit before I started my shift. As I checked my phone for messages from the nurse\u2019s station, I saw him step off the curb, eyes glued to his screen, not noticing the car speeding down the street. Instinctively, I wanted to shout, to grab his arm, to make sure he was safe\u2014just like I always had since we were kids.\n\nBut at that exact moment, my patient, Mrs. Lee, called out from her wheelchair by the door. Her voice trembled, and I could see the fear in her eyes. She\u2019d just had surgery, and she needed me to reassure her, to sit with her and ease her anxiety. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the urge to protect my brother, and the responsibility to comfort my patient. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the two people who needed me in different ways, both expecting me to be there for them."}
