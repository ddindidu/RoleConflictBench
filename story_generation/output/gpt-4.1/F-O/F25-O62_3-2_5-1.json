My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was for me to lead the family ceremony this year. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to show you\u2019re really part of us,\u201d she\u2019d said, her gaze hopeful but firm. The ceremony was starting soon, and everyone was waiting for me inside. But here, at the pool, I was the only lifeguard on duty. My supervisor\u2019s words were just as clear: \u201cNever take your eyes off the swimmers. Their safety depends on you.\u201d Suddenly, I noticed a young boy flailing near the middle of the pool, his strokes growing weaker. My heart pounded. I knew I was expected to step away and join my family, to prove I belonged. But I also knew that leaving my post, even for a moment, could put someone\u2019s life at risk. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, unable to move, caught between the pull of family and the call of duty."}
