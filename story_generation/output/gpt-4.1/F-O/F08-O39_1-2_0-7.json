My heart ached to gather her close, to share the stories and lessons I\u2019d learned over decades, to be the steady hand she needed. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the safety briefing at the site would start in two minutes, and missing it meant risking a reprimand or worse, a suspension. The expectation was clear\u2014be present, be alert, be part of the team. Yet here was my granddaughter, looking to me for guidance, expecting the wisdom only a grandmother could give. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the hard hat and the gentle hand, the urgency of the job and the timelessness of family.
