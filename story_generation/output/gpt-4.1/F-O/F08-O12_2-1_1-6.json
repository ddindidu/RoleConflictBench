The notification from QA pinged again\u2014another report about that pesky UI glitch. It wasn\u2019t critical, but I knew the team expected me to patch it quickly. I started typing, but my thoughts drifted to the living room, where my granddaughter sat curled up on the couch, her face shadowed with worry. She\u2019d barely spoken all afternoon, and I could sense something was weighing on her. As her grandmother, I felt a deep pull to set aside my work, to offer her the comfort and wisdom she might need. But the pressure from my team tugged at me just as strongly; they relied on me to keep things running smoothly. My heart ached with the urge to be present for her, to share stories and guidance from my own tangled path through life. Yet, my fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the demands of my profession and the needs of my family, caught in the silent struggle of choosing who needed me most in this moment."}
