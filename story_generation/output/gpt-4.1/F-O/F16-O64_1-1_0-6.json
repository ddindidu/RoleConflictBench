My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my partner. \u201cRough day, nothing major, just tired. Can\u2019t wait to talk later.\u201d I glance at the screen, feeling a tug in my chest. I want to send a quick, comforting reply, maybe a heart or a reassuring word, but another customer steps up, and I have to greet them with a cheerful, \u201cHi, how are you today?\u201d \n\nMy mind splits. I know my partner expects me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort they need after a long day. But right now, my job expects me to be attentive, friendly, and focused on the people in front of me. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my partner\u2019s need for support, my manager\u2019s expectation for excellent service. My fingers hover over my phone, hidden under the counter, as I force another smile for the next customer, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which one to answer first."}
