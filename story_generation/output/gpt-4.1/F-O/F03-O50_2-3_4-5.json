My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me to help set up the ancestral altar\u2014today was the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s passing, and every detail had to be perfect. My father glanced at me, his eyes full of expectation, silently urging me to honor our family\u2019s traditions. Just as I reached for the ceremonial candles, my phone buzzed urgently. It was the factory supervisor: a critical bearing was screeching, threatening to bring the entire production line to a halt. They needed me\u2014only I knew how to fix it quickly.
