My hands move automatically, but my mind is elsewhere. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s my partner. This morning, they could barely get out of bed, their voice trembling as they asked me not to leave. They need me, need my words, my arms, my presence. But here I am, forced to smile at customers, count change, and keep the line moving. My manager glances over, expecting efficiency, no mistakes. Each beep of the scanner feels like a reminder that I\u2019m not where I should be. I want to drop everything, rush home, and hold my partner, but the customers are waiting, and my job demands my full attention. My heart aches with guilt and helplessness, torn between the person I love and the responsibilities I can\u2019t abandon. The phone vibrates again. I swallow hard, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, not knowing which one I\u2019ll let down."}
