My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014another message from my brother, asking when I\u2019d be home for the big dinner. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, hoping I\u2019d help set the table and join in the laughter. But here I was, behind the register, the line of customers snaking past the candy aisle. A woman slammed her groceries on the counter, her voice sharp as she complained about a missing sale price. I forced a smile, trying to stay calm and helpful, even as my heart ached to be with my family. My manager glanced over, expecting me to keep things moving and customers happy. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family needed me, but so did my job. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
