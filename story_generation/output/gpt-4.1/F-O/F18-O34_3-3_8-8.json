My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, \u201cWe need you to coordinate with North and West, now.\u201d My hands flew over the console, relaying instructions, every second critical to the safety of hundreds in the air.

I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind, \u201cAlways keep an eye on your brother.\u201d But the radio blared again, \u201cWe\u2019re losing separation!\u201d I felt split in two, tethered by the weight of both worlds, each demanding my full attention, each with lives at stake.
