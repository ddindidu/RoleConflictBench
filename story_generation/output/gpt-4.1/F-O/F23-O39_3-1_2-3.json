My stepson had been caught bullying another kid, and the principal wanted me to come in and discuss it. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to prove I was there for the tough moments, not just the easy ones. But as I slipped the phone back into my pocket, the foreman\u2019s whistle cut through the air. It was time for the end-of-shift cleanup, and everyone was expected to pitch in. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down the crew, risking safety violations and maybe even my job. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my stepson, missing the chance to show him that his actions mattered and that I cared enough to be there. The broom felt heavy in my hands as I stood frozen, torn between the dust swirling at my feet and the weight of responsibility waiting for me at the school."}
