She wanted me to be open, to share every worry and hope, to face this together. I knew she expected nothing less than full transparency, and I wanted to give her that. But my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the plant. The old packaging machine, the one that only acted up when no one was watching, was glitching again. Production was slow, but if I didn\u2019t diagnose the issue now, it could halt everything when demand picked up. My supervisor expected me to drop everything and get to the root of the problem, no matter how elusive. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be present and vulnerable at home, and the demand to be sharp and decisive at work. My mind raced, torn between the trust my wife needed and the responsibility my job demanded. I looked at her, then at my phone, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between two lives."}
