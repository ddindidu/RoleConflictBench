It was our annual holiday lunch, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories, just like every year. But as I set down my phone, my client, Mrs. Lee, smiled at me in the salon chair. \u201cCould you just trim my fringe a little more? I know you\u2019re busy, but I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d She was one of my regulars, always kind, and I knew how much she trusted me to get her hair just right.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me. My family wanted me present, fully engaged in our tradition, not distracted or late. But Mrs. Lee deserved my full attention too; she relied on me to make her feel confident and heard. I could already imagine my mom\u2019s disappointed look if I showed up late, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s gentle smile fading if I rushed her. Torn between being the dependable sister and the attentive hairdresser, I stood there, scissors in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role to honor first."}
