The city inspector was coming in two hours, and every detail had to be perfect\u2014lives depended on it. As an architect, I knew the weight of this responsibility; one overlooked regulation could mean disaster. But the message was from my sister: \u201cCan you come? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I remembered our promise to always be there for each other, especially when things got tough. My mind raced\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d risk missing a crucial error in the plans, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. The pressure from both sides pressed in, my heart pounding as I stared at the screen, torn between the duty to protect hundreds of strangers and the bond that had always defined us as siblings."}
