My spouse and I had agreed to split the chores evenly, especially with relatives arriving this evening. The house needed to be spotless\u2014floors mopped, guest towels folded, snacks arranged just so. As I rushed through breakfast, my phone buzzed: my manager needed me to cover an extra shift at the store. I couldn\u2019t say no; we needed the money, and I was expected to follow every policy to the letter.\n\nAt the register, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the day\u2019s totals. But store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, every irregularity reported. My mind raced. If I took the time to fill out the paperwork and call the supervisor, I\u2019d be late getting home, leaving my spouse to handle everything alone. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be breaking the rules and risking my job. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, torn between being the reliable partner at home and the responsible cashier at work."}
