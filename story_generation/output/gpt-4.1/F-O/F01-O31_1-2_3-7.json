The family gathering was already in full swing, and my daughter had sent a photo of my grandkids waiting for me, their faces pressed to the window. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there early, to help set up the grill and toss a ball around. But the radio crackled, and duty called\u2014a minor traffic accident just a few blocks away. I arrived to find two drivers arguing, voices rising, each insisting the other was at fault. As a police officer, I knew I had to handle the situation with fairness, listen to both sides, and file a proper report. But every minute spent here was a minute stolen from my family, from the laughter and stories I\u2019d been looking forward to all week. I felt the weight of my badge and the tug of my grandfather\u2019s heart, both demanding my presence, both unwilling to yield. I stood between the two cars, pen in hand, torn by the impossible choice before me."}
