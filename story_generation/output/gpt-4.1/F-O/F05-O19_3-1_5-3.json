My wife had texted me twice already, reminding me that her parents would arrive in a few hours. The house still needed vacuuming, the guest room sheets had to be changed, and she was counting on me to help. I promised her I\u2019d be home early, but as I was about to leave the pharmacy, a customer approached the counter. She looked anxious, clutching a box of painkillers, and asked if it was safe for her to take with her other medications. I knew she deserved more than a rushed answer, but my mind kept drifting to the unwashed dishes and the expectation that I\u2019d be a supportive partner tonight. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibility to this patient against my promise to my wife. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the attentive pharmacist my patient needed and the reliable husband my wife expected."}
