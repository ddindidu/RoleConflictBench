My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her first impressions. I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present, especially now. My daughter had reminded me just last week how important it was to keep in touch, to be the steady presence in the family. \n\nBut the open research log on my screen pulled at me. I\u2019d just finished a batch of experiments, and the data was fresh in my mind. I prided myself on accuracy, on capturing every detail while it was still clear. The logs could technically wait, but I knew from experience that even a short delay could blur the specifics, introduce errors. \n\nI stared at the phone, then at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected warmth and attention; my profession demanded precision and discipline. I could hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice in my mind, eager and hopeful, as the cursor blinked on the empty log entry, waiting for my words."}
