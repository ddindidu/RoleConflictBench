Mom always reminded me to keep an eye on him, especially since he tended to wander off or get distracted by stray cats. Today, though, my mind kept drifting to the machines at work. I was supposed to stay late and clean the filters, but I\u2019d left early to pick up Sam. The supervisor\u2019s text still burned in my pocket: \u201cThose units are overheating. We can\u2019t afford a breakdown.\u201d\n\nSam tugged at my sleeve, pointing at a shortcut through the alley. \u201cLet\u2019s go this way! It\u2019s faster.\u201d I hesitated, remembering Mom\u2019s warning about the alley and the sharp, anxious edge in my boss\u2019s message. If I took Sam home the long way, I\u2019d be even later to the shop. But if I let him lead us through the alley, I\u2019d be risking his safety just to shave off a few minutes. My chest tightened as I tried to balance the weight of both responsibilities, feeling pulled in two directions, each demanding more than I could give."}
