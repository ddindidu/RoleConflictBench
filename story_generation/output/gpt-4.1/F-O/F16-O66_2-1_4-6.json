My partner had left a gentle reminder on the fridge: \u201cPlease do the laundry today\u2014kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I knew how important it was to keep things running smoothly at home, to share the load, to be a reliable spouse. But my phone buzzed with a message from the taxi company: \u201cRandom vehicle inspection today. Cab must be spotless.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I started the laundry now, I\u2019d barely have time to clean the cab before my shift. If I left the laundry, my family would be frustrated, and the kids might not have what they need. If I skipped cleaning the cab, I risked a warning or even suspension. My mind raced, torn between the expectations at home and the demands of my job. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each one urgent, each one important, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, laundry basket in the other, unsure which responsibility to tackle first."}
