The smell of cookies I\u2019d baked that morning still lingered on my uniform. As I patrolled Main Street, I spotted a familiar car parked in a no-parking zone\u2014my son-in-law\u2019s. He must have rushed in to pick up the cake for tonight. My radio crackled, reminding me of my duty: enforce the law, no exceptions. But my mind raced with the image of my grandkids\u2019 faces if I arrived late or, worse, if I handed their father a ticket. The badge on my chest felt heavier than ever. I knew the community expected fairness from me, and my family expected warmth and understanding. I stood there, pen in hand, torn between the grandmother who wanted to nurture and the officer sworn to uphold the rules."}
