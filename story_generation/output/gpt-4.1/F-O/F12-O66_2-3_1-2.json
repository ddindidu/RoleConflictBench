My passenger kept glancing at his watch, anxiety etched on his face\u2014he had to catch an international flight, and every red light felt like a personal failure. My phone buzzed on the dashboard. It was my husband. I knew why he was calling; he\u2019d been agonizing over a decision at work for days, and tonight he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be his anchor.
