My son, Ethan, waited near the candy aisle, swinging his backpack. Suddenly, my manager appeared, holding Ethan by the shoulder and a crumpled candy wrapper in her other hand. \u201cHe was caught taking this without paying,\u201d she said quietly, her eyes flicking between us.\n\nAs a parent, I knew I had to teach Ethan about honesty and consequences. I wanted to kneel down, look him in the eye, and talk to him about right and wrong, about trust and respect. But as the cashier, I was expected to finish the deposit without error\u2014no distractions, no delays, or I\u2019d risk a write-up or worse. The store\u2019s policy was clear: all incidents had to be reported, and the deposit had to be completed on time.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked at Ethan\u2019s guilty face and the stack of bills in my hands. I felt torn, pulled between my duty as a parent and my responsibility as an employee, both demanding my immediate attention."}
