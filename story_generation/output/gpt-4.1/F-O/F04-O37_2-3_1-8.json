It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you come? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. As her brother, I knew I should be there, especially since she\u2019d been struggling lately. But the hotel manager had just reminded us that any break in protocol\u2014removing gloves, touching our faces, or leaving our post without sanitizing\u2014could get us written up or even fired. I stared at the mop in my hands, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My sister needed me, but so did my job, and both demanded my full attention. I could feel the anxiety rising, torn between the urge to rush to her side and the responsibility to keep my job and follow every safety rule."}
