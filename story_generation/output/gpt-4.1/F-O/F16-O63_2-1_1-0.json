My partner paced in the living room, phone in hand, eyes clouded with worry. They\u2019d just gotten off a tense call with their boss, and now they hovered near me, voice trembling, \u201cCan we talk? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart twisted\u2014I wanted to drop everything, hold them, listen, reassure them that whatever they chose, I\u2019d be there.\n\nBut my screen blinked: another call coming in. The script was easy, the customers usually polite, but my supervisor expected me to answer every question smoothly, never miss a beat, never let my attention wander. I could hear my partner\u2019s breath hitch, see the hope in their eyes, and at the same time, the pressure of the job pressed down on me. I was supposed to be present, supportive, the person they could lean on. But I was also supposed to be the perfect telemarketer, attentive and unflappable. My finger hovered over the \u201caccept call\u201d button, my partner\u2019s voice soft in the background, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which role to choose."}
