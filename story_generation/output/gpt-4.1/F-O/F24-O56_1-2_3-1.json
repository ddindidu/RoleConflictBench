My stepsister nudged me, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d back her up on the movie night she wanted. I knew I should chime in, show I was part of the family, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: my next client was due in five minutes. I hurried to the salon, still thinking about the family plans, when the door chimed and a young woman stepped in, clutching her bag and scanning the room with anxious eyes. I was supposed to greet her warmly, help her relax, but my mind was split\u2014should I text my stepsister to say I\u2019d join the movie night, or focus on making this client feel welcome? My heart pounded as I stood between the reception desk and my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
