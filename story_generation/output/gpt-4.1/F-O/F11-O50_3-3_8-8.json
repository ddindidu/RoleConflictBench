I think you misunderstood what I said earlier.\u201d I knew he was upset after our argument last night, and as his sister, I wanted to clear the air, to listen and rebuild the trust between us. But just as I was about to call him, I noticed a commotion on the factory floor. Two new staff members were prepping the industrial mixer, clearly skipping the safety checklist. As the machine repairer, it was my job to step in, explain the risks, and make sure they understood the protocols before starting. My supervisor expected me to be vigilant, to prevent accidents at all costs. I felt torn\u2014my brother needed me to be present and understanding, but these workers needed my expertise and guidance right now. My heart pounded as I stood between the break room and the factory floor, phone in hand, caught between the demands of family and responsibility."}
