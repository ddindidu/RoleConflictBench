My sister\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about the news she\u2019d just received\u2014her world had been turned upside down, and she needed me. I could hear her trying to hold back tears, and every instinct in me screamed to rush to her side, to be the supportive brother she\u2019d always counted on. But as I listened, my other phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due in court in less than an hour to testify in a case I\u2019d worked for months. As a police officer, I knew how important my testimony was\u2014justice depended on it, and my absence could jeopardize the whole case. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my sister needed me now, but so did my duty. I felt torn in two, guilt and responsibility battling inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
