My sister sent a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised to help set up and be there early!\u201d I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, hoping I\u2019d finally make it on time and not be glued to my laptop. \n\nBut just as I was about to leave, an email notification popped up from one of our vendors. It was a standard payment confirmation, but protocol required a formal reply\u2014something my boss always emphasized. \u201cTimely communication is key,\u201d he\u2019d said in my last review. I knew if I didn\u2019t respond before the end of the business day, it would reflect poorly on my professionalism.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the brother they missed. My job demanded prompt, precise replies, even for routine matters. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the warmth of home and the cold necessity of work, my heart pounding as I weighed which role to disappoint."}
