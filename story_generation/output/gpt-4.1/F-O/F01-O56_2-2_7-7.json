She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her updates. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to everyone else\u2014that I respond quickly, show my support, and keep the conversation going. But just then, my next client walked in, hair damp and sticking to her forehead after a workout. She looked a little embarrassed, and I could tell she was hoping for a quick wash and some reassurance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the attentive, present grandfather, and the professional hairdresser who never lets a client feel uncomfortable. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, but my mind was still with my family, torn between the warmth of their excitement and the immediate needs of the person in my chair."}
