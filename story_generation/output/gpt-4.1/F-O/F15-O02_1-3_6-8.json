My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to buy the Nintendo for Jamie.\u201d I\u2019d promised my son weeks ago, after his good grades, that I\u2019d get him the game console he\u2019d been dreaming about. He\u2019d been counting down the days, his excitement growing with every mention. But as I stared at the numbers on my screen, my mind raced with another worry. My manager was waiting for my effort estimates for the new client project. The contract\u2014and a significant chunk of our team\u2019s revenue\u2014depended on my calculations. If I got it wrong, the project could spiral out of control, risking not just my reputation but the financial stability I worked so hard to provide for my family. I could hear Jamie in the next room, humming with anticipation, while my inbox pinged with another \u201curgent\u201d from my boss. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable parent, keep my promise, or be the dependable engineer, secure our future. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
