The workshop was a mess\u2014scraps of wood scattered, sawdust thick on the floor, tools left out from the rush to finish the day\u2019s orders. I knew the safety protocols by heart: everything in its place, no clutter, no shortcuts. But my phone buzzed again, a message from my brother: \u201cDon\u2019t be late for dinner. Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, warm and expectant, and picture my family gathered around the table, waiting for me. \n\nBut the workshop demanded my attention. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking every rule I\u2019d promised to uphold as a carpenter. One careless step tomorrow could mean a twisted ankle or worse. Yet, if I stayed to clean up, I\u2019d disappoint my family, miss the laughter and stories, and feel the sting of letting them down. My heart tugged in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest as I stood frozen between the sawdust and the promise of home."}
