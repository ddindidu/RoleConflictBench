My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cOpen class at 2 PM.\u201d My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, watching her read aloud in front of her classmates. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time.\n\nJust then, my work phone rang. The factory manager\u2019s voice was tense. \u201cOur new staff are about to start the next batch, but they\u2019re not clear on the safety steps. Can you come now? We need your guidance.\u201d I pictured the machines\u2014dangerous if mishandled\u2014and the anxious faces of the new workers. If I didn\u2019t go, someone could get hurt. If I did, I\u2019d break my promise to my daughter again.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between the door to my home and the call of my job, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
