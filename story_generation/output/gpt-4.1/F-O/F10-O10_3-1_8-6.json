Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how overwhelmed she felt caring for my dad after his surgery. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. I nodded, trying to focus, but my phone buzzed with an email notification\u2014a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol required I reply promptly and formally. My manager had emphasized the importance of timely communication, especially with this vendor. I could feel my mom\u2019s gaze, searching for comfort, while my mind raced with the right words for the email. My heart ached, torn between wanting to hold my mom\u2019s hand and the pressure to maintain my professional responsibilities. I stared at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
