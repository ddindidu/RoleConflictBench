It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. My heart skipped. I knew he\u2019d been having a tough time lately, but I hadn\u2019t realized it was serious. I wanted to call her right away, to be the steady presence my family expects, to listen and offer comfort. But I was in the middle of my shift, gloves on, mask tight, the cart of cleaning supplies beside me. The supervisor had just reminded us about the new hygiene protocols\u2014no phones, no distractions, always use protective gear. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the need to be there for my family, and the responsibility to keep this place safe and clean. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to step outside and call, and the duty to finish my work without breaking the rules."}
