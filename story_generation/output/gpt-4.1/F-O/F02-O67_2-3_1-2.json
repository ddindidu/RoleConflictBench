I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time. But just as I was about to leave for the school, the radio crackled to life\u2014dispatch reporting a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, injuries unknown, but the urgency in the operator\u2019s voice was unmistakable. My partner looked at me, waiting for my signal. I could already picture my daughter scanning the crowd, searching for my face, and the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there. At the same time, I knew that every second counted for those people on the highway, and my training screamed at me to go. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, my heart torn between the flashing lights of duty and the quiet hope of a little girl."}
