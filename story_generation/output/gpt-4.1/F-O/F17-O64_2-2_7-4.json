Dad barely touched his dinner, lost in thought. I wanted to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to be the kind of child who could help, even if it was just by listening. But my shift at the grocery store started in twenty minutes, and I had to go.\n\nAt the register, my mind kept drifting back home. Then a woman approached, holding a blender and looking desperate. \u201cI lost the receipt, but it\u2019s broken. Please, I need to return it,\u201d she pleaded. The store policy was clear: no returns without a receipt. My manager had reminded us just yesterday\u2014no exceptions. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectation to be a good employee, to follow the rules, to not let my personal feelings interfere.\n\nBut as I looked at the customer\u2019s anxious face, I thought of my parents, how sometimes people just need a little understanding. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the rules I was supposed to uphold, and the empathy I felt, both for this stranger and for my own family. I stood there, torn, unsure which part of me should speak."}
