My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. But just as I was about to close up, Mrs. Lee stormed in, her voice echoing through the nearly empty salon. She was furious about her haircut, demanding I fix it immediately. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and I knew how important it was to make things right for her\u2014my reputation depended on it. But my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My hands trembled as I tried to calm Mrs. Lee, my mind racing between the angry client in front of me and the little girl waiting for her dad at school."}
