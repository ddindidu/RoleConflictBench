My mind isn\u2019t just on the traffic\u2014though the cars weaving in and out, their taillights blurring in the downpour, demand every ounce of my attention. It\u2019s the home loan payment looming in two months that gnaws at me. I promised my wife we\u2019d never fall behind, that our kids would always have a roof over their heads. Every extra fare counts, and tonight, the streets are busy. If I push a little harder, take a few more rides, maybe I can get ahead. But the roads are treacherous, and I know the risks\u2014one wrong move, one moment of impatience, and I could end up in an accident. My duty as a father pulls me one way, desperate to provide, while my responsibility as a driver tugs the other, reminding me to keep everyone safe. My heart pounds as I approach a yellow light, torn between slowing down and speeding through, the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
