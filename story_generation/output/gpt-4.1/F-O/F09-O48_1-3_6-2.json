You promised.\u201d My heart twists. I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to it, and I want to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy. But the price tag is steep, and every dollar matters. I\u2019m working extra shifts as a nursing assistant just to keep us afloat, and I can\u2019t help but worry about rent and groceries.\n\nThe intercom buzzes, pulling me back. Room 204. Mrs. Jenkins is struggling again, her pain etched deep in her face as she tries to lift her spoon. She needs me\u2014needs patience, gentle hands, and time I barely have. My supervisor expects me to be attentive, compassionate, and efficient, but my mind is split. I want to be the mother my son needs, to give him something special, but I also have to be the caregiver my patients rely on. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I stand in the hallway, torn, not knowing which need to answer first."}
