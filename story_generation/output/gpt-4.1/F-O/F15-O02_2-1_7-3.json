As a parent, I felt the weight of every dollar\u2014groceries, rent, my daughter\u2019s school trip. The pressure to keep our family afloat pressed on my chest, making each expense feel like a personal failure. At work, my role as an engineer demanded a different kind of vigilance. A routine safety audit was scheduled months from now, and my manager expected all documentation to be flawless. There was time, but the expectation was clear: no shortcuts, no oversights. I knew I could take on extra freelance work to bring in much-needed cash, but that would mean less time to meticulously update the safety files. If I focused on the audit, I\u2019d have to turn down the side job and risk falling behind on bills. My mind spun with the impossible choice\u2014provide for my family now, or uphold the standards that kept my team and company safe. The two worlds collided, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
