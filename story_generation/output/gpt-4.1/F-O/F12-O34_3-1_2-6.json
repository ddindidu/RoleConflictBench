My headset buzzed with the usual chatter, but my mind kept drifting to the text my husband had sent just before my shift: \u201cI really need you tonight. Can you call when you get a break?\u201d He was unraveling, the weight of his father\u2019s illness pressing down on him, and I knew he needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together. But right now, I was an air traffic controller, responsible for the safe passage of hundreds of lives. An aircraft was approaching the sector boundary, and I needed to coordinate the handoff with the next controller. My supervisor expected flawless communication, no distractions. My husband expected comfort, my undivided attention.
