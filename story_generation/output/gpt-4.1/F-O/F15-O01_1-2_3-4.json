The deadline loomed, and my client expected a design that balanced privacy and collaboration, every square foot accounted for. My mind raced with measurements and sightlines when my daughter spilled her juice, the sticky liquid spreading across the table. She looked at me, wide-eyed, waiting for my reaction. I remembered my promise to teach her responsibility and kindness, to guide her through these small moments. But my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent email from my manager, asking for the revised plan within the hour. My daughter\u2019s expectant face tugged at me, needing patience and gentle correction. At the same time, the blinking cursor on my screen reminded me of my professional duty to deliver a flawless design. My heart pounded as I tried to be present in both worlds, feeling the weight of two sets of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
