My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his work shirt clean for tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform was somewhere in the mix. I knew I should start a load before it got any later. Just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a customer, her message curt: \u201cWhere is my package? It was supposed to arrive an hour ago.\u201d I checked the delivery app and saw a red alert\u2014her package was delayed, possibly misplaced at the depot. My heart pounded. I needed to respond quickly and professionally, reassure her, and start the process to locate the package. But the laundry couldn\u2019t wait either; if I didn\u2019t do it now, there\u2019d be no clean clothes for tomorrow. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the expectation to be a reliable wife and a competent delivery person pulling me in opposite directions. My hands hovered between the phone and the laundry basket, torn by the demands of two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
