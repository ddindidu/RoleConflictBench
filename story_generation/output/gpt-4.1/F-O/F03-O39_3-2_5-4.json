It was my turn to uphold our family\u2019s tradition, to honor our ancestors and show respect. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my foreman. There was a spill on the site, right in the main walkway, and I was the closest one. If I didn\u2019t clean it up immediately, someone could get hurt.
