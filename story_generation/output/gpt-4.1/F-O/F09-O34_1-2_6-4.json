The cloud tops are rising faster than forecasted, and three pilots are waiting for my revised climb instructions. My voice must be calm, precise\u2014lives depend on it. But my phone buzzes on the desk, a message from my son: \u201cDid you get the Nintendo yet? You promised.\u201d My heart twists. I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to it, how tight money has been since his father left, and how I promised I\u2019d make it happen if I picked up extra shifts. I want to keep that promise, to see his face light up, to be the mom he deserves. But right now, I\u2019m the only controller on duty, and the weather is turning. The pilots need me focused, not distracted. My son needs me to keep my word, to show him he matters. I stare at the radar, my mind pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, waiting for me to choose."}
