It was almost three, and my kids would be waiting outside their school, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, not like last week when work kept me late. But as I started to gather my things, I noticed the lane rope in the deep end\u2014frayed and sagging, a clear hazard for the swim lessons starting soon. As the only lifeguard on duty, it was my responsibility to fix it before the next group arrived. The manager always stressed the importance of safety and equipment checks, and I knew how quickly things could go wrong in the water. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my children\u2019s expectant faces, the trust of the parents at the pool, the rules, the promises. I stood there, torn, the echo of laughter from the pool mixing with the memory of my kids\u2019 disappointed eyes."}
