My phone buzzed with a new email from a client, asking for clarification on a confusing line item in their invoice. I knew I needed to respond quickly and professionally\u2014timely communication was crucial in my job as an accountant. But just as I started typing, my stepbrother slumped into the chair across from me, eyes red and hands trembling. His final exam was tomorrow, and he looked on the verge of tears. I remembered all the times we\u2019d promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the supportive sibling I\u2019d always tried to be. But the client\u2019s email blinked insistently on my screen, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be what both my brother and my client needed, feeling the weight of their expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
