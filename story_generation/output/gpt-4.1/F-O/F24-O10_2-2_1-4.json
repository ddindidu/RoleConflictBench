My stepbrother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, especially since our parents always said we needed to support each other through tough times. But the numbers on my screen glared at me, reminding me that the quarterly tax filing was due next week. As the company\u2019s accountant, I couldn\u2019t afford mistakes or delays; compliance was non-negotiable, and the pressure from my boss was mounting. My stepbrother dropped his bag and sat at the kitchen table, silent, waiting. I felt torn, my heart aching for him, but my mind racing with tax codes and deadlines. I stared at the open doorway between us, caught between the urge to close my laptop and the fear of falling behind, wrestling with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
