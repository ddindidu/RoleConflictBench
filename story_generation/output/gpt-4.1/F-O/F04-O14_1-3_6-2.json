Wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear his voice, hopeful, expecting me to show up like I promised. We\u2019d been working on building a better relationship, making time for each other, and I knew how much it meant to him that I was included in these outings. But as I glanced at the weather data streaming across my computer, my heart sank. The atmospheric conditions were perfect\u2014something I\u2019d been waiting months for. If I missed this window, I might not get another chance before the funding review, and all my work could be for nothing. My lab coat felt heavier than usual, the weight of responsibility pressing down. I wanted to be the brother he could count on, but I was also a scientist with a duty to my research and my team. The clock ticked closer to four, and I felt torn in two, caught between the pull of family and the demands of discovery, unsure which part of me should win."}
