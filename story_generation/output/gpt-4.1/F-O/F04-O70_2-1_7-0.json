My younger brother had texted me earlier, asking if we could talk tonight\u2014he\u2019d had a rough day, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for him. But now, a package needed to be delivered across town, and the customer had already messaged twice, anxious about the delay. I could still make the delivery within the day, but it would mean arriving home much later than I\u2019d told my brother. \n\nAs I sat in my car, engine idling, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My brother expected me to listen, to be patient and understanding, to show him the respect he deserved by keeping my word. But my job demanded punctuality, accuracy, and reliability\u2014qualities I prided myself on. I stared at the steering wheel, torn between the responsibility to my family and the commitment to my work, feeling the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
