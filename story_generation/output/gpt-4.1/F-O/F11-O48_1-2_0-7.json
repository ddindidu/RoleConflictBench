I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to cheer her on like she\u2019d always done for me. But as I tucked my phone away, I glanced at Mr. Harris, my patient, who was gripping his blanket, eyes wide and voice trembling. He\u2019d just come out of surgery, and the fear in his face was unmistakable. My supervisor had reminded me earlier, \u201cHe needs extra support tonight. Try not to leave him alone.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My sister expected me to be her biggest supporter, to show up and celebrate her milestone. But Mr. Harris needed me too, someone to sit with him, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone in his fear. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the family I loved and the patient who depended on me. I could feel the clock ticking, each second tightening the knot in my chest as I wrestled with what to do next."}
