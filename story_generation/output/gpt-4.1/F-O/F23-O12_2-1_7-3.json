Attendance is optional, but I know how these things go\u2014those who show up get their ideas heard, and it\u2019s a chance to collaborate with teams I rarely interact with. It\u2019s the kind of visibility that could lead to bigger projects, maybe even a raise down the line. But then I glance at the grocery list my partner left on the fridge, and the numbers in our bank account echo in my mind. As a step-parent, I promised to help keep this family afloat, to make sure there\u2019s enough for rent, food, and the kids\u2019 school supplies. If I skip the session and pick up a freelance gig instead, I can cover this month\u2019s bills. But if I don\u2019t go, will I be seen as less committed at work? My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014be present for my team, or be the provider my family needs. I can\u2019t seem to find a way to be both."}
