My daughter\u2019s voice had trembled as she explained the situation\u2014my grandson was in the hospital, and she needed me there, not just as a helping hand, but as the steady presence only a grandmother could provide. I could almost feel his small hand in mine, the comfort I could offer just by being there. But the project team was waiting for my input, too. We were still in the early stages, brainstorming solutions, but my colleagues expected me to guide the discussion, to propose alternatives that could shape the direction of the entire project. I could hear the ping of new emails, the subtle pressure to stay engaged, to be the reliable engineer they counted on. My heart pulled me toward my family, but my mind reminded me of my professional responsibilities. I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent need at home and the expectations at work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
