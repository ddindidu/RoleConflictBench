He sounded nervous, asking for some basic operating tips for the machine I\u2019d just serviced. I could hear the uncertainty in his voice, and I knew how important it was to make sure he felt confident\u2014my reputation depended on it. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized I was already late for the family video call. My daughter had reminded me twice this week: \u201cDad, it\u2019s important for the kids to see you before the holiday. They miss you.\u201d I could picture my grandchildren waiting, their faces lighting up when I joined. The client\u2019s questions kept coming, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the reliable expert, but I also wanted to be the present grandfather. My heart tugged in two directions, and for a moment, I just sat there, phone in hand, caught between the expectations of those who needed me."}
