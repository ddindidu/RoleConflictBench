It means a lot to your father.\u201d My heart tightened. This ceremony was more than a ritual\u2014it was a thread tying generations together, and my parents expected me to honor it, to show I valued our roots. But my laptop chimed with a reminder: \u201cQuarterly roadmap meeting in 30 minutes.\u201d My manager had been clear\u2014my estimates would shape the entire project timeline. The team was counting on me to be precise, to show leadership and technical insight. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of family pride on one side and professional responsibility on the other.
