The buildup is worse than I expected, and I know I\u2019ll need extra time to wash and condition before I can even think about cutting. My client expects to leave looking fresh and styled, and I pride myself on never rushing through a job. But my phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014a message from my son, reminding me about the Nintendo I promised him. He\u2019s been saving up, counting the days, and I told him we\u2019d go buy it together after my shift. I need to keep that promise, not just for his happiness, but because I want him to know I\u2019m there for him. At the same time, I can\u2019t afford to lose clients or cut corners; every tip matters for our bills. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014be the reliable mother, be the professional hairdresser. Both roles tug at me, and I feel the pressure mounting as I rinse the suds from my client\u2019s hair, wondering how I can possibly meet everyone\u2019s needs."}
