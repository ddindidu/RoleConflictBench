My phone buzzed, and I saw a message from my mom: \u201cCan you call? I need to talk.\u201d I hesitated, but dialed her number, balancing the phone between my ear and shoulder as I counted gauze pads. Her voice trembled as she confided in me about her recent health scare, her fears spilling out in a way that made her sound so small and vulnerable. I could hear the expectation in her voice\u2014she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the strong one for once. But as she spoke, my mind kept drifting back to the checklist in front of me. If I missed something, a patient could suffer. If I rushed my mom, she\u2019d feel abandoned. My hands shook as I tried to focus on both worlds, feeling the weight of being a good child and a responsible ambulance driver pulling me in opposite directions."}
