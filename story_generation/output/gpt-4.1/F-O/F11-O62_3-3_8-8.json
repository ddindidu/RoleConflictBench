My heart jumped. As his sister, I knew he hated being called out in front of others, and we\u2019d just talked last night about trusting each other more, about not embarrassing him in front of his friends. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t ignore the rules. The deep end was off-limits for kids his age, and he was clearly struggling. I could already hear the supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that safety always comes first. But Max\u2019s eyes met mine, wide and pleading, silently begging me not to make a scene. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my duty to keep everyone safe, and my promise to treat my brother with respect and understanding. My hand hovered over my whistle, torn between blowing it and rushing to his side quietly, unsure which role I should let guide me."}
