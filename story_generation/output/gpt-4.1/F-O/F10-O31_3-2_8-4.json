I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. I hesitated, but answered, keeping my eyes on the scene. Her voice trembled, telling me Dad had broken down, finally admitting how lost he felt since losing his job. She needed me, her daughter, to listen, to reassure her that we\u2019d get through this together. But behind me, a tow truck arrived, and a crowd was gathering, anxious and confused. As a police officer, I was expected to keep everyone safe, to manage the chaos and prevent another accident. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the daughter who dropped everything to comfort her parents, but I was also the officer everyone here depended on. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood in the rain, torn between the call in my ear and the crisis before my eyes, not knowing which duty to answer first."}
