My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to respond. We needed to talk about our finances\u2014he wanted to know if we could afford to help his parents with their medical bills. He expected me to be honest, to lay everything out so we could make a decision together. But my phone kept buzzing with reminders about the upcoming audit at work.

The audit was still weeks away, but I knew from experience that any oversight could mean serious consequences for the team. My husband\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, gentle but insistent.
