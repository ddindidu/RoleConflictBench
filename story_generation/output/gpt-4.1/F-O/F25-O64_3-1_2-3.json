I knew it was my stepmom\u2014she always wanted to know how my day was going, what I\u2019d eaten, if I was feeling okay. Ever since Dad remarried, she\u2019d made it clear that daily check-ins were important, and I tried to keep up, sending her updates and answering her questions as soon as I could. But right now, I was at the register, and the line was growing. I glanced at the screen and noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would change the total sales, but still, store policy said I had to report it immediately. My manager was watching from the office window, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be caught on my phone or ignoring a possible error. My stepmom\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more insistent, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I stood there, hands hovering over the register, torn between the rules of my job and the expectations at home, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
