As her brother, I wanted to be there, cheering her on, making her feel as proud as I did. But at the salon, my last client before the party was running late. When she finally arrived, she explained she\u2019d just washed her hair at home, and it was still damp and clean. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before a cut, no exceptions. My boss is strict about this policy, and skipping a step could get me in trouble. I could feel the minutes slipping away, the celebration at home starting without me, my sister waiting for her big brother. I stood there, torn between following the salon\u2019s rules and rushing through the appointment, or bending them just this once so I could make it home in time. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind racing with the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
