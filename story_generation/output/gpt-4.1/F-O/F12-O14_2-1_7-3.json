The urge to reach out, to ask what was wrong, pressed at me. We\u2019d always promised to share our worries, to talk things through before they grew into something bigger. But my mind kept drifting to the lab, to the stack of data waiting for me. I was supposed to update the research logs tonight, and while the schedule was flexible, I knew how easy it was to forget details if I waited too long. The accuracy of my notes mattered\u2014not just for me, but for the integrity of the whole project. I glanced at my husband again, torn. He needed me to listen, to be present, but the scientist in me whispered that I couldn\u2019t let the data slip from my mind. My heart thudded with the weight of both expectations, each pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, caught between the person I loved and the work I was devoted to."}
