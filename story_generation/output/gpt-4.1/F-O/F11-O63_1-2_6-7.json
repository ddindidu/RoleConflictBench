My break was scheduled for 2:15, and I knew management would check the logs. The phone queue was relentless, calls stacking up, supervisors pacing behind glass walls. I needed this job, and sticking to my break time was non-negotiable. Just as I was about to log out, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my sister: \u201cHey, we\u2019re all heading to the park now. Come with us! It\u2019s been ages since we hung out.\u201d I could almost hear her hopeful voice, the unspoken plea for me to be part of the family again, to show I cared enough to make time. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who showed up, who built trust by being present. But the clock was ticking, and every minute away from my desk would be scrutinized. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection against my employer\u2019s demand for discipline. I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
