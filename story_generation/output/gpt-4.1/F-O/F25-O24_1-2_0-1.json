The clock reads 8:47 p.m. My mind is deep in the details\u2014precedents, arguments, the subtle nuances that could tip the case either way. My phone buzzes, lighting up with a message from my stepmother: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this weekend. Hope you\u2019re okay. Love, Mom.\u201d I pause, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I know she worries, especially since Dad passed. She expects me to check in, to be present, even if it\u2019s just a quick text. But the weight of the case presses on me; I can\u2019t afford distractions. The parties are counting on me to be thorough, impartial, prepared. I stare at the phone, torn. If I reply, I risk breaking my concentration, losing precious time. If I don\u2019t, I know she\u2019ll worry, maybe even feel hurt. The expectations of being a good step-child and a diligent judge pull me in opposite directions, and for a moment, I just sit there, paralyzed, unable to choose."}
