Today was the day of our family\u2019s annual ancestor offering\u2014a tradition I\u2019d never missed. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my father: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring the incense.\u201d But at that moment, the foreman\u2019s shout cut through my thoughts. The crane was lowering a massive steel beam, and I was needed to help guide it into place. The whole crew was counting on me; if I didn\u2019t act fast, the beam could swing dangerously or delay the entire project. My hands trembled, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the urgent demands of my job. I could almost smell the incense and hear my relatives gathering, but the clang of metal and the foreman\u2019s urgent call pulled me back. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
