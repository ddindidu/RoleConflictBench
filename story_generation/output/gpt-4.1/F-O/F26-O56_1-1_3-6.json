The family gathering was circled in red on my calendar\u2014a promise to my daughter and grandkids that I\u2019d be there, laughing and sharing stories, just like I always said I would. But here I was, scissors in hand, facing Mrs. Lee in my salon chair. She smiled, her hair still damp and fragrant from her own shampoo at home. \u201cI washed it just before coming,\u201d she said, hopeful I\u2019d skip the usual wash and get straight to the cut.\n\nSalon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned by me before I start. It\u2019s about hygiene, consistency, and the experience clients expect. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair was spotless, and skipping the wash would save precious minutes\u2014minutes I could use to make it to my family on time. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the reliable grandparent, the professional hairdresser. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides, each demanding my loyalty, each unwilling to yield. My hands hovered over the sink, my heart caught between duty and love, unsure which role to honor first."}
