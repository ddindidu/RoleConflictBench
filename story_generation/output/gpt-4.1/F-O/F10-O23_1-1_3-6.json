As the eldest daughter, I was expected to join in the family traditions\u2014sharing stories, being open, and honoring the trust that binds us. Tonight, the conversation drifted to my work as a lawyer, and my uncle, with a knowing smile, asked about a high-profile case I was handling. \u201cCome on, just a little hint,\u201d he teased, nudging me as everyone leaned in, expecting me to share, as was our custom during these gatherings.\n\nBut the weight of my other role pressed down on me. As a lawyer, I was bound by strict confidentiality; revealing even the smallest detail would betray my client\u2019s trust and violate my professional ethics. My family\u2019s warmth and curiosity clashed with the cold, unyielding rules of my profession. I felt my cheeks flush, torn between the desire to honor my family\u2019s expectations and the duty to uphold my oath as a lawyer. The room grew quiet, all eyes on me, waiting for my response. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
