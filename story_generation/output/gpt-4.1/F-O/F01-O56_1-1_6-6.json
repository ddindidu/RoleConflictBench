My daughter called this morning, reminding me that everyone expects me to be there, to share stories and laughter, to keep our tradition alive. I promised I\u2019d make time, even though the salon is busier than ever. Today, a client sat in my chair, her hair already clean and fragrant. She smiled, \u201cI just washed it before coming.\u201d But the salon\u2019s policy is strict\u2014every client must have their hair washed and conditioned here, no exceptions. My manager expects me to follow the rules, to maintain the salon\u2019s standards. I could skip the wash, save time, and maybe leave early to call my grandson before dinner. But if I do, I risk my reputation and my job. My heart aches, torn between the warmth of my family and the demands of my profession. I stand behind the chair, hands trembling, wrestling with what to do next."}
