My shift as a cashier was supposed to end at three, just in time to pick up my kids from school. Today was special\u2014they had begged me to be there early for the end-of-year class party. I promised I wouldn\u2019t be late. But just as I was about to close my register, a woman hurried over, clutching a blender and no receipt. She pleaded for a return, her voice tight with frustration. Store policy was clear: no receipt, no return. My manager had drilled it into us\u2014no exceptions. I could see the line growing behind her, and I felt the weight of my uniform pressing down on me. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014probably a reminder from the school. I glanced at the clock again. If I followed the rules, I\u2019d be late for my kids. If I bent them, I\u2019d risk my job. My mind raced, torn between the mother my children needed and the employee my boss expected."}
