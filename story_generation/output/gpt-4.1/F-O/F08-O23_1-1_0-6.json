As a grandmother, I wanted to share everything I\u2019d learned, to guide her with stories from my own life. But my mind flashed back to earlier that day, at a networking event, when a colleague had pressed me for details about a client\u2019s case. I\u2019d smiled politely, feeling the familiar tug of professional duty\u2014confidentiality was non-negotiable, even in casual conversation. Now, as my granddaughter waited for my answer, I felt the tension between my roles. I wanted to be open and wise, but I also knew the importance of discretion, of not revealing too much, even in the name of teaching. My heart ached as I searched for words, caught between the urge to nurture and the obligation to protect."}
