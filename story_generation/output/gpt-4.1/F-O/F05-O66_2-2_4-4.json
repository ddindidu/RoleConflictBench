My last passenger just left, and I know the laundry at home is piling up. My wife texted earlier, reminding me that the kids need clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d help tonight, but the rain has made traffic a mess, and every car around me seems to be darting from lane to lane. I grip the wheel tighter, trying to keep a safe distance, my eyes flicking between the road and the time. If I rush, maybe I can squeeze in one more fare before heading home, but that means I\u2019ll be late and the laundry might not get done. If I hurry, I risk making a mistake on these slick roads, but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll let my family down. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time. My mind races, torn between the responsibility of a careful driver and the promise I made as a husband."}
