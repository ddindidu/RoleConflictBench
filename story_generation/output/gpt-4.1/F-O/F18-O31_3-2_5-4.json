My younger sister tugged at my sleeve, her eyes bright with excitement, reminding me that I promised to help decorate the tree. My parents had been looking forward to this evening for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to them for all of us to be together. Just as I reached for the box of ornaments, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch was calling. There\u2019d been a major traffic accident on the highway, and all available officers were needed to assist. My training kicked in; I knew how crucial it was to respond quickly, to protect lives and keep order. But as I looked at my family, laughter echoing through the living room, a knot formed in my stomach. I felt torn between the badge on my chest and the people who\u2019d always been there for me. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which path to take."}
