As a judge, I was expected to draft a standard scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. The court relied on my clarity and precision; any delay could disrupt the entire docket. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother, reminding me that I was to lead the family\u2019s annual remembrance ceremony this weekend\u2014a role passed down for generations. My family expected me to honor our traditions, to speak the prayers and guide the rituals as my father once did. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my mind, gentle but firm, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn now. We\u2019re counting on you.\u201d The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the solemn duty to my family\u2019s legacy and the professional obligation to the law. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank document, torn between the expectations of my family and the demands of my courtroom."}
