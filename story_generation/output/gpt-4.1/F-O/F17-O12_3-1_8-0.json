The code in front of me was a mess\u2014spaghetti logic, tangled and inefficient. With the deadline weeks away, I knew I could take my time, refactor, and make it something I\u2019d be proud to hand off. But just as I started mapping out a cleaner structure, my phone buzzed. It was Mom. Her voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s recent health scare, her fears spilling out in a way she rarely allowed. She needed me\u2014not just to listen, but to reassure, to be the steady presence she\u2019d always been for me. My mind split: part of me wanted to close the laptop and give her my full attention, to be the child she needed right now. The other part nagged at the code, the urge to perfect it, to meet my own standards as a developer. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
