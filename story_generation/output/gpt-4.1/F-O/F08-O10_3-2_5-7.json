It\u2019s about Jamie. He\u2019s really upset, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I knew my family needed me\u2014Jamie needed me. But as an accountant, I had a responsibility to respond to my client\u2019s urgent inquiry. The client was waiting for clarification, and I could already imagine the frustration in their voice if I delayed any longer.

The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move in either direction without letting someone down."}
