Today was the open class at my stepdaughter\u2019s school, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I promised her I would. But as the hour approached, I noticed a group of kids edging into the shallow end, giggling and splashing, no adult in sight. My supervisor had drilled it into us: never leave the pool unsupervised, not even for a minute. The parents at the school expected me to show up, to be present, to prove I cared. The parents at the pool expected me to keep their children safe, to be vigilant, to never let my guard down. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cOpen class starts in 15 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded as I watched the swimmers, torn between the promise I made to my stepdaughter and the duty I owed to every child in the water."}
