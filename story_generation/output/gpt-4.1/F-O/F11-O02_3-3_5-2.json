Mom\u2019s so excited.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, full of hope that I\u2019d finally join in without my usual excuses. My family had been planning this holiday for months, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially after all the times I\u2019d missed out before. But as I glanced at my laptop, the reality of my other world pressed in. My team\u2019s chat was blowing up with questions about the core module I was responsible for. The project deadline loomed, and everyone was waiting on me to finish the design so the build could move forward. I could feel the weight of their expectations, the trust they\u2019d placed in my skills. My heart pounded as I tried to imagine letting either side down. I wanted to be the dependable sister, the reliable engineer. But right now, it felt impossible to be both."}
