She looked at me, her eyes searching, and asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do I know if I\u2019m making the right choices as I start high school?\u201d I could see the uncertainty in her face, and I wanted nothing more than to offer her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to reassure her that she\u2019d find her way. Just as I opened my mouth to answer, my police radio crackled to life. There was a report of a violent assault just a few blocks away\u2014bystanders were in danger, and backup was needed immediately. My heart pounded. My granddaughter\u2019s question hung in the air, her need for guidance clear, but my duty as an officer demanded I respond without delay. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each expecting something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
