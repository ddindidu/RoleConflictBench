Lately, they\u2019d seemed so worn out\u2014dark circles under their eyes, voices quieter at dinner. I knew they needed me, needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But right now, my job demanded every ounce of my attention. A sudden splash caught my eye\u2014a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool. My heart pounded. I had to be ready, alert, focused. Yet, guilt gnawed at me for not being there for my parents, for not texting them back or sitting with them last night. I felt torn in two, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. I gripped the armrest, torn between the urge to check my phone for a message from home and the duty to keep every swimmer safe. The pressure built inside me, a silent battle between being the daughter my parents needed and the lifeguard these swimmers depended on."}
