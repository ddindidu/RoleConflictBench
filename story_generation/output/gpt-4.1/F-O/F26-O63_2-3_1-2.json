My script was open in front of me, the company\u2019s expectations clear: stay calm, answer every objection, don\u2019t lose the sale. But as I tried to explain the offer, my eyes drifted to the living room, where my granddaughter sat curled on the couch, her shoulders hunched, her face hidden behind a curtain of hair. She\u2019d barely spoken all morning, and I knew something was weighing on her. The urge to put down the headset and go to her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed, tugged at me.

My heart ached with the pull between the world of quotas and scripts, and the quiet, urgent need of the child I loved."}
