Two months left, and I can\u2019t afford to slip up now. My family depends on me to keep the roof over our heads, and every shift I take as a subway operator is a step toward that security. But right now, I\u2019m standing in the operator\u2019s cabin, checklist in hand, and the clock is ticking. The pre-departure check of the train\u2019s non-critical systems is due, and I know the rules: every item must be inspected before departure, no shortcuts. The passengers trust me to get them to their destinations safely and on time.\n\nBut my supervisor just called\u2014there\u2019s an opportunity for overtime on another line, but only if I can finish this check quickly and sign off. If I rush, I might miss something minor, but if I\u2019m too thorough, I\u2019ll lose the overtime and the extra money we desperately need. My hands tremble as I weigh the expectations: my family\u2019s financial stability against the safety and punctuality of hundreds of strangers. The pressure builds in my chest, and I stare at the checklist, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
