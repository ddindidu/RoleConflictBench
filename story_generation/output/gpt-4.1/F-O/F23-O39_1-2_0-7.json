My hard hat feels heavier than usual as I stand with the crew, the foreman\u2019s voice already echoing across the site. But my mind isn\u2019t here. My stepkids\u2019 school is just a few blocks away, and today is the last day before summer break. I promised I\u2019d be there to pick them up, to show them I care, that I\u2019m trying to be the parent they need. \n\nBut the site rules are strict\u2014miss the briefing, and I risk a write-up or worse. The team counts on me, and I can\u2019t just disappear. Yet, if I\u2019m late for the kids, I\u2019ll see the disappointment in their eyes, that silent question of whether they really matter to me. My phone buzzes again: a reminder from their mom, a photo of the kids waiting by the school gate. My heart pounds as I stand rooted between two worlds, each demanding more than I can give."}
