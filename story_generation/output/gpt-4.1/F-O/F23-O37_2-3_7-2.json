As a step-parent, I know the family depends on me. The bills are piling up, groceries are running low, and my partner\u2019s worried glances remind me that I need to bring in more money. That\u2019s why I took on extra shifts as a housekeeping cleaner. Today, my supervisor texts me: \u201cDeep clean every room\u2014no shortcuts. We have a new client, and they expect perfection.\u201d I glance at the clock, calculating how long it will take to scrub every corner, sanitize every surface. If I do it right, maybe I\u2019ll get more hours, more pay. But as I gather my supplies, my phone buzzes again\u2014my partner asking if I\u2019ll be home in time to help with dinner, to talk to the kids about their schoolwork. My chest tightens. I want to be there for them, to make sure we have enough, but I also want to do my job well. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I stand in the hallway, mop in hand, torn between the demands of two worlds."}
