My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cDad, can you come over tonight? Lily wants to tell everyone her big news.\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s excited face, the way she always looked for me in the crowd. Family time was precious, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014and to me.\n\nBut then my work phone rang. Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice was urgent, \u201cThe deck is worse than we thought. It\u2019s not safe, and we have guests coming tomorrow. Can you fix it tonight?\u201d As a carpenter, I took pride in my reliability. People counted on me to keep their homes safe and functional. I could hear the stress in her voice, and I knew how important this was for her.\n\nI stared at my tools, then at the family photo on the wall. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and warmth of my family, and the responsibility I felt to my work and my clients. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined who I was."}
