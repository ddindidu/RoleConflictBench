Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014almost three. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents in over a week, and I know they expect me to check in, even if it\u2019s just a quick call. I start typing a reply, but my work phone vibrates. An email from a vendor pops up: a payment confirmation, routine but requiring a formal acknowledgment. My manager always stresses the importance of prompt, professional communication, even on weekends. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my parents want to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, while my job demands immediate attention to keep things running smoothly. I stare at both screens, my fingers hovering, torn between sending a warm message home or drafting a polished reply to the vendor. The weight of both expectations presses down, and for a moment, I just sit there, caught between being a good son and a responsible accountant."}
