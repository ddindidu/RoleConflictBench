It was Sunday evening\u2014my usual time to call Mom and Dad. They waited for my updates, always eager to hear about my week, and I knew how much those conversations meant to them. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s gentle reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call us, even if you\u2019re busy.\u201d My phone buzzed in my pocket, their number lighting up the screen. At that exact moment, the radio crackled: \u201cUnit 14, respond to a possible broken leg, 5th and Main.\u201d The address was a few miles away, and traffic was already building up. I felt the weight of the uniform on my shoulders, the city\u2019s expectation that I\u2019d get there fast, that someone was counting on me. My parents\u2019 call kept ringing, a reminder of my promise to them. My hand hovered between the phone and the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the urgency of my job."}
