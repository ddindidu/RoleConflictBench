If I left now, I could just make it. But then my wife called, her voice tense. \u201cYou need to come to the store. Our son was caught stealing snacks.\u201d My heart dropped. As a father, I knew I had to be there, to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But as a delivery person, I had a promise to keep\u2014a customer depending on me, a job that expected reliability and punctuality. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own set of expectations.
