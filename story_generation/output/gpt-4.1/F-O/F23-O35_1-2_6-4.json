He\u2019s been talking about it all week.\u201d I feel the weight of that promise, the hope in Jamie\u2019s eyes when he asked, the way he\u2019s started to trust me, little by little. I want to keep that trust, to show him I\u2019m reliable, that I can provide for him, even if money\u2019s tight. But just as I\u2019m about to head out, my radio crackles\u2014there\u2019s a report of an unattended bag in car three. Protocol is clear: I need to investigate immediately, ensure everyone\u2019s safe, and possibly delay the train. My supervisor\u2019s voice is stern, reminding me of my duty to the passengers. My heart pounds. If I handle this, I\u2019ll miss the store\u2019s closing and break my promise to Jamie. If I leave, I risk passenger safety and my job. I stand frozen, torn between the child waiting for me at home and the hundreds of strangers depending on me now, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
