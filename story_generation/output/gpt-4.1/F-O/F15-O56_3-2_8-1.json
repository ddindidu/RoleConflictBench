My stomach tightens. I need every shift I can get, every tip, every satisfied client to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. As I\u2019m folding towels behind the counter, the bell above the salon door jingles. A young woman steps in, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I know that look\u2014she\u2019s new, probably anxious about her first visit. I\u2019m supposed to greet her warmly, put her at ease, make her feel like she belongs here. That\u2019s what keeps clients coming back, what keeps my chair full and my paycheck steady. But my mind is racing with numbers, with the mortgage, with the groceries I still need to buy for the kids. I feel the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing down on me, but I also see the expectation in her hesitant smile. I take a breath, caught between the urge to retreat and the need to perform, my heart pounding as I step forward, unsure which role will win out in this moment."}
