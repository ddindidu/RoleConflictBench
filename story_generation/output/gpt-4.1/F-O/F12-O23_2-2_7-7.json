My husband glanced at me, concern etched on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet lately. Is everything okay at work?\u201d he asked gently. I wanted to tell him\u2014he always encouraged open communication, and I knew he expected me to share my worries. But the truth was, today at the firm, an assistant had asked for access to confidential client files, insisting it would make things easier for everyone. As a lawyer, I was bound by strict ethical standards; client confidentiality was non-negotiable. Yet, the assistant\u2019s persistence and my own fatigue made me question if I was being too rigid. Now, sitting across from my husband, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. He wanted honesty, but I couldn\u2019t reveal the details. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, but I also had to be the principled lawyer my clients trusted. My heart pounded as I searched for words, torn between the expectations of the woman he married and the professional I had to be."}
