The next available slot was the same weekend as our family\u2019s annual holiday trip\u2014a tradition my sister always insisted I join, no matter how busy I was. Mom had already texted twice, reminding me to pack warm clothes and promising my favorite pie. I could almost hear my brother\u2019s teasing if I bailed again. \n\nBut the experiment was important, too. Months of planning had led to this, and my advisor expected me to be there, hands-on, collecting data. The lab was counting on me to keep things moving. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth and laughter of my family, the quiet hum of the lab and the thrill of discovery. I wanted to be the reliable brother, the dedicated scientist. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both, not this weekend. I scrolled through the messages, torn, knowing I had to choose but wishing I didn\u2019t have to."}
