She tried to hide it, but I could tell something was wrong. As her older brother, I knew I should sit with her, listen, and help her through whatever had happened at school. She needed me\u2014she always counted on me to be there when things got tough. But my phone buzzed insistently. A passenger had booked a ride through the app, and the message was clear: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late for an important meeting.\u201d As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt and professional, never keeping a customer waiting. I glanced at my sister, then at my phone, feeling the pressure from both sides. My heart ached with the urge to comfort her, but my mind raced with the responsibility of my job. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between being the brother she needed and the driver my passenger expected."}
