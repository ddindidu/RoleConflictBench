It was my younger brother, his name lighting up my screen with a sense of urgency. \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk,\u201d his message read. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there when he needed me. But the seminar was starting in an hour, and missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates that would affect my work as an accountant. My manager had stressed how important it was for us to stay ahead of regulatory changes, and I didn\u2019t want to let my team down. Yet, the thought of my brother sitting alone, waiting for me to show up, made my chest tighten. I stared at my calendar, torn between the duty I felt to my family and the responsibility I owed to my profession, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
