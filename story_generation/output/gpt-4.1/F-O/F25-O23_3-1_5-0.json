Your father would be proud.\u201d The family expected me to step up, to honor the traditions that had always felt just a little foreign to me, but which I knew mattered deeply to them. My laptop chimed\u2014a client\u2019s email. The contract wasn\u2019t urgent, but as a lawyer, I prided myself on thoroughness and promptness. I opened the document, scanning the clauses, but my mind kept drifting back to the ceremony. If I took on the family role, I\u2019d need to spend hours preparing, learning the rituals, making sure I didn\u2019t let anyone down. But if I focused on my work, I could ensure my client\u2019s interests were protected, maintain my reputation, and keep my professional promises. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my time, my attention, my loyalty. I stared at the flickering cursor, torn between the family that wanted me to belong and the career that defined who I was."}
