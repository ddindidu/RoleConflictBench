It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you come home? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d had a rough day at school, and I could hear the strain in her voice when I called. As her older sibling, I knew she counted on me to be there, especially when things got tough. But as I glanced at the delivery schedule, my heart sank. The next stop was a hospital, and the package in my hands was marked urgent\u2014medical supplies that had to be delivered on time for patient care. My supervisor had stressed the importance of punctuality, and I knew any delay could have serious consequences. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn between the responsibility to my sister, who needed my emotional support, and my duty as a delivery person, where lives might depend on my reliability. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
