My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014her gentle reminder this morning that we both promised to share the chores, that she\u2019s been working late all week. I promised I\u2019d handle it tonight. But as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my clerk: the attorney in tomorrow\u2019s case has cited a brand-new appellate decision, one that could shift the entire argument. I know I need to read it, analyze it, and be ready to question both sides. The weight of my robe feels heavier than usual, even though I\u2019m still in jeans and a T-shirt. I glance at the laundry, then at my laptop. My mind races\u2014if I ignore the case, I risk being unprepared in court. If I ignore the laundry, I let down my wife and our fragile balance at home. My hands hover, uncertain, as the clock ticks on."}
