As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear, detailed scheduling order for a new case by the end of the week. The legal language had to be precise, the deadlines fair, and the instructions unambiguous. But my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a step-parent, I was responsible for ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability, and the numbers just weren\u2019t adding up. I needed to review our budget, maybe pick up extra work, or cut back on expenses\u2014anything to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me: the court\u2019s demand for my undivided attention and the family\u2019s silent expectation that I would keep us afloat. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the legal order I had to write and the financial plan I desperately needed to make. The weight of both roles settled heavily on my shoulders, and I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations."}
