My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my daughter. She rarely called during work hours, but today was different. My son-in-law was in the hospital, and my daughter needed me to talk to my grandson, to reassure him, to be the steady presence I\u2019d always promised I would be. At the same time, my inbox filled with urgent emails from the project team. The prototype deadline loomed, and the stakeholders were growing impatient. They needed my expertise, my focus, my solutions\u2014now. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectation to be the reliable engineer and the loving grandparent. My heart ached for my family, but my mind raced with technical challenges. I stared at the phone, then at my laptop, torn between the people who needed me most and the work that defined me."}
