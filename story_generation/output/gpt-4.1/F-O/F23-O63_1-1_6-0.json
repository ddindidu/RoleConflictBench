As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to handle every objection with a smile, to keep my voice calm and persuasive, even when the questions are repetitive and the script is all I have to lean on. Today, the calls are easy\u2014most customers are polite, their questions simple, the answers already highlighted in yellow on my script. But my mind keeps drifting to home, to the promise I made to my stepson last week. He\u2019s been counting down the days until I buy him that Nintendo, his eyes lighting up every time he mentions it. I want to keep that promise, to be the reliable step-parent he deserves, but the commission from these calls barely covers rent, let alone a new game console. My supervisor expects unwavering focus, but my heart aches with the weight of my stepson\u2019s hope. The phone rings again, and I force a cheerful greeting, my voice steady even as my thoughts spiral. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that no matter what I do, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
