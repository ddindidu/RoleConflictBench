I wanted to give her my full attention, to listen and guide her gently, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was the hospital\u2014one of my patients, a woman with a rare autoimmune disease, needed an urgent adjustment to her treatment plan. The nurse\u2019s message was clear: my expertise was needed now, and any delay could risk her health. My heart pulled in two directions. My granddaughter needed my presence and reassurance, but my patient depended on my medical judgment and swift action. I could feel the tension rising, the impossible demand to be wholly present in both roles at once. I looked at my granddaughter, then at my phone, torn between the wisdom I owed her and the care I owed my patient, unsure which call to answer first."}
