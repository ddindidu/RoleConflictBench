The court expected my scheduling order by Friday, and I knew every word had to be precise\u2014no room for ambiguity. Yet, my phone buzzed again. It was my younger brother, Sam. We\u2019d argued last night, voices raised over a misunderstanding that had festered for weeks. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew I owed him that. As his brother, I should listen, communicate openly, and rebuild the trust between us. But as a judge, I was expected to set aside personal matters and focus on the clarity and detail of my legal work. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting the order and calling Sam. The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
