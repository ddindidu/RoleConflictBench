It was my husband, his voice tight with worry. He\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant longer hours and more stress. He needed me\u2014my advice, my comfort. I could hear the hope in his voice, waiting for me to say something reassuring, to help him sort through his tangled thoughts. But as I listened, I glanced at the clock. I was already behind schedule. The living room still needed dusting, the bathrooms had to be sanitized, and my supervisor had made it clear: every corner must sparkle today, or I\u2019d risk losing this job. My mind raced between the mop in my hand and the man on the phone. I wanted to drop everything and be the supportive wife he needed, but the weight of my cleaning duties pressed down on me. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, unsure how to be everything for everyone at once."}
