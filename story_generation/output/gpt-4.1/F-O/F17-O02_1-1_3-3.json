I could already picture my grandmother\u2019s gentle smile, the warmth of the kitchen, the laughter echoing through the house. But as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. The upcoming safety audit at work loomed large, and though it was weeks away, my manager had made it clear: all documentation needed to be flawless, every detail checked and double-checked. As an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring nothing slipped through the cracks. The pressure to meet these standards was immense; any oversight could have serious consequences.
