It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my parents. They looked forward to these calls, and so did I\u2014our weekly ritual of sharing stories and checking in. But as I reached for my phone, I noticed the back seat. A customer had left behind a half-eaten sandwich, crumbs scattered everywhere. My next fare was a businesswoman, impeccably dressed, eyeing the mess through the window. I felt the pressure mount. As a son, I owed my parents my time and attention, especially now when they seemed to need me more. As a taxi driver, I was expected to provide a clean, professional ride\u2014no excuses. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cReady for our call?\u201d My hands trembled, torn between grabbing the vacuum or dialing home, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
