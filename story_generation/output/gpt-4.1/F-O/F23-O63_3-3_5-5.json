My stepson, Jamie, stood beside me, his face pale and eyes wide as the store manager explained how he\u2019d been caught slipping a candy bar into his jacket. My mind raced\u2014this was the moment I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences, to be the responsible adult he needed. But my phone kept vibrating, each buzz a reminder that it was the last day of the quarter, and my sales manager had made it clear: if I didn\u2019t close at least three more deals today, the whole team would miss our target. The pressure was suffocating. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to get back on the phone, to not let everyone down. But Jamie needed me, right now, to be present, to guide him through this mistake. My heart pounded as I looked from Jamie\u2019s trembling hands to the phone in my pocket, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility I felt as his step-parent."}
