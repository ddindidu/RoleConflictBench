My passenger kept glancing at his watch, his voice tight as he reminded me\u2014again\u2014that his flight to Tokyo was in less than two hours. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, trying to focus on the slippery streets and the anxious man in the back seat. My phone buzzed in the cup holder. It was a message from Mom: \u201cJust checking in, hope you\u2019re safe in this weather. Love you.\u201d I hadn\u2019t replied to her last text, and guilt twisted in my stomach. She worried when I drove in storms, always wanting to hear from me, but I couldn\u2019t risk taking my eyes off the road. The passenger\u2019s sighs grew louder, the snow kept falling, and my phone buzzed again. I felt torn in two\u2014my mother\u2019s daughter, her only child, and a driver responsible for a stranger\u2019s urgent journey. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I didn\u2019t know which role to answer first."}
