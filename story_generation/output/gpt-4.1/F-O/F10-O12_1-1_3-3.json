Grandma\u2019s coming!\u201d she wrote, a string of heart emojis trailing behind her words. My family always made a big deal out of these traditions, especially when Grandma visited. I knew how much it meant to them, to her, that I was there, hands dusted with flour, laughing and sharing stories.\n\nBut the brainstorming session was scheduled for the same afternoon. Technically, it was optional, but I knew how these things worked. The product team expected developers to show up, to contribute ideas, to show initiative. I\u2019d been trying to prove myself, to be seen as someone who cared about more than just code. Missing it might mean missing out on a chance to be heard, to be part of something new.\n\nI felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s kitchen and the bright, collaborative energy of my team. Both worlds wanted me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
