As an accountant, I knew I needed to send a formal reply\u2014prompt, professional, and precise. My boss had reminded me just this morning how important it was to maintain good relationships with our vendors, and I could almost hear his voice in my head, urging me not to delay.\n\nBut across the room, my mother was setting the table for our family\u2019s traditional dinner. She called out, reminding me to help with the preparations, just as my father had done every year. This meal was more than food; it was a ritual, a symbol of our family\u2019s unity and respect for our heritage. Lately, my parents had been especially insistent that I participate fully, worried that our traditions might fade.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to honor our customs, to be present and engaged. My job demanded my attention and professionalism. I stared at the email draft, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, torn between the duty of a son and the responsibility of an accountant."}
