The new feature was almost done, but the warnings about performance kept popping up. My team expected me to deliver clean, efficient code\u2014no shortcuts, no technical debt. I could feel the pressure mounting; the deadline was tight, and everyone was counting on me to get this right.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a video call from my granddaughter. She looked anxious, her voice small as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new? I\u2019m scared about starting high school.\u201d I could see she needed reassurance, the kind only a grandparent could give\u2014wisdom, patience, a listening ear. But my mind was tangled in algorithms and optimization, the clock ticking louder with every passing minute.\n\nI wanted to be fully present for her, to offer the guidance she sought. At the same time, the demands of my job pressed in, reminding me that my team was waiting. My heart pulled in two directions, I sat there, torn, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
