It was a message from my wife: \u201cCan you come home? I really need you right now.\u201d She\u2019s been struggling lately, and I know how much she depends on me to be there, to listen, to hold her hand through the storm. My heart ached at the thought of her alone, waiting for comfort only I could give. But as I glanced at the packages stacked in the van, my work phone rang. Dispatch reminded me that one delivery, already delayed, had to reach the customer before evening. I could hear the urgency in their voice\u2014late deliveries meant complaints, maybe even a warning. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the need to be a reliable husband, the expectation to be a dependable delivery person. My hands trembled on the steering wheel as I sat in the van, torn between the person who needed me most and the job that demanded my punctuality."}
