My stepbrother, Ethan, sat in front of me, his eyes rimmed red from lack of sleep. He\u2019d come straight from a marathon study session, desperate for a haircut before his final exam tomorrow. As his step-sibling, I knew he needed comfort, not just a trim\u2014he needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay. But as his hairdresser, I was expected to follow protocol: wash and condition every client\u2019s hair, no exceptions. Yet Ethan\u2019s hair was already clean, and he looked exhausted, barely holding himself together. If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be breaking salon rules and risking my job. If I insisted on it, I\u2019d be ignoring his obvious need for kindness and rest. My heart twisted as I tried to balance the demands of being a supportive sibling and a professional hairdresser, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, waiting for me to choose."}
