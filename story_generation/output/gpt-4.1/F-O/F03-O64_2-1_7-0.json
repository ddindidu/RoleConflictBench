My mind keeps drifting to the image of my parents at breakfast this morning\u2014my mother rubbing her temples, my father sighing over his coffee. They barely spoke, and I could see the exhaustion in their eyes. I know they need me, maybe just to listen or offer a hug, but I\u2019m here, wearing my uniform, expected to focus on every barcode and every dollar. A customer approaches, and I force a smile, scanning their groceries with practiced precision. But my thoughts are split. I want to call my mom, to check in, to be the son they need right now. Yet, I can\u2019t let my attention slip; one wrong price or missed item could mean trouble with my manager. The line grows, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s silent plea for comfort and my duty to keep the register running smoothly. My hands move automatically, but my heart is torn, caught between the beep of the scanner and the memory of my parents\u2019 tired faces."}
