The Nintendo, remember?\u201d His birthday was just days away, and I could already picture his excitement. But my mind kept drifting back to the factory floor, where a rarely used machine had started acting up. The glitch was subtle, only appearing now and then, but if I didn\u2019t get to the bottom of it, it could mean bigger problems down the line. My supervisor expected a full report by tomorrow, even though production was slow. I knew the overtime pay from staying late to troubleshoot would help cover the Nintendo, but it would also mean missing dinner with my family\u2014again. My wife\u2019s gentle reminders about keeping promises echoed in my head, clashing with the pressure to keep everything running smoothly at work. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
