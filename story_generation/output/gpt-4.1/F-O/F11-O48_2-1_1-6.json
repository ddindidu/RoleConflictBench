I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d My heart clenched. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, and I could already picture her sitting by the window, eyes searching for someone to talk to, someone to make her feel less alone. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and companionship, especially to patients like Mrs. Lee who had no family nearby. But as a sister, I was supposed to be there for my own family, to support my sister when she was in distress. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the two people who needed me, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which door to open first."}
