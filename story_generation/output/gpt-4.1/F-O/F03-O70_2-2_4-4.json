It was the last delivery of my shift, a moderately valuable item that required a signature. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mom, reminding me that tonight was the family\u2019s annual dinner, a tradition my parents insisted we never miss. Lately, they\u2019d been talking more about the importance of keeping our customs alive, especially with everyone so busy. I knew they expected me home early, dressed properly, ready to recite the family blessing before dinner.\n\nBut here I was, standing on a stranger\u2019s porch, waiting for someone to answer. The minutes ticked by. If I left the package without a signature, I\u2019d be breaking company policy and risking my job. If I waited much longer, I\u2019d be late for dinner, disappointing my family and betraying their trust in me to honor our traditions. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension build with every passing second."}
