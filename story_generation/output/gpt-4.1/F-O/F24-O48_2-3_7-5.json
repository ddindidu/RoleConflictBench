My shift as a nursing assistant was in full swing, and Mrs. Carter\u2019s blood pressure had been dangerously low all morning. I was supposed to check her vitals every five minutes, no exceptions. But just as I finished recording her last reading, my phone buzzed with a text from my stepbrother, Max. \u201cAbout to try the new trick. Come watch?\u201d I looked out the window and saw him at the top of the steep ramp, skateboard in hand, helmet slightly askew. He\u2019d promised to wait for me, but I knew how impatient he could be. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But if I left Mrs. Carter, even for a few minutes, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty\u2014and risking her safety. My hands shook as I weighed the demands pulling me in opposite directions, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing my chest."}
