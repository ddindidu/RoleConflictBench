My wife had left a note on the fridge: \u201cPlease get the laundry done before the kids\u2019 soccer game.\u201d I knew how important it was to her that we share the load at home, and I wanted to do my part. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the site manager. Today, before we could start framing the new addition, I had to inspect every tool and piece of equipment. Safety protocols were strict; one missed step could mean an accident, or worse. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build in my chest. If I left now, the laundry would sit, and my family would be left scrambling for clean uniforms. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late to the site, risking not only my job but the safety of my crew. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of home and the responsibilities of work."}
