The phone queue was already piling up, and I knew if I took my break early, it would be flagged. Just as I was about to finish my last call, I heard the front door slam. My younger brother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. He dropped his backpack and sat at the kitchen table, staring at nothing. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school. As his sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to help him through whatever had happened. But my headset beeped, signaling another call. My break was still five minutes away, and if I left my desk now, I\u2019d risk a warning. I felt torn, my heart aching for my brother, my mind racing with the pressure from work. I hovered between the kitchen and my desk, caught between being the supportive sibling he needed and the reliable employee my job demanded."}
