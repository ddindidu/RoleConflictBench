My partner was bustling around, vacuuming and dusting, glancing at me with that look\u2014half hopeful, half exasperated. Relatives would arrive in a few hours, and the house still needed mopping, the guest beds made, and the bathroom scrubbed. I\u2019d promised to help, to share the load, to be present. But now, my work phone flashed: urgent medical supplies needed at the hospital, a delivery that couldn\u2019t be late. I knew what was at stake\u2014patients depending on that package, my job on the line if I failed. My partner\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, asking if I could start on the guest room. My chest tightened. I wanted to be the reliable spouse, the one who didn\u2019t leave everything to them. But I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility of my route, especially not today. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, mop in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
