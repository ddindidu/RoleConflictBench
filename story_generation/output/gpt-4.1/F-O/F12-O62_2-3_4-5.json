My husband had mentioned this morning that he was out of clean shirts, and our daughter needed her uniform for tomorrow\u2019s field trip. I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done today, and I knew how much it meant to keep our little world running smoothly. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the pool manager. The filtration system was acting up again, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed before the afternoon swim lessons, the water could become unsafe. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for the safety of every swimmer, and neglecting the equipment could put lives at risk. My mind raced, torn between the pile of clothes and the urgent call to the pool. Both roles demanded my attention, both equally important in their own way. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides, my heart pounding as I stood frozen, unable to choose which responsibility to face first."}
