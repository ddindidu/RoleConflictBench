My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you please fold these today? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but my phone buzzes\u2014work needs me back on site, now. The foreman\u2019s voice is urgent: \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the beam. If you\u2019re not here, we can\u2019t move forward.\u201d I picture the crane, the heavy steel swaying, the whole crew waiting for me to guide it into place. My hands itch with the pressure of both worlds. At home, I\u2019m expected to pull my weight, to show I care by sharing the load. At work, I\u2019m needed for my strength and focus, no room for delay. My heart pounds as I stand in the doorway, torn between the laundry and the jobsite, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
