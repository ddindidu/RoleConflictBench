The store was closing soon, and I had to follow every step of the deposit procedure\u2014double-checking totals, filling out forms, locking the safe. The manager had reminded us all week: no shortcuts, not even for a minute, or we\u2019d risk an audit. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my granddaughter, asking if she could call. She was starting college next week, nervous about leaving home, and wanted to talk. I knew she needed me to listen, to offer the kind of advice only a grandfather could give. But the deposit had to be done now, no exceptions. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s trust in my wisdom, the company\u2019s trust in my precision. My heart ached to be there for her, but my mind raced with the steps I couldn\u2019t skip. I stared at the cash, then at my phone, torn between the rules of my job and the needs of my family, not sure which demand I could afford to let down."}
