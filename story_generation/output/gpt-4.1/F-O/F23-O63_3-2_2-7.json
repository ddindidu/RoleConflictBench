She\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with a parent\u2014today, if possible. I glanced at the clock. My next break as a telemarketer wasn\u2019t for another two hours, and management had just sent a reminder about strict adherence to break times. The phone queue was relentless, and I knew if I left my desk outside of my scheduled break, it would be flagged. But how could I ignore the school\u2019s request? As her step-parent, I was supposed to be there for her, especially now. I imagined her sitting in the principal\u2019s office, waiting for someone to show up, feeling scared and alone. But I also pictured my supervisor\u2019s disappointed face, the risk of a write-up, maybe even losing my job. My headset felt heavier than usual, and my stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, neither one letting me breathe."}
