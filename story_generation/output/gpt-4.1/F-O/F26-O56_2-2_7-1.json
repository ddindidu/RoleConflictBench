She\u2019d sent a message about her first day, and I knew she was hoping for a call from me\u2014someone to share her excitement and nerves with. I could almost hear her voice, eager for encouragement, and I felt that familiar tug of responsibility as a grandparent to be present, to show her she mattered. But just as I reached for my phone, the salon door chimed. A young woman stepped in, her eyes darting around, clutching her bag tightly. She looked lost, anxious\u2014exactly the kind of client who needed a warm welcome, a gentle word to put her at ease. My hands hovered between the phone and the reception desk. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: my family expecting my attention, my client needing my care. My heart raced as I tried to decide who needed me more in that moment, torn between the comfort I could offer my granddaughter and the reassurance I owed this nervous stranger."}
