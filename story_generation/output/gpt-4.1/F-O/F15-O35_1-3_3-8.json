She grinned, wiped her mouth, and I felt a flicker of pride\u2014until my phone buzzed. My shift as a subway operator was about to start. I kissed her goodbye, promising to talk more about manners after work.\n\nSliding into the operator\u2019s seat, I barely had time to settle before the cabin door opened. The transit authority supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. An unannounced audit\u2014today of all days. My mind raced with the protocols I needed to follow: precise announcements, smooth stops, unwavering focus. But my thoughts kept drifting back to my daughter, wondering if she\u2019d remember to say \u201cplease\u201d at dinner, or if I\u2019d failed her by rushing out.\n\nThe supervisor\u2019s gaze bore into me, expecting flawless professionalism. My daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes lingered in my memory, expecting guidance and patience. I gripped the controls, heart pounding, torn between the demands of the tracks and the lessons waiting at home."}
