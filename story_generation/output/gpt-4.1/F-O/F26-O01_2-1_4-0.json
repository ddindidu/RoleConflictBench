The whole family was gathering tonight to watch her perform, and she\u2019d asked me to sit in the front row. I could see the hope in her eyes, the way she wanted me to be there, to share in her big moment. But as I listened, my phone buzzed with an email from the office. The subject line made my heart sink: \u201cUrgent: Building Plan Review.\u201d I opened the attachment and scanned the blueprints, spotting a few minor inconsistencies. They weren\u2019t likely to cause immediate problems, but as the lead architect, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail was perfect, every regulation met. My team expected me to respond quickly, to uphold the standards I\u2019d set. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for my presence, my professional duty to safety and precision. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my granddaughter\u2019s anticipation and the cold, exacting demands of my work."}
