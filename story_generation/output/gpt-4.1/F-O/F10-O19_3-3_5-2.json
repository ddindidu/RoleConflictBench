It\u2019s important for the family.\u201d My heart pounded. This tradition meant everything to my parents, and I knew how much they counted on me to keep it alive. But as I looked up, the pharmacy counter was already crowded, and my next task was waiting\u2014a high-risk chemotherapy prescription. I double-checked the patient\u2019s chart, feeling the weight of responsibility. One slip, one moment of distraction, and the consequences could be devastating. My mind raced between the sacred rituals my family expected me to perform and the precise calculations and focus my profession demanded. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, reminding me of my duty as a daughter. At the same time, the pharmacist in me knew that my patient\u2019s life depended on my undivided attention. I felt torn, pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I stood there, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
