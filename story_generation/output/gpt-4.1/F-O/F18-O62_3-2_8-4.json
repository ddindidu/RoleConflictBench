That\u2019s when I spotted it\u2014a frayed section, dangerously close to snapping. If I didn\u2019t fix it before the next swim lesson, it could tangle a swimmer or throw the whole class into chaos. My supervisor always stressed the importance of keeping everything in top shape, and I took pride in being reliable. Just as I knelt to inspect the rope, I glanced out the window and saw my little brother on the sidewalk, fiddling with his phone, about to step into the street. He didn\u2019t see the car coming. My heart pounded. As his sibling, I was always supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe. But as a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone here, and the broken rope couldn\u2019t wait. I felt torn, frozen between the urgent pull of family and the weight of my duty."}
