It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our time to catch up, to reassure her that I\u2019m eating well, that I\u2019m happy, that I remember to care. But my laptop screen is a battlefield of urgent emails and red-marked blueprints. The project is behind schedule, and my team is waiting for my decision on a structural change that could make or break our deadline. I glance at the clock. If I answer, I\u2019ll lose precious minutes, maybe the focus I need to untangle this mess. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll hear the disappointment in her voice later, the quiet worry that grows with every missed call. My heart pounds with guilt and frustration, torn between the daughter who wants to be present and the architect who must be in control. The phone keeps ringing, and I sit frozen, caught between two worlds that both need me, unable to move."}
