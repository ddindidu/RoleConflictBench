It was our ritual, a thread tying me to home no matter how far my work took me. Tonight, though, I was still at the office, files spread across my desk, prepping for a procedural hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014postponing it would be simple, just a quick email to the court. But my client, anxious and new to the legal system, had called twice today, desperate for reassurance that things were moving forward.\n\nMy phone buzzed. Mom\u2019s name lit up the screen. I could already hear her gentle voice, asking about my week, wanting to know if I was eating well, if I was happy. I felt the weight of her expectations, the comfort she found in our calls. At the same time, I pictured my client, waiting for answers, counting on me to be present and prepared. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my attention, each expectation valid. I stared at the phone, torn, the seconds ticking by as I wrestled with what to do next."}
