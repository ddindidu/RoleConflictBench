He barely touched his coffee, his hands trembling as he scrolled through messages from his family. I knew he needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my steady presence. But the salon was already buzzing when I arrived, and my first client, Mrs. Patel, was waiting. She\u2019d just come from the gym, her hair damp and clinging to her scalp. I could almost smell the sweat as she settled into my chair, chatting about her upcoming anniversary dinner. I was supposed to wash and condition her hair before the cut, make her feel pampered and fresh. But my phone kept buzzing in my pocket\u2014Jamie, reaching out, needing comfort. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind torn between the expectation to be the attentive, professional hairdresser and the desperate urge to step outside, call Jamie, and be the supportive spouse he needed right now. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of the person in my chair and the one waiting for me at home."}
