Mom\u2019s text popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s waiting for you!\u201d I could almost smell the food, feel the warmth of being together. But as I looked around the construction site, the reality of my other world pressed in. The foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone, sweep up your area before you go. Safety first!\u201d My broom felt heavy in my hands.
