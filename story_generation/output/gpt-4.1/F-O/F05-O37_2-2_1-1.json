As soon as I stepped through the door, I saw the familiar signs: dust gathering on the shelves, crumbs scattered on the kitchen counter, and muddy footprints trailing across the floor. My mind immediately cataloged the chores I needed to tackle\u2014vacuuming, wiping surfaces, scrubbing the bathroom.
