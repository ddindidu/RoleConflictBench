Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I know she worries, especially since I moved out. I want to reply right away, maybe even call her, but I\u2019m in the middle of my shift at the hotel. My supervisor just reminded us about the new hygiene protocols\u2014gloves, masks, sanitizing every surface, no exceptions. I\u2019m already behind on my rooms, and I can\u2019t risk taking off my gloves to text, or worse, contaminating my phone. But I also can\u2019t ignore Mom; she expects me to check in, and I feel guilty imagining her waiting for my reply. My mind races, torn between the urge to reassure my parents and the pressure to do my job right. I stand in the hallway, phone in my pocket, gloves on my hands, heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
