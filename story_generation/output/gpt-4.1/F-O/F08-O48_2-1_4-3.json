Lily wants to tell everyone her big news before school.\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014being there for my granddaughter\u2019s milestones was what I cherished most as a grandmother. But as I poured my coffee, my work phone chimed. The schedule for my morning rounds at the care home had just been posted. Mrs. Carter needed her vitals checked by 8:00 sharp, and I knew how anxious she got if I was late. \n\nI could picture Lily\u2019s excited face, waiting for me to arrive, and at the same time, I imagined Mrs. Carter glancing at the clock, her trust in me on the line.
