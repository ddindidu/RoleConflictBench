My husband\u2019s work shirts are buried somewhere in there, and the kids have soccer practice tomorrow. Clean clothes aren\u2019t just a convenience\u2014they\u2019re a necessity for our family\u2019s routine. But as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes with a notification: the latest law review journal has arrived. I\u2019ve been waiting for this issue, knowing it contains articles on new legal theories that could impact my upcoming cases. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay ahead, to be informed and thoughtful in my rulings. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my family counting on me at home, the legal community expecting my diligence. My mind races, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the crisp, unread pages of the journal. I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the demands of wife and judge pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
