I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name, three missed calls, and a desperate text: \u201cPlease, I need you.\u201d My heart thudded. She\u2019d just found out about Dad\u2019s diagnosis last night, and I knew she was barely holding it together. I wanted to call her back, to be the brother she needed, to listen and reassure her that we\u2019d get through this together. But the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the safety briefing. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option; it was non-negotiable, and I\u2019d already been warned about being late. My team counted on me to be focused and present, not distracted by personal problems. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the urgent need to support my sister and the strict demands of my job. The seconds ticked by, and I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
