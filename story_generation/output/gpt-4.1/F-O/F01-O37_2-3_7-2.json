She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear my grandson giggling in the background, eager to tell me about his day at school. As a grandfather, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, to celebrate these moments with them. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Today was the day I was scheduled to deep clean the entire house\u2014a task my employer emphasized must be done thoroughly, every corner sanitized, no shortcuts. The supplies were already laid out, and I could almost feel my supervisor\u2019s eyes on me, expecting nothing less than perfection. My phone buzzed again with a message from my daughter, \u201cCan you talk now, Dad?\u201d I stood in the hallway, mop in hand, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s news and the cold, pressing duty of my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
