She was so excited, and I knew she\u2019d want to talk, to share every detail. As her grandparent, I felt the weight of staying connected, of being the one she could always count on to listen and celebrate her milestones. But at the same time, my mind drifted to the notice posted at the construction site earlier that day\u2014an optional training session next week. The foreman had hinted that those who attended would be looked upon favorably for upcoming projects. I knew how important it was to show commitment, to be seen as a team player, especially with work being so uncertain these days. The thought of missing the training made my stomach twist, but so did the idea of letting my granddaughter down. I stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure from both sides, torn between the demands of my family and the expectations at work, unsure which path to take."}
