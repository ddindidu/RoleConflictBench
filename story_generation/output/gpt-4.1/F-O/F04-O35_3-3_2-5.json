It was a message from my sister: \u201cI need you. Please call me.\u201d She never sent messages like that unless it was serious. My heart clenched, but at that exact moment, the passenger emergency alarm blared through the train. The control panel flashed red\u2014medical emergency in the third car. I was trained for this: keep calm, follow protocol, ensure passenger safety. But my mind was split. My sister needed me, probably more than ever, and I was the one she trusted to help her through tough times. Yet, right now, a passenger\u2019s life might depend on my immediate action. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectation to be there, and my duty to the hundreds of strangers relying on me for their safety. My hands hovered over the controls, my phone still vibrating in my pocket, as I wrestled with which call to answer first."}
