It would mean so much to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important this tradition was to them, how much they wanted me to be part of the family, to show I belonged. But my laptop chimed with another notification\u2014an email from my project manager, reminding me that the prototype demo was in two days. The stakeholders were anxious, and my team was counting on me to finalize the design. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I let them down. My mind spun between the warmth of family expectations and the cold, logical demands of engineering. I wanted to be the stepchild who finally fit in, but I was also the engineer who couldn\u2019t afford to miss a deadline. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both sides needed me now more than ever."}
