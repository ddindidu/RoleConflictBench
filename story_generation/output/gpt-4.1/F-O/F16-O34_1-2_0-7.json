I catch the hint of fatigue in their tone, the unspoken hope for comfort. I want to sit beside them, listen, offer a shoulder. But my phone buzzes\u2014dispatch needs me early. Thunderstorms are rolling in, and the radar is a mess of red and yellow. Flights are stacking up, handoffs are coming fast, and every second counts. My headset waits on the table, a reminder that hundreds of lives depend on my focus. My partner looks at me, searching for reassurance, while my mind races through call signs and weather patterns. I feel the pull in both directions\u2014one toward the person I love, the other toward the responsibility I can\u2019t ignore. My heart aches with the weight of choosing, knowing that whatever I do, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
