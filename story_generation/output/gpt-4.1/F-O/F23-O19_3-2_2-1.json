The phone buzzed in my pocket, and I saw the school\u2019s number flash on the screen. My heart sank. I answered, and the principal\u2019s voice was stern: my stepson had been caught bullying another student. They needed me to come in immediately to discuss his behavior. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, the pharmacy would be short-staffed, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s prescription would be delayed. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my partner and my stepson down, missing the chance to address something serious in his life. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the expectation to be a responsible, present parent, and the duty to ensure my patients\u2019 safety. My hands trembled as I looked from the prescription to my phone, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
