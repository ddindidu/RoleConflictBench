My mom barely touched her coffee, her eyes distant. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted to sit down, hold their hands, and offer the comfort they\u2019d always given me. But my phone buzzed, and I remembered my shift at the hospital. Mrs. Carter, my patient, was recovering from surgery and had clung to my hand yesterday, her voice trembling as she asked if I\u2019d be there again. She needed me too, needed someone to calm her fears and help her feel safe. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the family who raised me and the patient who depended on me. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which door to walk through first."}
