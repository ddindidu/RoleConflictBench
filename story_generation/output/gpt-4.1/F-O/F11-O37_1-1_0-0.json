She\u2019d just gotten her promotion, and tonight was her celebration. As her sister, I was supposed to be there, cheering her on, making her feel special. But as I glanced around the living room, I saw the dust on the shelves, the crumbs on the sofa, and the pile of dishes in the sink. My supervisor had texted earlier, reminding me that the house needed to be spotless for tomorrow\u2019s inspection. I was expected to do more than just a quick tidy\u2014I had to make sure every corner gleamed. My sister\u2019s laughter echoed from the next room, and guilt twisted in my stomach. I wanted to be the supportive sister she deserved, but the weight of my job\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stood frozen, torn between grabbing my coat to join the celebration or reaching for the cleaning spray to start scrubbing."}
