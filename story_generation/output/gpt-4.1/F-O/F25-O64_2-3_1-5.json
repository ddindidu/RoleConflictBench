The store was nearly empty, and I still had to finish the deposit paperwork before closing. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014Mom\u2019s name lit up the screen. It was our weekly call, the one she always said made her feel like I was really part of the family. I knew she\u2019d be waiting, probably sitting with Dad, hoping to hear about my week, asking if I was eating well, if I was happy. But the deposit had to be perfect; the manager warned us that any mistake could mean a write-up or worse. I felt the pressure of the store\u2019s rules pressing down on me, but also the weight of Mom\u2019s gentle expectation, her need for connection.
