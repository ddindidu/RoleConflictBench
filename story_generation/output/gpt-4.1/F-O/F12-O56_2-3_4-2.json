My husband had already texted, asking if I could handle it since he\u2019d be late. I promised I would, but as I reached for the detergent, the bell above the salon door jingled. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids swept in, faces flushed with nerves, chattering about timelines and makeup. They were early\u2014much earlier than expected. I could see the anxiety in the bride\u2019s eyes, and I knew she needed reassurance, a calm presence, someone to make her feel special on her big day. My phone buzzed again: a reminder about the laundry. My heart pounded as I stood between the back room and the salon floor, torn between the home that needed me and the clients who expected my undivided attention. I took a shaky breath, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
