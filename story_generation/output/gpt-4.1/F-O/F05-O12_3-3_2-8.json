The production outage is all anyone at work can talk about\u2014users are locked out, and the root cause is a bug in my code. My manager\u2019s messages are urgent, asking for updates every few minutes. I know I need to focus, to dig through logs and patch the issue before the company loses more customers.\n\nBut in the next room, I hear my wife\u2019s muffled sobs. She\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and tonight is especially hard. She needs me\u2014needs my arms around her, my words to remind her she\u2019s not alone. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d listen, that I\u2019d help her through this storm.\n\nI sit at my desk, hands hovering over the keyboard, heart pounding. Every second I spend on code feels like a betrayal to her, but every moment I\u2019m away from my laptop feels like I\u2019m letting my team and our users down. The weight of both worlds presses in, and I can\u2019t see how to be enough for either."}
