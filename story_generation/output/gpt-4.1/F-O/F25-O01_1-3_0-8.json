Everything okay?\u201d I glance at the time\u2014Saturday evening. I promised myself I\u2019d check in with him and Mom every weekend, but the hours have slipped away in a blur of blueprints and urgent emails. The project deadline looms, and my team is waiting for my decision on a structural issue that could set us back days. I can hear their voices in the conference room, tense and expectant. My stepdad\u2019s text sits unread, a silent reminder of the family I\u2019m supposed to stay connected with. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be present for my parents, to reassure them I haven\u2019t drifted away, and the responsibility to my team, who rely on me to keep everything moving. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between sending a quick reply and diving back into the chaos of work, my heart caught in the tug-of-war between home and the office."}
