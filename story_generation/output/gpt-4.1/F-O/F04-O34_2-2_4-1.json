Tonight was the family dinner\u2014my sister\u2019s birthday, the one night everyone managed to gather. My phone buzzed with a message from my brother: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter, the clinking of glasses, the warmth I hadn\u2019t felt in weeks.\n\nBut outside, the radar screen was a mess of blinking targets. Holiday traffic had the airspace stacked with holding patterns, pilots requesting updates, and supervisors expecting me to keep delays minimal. Every decision I made rippled through the sky, affecting hundreds of lives. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled: \u201cWe need you focused, no mistakes tonight.\u201d\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds. My family wanted me at the table, present and smiling. My team needed me sharp, unwavering, and here.
