My heart ached to see her like that\u2014she\u2019d always been so bright and full of questions, but lately, she\u2019d seemed withdrawn. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer a gentle word, and help her untangle whatever was weighing on her mind. \n\nJust then, a customer approached the counter, asking about the best over-the-counter pain relief for a headache. As a pharmacist, I knew I needed to provide clear, professional advice, ensuring the patient\u2019s safety and understanding. But my mind kept drifting to Emma, wondering if she needed me more in that moment. The expectation to be present and attentive for my patient clashed with the urge to comfort my granddaughter. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
