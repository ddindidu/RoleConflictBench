He\u2019s been picking up the slack lately, and I know he\u2019s tired. I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight. But my phone buzzes again\u2014an urgent email from a major supplier. They\u2019re threatening to halt all future shipments unless I resolve a past-due invoice immediately. My boss expects me to handle these crises without delay, to keep the business running smoothly. My heart pounds as I glance between the laundry and my laptop. I can almost hear my husband\u2019s sigh if he comes home to the same mess, but I also know the consequences at work if I don\u2019t respond right now. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I feel torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the reliable wife I want to be and the competent accountant I\u2019m expected to be."}
