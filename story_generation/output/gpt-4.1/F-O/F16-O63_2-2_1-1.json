They just got off a call with their boss, and now they\u2019re looking at me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of support only I can give. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d they whisper, and I want to reach out, to hold their hand, to listen and help them sort through the mess.\n\nBut my screen blinks\u2014another call. I click accept, and a customer\u2019s voice fills my ear, launching into a barrage of technical questions about the new service. The script in front of me is useless; I fumble for answers, trying to sound confident, while my partner\u2019s gaze pleads for my attention. My manager expects me to handle every objection, to keep the customer engaged, but my heart aches for my partner, who needs me now more than ever.\n\nI feel split in two, pulled by the demands of my job and the needs of the person I love. My voice wavers as I try to juggle both, the pressure mounting, unsure which role to choose in this moment."}
