My son darted away, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him right from wrong, to show discipline. I opened my mouth to call him back, but my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the control center: a suspicious, unattended bag had been found on one of the train cars. As a subway operator, I was expected to respond immediately, to ensure passenger safety, to be calm and decisive. My heart pounded as I looked at my son, still running wild, and then at my phone, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I knew I couldn\u2019t ignore either responsibility, but in that moment, I was paralyzed, torn between being the parent my child needed and the operator my passengers depended on."}
