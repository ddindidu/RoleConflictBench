She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, how my day was going, and if I\u2019d remembered to call my aunt for her birthday. I glanced at the clock\u2014already past eight. I hadn\u2019t replied to her last three messages, and guilt gnawed at me. We always talked every day, and she expected me to share everything, no matter how small. But my laptop screen glared back at me, the blank document for the scheduling order taunting me with its emptiness. The deadline was looming, and as a judge, I was expected to be thorough, precise, and timely. The court staff and attorneys were waiting for my order to move the case forward. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s familiar questions and the weight of my professional duty. I stared at my phone, then at the blinking cursor, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
