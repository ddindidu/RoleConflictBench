Mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe need everyone there. It\u2019s been too long since we were all together.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, and I knew how much it meant to her. My siblings were already making plans for games and late-night talks. I wanted to be there, to laugh with them, to be the brother they expected.\n\nBut at work, the hum of the machines echoed in my mind. The maintenance logs glared at me from my computer screen\u2014three machines overdue for cleaning, running hotter than they should. My supervisor\u2019s reminder was blunt: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this done, we risk a breakdown. I need you on this.\u201d The responsibility pressed on me; I was the one who kept things running smoothly.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my family\u2019s hopes on one side and the demands of my job on the other. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in both places at once."}
