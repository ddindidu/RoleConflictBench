My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. I gripped the wheel, trying to focus on the slippery road, but my phone buzzed again in the cupholder. Another message from my stepbrother: \u201cDinner\u2019s starting soon. Mom\u2019s asking where you are.\u201d I could picture them all at the table, the warmth of the kitchen, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, part of the family, not just the outsider who always had an excuse.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t just abandon my passenger, not in this weather, not when he was counting on me to get him to the airport safely and on time. Every red light, every slow crawl behind a snowplow, I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I was supposed to be reliable, present for my family, but also professional, responsible for my passenger\u2019s journey. My heart thudded with guilt and frustration as I weighed the demands, the storm outside mirroring the turmoil inside me."}
