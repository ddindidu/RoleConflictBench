My numbers glowed green\u2014on track to beat my quota this week. The thrill of success buzzed in my chest, but it was interrupted by the clatter of a spoon. My daughter, Anna, was slouched at the table, poking at her cereal, her elbows on the table despite my reminders. I knew I should gently correct her, remind her about table manners, and talk about why respect and discipline matter. But my phone vibrated with a new lead\u2014one more call could push me even further ahead at work. Management expected me to be relentless, to seize every opportunity.
