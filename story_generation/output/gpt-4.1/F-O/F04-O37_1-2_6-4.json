You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d She always wanted me there, and I knew how much it meant to her that I included her in my plans. Building that mutual respect, being present for her, was something I promised myself I\u2019d do better at. But as I started to reply, my work phone buzzed. My client\u2019s text was curt: \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of floor cleaner. Please make sure it\u2019s restocked before your next visit.\u201d I checked the calendar\u2014my next shift was in two days, and the store closed early tonight. If I didn\u2019t get the supplies now, I\u2019d risk disappointing my client and possibly losing their trust. My sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, excited and hopeful, while the weight of my responsibility as a cleaner pressed down on me. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of family and the duty of my job, feeling the tension knot in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
