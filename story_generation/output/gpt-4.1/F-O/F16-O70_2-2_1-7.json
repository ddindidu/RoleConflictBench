I could see how much they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to help them sort through the mess. I reached for their hand, trying to focus, but my phone buzzed again. A customer was asking about their package, and the app flashed a warning: respond within two minutes or risk a complaint. I felt my heart race. My partner\u2019s voice wavered, searching my face for comfort, but my mind was split. I knew the customer expected a quick, polite reply, but my partner needed me, right now, to be present and supportive. I stared at my phone, then at my partner, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
