She wants us to talk honestly, to lay everything out\u2014our savings, her recent test results, the options we have. I know she expects me to be present, to listen, to share my worries and hopes without holding back. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the workshop on new prescription guidelines starts in thirty minutes. As a pharmacist, I can\u2019t afford to fall behind; my patients rely on me to know the latest, to keep them safe. The pressure from work is relentless\u2014missing this session could mean missing crucial updates. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my wife\u2019s need for openness and my professional duty to stay informed. My heart pounds as I glance between her anxious face and the clock, torn by the impossible choice between being the husband she needs and the pharmacist my patients depend on."}
