The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIf that glitch happens again, we could lose the whole batch. We need you on this.\u201d I could hear the faint hum of the machine, the kind that signaled something was off, but not enough to pinpoint. My mind raced through possible causes, but my phone buzzed, snapping me back. A reminder: \u201cPick up the kids\u2014school\u2019s out early today.\u201d My partner had texted twice already, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it means a lot to them.\u201d I pictured their faces, waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for me. I knew how important it was to show up, to prove I was reliable, that I cared. But the machine\u2019s intermittent fault nagged at me\u2014if I left now, production could stall, and I\u2019d let my team down.
