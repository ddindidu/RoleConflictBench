The whole family was gathering in the living room, eager to celebrate and hear him share the story. My heart swelled with pride, and I longed to be there, to wrap him in a hug and see his beaming face. But my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch needed me at the tower. The holiday rush had begun, and the approach fixes were already stacked with holding patterns. I knew the expectation: keep the skies safe, minimize delays, and stay sharp. My headset and uniform waited by the door, a stark reminder of my responsibility. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s laughter drifted from the next room, while my mind raced with flight numbers and separation minima. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
