My foreman\u2019s voice barked in my ear, \u201cWe need you now\u2014get that beam in place!\u201d My hands itched to grab the guide rope, to do my part, to keep the crew safe and the job moving. But just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s really down, won\u2019t say why. He needs you.\u201d I pictured my grandson\u2019s slumped shoulders, the way he looked at me last Sunday, searching for answers I should have. My heart twisted\u2014he needed my words, my time, my wisdom. But the beam was swinging, men were waiting, and I was needed here, too. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, torn between the call of my family and the demands of my work."}
