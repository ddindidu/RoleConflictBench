I knew I should step in, guide her gently but firmly, show her the boundaries she needed to learn. That was what was expected of me as her step-parent\u2014to teach her right from wrong, to help her grow into a kind and respectful person. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: a message from the hospital. The family of my patient was waiting, desperate for answers, and I was the one who had to give them the news no one wants to hear. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, my ability to communicate with clarity and compassion. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in on me\u2014my stepdaughter\u2019s wide eyes, trusting me to guide her, and the family at the hospital, needing me to be strong and present. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of the two people who needed me most, unsure which role to step into first."}
