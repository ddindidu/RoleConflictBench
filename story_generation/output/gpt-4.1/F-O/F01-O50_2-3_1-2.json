He\u2019d barely touched his snack, and I could sense the weight on his young shoulders. As his grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to offer him the right words, to share some hard-earned wisdom that might help him find his way. Just as I leaned forward to speak, my phone buzzed urgently. The hospital\u2019s number flashed on the screen. I was needed immediately\u2014one of the life-support machines in the ICU was failing, and every second counted. My mind raced. My family expected me to be present, to guide and comfort. But as a machine repairer, I was the only one who could fix that device, and lives depended on my expertise. I looked at my grandson, then at the phone in my hand, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
