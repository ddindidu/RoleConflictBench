My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter. The words on the screen made my heart clench: \u201cMom, it\u2019s urgent. Can you call me? It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d Jamie, my grandson, was in trouble, and my family needed me. As a grandmother, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and guidance, to keep the lines of communication open, especially in moments like this.\n\nBut just then, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to watch every movement, ready to leap in at the first sign of real distress. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014my family\u2019s crisis on one side, the safety of the swimmers on the other. My hands trembled as I gripped the armrests, wrestling with the impossible choice between answering my family\u2019s call and fulfilling my duty to protect those in the water."}
