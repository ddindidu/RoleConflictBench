My partner\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d handle the chores today. The expectation is clear: we share the load, and right now, it\u2019s my turn. But as I reach for the first towel, my phone buzzes. The salon\u2019s front desk manager texts\u2014my next clients, a bride and her bridesmaids, have arrived early. They\u2019re nervous, the wedding schedule is tight, and I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to greet them, calm their nerves, and make their day special. I can almost hear their anxious chatter from the break room. My heart pounds as I stand between the laundry and the salon door, torn. At home, I\u2019m a partner who keeps promises; at work, I\u2019m the professional who never lets a client down. Both roles demand my full attention, right now, and I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I take a shaky breath, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, and try to decide which part of me to let down."}
