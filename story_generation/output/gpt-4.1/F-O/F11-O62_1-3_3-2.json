The beach was packed, and the tide was higher than usual\u2014every instinct told me to stay alert, to watch every swimmer, every splash. But my phone buzzed with the family group chat. My little brother\u2019s message popped up: \u201cAre you coming to the picnic this weekend? Mom says you never join us anymore.\u201d I could almost hear their voices, laughing and planning, expecting me to be there, to be a good sister, to show I cared. Guilt twisted in my stomach. I wanted to reply, to be part of the conversation, to promise I\u2019d come. But every second I looked away from the water, I risked missing someone in trouble. My family wanted me present, involved, but the beach demanded my full attention. I gripped the phone, torn between the pull of home and the weight of responsibility, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
