As a telemarketer, every second is tracked\u2014if I step away from my desk outside of my scheduled break, the compliance system will flag me. I can\u2019t afford another warning; the threat of disciplinary action hangs over me like a storm cloud. But my mind keeps drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a step-parent, I promised my partner I\u2019d help keep us afloat, that I\u2019d be the steady one. The kids need stability, and I need this job to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. My phone buzzes with a message from my partner: \u201cCan you talk? The bank called again.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014my break isn\u2019t for another forty minutes. If I answer now, I risk my job. If I don\u2019t, I risk my family\u2019s trust.
