My grandkids had been talking about it all week, and I could already picture their eager faces waiting for me. But just as I was about to slip out of the salon, Mrs. Lee, one of my regulars, walked in. She smiled warmly, her eyes lighting up when she saw me behind the counter. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee always preferred me to greet her, and I knew how much she valued our little chats before her appointment. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014my family expecting my presence, my client expecting my warmth and attention. My mind raced, torn between the laughter of my grandchildren and the trust of a loyal customer. I stood there, caught in the doorway, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
