He\u2019d just messaged, upset about a comment I\u2019d made at dinner last night. I knew I should call him, listen, and try to see things from his perspective\u2014he always said I was too quick to judge. But the machine\u2019s glitch was elusive, only showing up when no one was watching, and my supervisor expected a full report by the end of the shift. I could almost hear his voice: \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who really understands these old circuits.\u201d My brother, meanwhile, expected patience and understanding, not the distracted, short-tempered sister I\u2019d been lately. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the hum of the factory floor and the silent weight of my brother\u2019s disappointment. My hands hovered over the machine\u2019s wiring, but my thoughts were with him, wrestling with the impossible task of being both the reliable repairer and the supportive sister at the same time."}
