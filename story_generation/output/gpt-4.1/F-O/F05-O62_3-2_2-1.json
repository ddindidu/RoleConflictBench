She needed me\u2014her voice cracked, her eyes searching mine for comfort, for the steady reassurance I\u2019d promised to give. I reached for her hand, trying to anchor her, but my gaze kept darting to the water. The pool was crowded, and as a lifeguard, I was supposed to be alert, scanning every corner for signs of trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My heart pounded. My wife\u2019s grip tightened, her words growing more desperate, but my training screamed at me to focus on the pool. I felt torn in two\u2014my wife needed my undivided attention, but so did the swimmer.
