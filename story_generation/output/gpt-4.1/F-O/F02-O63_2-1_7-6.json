As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to take my break now\u2014supervisors are lenient today since the call volume is light. But as a father, I know my family is counting on me. The bills are piling up at home, and every successful call means a little more security for my kids. My wife texted earlier, asking if I could pick up groceries on the way home, a reminder of how tight things are. I know if I skip my break and keep dialing, I might land another sale, maybe even a bonus. But the rules are clear: take breaks as scheduled, don\u2019t overwork, don\u2019t risk burnout. My body aches for a pause, but my mind races with worry about the rent, the groceries, the shoes my son needs for school. I stare at the blinking \u201cbreak\u201d button on my screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
