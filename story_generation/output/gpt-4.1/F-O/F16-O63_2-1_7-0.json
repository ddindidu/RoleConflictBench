I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on them. As a partner, I was supposed to be open, to share my own worries and listen to theirs. But my mind was still half in telemarketer mode, replaying the last call where a customer\u2019s question had thrown me off, even though the answer was right there in the script. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to never let my voice waver. Now, my spouse looked up, concern in their eyes, and asked, \u201cRough day?\u201d I wanted to tell them everything\u2014the pressure to be perfect, the fear of slipping up\u2014but I hesitated. If I opened up, would I sound weak? Would I burden them when they already seemed troubled? My roles pulled at me from both sides: the supportive spouse who should communicate, and the flawless telemarketer who should never let stress show. I took a breath, caught between the urge to confide and the instinct to keep my struggles hidden."}
