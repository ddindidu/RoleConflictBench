Glancing over, I saw my younger brother, skateboard in hand, grinning at the top of the old, cracked ramp behind our house. He was about to try that trick he\u2019d been talking about for weeks, the one I\u2019d warned him was too dangerous. As his older sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But just then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a slick, shimmering puddle on the walkway near the scaffolding. As a laborer, I knew the rules\u2014any spill, no matter how small, had to be cleaned up right away. If someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. My heart pounded as I looked from the ramp to the spill, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My brother\u2019s safety, my coworkers\u2019 safety\u2014both depended on me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
