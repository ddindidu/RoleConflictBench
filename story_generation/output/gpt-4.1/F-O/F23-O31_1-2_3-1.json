He\u2019d just muttered something rude under his breath about his teacher, and I knew I had to step in\u2014teach him about respect, about how words matter. I opened my mouth to speak, but my phone buzzed urgently. Dispatch. There was a protest downtown, and things were getting heated. As a police officer, I was expected to be there, to help keep the peace, to enforce the law. My wife\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for me to stay and handle the situation at home. My son needed guidance, but so did the city. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one invisible, one pressed and blue\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I stood between the table and the door, torn by the demands of two worlds that needed me, right now."}
