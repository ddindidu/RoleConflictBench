The plant was quiet, the slow season giving me time to be thorough, but the pressure to find the fault still pressed on me. My phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother, Sam, again. He\u2019d been struggling with his new job, and lately, our conversations had turned into arguments. He said I didn\u2019t listen, that I was too quick to judge. I knew he needed patience, someone to understand his frustrations, not just offer solutions. But right now, the plant manager expected answers, and every minute I spent on the phone was a minute not spent diagnosing the machine. I stared at the tangled wires, feeling the weight of both roles. I wanted to be the brother Sam needed, patient and open, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility to keep the line running. The phone buzzed again, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of family and work, unsure which expectation I was about to let down."}
