My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help rearrange the furniture before his parents arrived. The house needed to be spotless\u2014every cushion fluffed, every surface gleaming\u2014because relatives were coming, and I was expected to help make everything perfect. At the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my project manager, reminding me that the prototype demo was tomorrow. The stakeholders were anxious, and the team was counting on me to finalize the design so we could secure approval. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my heart pounding as I tried to decide whether to pick up my laptop or the vacuum. The expectations from both sides clashed in my mind, leaving me frozen in the middle of the kitchen, torn between being the supportive wife and the dedicated engineer."}
