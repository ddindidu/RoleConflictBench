It was my granddaughter, her message urgent: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart clenched. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew something serious was weighing on her. I wanted nothing more than to be the steady voice she needed, to offer the comfort and wisdom she expected from me. But just as I was about to call her back, the nurse in charge poked her head in. \u201cMrs. Lee in 204 is asking for you. She\u2019s anxious and keeps asking if you\u2019ll sit with her.\u201d I could picture Mrs. Lee\u2019s frightened eyes, her trembling hands after surgery. She depended on me for reassurance, for the gentle presence that made her feel safe. I felt torn in two\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s trust on one side, my patient\u2019s vulnerability on the other. Both needed me, both expected me to be their anchor. My hands shook as I stared at my phone, caught between the pull of family and the duty of care, not knowing which call to answer first."}
