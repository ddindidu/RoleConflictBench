The law was clear, but I knew the car belonged to my stepdad. He\u2019d been working double shifts lately, barely sleeping, and I\u2019d seen the exhaustion etched into his face at home. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to treat everyone equally, but as a step-child, I felt the pull to protect him, to ease his burdens however I could. My mom had confided in me last night, her voice trembling, about how worried she was for him. I could almost hear her now, asking me to be understanding, to help out. But my badge weighed heavy on my chest, reminding me of the oath I\u2019d taken. My hands trembled as I tried to reconcile the two worlds\u2014one demanding fairness, the other begging for compassion. I stared at the ticket, heart pounding, caught between duty and family, knowing that whatever I chose, something would be left undone."}
