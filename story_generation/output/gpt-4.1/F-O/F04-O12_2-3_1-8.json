The message was from my sister: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d Her words were short, but I could sense the heaviness behind them. At the same time, my Slack was blowing up\u2014alerts, frantic messages from QA, and a notification from my manager: \u201cProduction is down. Users are locked out. We need you to fix this ASAP.\u201d\n\nI stared at the screen, my mind racing. As a brother, I knew I should be there for my sister, especially when she reached out like this. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, no matter what. But as a software developer, I was responsible for the code that had just failed hundreds of customers. The team was counting on me to troubleshoot and resolve the outage, and every minute lost meant more frustration for users and more pressure on my colleagues.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pulling me in opposite directions. I felt torn, guilty for even hesitating, and overwhelmed by the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
