A car had spun out, colliding with a streetlight. As I stepped out, my phone buzzed\u2014my sister\u2019s name on the screen. She never called during my shift unless it was urgent. I hesitated, torn. My duty as a police officer demanded my full attention: securing the scene, checking for injuries, directing traffic. But as a brother, I knew I should answer, be there for her, especially if she was in distress. The weight of my badge pressed against my chest, a reminder of my responsibility to the public. Yet, the thought of my sister needing me gnawed at my conscience. I could see the accident victims waiting for help, but my sister\u2019s call kept ringing, each vibration a tug-of-war between my roles. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the expectations of my uniform and the bond of family, unsure which duty to answer first."}
