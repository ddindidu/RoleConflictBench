My phone buzzed with a message from my spouse: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, your parents arrive in two hours. We still need to vacuum and set the table.\u201d I could picture the living room, half-tidy, the kitchen counters still cluttered. I promised I\u2019d be home early to help, but here I was, picking up another fare because the roads were clear and the shift was going well. \n\nAs a taxi driver, I knew I couldn\u2019t rush. The expectation was clear: drive safely, follow every rule, no matter how empty the streets looked. But as a spouse, I was supposed to be home, sharing the load, making sure everything was perfect for our guests. My mind raced with the competing demands\u2014should I finish this ride and risk being late, or cut my shift short and disappoint my dispatcher? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I approached the next intersection."}
