He\u2019s chattering about his day, but my mind keeps drifting to the thick stack of legal documents waiting on my desk. The purchase agreement needs my attention\u2014my client is counting on me to catch any errors before the filing deadline tomorrow. My phone buzzes with another reminder, and I feel the pressure mounting. I know I should be present, watching out for my stepbrother, especially as we cross the busy intersection ahead. That\u2019s what family does\u2014we look out for each other. But the lawyer in me is screaming that I can\u2019t afford to let my focus slip from the contract, not with so much at stake. My stepbrother tugs at my sleeve, asking if I\u2019m listening, and I force a smile, torn between the responsibility I owe him and the professional duty that won\u2019t wait. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the growing sense that I\u2019m about to let someone down, no matter what I choose."}
