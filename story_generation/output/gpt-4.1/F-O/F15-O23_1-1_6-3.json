My son bounced into the room, eyes bright with anticipation. \u201cIs today the day, Mom? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo after your big case!\u201d His words tugged at me. I wanted to keep my promise, to see his face light up with joy. But as a lawyer, I knew I had a procedural hearing scheduled this afternoon. It was a minor matter, one that could be postponed without much consequence, but I also knew that every hour billed helped keep our finances steady. The expectation to provide for my family pressed on me, but so did the promise I\u2019d made to my child. I could call the court and request a postponement, but would that be shirking my professional duty? My heart ached as I weighed the needs of my client against the happiness of my son, feeling the familiar pull of being stretched between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
