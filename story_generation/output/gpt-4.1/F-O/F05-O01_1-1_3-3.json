My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cWe said we\u2019d share this, remember?\u201d\u2014and guilt prickles at my skin. I promised I\u2019d help, but the day slipped away, eaten by deadlines and sketches. Now, as the evening settles in, I should be folding, making good on my word.\n\nBut my sketchbook calls from the kitchen table, open to the half-finished layout for my new studio. The design is simple, but every line matters. I need to make the space work, to prove to myself that I can create something functional and beautiful, even for my own home. My mind races with ideas for storage, light, and flow, but the laundry nags at me, a reminder of the life I share and the promises I\u2019ve made.\n\nI stand between the couch and the table, heart tugged in two directions. The weight of expectation presses down\u2014husband, architect\u2014and I wonder which role I\u2019ll answer first."}
