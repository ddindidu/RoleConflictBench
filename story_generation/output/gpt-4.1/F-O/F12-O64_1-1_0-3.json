See you soon.\u201d I knew he\u2019d want to talk, maybe just a hug and a listening ear. That\u2019s what I always try to give him\u2014my support, my attention, my care. But as I finished the count, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. It was just a few dollars off, nothing that would change the total sales, but store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, every irregularity reported. My manager expected me to be thorough, to follow the rules without exception.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. If I stayed to sort out the register, I\u2019d be late getting home, and my husband would be left alone with his thoughts, maybe feeling like I didn\u2019t care. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking my reputation at work. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
