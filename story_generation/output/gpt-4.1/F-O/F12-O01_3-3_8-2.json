My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to respond. He wanted to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about whether we should dip into our savings. He needed me to be honest, to share my worries and hopes, to be his partner in this. But my phone kept buzzing with messages from the site manager: a last-minute inspection had revealed a possible flaw in the fire escape design. If I didn\u2019t review the plans tonight, the project could be delayed, or worse, someone\u2019s safety could be at risk. My husband\u2019s voice was gentle but insistent, \u201cWe need to talk about this, really talk.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to him, to our future, and my duty to the hundreds of lives that would depend on the building I designed. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the two people who needed me most."}
