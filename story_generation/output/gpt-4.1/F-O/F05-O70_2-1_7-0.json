The package in the backseat was supposed to be delivered by noon, but traffic had been brutal, and now it was already 12:15. I could still make it within the day, but I knew my supervisor expected punctuality, and customers could be unforgiving. As I pulled up to the address, my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cCan we talk when you get home? I\u2019m worried about something.\u201d I remembered how she\u2019d seemed distant at breakfast, her eyes clouded with concern. She always wanted us to share our worries, to be open with each other, and I knew she expected me to listen and be present. But all I could think about was the late delivery, the possible complaint, and the pressure to keep my job. My mind spun between the demands of being a reliable delivery person and a supportive husband, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn and uncertain."}
