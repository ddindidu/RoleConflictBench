Can you pick up some things after work? We really need it.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew the bills were piling up, and my stepdaughter had mentioned her shoes were too tight. I felt the weight of being the provider, the one who had to make sure everyone at home was okay, fed, and safe.\n\nBut right now, I was at the bedside of Mrs. Carter, a frail woman in her eighties, her face twisted in pain as she tried to lift a spoonful of soup. \u201cCan you help me, please?\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. My shift was supposed to end in ten minutes, but I couldn\u2019t just leave her like this. My supervisor expected me to finish my rounds, but my family needed me, too.\n\nI felt torn, my chest tight with anxiety. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late getting groceries, risking another tense evening at home. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning someone who depended on me for comfort and care. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which need to answer first."}
