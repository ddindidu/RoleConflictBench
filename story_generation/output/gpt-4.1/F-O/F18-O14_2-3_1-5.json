The journal deadline was just hours away, and every detail had to be perfect\u2014no errors, no missing datasets. My phone buzzed, but I ignored it, determined to finish the analysis. Then I heard the front door slam. My younger brother trudged in, backpack dragging, face streaked with tears. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch, shoulders shaking. I knew I should go to him, ask what happened, be the supportive sibling he needed. But the clock was ticking, and my mind raced with the pressure of the looming deadline. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me as I glanced between my brother and the screen. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my family needed me, but so did my research. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between the urge to comfort him and the obligation to finish my work."}
