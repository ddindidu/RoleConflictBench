We\u2019d been talking about our finances, and she wanted to know if I\u2019d been completely open about our expenses. She deserved the truth\u2014she always said that trust was the foundation of our marriage. I promised her I\u2019d tell her everything, no matter how uncomfortable.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the morning\u2019s shift. I\u2019d pulled over a car parked illegally outside a pharmacy. The driver was a single mother, frazzled and apologetic, explaining she\u2019d only run in to get medicine for her sick child. Department policy was clear, but I had some discretion. If I let her go, was I being fair to others who\u2019d gotten tickets? If I wrote her up, was I acting with compassion?\n\nNow, as my wife pressed for answers, I felt the weight of both roles. She expected openness, but I wondered if sharing every detail\u2014like the times I bent the rules for empathy\u2014would make her question my integrity as a police officer. I wanted to be honest with her, but I also wanted to uphold the standards of my badge. The two expectations pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
