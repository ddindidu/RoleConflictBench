I\u2019d just caught her slipping a candy bar into her pocket at the snack stand. My heart pounded as I tried to remember everything I\u2019d read about teaching kids honesty and discipline\u2014how important it was to address the behavior right away, to talk about right and wrong, to set boundaries. I could see the guilt in her eyes, and I knew this was a moment that mattered for both of us.\n\nBut then, as I opened my mouth to speak, a shrill whistle cut through the air. I looked up and saw a small boy flailing in the deep end, his arms splashing wildly. That area was off-limits for kids who couldn\u2019t swim, and as a lifeguard, I was responsible for enforcing those rules and, more importantly, for keeping everyone safe. My training screamed at me to act immediately, to jump in and help. But Mia was still standing in front of me, waiting for my reaction, her future trust in me hanging in the balance. I felt torn in two, pulled by the urgent demands of both roles, not sure which one to answer first."}
