My break was scheduled for 2:30, but with the call volume so light today, my supervisor had said we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all go at once. I knew this was my chance. My granddaughter had just started her new job, and she\u2019d texted the family group chat this morning, bubbling with excitement. I promised her I\u2019d call during my break to hear all about her first week. \n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I hesitated. The unwritten rule here was to stick to the schedule, even if the supervisors were lenient. If I took my break now, I\u2019d be out of sync with the rest of the team, and if the call volume suddenly spiked, I\u2019d be letting my coworkers down. Yet, if I waited until my official break, I might miss my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019d be back at work herself. My heart tugged in two directions: the devoted grandparent wanting to be present, and the reliable employee not wanting to bend the rules too far. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
