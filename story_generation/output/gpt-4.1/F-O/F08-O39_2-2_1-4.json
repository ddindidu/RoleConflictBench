My heart ached to reach out, to offer the kind of gentle words my own grandmother once gave me\u2014reminders that storms pass, that he\u2019s stronger than he thinks. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the foreman: a spill had been spotted in the walkway, and I was the closest to the site. Safety was on my shoulders; if someone slipped, it would be on me. I looked at my grandson, so small and lost, and then at my phone, the weight of responsibility pressing in from both sides. My mind raced\u2014do I stay and be the grandmother he needs, or do I rush back to the site and be the laborer my crew depends on? The clock ticked, and I felt torn in two, each role pulling me in a different direction, both demanding more than I had to give."}
