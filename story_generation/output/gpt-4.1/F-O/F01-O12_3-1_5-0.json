The house was unusually quiet, but my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you come over? We really need you.\u201d My heart tightened. There was trouble at home\u2014something serious, something only a grandfather\u2019s steady presence could help soothe. I glanced back at the code, knowing the deadline was generous. I could leave the module as it was, a little messy, a little inefficient, and fix it later. But the developer in me recoiled at the thought. I prided myself on clean, maintainable work, and leaving things half-done felt wrong. Yet, the image of my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces tugged at me. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s need pressing against the quiet insistence of my professional standards. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind wrestling with the demands of both worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
