My daughter had called last night, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing their eager faces and the laughter around the table. But as I slipped on my headset and logged into the telemarketing system, a cold reminder flashed on my screen: \u201cAll breaks must be scheduled. Unscheduled downtime will be flagged.\u201d The compliance system was relentless\u2014one minute off the clock, and I\u2019d be called in for a warning. My supervisor had already hinted that my job was on the line.\n\nThe clock ticked closer to the time I was supposed to leave for the family gathering. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety. I wanted to be the grandparent who showed up, who listened to stories and played games. But I also needed this job to help with bills and gifts for those same grandkids.

I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my headset and the warmth of my family waiting just beyond the door."}
