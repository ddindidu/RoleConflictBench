She was in tears, her voice trembling as she talked about her final exam later that morning. She needed me, she said, just to sit with her, to help her calm down. I could hear the panic in her words, and I knew how much she counted on me during moments like this. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. I was already running late for the job site. As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t afford to be careless; being late meant rushing, and rushing meant risking safety\u2014mine and everyone else\u2019s. The foreman had made it clear: safety protocols were non-negotiable, and punctuality was part of that. My mind raced, torn between the urge to comfort my sister and the responsibility to my crew. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
