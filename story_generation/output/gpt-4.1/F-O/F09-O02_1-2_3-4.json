My son, Ethan, was slouched in his chair, poking at his food, ignoring my gentle reminders about table manners. I knew I should put the computer away, look him in the eye, and patiently guide him\u2014teach him why respect and discipline matter. That\u2019s what a good mother does, I reminded myself, feeling the weight of that expectation.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again: a message from my manager. The new safety standard for our project had just been released, and I was responsible for ensuring our design met every requirement. The deadline was tight, and I needed to review the documentation, gather evidence, and prepare a compliance report. If I missed something, the whole release could be delayed, and the team was counting on me.\n\nEthan dropped his fork, and I heard it clatter to the floor. He looked at me, waiting for my reaction. My heart twisted as I glanced between his expectant face and the urgent email notification flashing on my screen. I felt torn, pulled by the demands of being both a present mother and a responsible engineer, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
