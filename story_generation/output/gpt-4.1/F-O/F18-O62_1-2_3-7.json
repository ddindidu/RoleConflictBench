My little sister nudged me, her eyes bright, asking if I\u2019d join them for a hike on Saturday. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to all of them\u2014that I be there, not just in body but in spirit, laughing and sharing stories. Just as I was about to promise I\u2019d come, a sharp splash caught my attention. Across the pool, a group of teenagers were daring each other to dive right beneath the bold, red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My training kicked in; I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the risk. But my family\u2019s expectant faces were turned toward me, waiting for my answer, wanting me to be present with them. My heart pounded as I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
