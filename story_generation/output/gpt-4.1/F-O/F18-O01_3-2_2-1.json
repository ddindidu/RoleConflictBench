The structural calculations didn\u2019t add up\u2014if we didn\u2019t address the load-bearing wall, the entire project could be at risk. My phone buzzed, and I saw my sister\u2019s name. She\u2019d just gotten the news about her diagnosis, and her voice trembled as she asked if I could come over. I could hear the pain in her words, the way she tried to hold herself together. I knew she needed me, needed her sibling to listen, to comfort, to just be there. But the contractor was waiting for my sign-off, and if I didn\u2019t flag the issue now, construction might continue, putting lives at risk. My mind raced between the urgent responsibility to ensure safety and the equally urgent pull to support my sister. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I stared at the phone, then at the plans, my heart pounding, torn between the person I love and the duty I cannot abandon."}
