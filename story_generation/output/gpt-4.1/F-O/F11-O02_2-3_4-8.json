Mom had sent another reminder about tonight\u2019s dinner\u2014Dad\u2019s birthday, everyone was expected. I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, \u201cIt means a lot to your father.\u201d I wanted to be there, to laugh with my siblings, to see Dad\u2019s smile when we brought out the cake. But my laptop screen glared back at me, the project timeline blinking in my calendar. My manager\u2019s email was marked urgent: \u201cWe need your estimates before the client call tomorrow. The contract depends on it.\u201d I knew the team was waiting on me, and any delay could cost us the deal. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of home and the weight of responsibility at work. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s expectation for togetherness, my team\u2019s need for my expertise. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present in both worlds at once."}
