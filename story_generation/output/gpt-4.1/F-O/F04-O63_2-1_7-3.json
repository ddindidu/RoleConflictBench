My sales numbers were soaring this week\u2014if I kept up the pace, I\u2019d finally get that bonus. Management\u2019s emails buzzed in my head: \u201cPush harder, don\u2019t let up.\u201d But the next name on my list made my stomach twist. It was my younger brother, Sam. He\u2019d just started his own business, and I knew he was struggling. I could almost hear his voice, tired but hopeful, from our last conversation. I was supposed to be the patient, understanding brother, the one who listened and respected his choices, not someone who pressured him for a sale. But the script was right there in front of me, and the expectation to close every possible deal pressed down on me. I wanted to help him, to be the brother he needed, but the thought of missing my target and letting my team down gnawed at me. My finger trembled, caught between dialing and deleting his number, my mind torn by the demands of both worlds."}
