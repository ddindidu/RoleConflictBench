The ER was tense tonight, and the man in front of me was burning with fever, his infection spreading faster than I\u2019d seen in months. I knew I had to act quickly, prescribe the right antibiotics, and monitor his response. But the message on my phone was from my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was lighting up with her excitement. I could almost hear her voice, eager for my reply, wanting to share her first-day stories with her grandmother. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to be present for my family, to celebrate milestones and offer encouragement, and the urgent responsibility to save a life in the ER. My heart ached with the pull in both directions, knowing that whichever role I chose in this moment, I would be letting someone down."}
