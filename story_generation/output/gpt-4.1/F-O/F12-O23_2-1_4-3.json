But now, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014court in two hours. It was a minor hearing, one I could postpone without much trouble, but my client was anxious, calling me twice already this morning. I could hear my husband in the kitchen, humming as he packed lunches, trusting that I\u2019d keep my word. My client, meanwhile, was counting on me to show up, to be the steady hand guiding her through the legal maze. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, the pull of home and the call of duty. My hands hovered over the laundry, my mind already rehearsing what I\u2019d say to the judge\u2014or to my husband\u2014depending on which role I chose to honor today."}
