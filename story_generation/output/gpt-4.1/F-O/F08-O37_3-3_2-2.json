It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be struggling. I glanced at the clock\u2014my supervisor expected every room spotless by noon, and I was already behind. The kitchen still needed mopping, and the living room windows were streaked with fingerprints. But the thought of my granddaughter waiting, needing my guidance, pulled at me. I could picture her sitting alone, hoping for comfort and wisdom only I could give. Yet, the pressure to finish my cleaning duties weighed just as heavily. If I stopped now, I\u2019d risk disappointing my employer and possibly losing hours. My hands trembled, torn between the urge to drop everything for my family and the responsibility to do my job well. The mop handle felt heavy in my grip as I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
