My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his favorite shirt clean for an important meeting tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform was buried somewhere in the pile. I knew I should start a load now, so everything would be ready for the evening. But my phone buzzed with a new delivery assignment\u2014an urgent package that had to be dropped off within the hour. The address was across town, and the customer had left strict instructions: the package must be placed out of sight and a photo sent as proof. If I delayed, I risked a complaint or even losing my rating. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family counting on me at home, my job demanding my attention on the road. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, laundry detergent in the other, torn between the expectations of being a reliable wife and a responsible delivery person."}
