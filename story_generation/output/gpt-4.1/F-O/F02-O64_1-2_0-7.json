I could picture my kids, backpacks slung over their shoulders, scanning the crowd of parents outside the school gates. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, the last day before summer break. But here I was, stuck behind the counter, the lunch rush in full swing. The line snaked past the candy racks, and Mrs. Patel was telling me about her grandson\u2019s graduation. I smiled, nodded, scanned her groceries, all the while glancing at the clock. My manager expected me to keep the line moving, to be cheerful and patient, but my mind was already at the school, imagining my children\u2019s faces falling as they waited. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, the weight of two worlds pressing down on me. I wanted to be the reliable father, the friendly cashier, but right now, I didn\u2019t know how to be both."}
