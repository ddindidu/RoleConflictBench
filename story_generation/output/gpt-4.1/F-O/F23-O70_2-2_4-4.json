He darted between aisles, laughing, ignoring my calls to slow down. I knew I should step in, teach him about respect for public spaces and discipline, but my phone buzzed\u2014a notification from work. A customer was waiting for a moderately valuable package, and I needed to get their signature within the next fifteen minutes or risk a complaint. My mind raced. If I left my stepson\u2019s behavior unchecked, I\u2019d be failing as a step-parent, not living up to the expectations my partner and I had set. But if I didn\u2019t secure the delivery, I\u2019d be letting down my employer and possibly losing future shifts. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own consequences. My heart pounded as I looked from my stepson to my phone, torn between teaching him the right thing and fulfilling my job\u2019s requirements."}
