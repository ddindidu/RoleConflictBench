My numbers glowed green\u2014on track to crush this week\u2019s quota. Management\u2019s emails buzzed in my mind: \u201cKeep up the momentum! Every call counts!\u201d But across from me, my partner\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed, hands wrapped around a mug that had long gone cold. They\u2019d just told me about the impossible choice their boss had dumped on them\u2014take on a risky project or risk being sidelined. They needed me, not as a telemarketer, but as their spouse, someone to listen, to reassure, to help them sort through the mess.\n\nBut my phone kept vibrating with reminders\u2014lunch hour was prime calling time. If I stepped away now, I\u2019d lose my rhythm, maybe miss a big sale. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my partner down when they needed me most. My heart pounded as I looked between the blinking cursor on my screen and the person I loved, torn between the demands of my job and the promise I\u2019d made to always be there for them."}
