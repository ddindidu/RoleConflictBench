My heart sank as I read that my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in and discuss the situation immediately. My mind raced with worry and guilt\u2014how could my child do such a thing? I knew I needed to be there for him, to show the school I took this seriously, and to help him understand the consequences of his actions.\n\nAt the same time, my work phone rang. A customer was upset about a delayed package and demanded an update. I could hear the frustration in their voice, and I knew I was expected to remain calm, polite, and professional, even as my thoughts were consumed by my son\u2019s trouble at school. My hands shook as I tried to reassure the customer, but my mind kept drifting back to my child, wondering what I should do next. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, unable to give either role the attention it deserved."}
