My spouse was bustling around, making lists and barking out reminders\u2014relatives would arrive in a few hours, and every corner of the house needed to be spotless. I\u2019d promised to help, to share the load, and I could see the expectation in their eyes every time they passed by. But my phone kept pulling me back. A client had just sent over a contract for review. It wasn\u2019t urgent, not due for weeks, but the lawyer in me itched to get started, to stay ahead and keep my reputation for promptness. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my spouse needed my hands and attention here, now, while my professional self whispered that I should seize this quiet moment to work. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the clatter of dishes and the silent call of my inbox, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they wanted at the same time."}
