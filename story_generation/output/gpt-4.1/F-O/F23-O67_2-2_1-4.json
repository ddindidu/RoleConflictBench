Today was the open class at Lily\u2019s school\u2014the first one since I became her step-parent. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, asking if I\u2019d be there, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I promised I would. But just as I was about to leave for the school, the radio crackled: a woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, pain severe. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. Protocol was clear\u2014respond immediately, provide care, stabilize, and transport. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. Lily\u2019s hopeful face flashed before me, her need for me to show up, to prove I cared. But the patient needed me too, someone in pain, relying on my skills and quick response. I felt torn, the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart, each demanding I put them first. My heart pounded as I sat in the ambulance, caught between the siren\u2019s call and the promise I\u2019d made."}
