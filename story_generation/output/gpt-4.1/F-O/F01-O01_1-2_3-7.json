My grandson had called me yesterday, his voice bubbling with excitement about showing me his new train set. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture his hopeful eyes searching for me in the crowd. But as I sat at my desk, blueprints spread out before me, my phone buzzed again.

My mind raced with the weight of both worlds\u2014my family expecting my presence, my team relying on my leadership.
