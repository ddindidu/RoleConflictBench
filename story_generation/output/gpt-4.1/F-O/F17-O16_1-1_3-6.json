The diagnosis was clear\u2014strep throat. As I reached for my prescription pad, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. Grandma expects you to lead the prayer and help with the traditional dishes.\u201d My mind split in two. As a doctor, I knew antibiotics were necessary, but Mrs. Lee hesitated, mentioning her family\u2019s belief in herbal remedies and how, in her culture, antibiotics were seen as too strong for children. I remembered my own family\u2019s expectations\u2014never question tradition, always respect elders\u2019 wisdom. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to provide evidence-based care, and the pull to honor family values and cultural beliefs. My heart pounded as I looked at Mrs. Lee, torn between my professional responsibility and the echoes of my own upbringing."}
