My children would be finishing school soon, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like I always was. It was important to them, and to me\u2014I never wanted them to feel forgotten or left behind. But just as I was about to grab my keys, the door chimed and in swept the bride-to-be and her entourage, all nerves and excitement, arriving earlier than expected. Their anxious eyes landed on me, silently pleading for reassurance and a calming presence. As a hairdresser, I knew how much this day meant to them, how much they needed me to be attentive, welcoming, and focused. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my children waiting, trusting I\u2019d be there, and these clients, hoping I\u2019d help make their day perfect. My mind raced, torn between the two, feeling the sting of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
