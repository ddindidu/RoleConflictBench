Can you come home early? The living room still needs vacuuming, and I can\u2019t do it all myself.\u201d I glanced at the clock, guilt gnawing at me. I knew how important this visit was, how much my partner counted on me to share the load, especially today. But as I looked out over the crowded beach, the whistle around my neck felt heavier than ever. The tide was high, the waves rough, and the sand was packed with families and children. Every few seconds, I scanned the water, knowing that even a brief distraction could mean disaster. My spouse\u2019s words echoed in my mind, clashing with the unspoken responsibility I felt for every swimmer out there. I wanted to be the reliable partner at home, but I was also the only lifeguard on duty. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the demands of love and duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
