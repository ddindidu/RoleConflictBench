My phone buzzed with a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss it. My heart clenched\u2014he\u2019d never done anything like this before. I knew I needed to be there for him, to show him that I cared and help him understand the seriousness of his actions. But I glanced at the break log on my monitor. Management had sent out another warning this morning\u2014no unscheduled breaks, every minute accounted for, the queue was overflowing. If I left now, I\u2019d be flagged, maybe even written up. My supervisor\u2019s desk was just a few feet away, eyes always scanning. I felt torn in two, the weight of my son\u2019s mistake and my responsibility as a father pressing against the rigid expectations of my job. My finger hovered over the \u201clog out\u201d button, my mind racing, caught between the needs of my child and the demands of my work."}
