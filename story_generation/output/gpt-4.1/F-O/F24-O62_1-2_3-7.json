My stepsister nudged me, her eyes bright, clearly hoping I\u2019d back her up on the water park plan. I knew Mom wanted us all to chime in, to feel like a real family, so I tried to sound enthusiastic, even though my mind kept drifting to my lifeguard shift later that day.\n\nAt the pool, the air was thick with chlorine and laughter. I scanned the water, my whistle ready. Suddenly, I spotted a group of teenagers\u2014my stepsister among them\u2014gathered at the deep end, giggling as they lined up near the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cNo exceptions. Safety first.\u201d But my stepsister caught my eye, grinning, clearly expecting me to let it slide, just this once, in front of her new friends. My heart pounded as I weighed the rules I was sworn to uphold against the fragile trust I was still building at home."}
