It was my younger brother, his name lighting up the screen. We hadn\u2019t spoken since our argument last week, and I knew I should answer, try to clear the air, build back the respect we\u2019d always had. But just as I reached for the phone, a customer walked in, holding a splintered wooden train. Her little boy clung to her leg, eyes wide with hope. She asked if I could fix it and how much it would cost. I could see the worry in her face\u2014she needed an answer now. My phone kept vibrating, my brother\u2019s call insistent. I felt torn, the weight of my sisterly duty pressing against the immediate demands of my work. Should I step outside to talk to my brother, risking the customer\u2019s patience and maybe her trust? Or should I focus on the repair, putting my family on hold yet again? My heart pounded as I stood between the ringing phone and the broken toy, caught in the pull of both worlds."}
