It won\u2019t be the same if you\u2019re not here.\u201d My heart squeezed. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for the holiday dinner, the one time a year our whole family gathered. But as I sat behind the wheel of the ambulance, the radio crackled with instructions\u2014move the vehicle to the satellite station for the shift change, no delays, drive carefully. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always. No exceptions.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me.
