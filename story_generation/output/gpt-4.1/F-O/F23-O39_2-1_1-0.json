I knew how important it was for Jamie, too\u2014he\u2019d been talking about it all week, hoping I\u2019d show up like the other parents. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my supervisor\u2019s voice cut through the clatter of the construction site. \u201cHey, I need you to move those bricks to the back lot before you clock out. We\u2019re clearing space for the new delivery.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight settle in my chest. The pile was huge, and moving it would take hours\u2014if I started now, I\u2019d barely make a dent before the school event. If I left early, I\u2019d let the crew down and risk my supervisor\u2019s anger. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss Jamie\u2019s big moment, and I could already picture his disappointed face. My hands tightened around the handle of the wheelbarrow, torn between the demands of the site and the hope in my stepson\u2019s eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
