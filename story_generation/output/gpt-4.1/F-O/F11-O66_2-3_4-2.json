My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014another message from my brother, reminding me not to be late for Mom\u2019s birthday dinner. I could almost hear his voice, \u201cYou promised you\u2019d be there this time.\u201d I wanted to be. I wanted to sit at the table, laugh, and watch Mom blow out her candles. But in the back seat, my passenger was checking his watch every few seconds, anxiety etched across his face. He had a flight to catch, and the airport was still miles away, traffic crawling at a snail\u2019s pace. As a taxi driver, I was supposed to get him there safely and on time, no matter the weather. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, heart pounding with the weight of both promises. I could feel the pull from both sides\u2014my family waiting, my passenger depending on me. The clock ticked on, and I was caught in the middle, torn between being the sister they needed and the driver he counted on."}
