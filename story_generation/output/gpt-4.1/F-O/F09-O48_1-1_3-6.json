My son sat at the table, fidgeting with his spoon, refusing to say \u201cplease\u201d when he asked for more cereal. I knew I needed to be patient, to guide him gently, to teach him the importance of kindness and respect. But my phone buzzed on the counter\u2014a message from the hospital. Mrs. Evans, my favorite patient, was having a rough morning and needed someone to talk to. I could picture her sitting by the window, waiting for a friendly face, someone to listen and offer comfort. My heart tugged in two directions. My son\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for approval, while my mind raced with worry for Mrs. Evans. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, each expecting my full attention, my care, my presence. I stood there, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
