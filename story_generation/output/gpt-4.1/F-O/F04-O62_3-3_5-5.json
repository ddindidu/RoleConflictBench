It\u2019s the first time in years we\u2019ll all be together for the holiday.\u201d I could almost see my family gathered around the table, laughter and warmth filling the house. As a brother, I knew how much this meant to them\u2014and to me. But as I walked through the pool area at work, the sharp smell of chlorine hit me, and I noticed the filtration system\u2019s warning light blinking red. The manual was clear: any malfunction had to be addressed immediately, or the pool would be unsafe. My supervisor\u2019s words rang in my head: \u201cSafety comes first. Always.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me to be present, to share in our traditions, and my duty as a lifeguard demanding I stay and fix the problem before anyone got hurt. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and the exit, torn by the impossible choice."}
