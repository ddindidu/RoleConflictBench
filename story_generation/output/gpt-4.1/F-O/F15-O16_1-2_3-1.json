I knew I should be patient, guiding her gently to understand the importance of healthy habits and respect at the dinner table. She needed my attention, my calm explanations, my example. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the hospital. A patient I\u2019d seen earlier was deteriorating, their symptoms a confusing mix that didn\u2019t fit any textbook diagnosis. The team needed my input, my expertise, my focus. My daughter\u2019s eyes flicked up to mine, searching for approval or correction, while my mind raced through possible diagnoses and test results. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectation to nurture and teach at home, and the demand to solve a medical mystery at work. My heart ached with the knowledge that, in this moment, I could not fully be both the parent my child deserved and the doctor my patient needed."}
