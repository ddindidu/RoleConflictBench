She didn\u2019t ask for much\u2014just a listening ear, maybe a hug, someone to tell her it would be okay. I wanted to be that person, to sit beside her and let her know I cared. But my phone buzzed again, the app flashing a new message: my passenger was waiting, growing impatient, asking if I was close. I could almost feel their urgency through the screen, the expectation that I\u2019d be there on time, professional and reliable. My wife looked at me, searching for comfort, while my phone vibrated insistently in my hand. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I wanted to be a good husband, but I also needed to be a dependable driver. My heart raced as I stood there, caught between the warmth of home and the demands of the road, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
