He rarely reached out like this, and his words were urgent: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask unless it was serious. As a grandfather, I felt the weight of his trust, the expectation to listen, to guide, to be present for him in a way only I could. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for my passenger in the back seat, a young woman quietly scrolling through her phone, trusting me to get her to her destination safely. The roads were clear, the speed limits normal, and I knew I couldn\u2019t risk distraction. My mind raced\u2014should I pull over and call my grandson, risking a delay for my passenger? Or should I keep driving, fulfilling my duty as a professional, while my grandson waited, possibly feeling alone? The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the needs of my family and the responsibility to a stranger."}
