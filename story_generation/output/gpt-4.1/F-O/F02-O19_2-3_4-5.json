As I scanned the shelves for cereal, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the pharmacy. A patient had just arrived, needing immediate counseling about a new combination of high-risk medications. My mind raced: I knew how critical it was to prevent dangerous drug interactions, and my team was counting on me to provide thorough, careful advice.\n\nAt that moment, I heard laughter and the sound of running feet. My son was darting between aisles, weaving around other shoppers. I felt the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why his behavior wasn\u2019t acceptable. But the pharmacy needed me now, and the patient\u2019s safety was at stake. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the father my son needed and the pharmacist my patient depended on, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
