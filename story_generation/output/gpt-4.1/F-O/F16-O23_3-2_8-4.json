My client\u2019s case hinged on my preparation tonight; they were counting on me to be sharp, thorough, and ready to fight for them. But across from me, my spouse waited, eyes searching mine, the air heavy with the weight of our unfinished conversation. We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about the choices we had to make together. They expected honesty, patience, and my full attention\u2014qualities I prided myself on, but tonight, I felt stretched thin. My mind kept drifting to legal arguments and evidence, while my heart ached to be present for the person I loved. I could see the disappointment flicker in their eyes each time I glanced at my phone. I wanted to be the partner who listened, who shared every worry and hope, but I was also the lawyer who couldn\u2019t let a client down. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
