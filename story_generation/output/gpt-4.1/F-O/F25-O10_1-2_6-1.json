My manager had reminded me twice already that accuracy was crucial\u2014no mistakes, no delays. The numbers blurred together, but I forced myself to focus, knowing how much depended on getting this right. Just as I was double-checking the final entries, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my stepdad: \u201cCan you talk? Your mom\u2019s been quiet all day.\u201d I knew what he wanted\u2014someone to listen, to ask if everything was okay, to be the emotional glue holding our patchwork family together. Guilt twisted in my stomach. I wanted to be there for them, to show I cared, but the weight of unfinished work pressed down on me. If I stopped now, I might miss something important in the records. If I ignored the message, I\u2019d be letting my family down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the numbers on the screen and the people waiting for me at home, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
