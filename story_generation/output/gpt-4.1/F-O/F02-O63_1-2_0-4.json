My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week, or we\u2019ll have to talk.\u201d I stared at the list of leads, my headset pressing into my ear, sweat prickling my neck. At the same time, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my kids would be finishing school in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like I promised last week and the week before. I pictured their faces scanning the crowd, searching for me. My heart twisted. If I left now, I\u2019d let my team down and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to my kids again. The pressure from both sides squeezed me, and I sat frozen, headset in hand, torn between the demands of being a good father and a reliable employee, not knowing which role to let down."}
