Let us know how you\u2019re doing!\u201d I know he and Mom expect me to check in, to keep the connection alive, especially since I moved out. I start typing a reply, but before I can finish, my work phone rings. The plant manager\u2019s voice is tense\u2014one of the old packaging machines is acting up, and no one else is around to look at it. I\u2019m the only one on call, even though it\u2019s supposed to be a quiet weekend. I glance at my half-written text, feeling the weight of both worlds. My parents want to hear from me, to know I\u2019m okay, but the machine could halt production if I don\u2019t get there soon. My mind races, torn between the warmth of family and the cold urgency of malfunctioning gears, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
