My daughter calls, her voice bright, reminding me that everyone expects me to share stories and laughter, to be present as the grandfather who knits the family together. I nod, promising to be there, to listen to my grandson\u2019s tales and my granddaughter\u2019s piano piece. Yet, as I hang up, my eyes drift to the thick law review journal on my desk. The latest issue has just arrived, brimming with articles on new legal theories\u2014developments I cannot afford to ignore as a judge. The court expects me to be sharp, current, and prepared for the cases that will soon land on my docket. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth of family, the gravity of the law. My heart aches with the desire to be fully present in both roles, but the hours in the day are finite. I sit in my study, torn, the laughter of my family echoing from the living room while the silent pages of the journal beckon from my desk."}
