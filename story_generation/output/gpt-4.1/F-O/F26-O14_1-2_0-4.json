She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready to move out on your own?\u201d My heart swelled with the urge to share stories, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades. But as she spoke, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the departmental meeting in an hour. I still hadn\u2019t finished summarizing the preliminary data, and my team was counting on me to present our findings clearly and accurately. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be present and wise for my granddaughter, and the professional demand to be precise and prepared for my colleagues. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the rigor of science, knowing that whichever path I chose in the next few moments would leave something important behind."}
