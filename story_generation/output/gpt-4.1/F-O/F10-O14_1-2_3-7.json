Grandpa will be so happy to see you.\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. Every year, I\u2019m expected to help prepare the traditional dishes, set the table, and join in the rituals that mean so much to my family. But as I glanced at the lab schedule pinned above my desk, anxiety prickled at my skin. The safety audit was in two days, and I\u2019d already been warned about the faulty centrifuge and the cluttered chemical storage. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to fix these issues and ensure everything was perfect. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any mistakes.\u201d I felt torn, pulled between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the cold, pressing demands of my professional duty.
