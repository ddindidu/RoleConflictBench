My mother looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us this time, right?\u201d I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the pharmacy. I had a patient waiting, someone with a complicated prescription, a delicate balance of medications that couldn\u2019t be rushed. My mind raced with the responsibility; one mistake could mean real harm. My family\u2019s voices faded into the background as I pictured the patient\u2019s chart, the long list of medications, the trust they placed in me. I wanted to be present, to share in the laughter and plans, but the weight of my duty as a pharmacist pressed on me. I felt torn, caught between the comfort of family and the gravity of my professional promise. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me at the same time."}
