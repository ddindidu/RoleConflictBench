The workshop on updated prescription guidelines was about to start in fifteen minutes, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss it\u2014my patients depended on my knowledge, and my boss expected me to stay sharp. But here I was, in the supermarket, with my stepson darting between aisles, giggling as he knocked over a display of cereal boxes. Other shoppers stared, some with annoyance, others with judgment. I knew I should step in, teach him about respect and discipline, show him that actions have consequences. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does, right? But every minute I spent here meant I\u2019d be late for the workshop, maybe miss crucial information that could affect my work as a pharmacist. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cWorkshop starts in 10 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the responsible parent he needs, or the diligent professional my patients rely on.
