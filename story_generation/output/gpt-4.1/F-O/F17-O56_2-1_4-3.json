She was one of my favorite clients, always cheerful and never demanding. Today, she asked for a small change to her fringe\u2014just a little shorter, she said, nothing drastic. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. My family had been talking nonstop about tradition lately, especially about how we should never cut hair on certain days, believing it brings bad luck. Today was one of those days. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my head, reminding me of the importance of respecting our customs, of not letting our ancestors down. But here I was, expected to be the professional hairdresser, to make sure Mrs. Lee left happy and satisfied. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, my hands trembling slightly as I tried to decide what to do. The expectations of my family and my client clashed inside me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself I should honor."}
