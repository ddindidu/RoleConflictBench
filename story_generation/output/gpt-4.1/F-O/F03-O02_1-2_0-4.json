Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014almost 3 p.m.\u2014and realize I haven\u2019t called home in over a week. Guilt prickles at me. I know how much it means to my parents to hear from me, especially since I moved out for this engineering job. I start typing a reply, but my laptop pings with a new email from my manager: \u201cReminder: We need documentation for the new safety standard before Monday\u2019s release.\u201d My stomach tightens. The updated regulations are strict, and I\u2019m responsible for making sure our product meets every requirement. If I miss something, the whole project could be delayed\u2014or worse, unsafe. I stare at my phone, then at the stack of technical documents on my desk. My parents expect me to be present, to show I care. My team expects me to be thorough, to not let anything slip. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down, and I can\u2019t ignore either."}
