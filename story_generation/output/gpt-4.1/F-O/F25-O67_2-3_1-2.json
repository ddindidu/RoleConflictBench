He always waited for my call, eager to hear about my week, and I knew how much it meant to him. I\u2019d promised to keep in touch, especially after Mom passed, and I could hear his voice in my head, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, okay?\u201d But as I reached for the phone, the radio crackled with urgency: \u201cAll units, multi-vehicle collision, Highway 17, possible fatalities. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. Every second counted for those people on the highway, but I also pictured my stepdad waiting by the phone, hoping for a sign that I hadn\u2019t forgotten him. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I stared at the phone, torn between the call I needed to make and the call I needed to answer, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
