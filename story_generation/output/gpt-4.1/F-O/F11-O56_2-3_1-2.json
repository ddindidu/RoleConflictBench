It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d My heart squeezed. He never asked for help unless it was serious. But just as I was about to step outside, the front door chimed. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids bustled in, faces tense, glancing at their watches. My manager shot me a look\u2014this was the biggest booking of the month, and I was expected to greet them, offer tea, and set everyone at ease. I could see the bride\u2019s hands trembling, her mother\u2019s anxious eyes darting around the salon. I knew I was supposed to be the calm, welcoming professional, but my mind was with my brother, wondering what he needed, if he was okay. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family needing my support, my clients needing my attention. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the sister my brother counted on and the hairdresser my clients expected."}
