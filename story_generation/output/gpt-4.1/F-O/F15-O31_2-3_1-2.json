My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in ten minutes. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there in the front row. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. I could already picture her scanning the crowd, searching for my face.\n\nBut then the radio crackled, sharp and urgent. \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and Fifth. Suspects armed, shots fired.\u201d My training kicked in, adrenaline surging. I knew the area\u2014families, shopkeepers, people I\u2019d sworn to protect. Every second counted. I was closest. I was needed.\n\nI gripped the steering wheel, torn in two. My duty as a police officer demanded I respond, to put myself in harm\u2019s way for strangers. My duty as a parent begged me to be present for my child, to keep a promise that mattered more than anything to her. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and for a moment, I couldn\u2019t move, caught between the siren\u2019s call and my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes."}
