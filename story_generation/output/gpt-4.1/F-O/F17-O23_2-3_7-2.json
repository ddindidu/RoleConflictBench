My phone buzzed with reminders from the office\u2014everyone was waiting for my analysis. The clauses in this contract were tricky, and if I didn\u2019t catch every detail, my client could be in real trouble. But as I tried to focus, I heard my parents\u2019 voices in the living room, quieter than usual. Lately, they\u2019d seemed so tired, their faces drawn with worry lines I hadn\u2019t noticed before. I knew they needed me, not just as their child, but as someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. My heart ached with guilt.
