It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart tightened. He never reached out unless it was serious. As his sister, I knew he expected me to drop everything and be there, to listen and support him like I always promised. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to finish the inventory before the supervisor\u2019s afternoon check. Supplies had been running low lately, and I\u2019d already been warned about missing items. I stared at the half-empty shelves, feeling the pressure of my job\u2019s demands, then at my phone, feeling the weight of my brother\u2019s need. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my work. I could almost hear both voices in my head, each pleading for my attention, and I stood frozen, unable to move, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds."}
