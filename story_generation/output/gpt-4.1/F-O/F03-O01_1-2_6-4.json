My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The deadline for the floor plan was tomorrow, and I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to fit the break room without sacrificing workspace. My mind raced with measurements and layouts, but guilt crept in. I hadn\u2019t checked in with my parents all week. They relied on me to notice when something was off, to ask if everything was okay at home. But right now, my clients expected a flawless design, one that balanced function and comfort for dozens of employees. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my parents needed my attention, my project demanded my focus. My heart ached with worry for them, but my mind spun with architectural details. I stared at my phone, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
