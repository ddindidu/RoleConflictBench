My husband had texted, reminding me that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I could almost hear his voice, gentle but firm, asking if I\u2019d have time to finish the laundry before dinner. I wanted to be there, to help, to keep our home running smoothly. But just as I reached for the detergent, my work phone rang. It was the charge nurse\u2014one of my patients, Mrs. Evans, was showing slightly elevated vital signs after her procedure. I was expected to come in, check her temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record everything immediately. My mind raced, torn between the pile of laundry and the urgent call from the hospital. Both needed me, both expected me to be present and responsible. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between my family\u2019s needs and my patient\u2019s care."}
