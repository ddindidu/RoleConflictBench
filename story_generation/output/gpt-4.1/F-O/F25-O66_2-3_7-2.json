My passenger kept glancing at his watch, his voice tight as he reminded me, again, that his flight was international and he couldn\u2019t miss it. I gripped the wheel, trying to focus on the slick road, but my phone buzzed in the cupholder. A message from my stepdad: \u201cCan you come home soon? Your mom\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I pictured her pale face, the way she\u2019d barely touched her dinner last night, and the exhaustion in my stepdad\u2019s voice. I knew they needed me, needed someone to listen, to help. But the man in my backseat was counting on me too, his whole trip depending on my ability to get him to the airport safely and on time. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the demands\u2014my family\u2019s need for comfort, my duty to my passenger, and the treacherous road ahead. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as the snow kept falling."}
