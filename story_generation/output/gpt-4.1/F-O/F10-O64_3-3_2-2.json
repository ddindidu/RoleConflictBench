I knew it was Mom\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to hear about my day and make sure I was okay. We had this unspoken rule: I\u2019d reply quickly, tell her about work, and reassure her that everything was fine. But tonight, the register was off by a few dollars, and my manager hovered nearby, watching me recount every bill and receipt. My hands shook as I tried to focus, but the phone kept vibrating, each buzz a reminder of my promise to Mom. I could almost hear her voice in my head, worried if I didn\u2019t answer soon. I felt torn\u2014if I stopped to text her, I might make another mistake with the money, but if I ignored her, she\u2019d worry all night. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood there, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible cashier, not sure which role to answer first."}
