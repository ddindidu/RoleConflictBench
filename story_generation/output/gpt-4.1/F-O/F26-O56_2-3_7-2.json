She\u2019d just started her new job, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, celebrated, and offered encouragement. I wanted to call her right away, to hear her voice and share in her excitement, just as a good grandparent should. But as I tucked my phone away, the salon door swung open. The bride-to-be and her friends bustled in, faces tense, eyes darting to the clock. They were early, and the pressure of the wedding schedule was already in the air. As their hairdresser, I was expected to greet them warmly, put them at ease, and set the tone for a joyful morning. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my attention and love, and toward my clients, who needed my calm and focus. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each deserving my best. My hands hovered over my phone, my heart caught between the worlds I cared for most."}
