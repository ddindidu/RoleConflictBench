My partner had mentioned this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for their activities tomorrow, and I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done tonight. As I loaded the washing machine, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from one of my housekeeping clients. She\u2019d noticed the floor cleaner was almost gone and wanted to make sure I\u2019d bring more for the next visit. I mentally scanned my schedule, realizing I\u2019d need to pick up supplies before my shift, but that meant leaving home earlier than usual. If I did that, I might not finish the laundry in time, and my family would be left scrambling for clean clothes. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: be a reliable spouse, keep the household running smoothly, and also be the dependable cleaner my client counted on. Both roles demanded my attention, and I felt pulled in two directions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
