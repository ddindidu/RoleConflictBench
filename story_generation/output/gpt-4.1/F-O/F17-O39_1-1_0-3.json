It\u2019s Saturday, and I know she expects a quick text\u2014just a \u201cHi, I\u2019m okay\u201d to ease her worries. But I\u2019m standing in the middle of the construction site, dust swirling around my boots, the foreman\u2019s voice barking orders to get the area swept before we clock out. My broom is heavy in my hands, and I can see the piles of debris that need clearing. Safety is drilled into us\u2014leave a mess, and someone could get hurt.
