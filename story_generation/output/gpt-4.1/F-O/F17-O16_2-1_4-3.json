As a doctor, I knew I needed to explain everything clearly, to be patient and empathetic, to answer every question with care. But my mind kept drifting to my family\u2019s words from last night\u2014how they reminded me, yet again, that upholding our traditions was not just important, but essential. They wanted me home early for the family dinner, to help prepare the ancestral dishes, to show respect for our customs. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, telling me that family comes first. Yet here I was, in my white coat, feeling the weight of my patient\u2019s trust and the responsibility to give her my full attention. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my sister, asking if I\u2019d be home on time. My heart twisted as I tried to focus on Mrs. Kim\u2019s questions, torn between the expectations of my family and the needs of my patient, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
