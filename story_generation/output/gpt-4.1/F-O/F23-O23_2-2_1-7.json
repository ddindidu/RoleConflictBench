She\u2019d asked me twice this week if I\u2019d be there, her hopeful eyes making it clear how much it meant. I promised I\u2019d try, knowing how important it is to show up for her, to prove I\u2019m invested in her life. But just as I was about to leave the office, my assistant knocked, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files. She said it would help her prepare the documents for tomorrow\u2019s meeting, but she wasn\u2019t assigned to this case, and the rules were clear\u2014no unauthorized access. I could see her frustration, and I knew denying her would slow down our work, maybe even make me look uncooperative. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my client and the promise to my stepdaughter. The clock ticked, each second tightening the knot in my stomach. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
