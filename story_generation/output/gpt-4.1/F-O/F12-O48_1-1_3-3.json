As a wife, I promised to share the chores, but lately, the laundry has become a silent mountain in our bedroom, waiting for me to find time to fold it. My husband\u2019s gentle reminders echo in my head, tinged with disappointment. \n\nBut here, in my scrubs, I\u2019m a nursing assistant. My morning rounds are about to start, and Mrs. Carter in room 204 is waiting for her vitals to be checked. The expectation is clear: I must be thorough, attentive, and on time. The pressure to be reliable at work is as heavy as the guilt I feel for neglecting things at home. \n\nAs I walk down the hallway, clipboard in hand, my heart pounds with the weight of both worlds. I wonder how I can be present for my patients and my husband when both need me at the same time. The demands pull me in opposite directions, and I feel myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
