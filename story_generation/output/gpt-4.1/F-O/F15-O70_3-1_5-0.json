My heart sank as I heard my son\u2019s name\u2014he\u2019d been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is never acceptable, no matter how small the item. But as a delivery person, I was already running behind. The next package was supposed to be at the customer\u2019s door by five, and I was cutting it close. If I stopped to handle this with my son, I\u2019d be late, risking a complaint or even my job. If I ignored the call, I\u2019d be failing him as a parent, missing a crucial moment to guide him. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stood there, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that needed me right now."}
