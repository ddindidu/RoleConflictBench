I smiled, heart swelling, knowing how much these moments meant to her\u2014and to me. Just as she began, my phone buzzed. The salon\u2019s receptionist was on the line. \u201cMrs. Lee just walked in,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s early and seems a bit anxious. Should I ask her to wait?\u201d Mrs. Lee was one of my regulars, always nervous before her appointments, and I prided myself on making clients feel at ease from the moment they arrived. I could picture her now, fidgeting in the waiting area, probably hoping for a friendly face and a warm greeting. My daughter\u2019s voice grew louder, eager for my attention, while the phone pressed against my ear, the salon\u2019s needs tugging at me. My heart raced as I stood between the kitchen and the hallway, torn by the pull of family and work, both expecting me to be fully present, both needing me right now."}
