My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d Guilt prickles at my skin\u2014I promised I\u2019d share the load, but my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s the plant again. The operator on shift keeps calling, confused about the new settings. Every time he guesses, the machine chews up more material, and the waste is adding up. My supervisor expects me to walk him through it, step by step, no matter the hour. I glance at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My partner expects me to be present, to pull my weight at home. My job expects me to be the expert, always available to prevent costly mistakes. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both sides are waiting for me to choose."}
