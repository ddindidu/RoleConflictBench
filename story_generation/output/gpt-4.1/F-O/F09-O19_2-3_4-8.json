My son darted away from me, weaving between displays, his laughter echoing down the aisle. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. I knew I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and explain why his behavior wasn\u2019t acceptable. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the national continuing education program was starting in ten minutes. Missing it would mean falling behind on the latest treatment protocols, something my patients and colleagues counted on me for. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the mother who must guide her child, the pharmacist who must stay sharp and informed. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the lesson my son needed and the professional responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
