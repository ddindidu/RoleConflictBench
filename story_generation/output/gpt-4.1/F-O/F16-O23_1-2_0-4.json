They nodded, giving me a tired smile, and started telling me about a frustrating meeting with their boss. I knew they needed me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe even just a hug and a few words of reassurance. But as they spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the contested motion was first thing in the morning, and my client\u2019s case depended on my focus tonight. I felt the pull in both directions\u2014my partner\u2019s need for support, my client\u2019s need for my undivided attention. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to be present, but my mind kept drifting to legal arguments and case law. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the spouse my partner deserved and the lawyer my client needed."}
