Can\u2019t wait to celebrate!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her first job, and the whole family was gathering to mark the occasion. As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me, and I wanted to show her the same support.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I saw the data from today\u2019s experiment still open on my computer. The results were fresh, and though the lab\u2019s routine logs could technically wait, I felt the weight of my responsibility as a scientist. Accurate, timely documentation was crucial, and I prided myself on never letting things slip, even when the schedule was flexible.\n\nI stared at the screen, then at my phone, feeling the tug from both sides.
