The first was a bright, cheerful notification: \u201cOpen Class \u2013 2:00 PM, Lily\u2019s School.\u201d The second, more formal, was a departmental meeting at 2:30 PM, where I was expected to present the preliminary data from my latest experiment. My heart squeezed as I pictured Lily\u2019s hopeful face, her excitement about showing me her classroom and the art she\u2019d made. I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, to sit among the other parents and beam with pride.\n\nBut the meeting was critical. My supervisor had emphasized the importance of accurate, timely reporting, and my colleagues were counting on my data to move the project forward. I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I failed to deliver. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me as I tried to figure out how to be both the parent Lily needed and the scientist my team relied on."}
