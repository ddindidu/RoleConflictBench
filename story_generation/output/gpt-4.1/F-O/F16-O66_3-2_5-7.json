My spouse had already started cleaning, her voice echoing from the kitchen, \u201cWe need to finish before your cousins arrive!\u201d I promised I\u2019d help with the vacuuming and the guest room, but my phone buzzed\u2014a ride request. Two travelers, heavy suitcases, and a long trip across town. They needed help loading, and I could hear the urgency in their voices when I called to confirm. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be reliable, professional, and never turn down a fare, especially when business is slow. But as a spouse, I\u2019m supposed to share the load, especially today, when the house must be spotless for our guests. My wife\u2019s eyes met mine, full of expectation and a hint of frustration. The travelers waited, their fare would help with bills, but my partner needed me here, now. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, vacuum in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me at the same time."}
