My headset feels heavier with every passing minute. The pressure from management is clear: hit the numbers or risk a stern warning, maybe worse. My fingers hover over the call list, but my phone buzzes with a message from my partner: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you.\u201d I know they\u2019re struggling with a tough decision at work, and I promised I\u2019d be there, to listen, to support, to be the spouse they can lean on. My heart aches, torn between the urgent need to make those last sales and the equally urgent need to be present for the person I love. I can almost hear my partner\u2019s voice, shaky and uncertain, needing comfort. At the same time, I can feel the weight of my manager\u2019s expectations, the unspoken threat of disappointment. My mind races, caught in the tug-of-war between being a supportive spouse and a successful telemarketer, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
