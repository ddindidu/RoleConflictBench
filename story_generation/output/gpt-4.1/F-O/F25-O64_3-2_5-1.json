The line stretched past the candy racks, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every time I hesitated. Each beep of the scanner reminded me to stay focused, to keep the line moving, to not make mistakes. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the family ceremony tonight. It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, heavy with expectation, reminding me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s traditions, to show I belonged. My stomach twisted. I wanted to make them proud, to prove I was part of the family, but I couldn\u2019t just leave the register. The customers grew impatient, sighing and tapping their feet, while my mind raced between the demands of my job and the weight of my family\u2019s hopes. I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know how I could possibly choose."}
