My family\u2019s holiday dinner was starting in less than an hour, and I was expected to be there on time, as always. My mother had called twice already, reminding me to bring the dessert and not to forget the toast Grandpa always made us recite. Just as I was about to lock up, Mrs. Carter stormed in, her voice echoing through the empty salon. She was furious about her haircut, demanding it be fixed immediately. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and I knew my job was to make sure she left happy, no matter how late it was. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my mom, asking where I was. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the daughter who never let her family down, and the hairdresser who never let a client leave unhappy. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to disappoint tonight."}
