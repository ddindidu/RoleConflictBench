He looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in his eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, setting my things down. He shrugged, \u201cJust the usual. My boss was in a mood, but it\u2019s nothing.\u201d I knew he wanted me to sit beside him, to listen, maybe offer a hug or a few words of comfort. That\u2019s what I always do\u2014be his sounding board, his safe place.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with an email notification. It was from a client, sending over a contract for a routine service engagement. It wasn\u2019t urgent, not due for weeks, but I felt the familiar tug\u2014the need to stay ahead, to be thorough, to prove my reliability as a lawyer. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, praising my diligence if I got it done early.\n\nI stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My husband\u2019s expectant eyes, the unopened email, and my own swirling thoughts collided. I wanted to be present for him, but the contract called to me, too. My heart raced as I tried to decide which part of me to honor first."}
