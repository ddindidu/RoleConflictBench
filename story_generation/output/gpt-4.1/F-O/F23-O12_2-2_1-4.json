My stepdaughter\u2019s open class was at 2 p.m.\u2014her first since I became part of her life. She\u2019d asked me twice this week if I\u2019d be there, her eyes hopeful, her voice uncertain. I knew how much it meant to her, to have someone in the audience, to feel seen and supported. But at the same time, my inbox was filling up with reminders from the product and QA teams. The design documents for the new feature were due by end of day, and everyone was waiting for my technical input to move forward. I could almost hear the tension in their Slack messages, the unspoken pressure to not be the bottleneck. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to a child who was learning to trust me, and the responsibility I owed to my colleagues who depended on my expertise. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in her eyes against the frustration of my team. I sat frozen at my desk, unable to choose, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
