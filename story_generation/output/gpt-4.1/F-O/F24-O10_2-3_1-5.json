My stepbrother trudged in, his backpack hanging off one shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, and he needed me. I was supposed to be the one he could talk to, the one who listened and helped him through these moments. But the tax notice glared at me from the table, a reminder that as an accountant, I couldn\u2019t afford to ignore it, not even for an hour. The deadline was tight, and any mistake could cost my client dearly. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urge to comfort my stepbrother and the professional duty demanding my immediate attention. My hands shook as I tried to decide which role to step into first, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
