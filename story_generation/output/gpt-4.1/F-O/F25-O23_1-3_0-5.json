My stepmother\u2019s message blinked up at me: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while. Hope you\u2019re okay. Call when you can.\u201d Guilt prickled at my chest. I knew she and Dad expected me to check in, especially on weekends, to keep the fragile peace we\u2019d built since I moved out. But my mind was already racing through the opening arguments I\u2019d deliver in court tomorrow. The trial was huge\u2014my client\u2019s future, my reputation, all on the line. There was no room for distraction, no time for family calls or emotional check-ins. Yet, I could almost hear my stepmother\u2019s voice, gentle but disappointed, if I let another weekend slip by in silence. I wanted to be the attentive stepchild they hoped for, but the lawyer in me demanded total focus. My phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, torn between the courtroom and the living room, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present in both."}
