I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo if I could save enough this month, and he\u2019s been counting down the days. Every extra fare matters, every tip brings me closer to keeping that promise. My current passenger, a young man in no rush, chats idly about his weekend plans. He\u2019s heading to a caf\u00e9, and we\u2019re making good time. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that the store\u2019s Nintendo sale ends in an hour. If I take a shortcut, I could finish this ride early, swing by the store, and still be home in time for dinner. But the shortcut is notorious for heavy traffic and tricky intersections. As a taxi driver, my job is to get him there safely and comfortably, not to rush for my own errands. My heart pounds as I weigh my son\u2019s excitement against my duty to my passenger. The steering wheel feels heavy in my hands, torn between being the mother who keeps her promises and the driver who keeps her word."}
