My partner\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised Jamie the Nintendo today. He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d I could picture Jamie\u2019s hopeful face, the way he\u2019d hugged me last night, asking if I\u2019d really keep my word. I wanted to give him that joy, to prove I could be the parent he needed, not just the one who showed up late and tired.\n\nBut outside, the foreman\u2019s voice barked through the static of the walkie-talkie. \u201cBeam\u2019s in the air! We need you now!\u201d The crane was already swinging the steel into place, and I knew the whole crew was counting on me to help guide it safely. If I left, even for a minute, I\u2019d be letting them down\u2014risking safety, risking my job, risking the paycheck that kept our family afloat.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the door, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to Jamie and the responsibility I owed my team. Both needed me, right now, and I didn\u2019t know how to be in two places at once."}
