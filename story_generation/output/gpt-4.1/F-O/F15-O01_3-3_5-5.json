The store manager\u2019s voice was tense: my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. I rushed over, my mind still half on the design\u2014had I left enough space for the trauma bay?\u2014but now I had to face my son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But the hospital project was at a critical stage; the contractors needed my input on the fire exits by noon. My son needed me to be present, to guide him, but my team expected me to be decisive and available. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the parent my son needed and the architect my team relied on, both at the very same moment."}
