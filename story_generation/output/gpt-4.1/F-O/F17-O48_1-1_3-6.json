Grandma will be so happy if you\u2019re here.\u201d My heart squeezed. Tonight was the family tradition\u2014everyone gathered, laughter echoing, stories shared, the warmth of belonging. I knew how much it meant to them, especially to Grandma, who always looked for me in the crowd.\n\nBut here I was, in Mrs. Patel\u2019s room, her eyes searching mine as she clutched my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet tonight,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. \u201cWould you stay a little longer?\u201d I saw the loneliness in her face, the way she waited for these moments, the comfort I could offer just by being present.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest.
