My foreman said it could lead to more hours and maybe a shot at a team lead position, but it meant staying late, missing dinner, and paying for a sitter. At home, my partner and I had just sat down with the bills, the home loan repayment looming like a storm cloud. I promised I\u2019d do everything to keep us afloat, to be the steady hand my stepdaughter could count on. But the training wasn\u2019t paid, and every hour away from home was another hour I couldn\u2019t help with homework or reassure her that things would be okay. My crew expected me to step up, to show I was committed, but my family needed me present, not just as a provider but as a parent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I had to give, and I stood there, torn, unable to move."}
