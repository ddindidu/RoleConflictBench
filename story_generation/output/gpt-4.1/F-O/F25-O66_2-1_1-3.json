It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my stepdad and mom to check in, share stories, and ask about their week. They expected it, and honestly, I did too\u2014it was our way of staying close, even if I sometimes felt like an outsider in their new family. My phone buzzed in the cup holder, their names lighting up the screen. I was between fares, but still on duty, and the rules were clear: no phone use while driving, not even at a red light. I could pull over, but I was already running behind schedule, and my next passenger was waiting just a few blocks away.
