They wait for my call every week, eager for stories, worried if I\u2019m late. My phone buzzes with their number, but I\u2019m behind the wheel, navigating a maze of orange cones and flashing signs. The detour squeezes traffic into a single lane, and up ahead, a school zone sign blinks. Children cluster near the curb, backpacks swinging, some darting too close to the street. My hands tighten on the wheel. I know I should answer, reassure my parents, keep our promise. But the road demands my full attention\u2014one wrong move, one distraction, and someone could get hurt. The phone keeps ringing, my parents\u2019 faces in my mind, their voices asking if I\u2019m okay. I feel torn, pulled between the duty to my family and the responsibility to these children and my passengers. The pressure builds in my chest as I weigh the risks, caught between the urge to reach for the phone and the need to keep both hands on the wheel."}
