The store is quiet, only a few customers trickling in. I greet each one, making sure my voice is warm and my eyes meet theirs, just like my manager expects. But my mind keeps drifting home. This morning, I saw my stepdad rubbing his temples, my mom barely touching her coffee. They looked so tired, so worn down. I know they need me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort when I get home. I want to be that support for them, to show I care, but right now, I have to be the cheerful cashier, the one who makes small talk and counts change with a steady hand. My heart aches with worry for my parents, but I push it down, forcing another smile for the next customer. I feel split in two\u2014torn between the family that needs me and the job that demands my attention. The register beeps, and I wonder how I can possibly be enough for both."}
