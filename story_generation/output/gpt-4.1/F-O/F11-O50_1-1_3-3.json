My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and my sister was already planning a picnic menu. They all looked at me, waiting for my input, expecting me to be there, to laugh and share in the plans. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who never missed a family moment.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the machines at work. The scheduled shutdown was next week, and I was responsible for the maintenance\u2014cleaning, checking every part, making sure nothing would break down when production resumed. My supervisor had reminded me how crucial this was, how any delay could cost the company thousands. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: my family\u2019s hope for togetherness and my duty to keep the machines running smoothly. My heart tugged in two directions as everyone waited for my answer, and I sat there, caught between being a good sister and a reliable machine repairer."}
