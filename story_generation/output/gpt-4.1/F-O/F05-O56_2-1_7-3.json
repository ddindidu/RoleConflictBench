I\u2019ve been feeling off lately.\u201d My heart tightened. I\u2019d noticed her quietness, the way she lingered in the kitchen, lost in thought. As her husband, I knew I should be there, ready to listen, to share my own worries and encourage her to open up. But just then, Mrs. Lee, my regular, settled into my chair. She smiled, but hesitated. \u201cCould you trim my fringe just a bit more? I\u2019m sorry to be fussy.\u201d I assured her it was no trouble, but inside, I felt the pressure mounting. My mind raced with thoughts of my wife\u2019s needs, but my hands had to be steady, my attention focused on Mrs. Lee\u2019s satisfaction. I wanted to be the attentive husband she deserved, but right now, I was the hairdresser, expected to be patient and professional. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure how to give enough to either."}
