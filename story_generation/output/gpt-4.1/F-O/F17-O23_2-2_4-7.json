My phone buzzed with a message from my mother, reminding me about the upcoming family gathering and the importance of honoring our traditions\u2014especially now, when the family was so focused on keeping our customs alive. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, insisting that I do my part, just as generations before me had done.\n\nAt the same time, an email popped up from an assistant at the firm, asking for access to confidential client files. She said it would make things easier for everyone, but I knew she wasn\u2019t familiar with the case. As a lawyer, I was bound by strict ethical rules\u2014client confidentiality wasn\u2019t just a guideline, it was a duty. Yet, I could sense the expectation from my colleagues to be a team player, to make things run smoothly.\n\nCaught between the pull of my family\u2019s values and the demands of my profession, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. I wanted to be the dutiful child, the reliable lawyer, but the expectations seemed to pull me in opposite directions."}
