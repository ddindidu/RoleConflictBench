He frowns, stubborn, and I feel the familiar tug of frustration. Just then, my phone buzzes\u2014a passenger needs a ride to the train station, and their train leaves in less than half an hour. My heart pounds. If I leave now, I can get them there on time, fulfill my duty as a reliable taxi driver. But if I rush out, I\u2019ll miss this moment to teach my son, to be the mother he needs, the one who doesn\u2019t just talk about values but lives them. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, patient, and perfect. I stand in the doorway, keys in hand, torn between the world outside and the small world at my kitchen table, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
