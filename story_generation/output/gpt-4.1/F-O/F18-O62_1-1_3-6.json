My little brother wanted to go to the community pool, and everyone seemed excited. As the oldest, I was expected to join in, help wrangle the younger kids, and make the day special. But as a lifeguard, I knew the pool had strict rules\u2014no one was supposed to be in the shallow end without a lifeguard present. Last weekend, I\u2019d seen a few swimmers slip into that area when no one was watching, and it gnawed at me. My parents looked at me, waiting for my input, expecting me to be part of the fun. At the same time, I felt the weight of my responsibility to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. My mind raced, torn between being the supportive sibling my family wanted and the vigilant lifeguard I was trained to be. I could feel the tension building inside me as I tried to figure out what to say."}
