She was supposed to be learning to eat neatly, and I knew I should gently correct her, remind her about manners and responsibility. But my phone buzzed insistently\u2014another message from the factory floor. The operator was at it again, adjusting the machine settings without consulting the manual, and now the production line was wasting expensive material. My supervisor expected me to call immediately, walk the operator through the correct procedure, and prevent further loss. I could almost hear his voice: \u201cYou\u2019re the expert, they need your guidance.\u201d But here, at home, my daughter needed me too, needed my patience and presence to learn the small lessons that would shape her character. My mind tugged in two directions, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to guide, to teach, to fix. I stared at my phone, then at my daughter, heart pounding, caught between the worlds that needed me."}
