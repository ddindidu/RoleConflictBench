She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cWill you come, Mom?\u201d I wanted nothing more than to be there, to watch her proudly show off her reading skills. But as I looked around the living room, the mess from the morning rush stared back at me\u2014crumbs on the carpet, toys scattered, dust gathering on the shelves. My job as a housekeeping cleaner meant I was expected to keep everything spotless, especially since the landlord was coming by for an inspection that afternoon. I knew if I left now, the house would still look lived-in, not the pristine standard I was supposed to maintain. My heart tugged in two directions: the promise I made to my daughter, and the responsibility I owed to my work. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, cleaning spray in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
