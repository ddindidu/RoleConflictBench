He asked about my day, and I tried to be present, to listen and share, just as we promised we would. I started to tell him about a funny moment at the pool, but my mind kept drifting back to work. I could still see the little boy\u2019s face, wide-eyed and panicked, as he drifted into the deep end where he wasn\u2019t supposed to be. I was supposed to enforce the rules, to keep everyone safe, but I also knew how much the parents hated being told their child couldn\u2019t swim there. My husband\u2019s voice pulled me back\u2014he wanted to know if something was wrong. I wanted to open up, to let him in, but I worried he wouldn\u2019t understand the pressure I felt. I was torn between being the attentive wife he needed and the vigilant lifeguard I was trained to be. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to confide and the duty to protect."}
