The office project deadline loomed, and I was still struggling to make the break room accessible without sacrificing desk space. My mind raced with measurements and layouts, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the way my husband lingered by the sink, quieter than usual. I knew I should ask him what was wrong, open up the conversation like we always promised we would. But every time I looked at him, my thoughts snapped back to the floor plan\u2014if I didn\u2019t solve this, the whole design would fall apart. I felt torn, the weight of my professional responsibility pressing against the promise I\u2019d made to be present and supportive at home. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to focus on both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me paralyzed between the person I wanted to be for him and the architect I needed to be for my team."}
