My spouse is bustling around, reminding me that her parents will arrive in a few hours and the house still looks like a tornado hit it. She expects me to help\u2014vacuum, tidy the living room, maybe even cook something special. I nod, feeling the weight of her expectation, but my mind keeps drifting to the engineering project at work. We\u2019re in the early stages, brainstorming solutions, and my team is waiting for my input on a new approach. I know I could propose alternatives later, but the ideas are fresh now, and I\u2019m itching to sketch them out before they slip away. My spouse\u2019s voice pulls me back\u2014she needs me here, present and helpful. But my mind is split, torn between the immediate, tangible needs at home and the creative spark that could shape my project\u2019s direction. I grip the counter, heart pounding, caught between the roles I care about most, unsure which demand to answer first."}
