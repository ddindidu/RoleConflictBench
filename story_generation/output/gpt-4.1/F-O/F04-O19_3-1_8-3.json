It was a text from my younger sister: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m upset about last night.\u201d I knew I\u2019d been short with her during our argument, and I owed her an honest conversation. As her brother, I wanted to show her respect, to listen and work things out. But just then, a customer approached, rubbing her temples. \u201cExcuse me, which painkiller is best for headaches?\u201d she asked. As a pharmacist, I was expected to provide clear, thorough counseling, even for simple questions. I glanced at my phone, feeling the weight of my sister\u2019s message, then back at the customer, who waited expectantly. My mind raced\u2014should I step away for a moment to call my sister and show her she mattered, or focus on my professional duty to the patient in front of me? The pressure of both roles pressed in, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between being the brother my sister needed and the pharmacist my patient deserved."}
