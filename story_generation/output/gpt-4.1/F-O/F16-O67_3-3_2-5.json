It was my partner, voice trembling, asking if I could come home early. They\u2019d had another rough day, and I could hear the tears they were trying to hide. I promised I\u2019d call during my break, feeling the weight of their need for comfort settle on my shoulders. Minutes later, the radio crackled\u2014dispatch alerting us to a possible heart attack, just blocks away. My partner\u2019s words echoed in my mind, but the siren\u2019s wail demanded my focus. I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the person who needed my arms around them and the stranger whose life might depend on my hands. The expectation to be present, to heal, to save\u2014both at home and on the road\u2014pulled me in opposite directions. I could feel myself splitting, desperate to be enough for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t. The ambulance sped through the night, and I was left wrestling with the impossible choice ahead."}
