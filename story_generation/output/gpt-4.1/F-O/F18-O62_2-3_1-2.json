My little brother trudged up the sand, his shoulders slumped, face blotchy from crying. I knew instantly something was wrong\u2014he\u2019d had a rough day at school, and I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and help him through it. He stopped at the base of my chair, looking up at me with pleading eyes, his voice trembling as he tried to talk. But the tide was high, and the water was packed with swimmers. My training echoed in my mind: never take your eyes off the water, not even for a second. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my brother needed me, but so did every person in the surf. My heart twisted as I tried to split my attention, torn between the urge to climb down and comfort him and the responsibility to keep watch over the restless sea."}
