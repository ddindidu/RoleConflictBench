My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I glance at the screen\u2014it's the school. My heart sinks as I read the message: my son was caught bullying a classmate. They want me to come in and discuss it immediately. I feel a wave of guilt and worry. As a mother, I know I should be there for him, to understand what happened, to show him right from wrong. But as a cashier, I can't just leave my post; my manager expects me to be reliable, and the customers expect a friendly face and quick service. I force another smile as I hand a receipt to a customer, but my mind is racing. I can almost hear my son's voice, scared and confused, needing me. At the same time, I see the line growing, people waiting, expecting me to do my job. My hands tremble as I scan the next item, torn between the two worlds that both need me right now."}
