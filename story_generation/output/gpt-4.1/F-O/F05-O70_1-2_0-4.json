My wife greeted me at the door, her smile a little forced. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, dropping her bag by the couch. I could tell she wanted to talk, maybe just vent, and I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that everything would be okay. But my phone buzzed\u2014another delivery, this one requiring a signature for a set of electronics. The customer had already called twice, anxious about the package. I felt the pressure mounting: my wife needed me to be present, to offer comfort and attention, but my job demanded I leave immediately, secure the package, and get that signature. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the urge to sit beside her and the obligation to fulfill my delivery duties. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy either at this moment."}
