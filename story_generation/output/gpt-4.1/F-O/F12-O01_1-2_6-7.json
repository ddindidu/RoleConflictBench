The contractor needed an urgent decision about the window placement, and the project was already behind schedule. My husband poured us both tea and asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I wanted to tell him about the stress, the endless calls, the pressure to keep everything moving. But as I glanced at his tired eyes, I hesitated. He expected me to share, to be open, to let him in. At the same time, my mind raced with details\u2014measurements, deadlines, the fear of making a costly mistake. If I opened up, would I sound like I was complaining? Would it distract me from the urgent decisions waiting for me? I felt torn, caught between the need to be present as a wife and the relentless demands of being an architect. The silence stretched as I weighed whether to close my laptop and talk, or keep working to save the project."}
