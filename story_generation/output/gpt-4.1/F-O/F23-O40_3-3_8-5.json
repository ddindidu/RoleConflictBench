As a step-parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability pressing down on my shoulders. The kids were counting on me, and I couldn\u2019t let them down. But tomorrow, I was starting the biggest carpentry project I\u2019d ever landed\u2014a custom kitchen for a new client. Tonight, I needed to pore over blueprints and technical drawings, making sure every measurement was perfect, every joint planned. My mind kept drifting back to the loan, the numbers swirling in my head, while the stack of blueprints on the table seemed to grow taller by the minute. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford any mistakes at work, not with so much riding on this job. But I also couldn\u2019t ignore the family\u2019s needs, the anxious look in my partner\u2019s eyes when we talked about money. The demands of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility to face first."}
