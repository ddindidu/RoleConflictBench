As a parent, I know the home loan repayment is looming\u2014just two months away. Every extra shift I take at the hospital means a little more security for my family, a little less worry about keeping our home. But right now, as a nursing assistant, I\u2019m standing at the bedside of Mr. Lee, whose breathing is shallow and erratic. The doctor\u2019s orders are clear: monitor his vital signs every few minutes, record everything, and alert them at the slightest change. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my partner\u2019s text, asking if I can pick up the kids after school because the sitter canceled. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. If I leave, I risk my patient\u2019s safety and my job. If I stay, I let my family down and risk our financial stability. My hands tremble as I check Mr. Lee\u2019s pulse, my thoughts torn between the beeping monitors and the faces of my children waiting for me at home."}
