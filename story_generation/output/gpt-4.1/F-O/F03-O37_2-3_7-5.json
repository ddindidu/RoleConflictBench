They\u2019d always been my pillars, but lately, they seemed so fragile, weighed down by worries they tried to hide.

But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the next client was expecting me in half an hour, and I still had to check the supply cart. \n\nAs I opened the storage closet, my heart sank. The specialized cleaner for Mrs. Lee\u2019s antique floors was gone. She\u2019d be furious if I showed up unprepared. My boss had made it clear: no mistakes, no excuses.
