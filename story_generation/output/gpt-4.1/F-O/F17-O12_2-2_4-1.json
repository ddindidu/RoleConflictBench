My code editor was open, lines of logic sprawled across the screen, but my mind kept drifting. The new feature was almost done, but the code review comments stung: \u201cPerformance issues\u2014needs refactoring.\u201d I knew what was expected of me as a developer: clean, efficient code, no shortcuts. But my phone buzzed again with messages from my family group chat. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. It\u2019s tradition. We all have to be there.\u201d Lately, my parents had been insistent about upholding our customs, especially after my cousin skipped last week. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, disappointed if I missed it. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds.
