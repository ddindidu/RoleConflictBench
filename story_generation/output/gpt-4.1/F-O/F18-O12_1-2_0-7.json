What if I fail? Can you talk?\u201d He had his final exam in the morning, and I knew how much he\u2019d been struggling. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like I always did. But just as I was about to call, a Slack notification popped up\u2014urgent bug reports from users, flagged by QA. The app was crashing, and the team needed me to troubleshoot right away. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need a fix tonight.\u201d I stared at my screen, torn. My brother needed my support, but my team was counting on me to keep the product running. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt my chest tighten. I wanted to be a good sibling, but I was also responsible for the stability of our software. My hands hovered over the keyboard, caught between dialing my brother and diving into lines of code, unsure which role to answer first."}
