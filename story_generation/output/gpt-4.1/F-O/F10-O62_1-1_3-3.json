As a daughter, I was expected to help set the table, share stories, and honor the traditions that meant so much to my parents. But as a lifeguard, I was responsible for keeping the pool area safe and orderly, which included making sure every chair was perfectly aligned and every piece of equipment in its place. I noticed a few pool chairs were slightly out of line\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to standard. My mom\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it was to be present for family moments, especially during the holidays. At the same time, my supervisor\u2019s words about attention to detail and professionalism tugged at me. I felt torn, standing between the laughter drifting from the kitchen and the quiet order of the pool deck, wrestling with the weight of both roles and the fear of letting someone down, no matter which way I turned."}
