Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d The holiday was coming, and I knew how much it meant for us to gather, to keep the tradition alive. I started typing a quick reply, promising to call during my break, when the radio crackled. \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew the protocol\u2014passenger safety always came first.
