My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cOpen Class \u2013 2:00 PM.\u201d My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining as she practiced her lines for the class presentation. I promised her I\u2019d be there, front row, cheering her on. But just as I was about to hand over my sector, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cTower, this is Delta 452, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart thudded.
