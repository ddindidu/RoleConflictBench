The family ceremony was tomorrow\u2014my mother\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was for me to lead the ritual this year. \u201cYou\u2019re the eldest now,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with pride and hope. I knew how much it meant to her, to all of us, to keep our traditions alive. But then my phone buzzed: a message from the precinct. The court date for the case I\u2019d been working on had been moved up. I was required to testify, no exceptions. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to be there when justice called, no matter what.
