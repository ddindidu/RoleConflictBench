It\u2019s important.\u201d My stomach tightened. We\u2019d been dancing around the topic of our mounting bills and my recent cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. I knew tonight was the night for honesty, for laying everything out on the table, just as my partner expected of me. But as the whistle blew, signaling the end of my shift, my foreman\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone, safety check and sweep-up before you go. No shortcuts.\u201d I looked at the scattered debris around my station, the dust swirling in the fading light. If I left now, I\u2019d be shirking my responsibility to my crew, risking someone\u2019s safety tomorrow. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for that conversation at home, the one that demanded my full attention and openness. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my team and the promise I\u2019d made to my spouse."}
