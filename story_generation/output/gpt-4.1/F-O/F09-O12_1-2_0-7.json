Users are getting kicked out of the app, and QA is pinging me for updates. My fingers hover over the keyboard, mind racing through possible causes. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a calendar reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school.\u201d Dismiss or snooze? I picture my children waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised I\u2019d be there on time today. But the error logs keep piling up, and my team is counting on me to find a fix before the end of the day. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014my children\u2019s trust in me as their mother, my team\u2019s reliance on me as their developer. I feel the pressure building, torn between two worlds that both need me right now."}
