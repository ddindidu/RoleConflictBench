My stepmom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to join in, to be part of the family, to say yes. I nodded along, trying to seem engaged, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014my shift as a subway operator was about to start. I barely had time to change before heading out.\n\nLater, as I guided the train through the tunnels, my mind drifted back to the dinner table and the laughter I\u2019d left behind. Suddenly, the emergency alarm blared. A passenger was in distress. My training kicked in: I had to stop the train, alert emergency services, and keep everyone calm. But as I reached for the intercom, my phone vibrated again\u2014a family group chat, my stepbrother asking if I could make it for the hike. I felt torn, the weight of my responsibility to the passengers pressing down on me, while the hope of my new family tugged at my heart."}
