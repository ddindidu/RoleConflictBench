The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces, and felt the familiar warmth of family expectation. But as I tucked my phone away, a patient approached the counter, prescription in hand, eyes anxious. She was starting a new medication, and I could see the worry etched on her face. My duty as a pharmacist was clear\u2014I needed to take the time to explain every detail, answer her questions, and ensure she felt safe. Yet, the clock was ticking, and I knew my family would be waiting, hoping for my presence and attention.

I stood there, torn, feeling the pull of two worlds, each demanding more than just my time."}
