It\u2019s urgent with the kids.\u201d My hands, still rough from a day of hauling bricks and mixing cement, trembled. I knew my family needed me\u2014my daughter never asked unless it was serious. The thought of my grandkids\u2019 worried faces tugged at me, the urge to drop everything and rush home almost overwhelming.\n\nBut the foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding us all that a clean, safe site was non-negotiable.
