My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school.\u201d I pictured their faces pressed against the window, scanning the parking lot for me. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, not like last week when I was late. Just then, Mrs. Lee, a regular, walked in, her smile warm and expectant. The receptionist was chatting idly, but Mrs. Lee looked straight at me, waiting for our usual friendly greeting and the comfort she always found in my chair. My heart squeezed. I wanted to be the reliable dad at the school gate, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down a loyal client who counted on me for more than just a haircut. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be there, fully. I stood frozen, broom in hand, torn between the door and the salon floor, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
