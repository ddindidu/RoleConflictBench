My manager had emailed twice already, reminding me how crucial it was to get everything right this month. I could feel the pressure mounting, my fingers tense on the keyboard. Just then, the front door creaked open and my younger brother trudged in, his backpack slung low and his face streaked with tears. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could see the pain in his eyes. I wanted to go to him, to sit beside him and listen, to be the supportive sibling he needed. But the numbers on my screen glared at me, the clock ticking louder in my mind. My heart pulled in two directions, torn between the duty to my family and the demands of my job, both expecting my full attention at the same impossible moment."}
