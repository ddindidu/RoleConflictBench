My stepmom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cIt would mean a lot if you could be there this year.\u201d I knew how important it was to show up, to be part of the family, especially since I\u2019d always felt a bit like an outsider. But my laptop screen glared back at me, the project timeline blinking in my inbox. My manager\u2019s email was just as urgent: \u201cWe need your estimates by tomorrow morning. The client\u2019s waiting to sign.\u201d I could almost hear the tension in his words, the weight of the contract hanging on my calculations. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family expectations and the cold precision of engineering demands. I wanted to be present for my step-siblings, to finally feel like I belonged, but I also knew the team was counting on me. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, feeling the pressure build with every passing minute."}
