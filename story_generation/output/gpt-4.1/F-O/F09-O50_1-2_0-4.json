The hum of the machines filled the workshop, but I could hear my phone buzzing in my pocket\u2014a reminder that school was ending soon. My kids would be waiting at the gate, eyes searching the crowd for me, just like every other day. I pictured their faces, the way they\u2019d light up when they spotted me, and my heart ached.\n\nBut the machines were running hotter than they should, and I knew skipping another maintenance could mean a breakdown, maybe even a safety hazard. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime, not today.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on both sides\u2014my children\u2019s trust in me as their mother, and the team\u2019s reliance on me as the repairer. I wiped my hands, torn between the school parking lot and the factory floor, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
