She wanted to share every detail, and as her mother\u2014and now grandmother\u2014I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, asked questions, and celebrated with her. I promised myself I\u2019d always be there for these moments, to keep our family close, to show my grandchildren what it means to be present.\n\nBut as I stood in my workshop, the clock ticking toward the start of my shift, I glanced at the pile of tools waiting for inspection. As a carpenter, I know the risks of neglecting safety checks. One missed crack in a handle, one dull blade, and someone could get hurt. The crew depends on me to make sure everything is in order before we begin.\n\nMy phone buzzed again\u2014my daughter, sending photos and updates. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the weight of responsibility. I stared at my phone, then at the tools, feeling the pressure build inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they deserved at the same time."}
