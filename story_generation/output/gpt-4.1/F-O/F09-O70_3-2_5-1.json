I answered, heart pounding, and heard the principal\u2019s voice: \u201cYour son was caught stealing snacks at the corner store.\u201d My mind raced. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. I pictured his small, guilty face, waiting for me to come and guide him, to be the parent he needed in this moment.\n\nBut then I glanced at the packages stacked in the passenger seat. One was groceries for Mrs. Kim, who had called earlier, nearly in tears, saying she needed them for her family\u2019s dinner tonight. My job as a delivery person was clear\u2014deliver on time, no excuses. My supervisor had already warned me about late deliveries.\n\nI felt torn in two. My son needed me to be his mother, to teach and comfort him. My customer needed me to be reliable, to keep my promise. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat in my car, keys in hand, paralyzed by the choice I had to make."}
