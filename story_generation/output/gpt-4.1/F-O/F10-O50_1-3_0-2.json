The nurse\u2019s voice is tight with urgency\u2014this machine can\u2019t fail, not now. I kneel beside it, tools in hand, mind racing through possible causes. My phone vibrates again. It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cJust checking in. How are you? Love you.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last text from yesterday. Guilt prickles at me. She worries when I go silent, especially on weekends. I know she expects a quick reply, a sign that I\u2019m safe and thinking of her. But the machine\u2019s alarm is shrill, and the patient\u2019s life depends on me diagnosing the fault, fast. My hands tremble as I reach for my phone, torn between the daughter who should reassure her mother and the repairer who must not be distracted. The weight of both expectations presses down, and for a moment, I can\u2019t move, caught between the two worlds that need me right now."}
