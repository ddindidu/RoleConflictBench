Dad\u2019s voice was softer than usual, and he seemed to move slower, weighed down by something unspoken. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort. But my phone buzzed with a new order: a client wanted a custom bookshelf, and the deadline was tight. I had to estimate the wood, hardware, and finish, and place the order before the supplier closed for the weekend. My mind raced between the living room, where my parents waited, and the workshop, where my tools and notepad lay ready. I felt torn, the weight of my parents\u2019 silent plea pulling me one way, and the responsibility of my craft tugging me the other. My heart ached with the pressure of being both a good son and a reliable carpenter, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
