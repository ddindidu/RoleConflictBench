She\u2019d barely slept, and I knew she needed me to sit with her, to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. I wanted nothing more than to hold her hand and be the anchor she needed right now. But my phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: the lane rope was broken, and swim lessons would start in less than an hour. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids\u2019 lessons would be thrown into chaos, and I\u2019d be letting down my team. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Jamie\u2019s silent plea for me to stay, the urgent responsibility waiting at the pool. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person I loved and the job that counted on me."}
