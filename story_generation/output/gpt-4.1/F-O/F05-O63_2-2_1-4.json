My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need results, or there\u2019ll be consequences.\u201d I dial another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my phone buzzes with a message from my wife. She\u2019s at her office, facing a tough decision about a promotion that could change everything for her. \u201cCan you talk?\u201d she writes. \u201cI really need you right now.\u201d\n\nMy heart twists. She\u2019s always been there for me, and I know how much this means to her. She expects me to listen, to reassure her, to be the supportive husband she can lean on. But if I stop now, I might miss my target\u2014and I can\u2019t afford to fall short again. The pressure from work and the need to be present for her pull me in opposite directions. My headset feels heavier, my chest tightens. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of the person I love most."}
