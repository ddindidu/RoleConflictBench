The manager\u2019s stern voice echoed in my ears, but all I could see was the shame on my boy\u2019s face. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. My mind raced with the words I should say, the lesson I needed to impart, the disappointment I had to express.\n\nBut even as I tried to focus on my son, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the upcoming machine maintenance at work. Next week\u2019s shutdown was my only window to clean and service the machines, and my supervisor had made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. The pressure to perform perfectly at work pressed against the weight of my responsibility as a father. I felt torn, my thoughts pulled between the need to discipline my child and the looming demands of my job. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the father my son needed and the reliable repairer my team expected."}
