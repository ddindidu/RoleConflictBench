As a police officer, I knew I should respond, but as a step-parent, my mind was elsewhere\u2014my stepson, Jamie, had just been caught stealing snacks at the corner store. The store manager called me, not the boy\u2019s mother, because he knew I was a cop. He expected me to handle it \u201cthe right way.\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes were wide with fear and shame, and I could see he was waiting for my reaction, hoping for understanding but bracing for discipline.\n\nI felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me. As a step-parent, I wanted to teach Jamie about honesty and consequences, to guide him gently but firmly. As a police officer, I was expected to uphold the law, even if it meant treating my own family like any other offender. The phone buzzed again\u2014another neighbor, more insistent. I stood in the kitchen, torn between the badge and the family, knowing whatever I chose would disappoint someone, maybe even myself."}
