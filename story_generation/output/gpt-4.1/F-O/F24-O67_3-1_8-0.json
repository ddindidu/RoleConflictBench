My radio crackled with static, a constant reminder that at any moment, I might have to speed off to save a life. I glanced out the window and saw my stepbrother, Jamie, on the sidewalk across the street. He was fiddling with his phone, not paying attention as he stepped off the curb. My heart lurched\u2014he didn\u2019t see the car coming down the road, and I knew he never looked both ways.\n\nAs his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially since our parents always said, \u201cTake care of each other.\u201d But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to stay put, ready to respond instantly to any emergency. If I left my post, even for a second, I could miss a call that meant life or death for someone else. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urge to shout his name and the duty to stay ready. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, caught between two impossible choices."}
