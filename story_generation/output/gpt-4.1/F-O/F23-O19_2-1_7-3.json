As a step-parent, I felt the weight of every bill, every expectation to keep our family afloat. Today, I\u2019d picked up an extra shift, hoping the overtime would help cover this month\u2019s expenses. The store was busy, and I was moving quickly, ringing up customers, barely pausing to breathe.\n\nA woman approached, asking about over-the-counter pain relief. I gave her a quick answer, glancing at the clock, thinking about the next customer, the next dollar. But as a pharmacist, I knew I was supposed to do more\u2014ask about her symptoms, check for allergies, make sure she was choosing the right medication. My training told me to slow down, to care for her as a patient, not just a transaction.\n\nBut every minute I spent counseling meant less time for the line, less chance to finish my shift on time, less money for my family. I felt torn, the expectations of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do next."}
