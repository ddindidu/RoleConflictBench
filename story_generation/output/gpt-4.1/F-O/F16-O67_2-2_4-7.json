My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that the kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done tonight, and I know how much it means to keep our home running smoothly. Just as I reach for the detergent, my radio crackles to life\u2014dispatch calling. There\u2019s a patient with a sprained ankle across town, nothing life-threatening, but protocol is protocol. I\u2019m the closest ambulance driver on shift. I grab my keys, heart pounding, picturing the gridlocked city streets at rush hour. I know I have to drive safely, no matter how urgent the call feels. But the guilt gnaws at me\u2014if I leave now, the laundry won\u2019t get done, and I\u2019ll be letting my family down. If I stay, I\u2019m not doing my duty as a first responder. The weight of both roles presses on me, and for a moment, I just stand there, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the hum of the washing machine."}
