My headset feels heavier with every passing minute. The manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers up, or there\u2019ll be consequences.\u201d I know what that means\u2014less commission, maybe even fewer hours. I can\u2019t afford that, not with groceries running low and the rent due next week. My kids are counting on me to keep the lights on and food on the table.\n\nBut as I dial the next number, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you help me with my homework? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d I picture her sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for me, her face scrunched in frustration. I want to be there for her, to help her learn and feel supported. But if I step away now, I might miss my chance to make those last sales. My heart pounds as I stare at the screen, torn between the voice in my ear urging me to sell and the small voice at home needing her parent."}
