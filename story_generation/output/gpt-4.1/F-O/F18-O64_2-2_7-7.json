My manager had reminded me just that morning to keep the line moving and stay cheerful, no matter how hectic things got. As I handed change to a woman with a toddler tugging at her sleeve, I caught sight of my younger brother through the big front window. He was at the edge of the parking lot, skateboard in hand, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp that led down to the loading dock. I knew he\u2019d been practicing a new trick, and I also knew how dangerous that ramp was. My parents always said I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But the line of customers stretched past the magazine rack, and I could feel their impatience. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the next order, torn between the expectation to be the reliable, friendly cashier and the older sibling who was supposed to keep my brother safe."}
