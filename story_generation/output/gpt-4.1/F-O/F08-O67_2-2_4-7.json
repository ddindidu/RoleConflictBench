The air was thick with anticipation, and I could feel the warmth of my family\u2019s love all around me. Just as she opened her mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. There was a patient across town, nothing life-threatening, but they needed an ambulance. I looked at my daughter, who gave me a pleading glance, silently asking me to stay, just this once. But I knew the city traffic would be brutal, and my duty was to get there safely and quickly. My heart twisted as I weighed the joy of being present for my granddaughter\u2019s big moment against the responsibility of helping someone in need. The family expected me to be there, to be the grandmother who never missed a milestone. The city expected me to be the reliable ambulance driver, calm and focused behind the wheel.
