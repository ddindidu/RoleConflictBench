My son, Ben, was across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dribbling down his chin. I was supposed to be teaching him to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d to wipe his mouth, to listen when someone spoke. But my phone buzzed\u2014another call. I clicked in, voice shifting to my professional tone. The customer on the other end was furious, questioning every detail of the offer, demanding proof, explanations, reassurances. My manager expected me to handle objections smoothly, keep the customer calm, and close the deal. Ben tugged at my sleeve, asking if he could leave the table. I tried to signal him to wait, but he pouted, pushing his bowl away. My mind raced\u2014should I mute the call and correct Ben, or focus on the customer and risk letting my son\u2019s manners slide? Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my full attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which demand to meet first."}
