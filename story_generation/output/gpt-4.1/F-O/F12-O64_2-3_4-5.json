My hands moved automatically, sorting and stacking, but my mind was elsewhere. The store manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t rush the deposit. Every step matters for the audit.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014double-check, sign off, lock the safe. No shortcuts. But my phone buzzed in my apron pocket, and I saw my husband\u2019s message: \u201cDid you do the laundry? Kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I pictured the overflowing basket at home, the kids\u2019 disappointed faces if their clothes weren\u2019t ready. I was supposed to share the chores, not leave it all to him. Guilt twisted in my stomach. If I stayed late to finish the deposit by the book, I\u2019d miss my chance to get the laundry done before bedtime. If I hurried, I risked making a mistake and breaking store policy. I stood at the counter, torn between being the reliable cashier my boss expected and the supportive wife my family needed, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
