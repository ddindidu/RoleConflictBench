As a step-parent, I felt the weight of wanting to keep my word, to show him he could trust me, and to give him something special. But my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the site manager: the new building\u2019s stairwell design might not meet safety codes, and if I didn\u2019t review the plans tonight, construction would move forward, risking both compliance and people\u2019s safety. My job as an architect demanded vigilance, and I knew a mistake could cost lives\u2014or my career. I stared at the unopened Nintendo ad on my laptop, Jamie\u2019s hopeful face in my memory, and then at the stack of blueprints waiting for my attention. The pressure of being both a reliable parent and a responsible architect pressed in on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
