Lily wants to tell everyone her big news!\u201d I could hear my granddaughter giggling in the background, and my heart swelled. I pictured her face, eager and proud, waiting for her family to gather around.\n\nBut as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014an urgent message from a client. They needed a rush estimate for a new dining table, and the supplier\u2019s order deadline was tonight. If I didn\u2019t get the measurements and materials list in, the whole project would be delayed, and I\u2019d risk disappointing a loyal customer.\n\nI stared at the half-finished bookshelf, the sawdust clinging to my hands, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate Lily\u2019s milestone. My client expected professionalism and timeliness. I wanted to be both the loving grandmother and the reliable carpenter, but tonight, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both. My heart tugged in two directions as I stood in my workshop, torn between the laughter of my family and the hum of my craft."}
