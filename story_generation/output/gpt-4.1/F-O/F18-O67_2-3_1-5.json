He barely looked up as I set my bag down, but I could feel the weight of his sadness filling the room. I knew he needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone after whatever had happened at school. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: a call from dispatch. A patient nearby was showing signs of a major heart attack. My training kicked in, heart pounding, knowing every second counted for that stranger\u2019s life. But my brother\u2019s pain was right here, raw and immediate. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to save a life and the promise I\u2019d always made to be there for my family. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
