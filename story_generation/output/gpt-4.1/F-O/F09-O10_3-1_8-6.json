My son\u2019s laughter echoed from the living room, but my mind was tangled in numbers. The home loan repayment loomed in two months, and I needed to double-check our budget, make sure every cent was accounted for.

As the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to respond promptly and formally, maintaining our professional relationships.
