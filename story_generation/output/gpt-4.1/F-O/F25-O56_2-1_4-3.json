She was one of my favorite clients\u2014always cheerful, never demanding. Today, she asked for a slight trim to her fringe, nothing major, but she mentioned she wanted it just right for her family\u2019s big celebration tonight. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. My stepmother had called earlier, reminding me that tonight was our family\u2019s annual dinner, a tradition she insisted I honor, especially now that I was part of the family. She\u2019d made it clear: being late or distracted would be disrespectful to our values.\n\nAs I carefully snipped Mrs. Kim\u2019s hair, I felt the minutes ticking by. If I took extra time to perfect her fringe and chat as usual, I\u2019d risk being late for dinner. But if I rushed, I might disappoint her, and that went against everything I believed as a hairdresser. My hands trembled slightly, caught between the warmth of Mrs. Kim\u2019s trust and the weight of my stepmother\u2019s expectations. I could feel the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment."}
