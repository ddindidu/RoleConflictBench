As an accountant, I knew the quarterly filing deadline was looming. My manager expected flawless records, and any mistake could mean hours of extra work and a dent in my reputation. But as a parent, my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment due in two months. I needed to double-check our family budget, make sure every cent was accounted for, and maybe even find ways to cut back. The pressure to ensure our financial stability pressed on my chest, but so did the responsibility to keep my work spotless. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the office, while my partner called from the other room, asking if I\u2019d looked at the loan documents yet. I stared at the numbers, feeling the weight of both worlds, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family, unsure which to tackle first."}
