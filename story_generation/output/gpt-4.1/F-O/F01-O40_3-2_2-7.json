It was Mrs. Lee, the homeowner from across town, her voice tight with worry. \u201cThe deck\u2019s gotten worse overnight. I\u2019m afraid someone might get hurt. Can you come today?\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there as soon as possible, knowing how much she relied on that deck for her family gatherings. I gathered my tools, mentally running through the repairs I\u2019d need to make.\n\nJust as I was about to leave, my grandson, Ethan, appeared at the door, his eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d He hesitated, then blurted out a problem he was facing at school\u2014something serious, something that needed more than a quick answer. I could see he needed my full attention, my guidance, the kind only a grandfather could give.\n\nI felt torn. Mrs. Lee was counting on me to keep her family safe, but Ethan needed me in a way only I could provide. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the two worlds that defined me."}
