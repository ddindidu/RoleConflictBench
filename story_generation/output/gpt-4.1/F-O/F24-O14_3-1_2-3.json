The words on the screen made my heart drop: \u201cCan you come home? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just found out our dad\u2019s illness had taken a turn for the worse. As a step-sibling, I knew he expected me to be there, to listen, to help him process the fear and sadness. But as a scientist, I also felt the tug of responsibility\u2014my data was fresh, and I always prided myself on accuracy and timeliness, even if the logs could technically wait. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my own standards, but if I stayed, I\u2019d be abandoning Sam when he needed me most. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, torn between the lab and the living room, between duty and family."}
