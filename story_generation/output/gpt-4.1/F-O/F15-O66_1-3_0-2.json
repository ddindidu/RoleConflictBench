My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. I could feel his anxiety pressing on me, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d somehow get him to the airport on time, no matter the weather. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014an alert from the school. Dismissal was early because of the storm. My kids would be waiting, bundled up and shivering, expecting me to be there like I always promised. I pictured their faces, scanning the line of cars, hoping to see me. But the airport was still miles away, and traffic was crawling. My hands tightened on the wheel. I was supposed to be reliable, both as a parent and as a driver. But right now, I couldn\u2019t see how I could possibly be both. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, the storm outside nothing compared to the one inside my chest."}
