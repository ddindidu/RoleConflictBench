Can you bring home some food tonight?\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Money was tight, and I knew every shift I picked up as a delivery person mattered. I needed to make sure my family had enough, to prove I could be a reliable step-parent, someone they could count on.\n\nBut today, my delivery route included a high-value package. The instructions were clear: hand it directly to the recipient, check their ID, and get a signature. No shortcuts. If I messed this up, I could lose my job\u2014or at least the bonus I was counting on to cover this week\u2019s bills.\n\nAs I pulled up to the address, my phone buzzed again. My stepchild\u2019s school was calling; something about a forgotten lunch. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family needed me, but so did my job.

My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
