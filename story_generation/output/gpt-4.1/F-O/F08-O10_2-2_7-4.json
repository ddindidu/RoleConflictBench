The quarterly tax filing deadline loomed, and I knew every detail had to be perfect\u2014no room for error, not with the new regulations this year. My phone buzzed again, a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, did you see my new office? I got the job!\u201d She\u2019d sent photos, her smile beaming through the screen. I knew she wanted to talk, to share her excitement, and I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice reminding me how much it means to keep in touch, to be present for these moments. But the pressure of the tax deadline pressed down on me, the fear of missing a detail, of letting my team down. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the family that needed my warmth and the company that relied on my precision. I stared at the phone, torn, the weight of both worlds heavy on my shoulders."}
