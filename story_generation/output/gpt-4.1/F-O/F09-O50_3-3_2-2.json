I glance at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the school. My heart sinks. My son, caught bullying. They need me to come in, now, to talk with the principal and the other child\u2019s parents. I picture his face, the confusion and fear he must feel, and the disappointment in myself for not being there more. But the ventilator\u2019s alarm blares, red lights pulsing. The ICU nurse\u2019s eyes plead with me\u2014this machine is keeping someone alive, and I\u2019m the only one on call who can fix it. My hands tremble, torn between the wrench and my phone. My child needs his mother, but someone\u2019s life depends on my skill. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I can\u2019t see how to be enough for either."}
