She asked about my day, and I knew she wanted more than just a list of deliveries. She wanted to hear about the little things, the frustrations, the funny moments\u2014she wanted me to open up. I started to tell her about a difficult customer, but my phone buzzed. It was a message from another customer, asking about their delivery status. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, using the right words, keeping it polite and efficient. My wife waited, her face falling just a little as I turned my attention to my phone. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, I wanted to be present, to share and connect with her, as a good spouse should. On the other, I couldn\u2019t ignore the customer, not if I wanted to keep my job. The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, caught between the two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
