My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cBreaks are strictly timed. We need everyone on the phones.\u201d The call queue never seemed to shrink, and I knew if I took an unscheduled break, it would be noticed. But my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from my mom. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the family ceremony tonight. It means a lot to your grandparents.\u201d My heart twisted. I was the oldest child, expected to honor our traditions, to stand in front of everyone and guide the prayers, just like my father once did. I could almost hear my family\u2019s voices, full of pride and expectation. But the clock on my screen kept ticking, and the next call was already waiting. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my family\u2019s hopes pressing against the rigid rules of my job. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
