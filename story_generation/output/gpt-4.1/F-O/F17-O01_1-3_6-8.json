The project deadline looms, and every minute counts. My mind races with solutions\u2014should I call an emergency meeting, or can I resolve this with a few quick emails? Just as I start typing, my phone rings. It\u2019s my mom. Her voice is soft, a little tired, and she asks, \u201cHow are you? Is everything okay at work?\u201d I hear the unspoken question\u2014she wants to know if I\u2019m okay, but also if she and Dad are okay, if I\u2019ve noticed the tension at home. I remember my promise to check in, to be there for them, to ask if everything is going well. But my inbox is filling up, and the project can\u2019t wait. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my parents need me to listen, to care, to be present, but my team needs answers, leadership, and quick decisions. My heart aches as I try to be both the supportive child and the responsible architect, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
