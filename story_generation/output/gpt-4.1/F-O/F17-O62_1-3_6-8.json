My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cRough day. Can you call later?\u201d I felt that familiar tug\u2014my parents needed me, and I always tried to be there, asking if everything was okay, listening to their worries. But right now, my eyes caught a small figure flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits for kids. My training kicked in: I had to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. My heart pounded. I wanted to jump up, blow my whistle, and rush to help, but my mind flickered back to Mom\u2019s message. I could almost hear her voice, tired and needing comfort. I felt split in two\u2014torn between being the supportive child my parents expected and the vigilant lifeguard everyone at the pool depended on. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just froze, caught between the demands of home and the urgent need in front of me."}
