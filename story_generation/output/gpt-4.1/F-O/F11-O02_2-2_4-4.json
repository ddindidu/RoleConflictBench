Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much it meant to everyone that I show up. Family dinners were sacred\u2014an unspoken rule in our house. But my laptop chimed with a new email from my manager, subject line urgent: \u201cUpdated safety standard\u2014need documentation by tomorrow morning.\u201d My heart sank. The new regulation was complex, and I was the only one on the team who fully understood the system. If I didn\u2019t get the evidence together tonight, the release would be delayed, and the company could face penalties. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting my laughter at the table, my team relying on my expertise. I wanted to be the dependable sister and the responsible engineer, but tonight, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between replying to my sister and opening the compliance checklist, my mind racing with guilt and frustration."}
