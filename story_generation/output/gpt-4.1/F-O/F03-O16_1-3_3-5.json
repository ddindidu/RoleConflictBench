It was the annual holiday gathering, a tradition my parents cherished, a time when everyone came together, shared stories, and celebrated our roots. I knew how much it meant to them, especially to my father, who always insisted that family came first, no matter what.\n\nBut just down the hall, a family waited for me, their faces drawn with worry. I had to tell them that their loved one\u2019s condition was far more serious than they\u2019d hoped. As a doctor, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and clear, to guide them through the hardest news they might ever hear. My pager beeped again\u2014my patient\u2019s family was ready.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of my white coat pressing down on me, the echo of my mother\u2019s voice in my ear. I wanted to be the son my parents expected, honoring our traditions, but I also had a duty to my patient and their family. My heart pounded as I stood between two doors, each leading to a different world, each demanding all of me."}
