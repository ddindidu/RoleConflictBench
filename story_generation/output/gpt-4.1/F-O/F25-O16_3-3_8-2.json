The ER was tense, every second precious. I glanced at the screen: a message from my stepfather. \u201cCan you call? I need to talk.\u201d I hesitated, but dialed. His voice trembled as he confided in me, unraveling a personal struggle he\u2019d never shared before. He needed me to listen, to comfort him, to be the step-child he could lean on. But as he spoke, I watched the monitors in the next room flash warnings. The patient\u2019s condition was deteriorating, and the team was waiting for my orders. My mind split\u2014one part desperate to be the supportive child my stepfather needed, the other pulled by the urgent responsibility to diagnose and save a life. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t give myself to both. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, torn by the weight of their expectations."}
