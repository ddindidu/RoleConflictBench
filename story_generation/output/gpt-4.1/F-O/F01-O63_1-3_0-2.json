My shift as a telemarketer had just begun when my grandson, Ethan, wandered in, his face clouded with uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d he asked, voice barely above a whisper. My heart ached to pause everything, to give him the thoughtful answer he deserved, to share the lessons I\u2019d gathered over decades. But just then, my screen flashed\u2014an incoming call. I clicked accept, and a customer\u2019s angry voice filled my ear, demanding to know why our offer was worth their time, challenging every word I said. My training told me to stay calm, to answer with patience and clarity, to keep the customer on the line. Yet, Ethan lingered, eyes searching mine for guidance. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my family. My mind raced, caught between the script in my ear and the wisdom in my heart, unsure which voice to answer first."}
