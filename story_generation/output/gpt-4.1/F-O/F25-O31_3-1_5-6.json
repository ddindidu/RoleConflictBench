I knew how important this tradition was to her, to the family\u2014how much she wanted me to be part of it, to bridge the gap between us. But my phone buzzed, a reminder of my other life. Earlier that day, I\u2019d been on patrol and found my stepbrother\u2019s car parked illegally outside the community center. Technically, I should have issued a ticket, but I hesitated, knowing how much he struggled. As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity, to treat everyone equally. But as a step-child, I\u2019m expected to protect and support my new family, to show loyalty and understanding. Now, as everyone gathered around, waiting for me to step forward, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something different, each pulling me in opposite directions."}
