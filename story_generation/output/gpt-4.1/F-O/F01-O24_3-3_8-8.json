The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was relying on. My mind raced; I knew I had to halt everything, review the new ruling, and adjust my instructions. The courtroom was silent, all eyes on me, waiting for my next words. At that moment, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a rare breach of protocol, but I\u2019d left it on for a reason. My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cDad, it\u2019s about Ben. Please call as soon as you can.\u201d Ben, my grandson, had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there for him, to keep in touch, to help him through this crisis. The weight of my robe felt heavier than ever. I was expected to be the pillar of justice, unwavering and precise, but also the steady, loving presence my family needed. I stood there, torn, the demands of the bench and my family pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
