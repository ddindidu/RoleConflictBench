My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement. I knew I should call, ask about her first day, share in her joy. That\u2019s what a good grandmother does: stays connected, celebrates milestones, makes her feel seen.\n\nBut the hospital project deadline loomed. I\u2019d just discovered a potential flaw in the fire escape plan\u2014something that could put lives at risk if not addressed immediately. As the lead architect, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail met the strictest safety codes. My team was waiting for my review, and any delay could set the whole project back.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My family expected warmth and presence; my profession demanded vigilance and precision. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
