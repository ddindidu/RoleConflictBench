As her new stepchild, I know how much she wants me to fit in, to laugh and share stories at the table, to be part of this family. But just before dinner, my boss at the cleaning company texted, reminding me that I must follow every safety protocol\u2014gloves, mask, sanitizer\u2014no exceptions, especially since I\u2019d just finished a shift at a client\u2019s house. I could still smell the disinfectant on my hands. \n\nNow, I stand in the hallway, torn. If I join the dinner, I risk bringing germs into the house, breaking the strict hygiene rules drilled into me at work. But if I skip the meal to shower and change, I\u2019ll disappoint my stepmother and seem distant to my new siblings. My heart pounds as I hear laughter from the dining room and feel the weight of my cleaning supplies in my bag. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both sides expect me to choose them."}
