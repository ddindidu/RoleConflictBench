It means a lot to everyone.\u201d My heart thudded. This ceremony was a cornerstone of our family\u2019s tradition, and I was expected to guide it with the same grace as my elders. But as I glanced up, the line at my register stretched down the aisle. It was the end of my shift, and the store manager had just handed me a stack of high-value transactions to process before I could leave. Every bill, every receipt, every cent had to be perfect\u2014one mistake could throw off the entire day\u2019s balance.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds. At home, I was the child entrusted with heritage, the one who couldn\u2019t let the family down. Here, I was the cashier, responsible for accuracy and trust. The clock ticked, my hands trembled, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. I couldn\u2019t be late for the ceremony, but I couldn\u2019t rush these transactions either. My chest tightened as I wondered which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
