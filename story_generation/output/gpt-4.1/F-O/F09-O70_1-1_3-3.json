I had just started teaching him about saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d and he was finally beginning to remember. He looked up at me, waiting for my next gentle reminder as he reached for the sugar. At the same time, the app flashed a message: \u201cUrgent delivery\u2014package must be left securely at the doorstep within 20 minutes.\u201d I knew the customer\u2019s building was across town, and if I left now, I\u2019d barely make it. But if I left, my son would be alone, and the lesson would be interrupted. My mind raced\u2014should I stay and guide him through this small but important moment, or rush out to make sure the package was safe and my job secure? Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
