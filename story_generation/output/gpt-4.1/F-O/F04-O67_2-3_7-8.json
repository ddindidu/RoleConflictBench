My brother sat beside me, his face pale, eyes darting between me and the road. He\u2019d always been the cautious one, and now, as I navigated the ambulance through sheets of rain, I could feel his anxiety radiating. \u201cSlow down,\u201d he whispered, voice tight. But in the back, a patient\u2019s life hung in the balance, every second precious. My training screamed at me to focus, to drive as quickly as safety allowed, but my brother\u2019s fear pressed on me, reminding me of our promise to always respect and understand each other. I wanted to reassure him, to show patience for his worry, but the siren\u2019s wail and the patient\u2019s labored breaths demanded my attention. My hands trembled, torn between the duty to my patient and the bond with my brother, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions as the storm raged on."}
