My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his work shirts clean for tomorrow, and the kids\u2019 soccer uniforms were buried somewhere in the pile. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014my role as a wife meant making sure everyone had what they needed, that the home was comfortable and cared for.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the factory\u2019s machines were due for their annual maintenance next week, and I was responsible for preparing the checklist and cleaning supplies. If I didn\u2019t get everything ready today, I\u2019d risk falling behind, and the shutdown window was tight. My supervisor had stressed how crucial this was for the company\u2019s production schedule. I could almost hear his voice in my head, urging me not to let anything slip.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine waiting to be loaded and the stack of maintenance manuals on the kitchen table. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my family against the demands of my job, feeling the pressure build with every passing minute."}
