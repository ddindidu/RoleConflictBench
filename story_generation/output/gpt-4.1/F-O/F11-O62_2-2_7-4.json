He\u2019d just had a fight with one of his friends, and I knew he needed me to listen, to be the patient sister who always helped him sort through his feelings. But as I started walking over, my supervisor called out about a broken lane rope. Swim lessons were about to start, and if I didn\u2019t fix it right away, the class would be delayed and the kids would be disappointed. I could see Ethan\u2019s eyes searching for comfort, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a lifeguard\u2014keeping the pool safe and running smoothly. My heart tugged in two directions: be the understanding sister Ethan expected, or fulfill my duty to the swimmers and my team. I stood there, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
