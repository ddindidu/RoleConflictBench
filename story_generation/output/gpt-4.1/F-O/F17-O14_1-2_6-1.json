The lab had finally approved my experiment slot\u2014just two hours with the specialized instruments I\u2019d been waiting months to use. My mind buzzed with hypotheses and the careful steps I needed to follow. But as I reached for my notes, my phone vibrated. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute?\u201d Lately, I\u2019d noticed the tension in her voice, the way Dad seemed quieter at dinner. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more, be there for them, ask if everything was okay. I knew they needed me, even if they didn\u2019t say it outright. But the experiment window was so tight, and if I missed it, I\u2019d have to wait weeks. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the lab and my family, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one needed me more right now."}
