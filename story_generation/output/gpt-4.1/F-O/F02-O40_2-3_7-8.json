As a father, I felt the weight of every dollar we needed\u2014groceries, rent, her school shoes. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: a client\u2019s house had severe termite damage, and they needed an urgent repair plan. As a carpenter, I knew the job would take days, maybe weeks, and the family was counting on me to make their home safe again. But if I took the job, I\u2019d have to leave my own family for long hours, maybe even overnight, and I worried about how we\u2019d manage at home. My wife expected me to be present, to help with our daughter, but the money from this job could cover our expenses for the month. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I stared at the phone, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
