Haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and hopeful, and I knew how much she valued these little gatherings. We\u2019d promised to make more time for each other, to build the kind of relationship where we didn\u2019t just pass like ships in the night. But my laptop screen glowed with the day\u2019s data, waiting to be logged. The results weren\u2019t urgent\u2014my lab manager had said the logs could wait until tomorrow\u2014but I prided myself on accuracy and consistency. If I let this slide, would it become a habit? Yet if I said no to my sister again, would she stop asking? My chest tightened as I weighed the pull of my work against the promise I\u2019d made to her, feeling the two parts of myself tugging in opposite directions."}
