The manager\u2019s hand rested gently on his shoulder, and in his small fist, he clutched a crumpled bag of chips. My heart sank. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake with firmness and compassion. I could see the fear in his eyes, and I wanted to hold him, to reassure him, but I also needed to show him that actions have consequences.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed urgently. I glanced at the screen\u2014dispatch needed me back on the radio. A cruising aircraft was requesting the routine altimeter setting. As an air traffic controller, I was expected to respond immediately, to keep the skies safe and pilots informed. My mind raced, torn between the pressing need to address my son\u2019s behavior and the professional duty that could not wait. The store\u2019s fluorescent lights seemed to flicker in time with my heartbeat as I stood there, caught between the expectations of motherhood and the demands of the tower, unsure which voice to answer first."}
