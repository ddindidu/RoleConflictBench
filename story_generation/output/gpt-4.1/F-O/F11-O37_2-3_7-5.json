My supervisor always emphasized the importance of managing supplies and never letting stocks run out. I could already hear her voice in my head, disappointed and stern, expecting me to fix the problem immediately. But just as I was about to call the supply company, my phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, texting me in frustration about a fight he\u2019d had with our parents. He wanted to talk, to have me listen and help him feel understood\u2014something I\u2019d promised I\u2019d always do as his sister. I knew he expected patience and empathy from me, especially when he felt misunderstood. But the clock was ticking, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the missing cleaning product either. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable sister who listens and the responsible cleaner who keeps everything running smoothly. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
