My grandchildren have been talking about it for weeks, and I promised I\u2019d be there early to help set up and play with them. But as I walk through my own living room, sunlight catches on the dust swirling in the air, and I notice crumbs under the table, muddy footprints by the door. The house is messier than I\u2019ve let it get in months. As the one responsible for keeping things spotless, I know I should get to work\u2014scrubbing, vacuuming, making sure everything is in order. My supervisor has been strict lately, and I can\u2019t afford to let standards slip. Yet, my heart aches at the thought of missing the laughter and stories, the chance to be the grandfather my family expects. I stand in the hallway, mop in one hand, car keys in the other, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I made to my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
