My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cHearing at 10:00 AM.\u201d It was a minor procedural matter, one I could easily postpone, but I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there. Just then, my granddaughter, Emma, appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important.\u201d She\u2019d never come to me like this before, and I could see she was struggling with something heavy. As her grandfather, I knew she needed my full attention, my wisdom, and my comfort\u2014right now, not later. But as a lawyer, I had a duty to my client, who trusted me to show up and represent them, no matter how small the case. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I looked at Emma, then at my phone, feeling the pull of two worlds I cared deeply about, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
