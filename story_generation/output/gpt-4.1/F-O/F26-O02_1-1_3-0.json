I pictured their eager faces, the way they\u2019d tug at my sleeve, wanting to show me their latest drawings or ask me to build a tower of blocks. I knew how much these moments meant, not just to them, but to me too.\n\nBut as I closed my phone, my laptop chimed with a new message from the project team. The exploratory phase was heating up, and my manager wanted fresh ideas for the new design. \u201cWe need your input on alternative solutions,\u201d the email read. I felt the familiar pull\u2014my mind already racing with possibilities, sketches forming in my head. I knew my expertise could shape the project\u2019s direction, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the laughter and warmth waiting at Sarah\u2019s and the challenge and responsibility of my work. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
