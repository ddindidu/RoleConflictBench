My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids at 3:00.\u201d I pictured their eager faces waiting at the school gate, backpacks slung over small shoulders, scanning the crowd for me. But just as I reached for my car keys, my pager shrieked\u2014a code red from the hospital. The ICU\u2019s life-support device was flashing critical fault codes. I was the only technician on call, and every second counted for the patient relying on that machine. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: my children\u2019s trust in me to be there, and the hospital\u2019s desperate need for my expertise. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, \u201cYou promised you\u2019d be there today, Mom.\u201d At the same time, I imagined the frantic nurses, the beeping alarms, the fragile life hanging in the balance. My hands trembled as I stood frozen, torn between the two places I was needed most, feeling the impossible pull of being both a mother and a machine repairer."}
