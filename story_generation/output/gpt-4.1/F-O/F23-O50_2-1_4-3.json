My heart pounded with the familiar anxiety of being a step-parent\u2014knowing I should step in, teach him about respect and discipline, but also fearing I might overstep, that my correction would be met with resentment or accusations of being too harsh. I glanced at my phone, where a reminder blinked: \u201cPrepare maintenance checklist for next week\u2019s shutdown.\u201d As a machine repairer, I prided myself on being thorough, always planning ahead to avoid costly mistakes. My supervisor expected nothing less than perfection, and I knew I needed to focus on the details, to review manuals and order parts before the scheduled maintenance. But here I was, torn between the immediate need to guide my stepson and the looming responsibility of my job. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own set of expectations. I stood frozen, caught between the urge to call out to my stepson and the nagging thought of unfinished work, unsure which role to answer first."}
