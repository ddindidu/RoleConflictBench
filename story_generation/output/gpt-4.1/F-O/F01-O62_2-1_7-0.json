My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my granddaughter. She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was lighting up with her updates. I knew how much it meant to her, and to everyone, that I respond quickly, share in her excitement, and keep the conversation going. But as I glanced up, I noticed a few swimmers drifting toward the deep end. No one seemed in trouble, but I couldn\u2019t let my attention slip for even a moment. The expectation to be present for my family tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to keep these swimmers safe. My heart thudded with the weight of both roles, the phone warm in my hand, the pool shimmering with possibility. I felt torn, caught between the joy of my granddaughter\u2019s news and the silent, watchful duty of my post."}
