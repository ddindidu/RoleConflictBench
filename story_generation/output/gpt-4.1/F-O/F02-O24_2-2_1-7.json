My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I sifted through the case files on my desk, my clerk entered, handing me a printout. \u201cJudge, the attorney in the Miller case just cited a new appellate decision from last week. It could change the direction of the hearing tomorrow.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The expectation was clear: as a judge, I needed to be fully prepared, up-to-date, and impartial. The legal community and the parties involved depended on my diligence. Yet, as a father, my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes and the memory of my promise weighed heavily on me. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
