My shift as a nursing assistant was almost over, but Mrs. Carter, who had just come out of surgery, needed help getting dressed and moving to her wheelchair. She looked at me with anxious eyes, her hands trembling as she tried to button her gown. I knew she depended on me, and the other aides were already busy. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the kids were finishing school soon, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up and hear all about their day. As their step-parent, I wanted to be there, to show them I cared, to keep my promise. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s needs pulled at me just as strongly. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on my chest. I could almost hear the kids\u2019 disappointed voices if I was late, and I could see Mrs. Carter\u2019s fear if I left her waiting. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I could give."}
