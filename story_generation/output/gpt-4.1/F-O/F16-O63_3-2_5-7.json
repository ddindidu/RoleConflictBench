My break is scheduled in five minutes, but my phone queue is still stacked, and management has sent two reminders today about sticking to our allotted times. I know if I take my break late, it\u2019ll be flagged. But my phone buzzes with a text from my spouse: \u201cCan you help vacuum before your parents arrive? I\u2019m swamped with the kitchen.\u201d The house is a mess, and we promised each other we\u2019d split the chores evenly, especially with relatives coming. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my job expects me to be a model employee, never missing a beat, while at home, I\u2019m expected to be a reliable partner, sharing the load. My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking call light, torn between logging out for my break to help at home or staying at my desk to avoid another warning from my boss. The pressure builds, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
