It was the store manager, his voice tense. My son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. I pictured his small, guilty face, waiting for me to arrive, needing guidance and discipline.\n\nBut at the same time, my other phone rang. It was Mrs. Carter, her voice anxious. The deck at her house was splintered and unsafe, and she needed it fixed today before her grandchildren visited. As a carpenter, I had promised her I\u2019d be there this afternoon. She was counting on me to keep her family safe, and my reputation depended on it.\n\nI stood in my workshop, torn between two worlds. My son needed me to be a father, to teach him a lesson he\u2019d remember. But my client needed me to be a carpenter, to deliver on my word. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt the struggle twist inside my chest as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
