Their exhaustion was written all over their faces, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. I wanted to sit with them, offer comfort, maybe make tea and just listen. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my shift at the pharmacy started in twenty minutes. \n\nAt work, a woman approached the counter, her face pinched with discomfort. \u201cWhich painkiller is best for headaches?\u201d she asked. I glanced at the clock, thinking about my parents at home, and gave her a quick answer, barely scratching the surface of what I should have explained. Guilt pricked at me. I knew I was supposed to give her more time, ask about her symptoms, make sure she felt heard. \n\nAll day, my mind bounced between the pharmacy and home. I felt pulled in two directions, unable to give enough to either. The weight of my parents\u2019 tired eyes and the patient\u2019s uncertain smile pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly be what everyone needed."}
