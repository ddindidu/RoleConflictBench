My break was scheduled for exactly 2:15, and management had made it clear\u2014no early or late breaks, not even by a minute. The phone queue was relentless, and I could almost feel my supervisor\u2019s gaze through the glass. Just as I was about to log my break, my phone buzzed with a text from my younger brother: \u201cHeading out to the store.\u201d I glanced out the window and saw him, earbuds in, stepping off the curb without looking. My heart pounded. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially after Mom\u2019s constant reminders. But if I left my desk now, even for a minute, I\u2019d be flagged for an unscheduled break\u2014again. The pressure from work and the responsibility for my brother\u2019s safety crashed together inside me, leaving me frozen, torn between the demands of my job and my family."}
