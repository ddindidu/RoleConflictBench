I nodded, feeling the weight of generations pressing on my shoulders. At the same time, my phone buzzed with an urgent email from my clerk: an attorney in a case before me had cited a new appellate decision, released just last week. The next court session was in the morning, and I needed to review the opinion thoroughly to ensure a fair and informed ruling.

I stared at the flickering candle on the table, feeling the pressure build inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left wanting."}
