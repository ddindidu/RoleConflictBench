My sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for the hiking trip they were planning. I wanted to say yes, to be present, to laugh and share stories like we used to. But my phone buzzed with a message from the office\u2014an assistant needed access to files from a case I was handling. She said it would make things easier for everyone, but the documents were confidential, and I knew the rules. My family expected me to be there, to be the sibling who showed up, but my duty as a lawyer demanded I protect my client\u2019s trust above all else. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the warmth of home and the cold clarity of my professional oath. I stared at my phone, caught in the space between what my family wanted and what my career required, unsure which part of myself I could afford to disappoint."}
