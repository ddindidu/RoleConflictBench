My partner sat across from me, eyes red, voice trembling as they described the impossible choice their boss had given them\u2014take on a risky project or risk being sidelined. They reached for my hand, searching my face for reassurance, for the steady support I\u2019d always promised. But my mind kept drifting to my patient, whose health depended on my timely intervention. I could see the expectation in my partner\u2019s eyes: to listen, to comfort, to be present. At the same time, I felt the weight of my responsibility as a doctor, knowing that a delay could mean a setback in my patient\u2019s fragile progress. My heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two, torn between the person I loved and the oath I\u2019d taken. I wanted to be everything for both, but the demands pressed in, leaving me paralyzed, unable to choose which role to answer first."}
