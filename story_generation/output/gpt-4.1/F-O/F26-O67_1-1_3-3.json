My daughter had called, reminding me to bring my famous apple pie, and my grandson was excited to show me his new bike. As a grandparent, I felt the pull to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the steady presence my family counted on. That morning, I was at the station, running through my routine check of the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit. Every bandage, every vial, every tool had to be accounted for\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cFamily gathering at 2 PM.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore. My supervisor expected me to be thorough, to never cut corners, because a missing supply could mean the difference between life and death. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family and the cold, clinical responsibility of my job. I stood there, first-aid kit open, hands trembling, torn between the call of home and the call of duty, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
