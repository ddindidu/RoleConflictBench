She smiled warmly, holding a sweater. \u201cI need to return this, dear. I lost the receipt, but you know I shop here all the time.\u201d My mind flashed to last week\u2019s family dinner, where my parents reminded me how important it was to help our community and respect our elders\u2014values I\u2019d grown up with. But as a cashier, I was expected to follow the store\u2019s strict return policy: no receipt, no return. My manager had warned us about making exceptions, and I knew there could be consequences if I didn\u2019t follow the rules. Mrs. Lee\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice urging me to be kind and helpful, but my manager\u2019s words echoed just as loudly. I hesitated, caught between honoring my family\u2019s expectations and fulfilling my responsibilities at work, unsure which path to take."}
