Mom had planned a small family dinner tonight, and everyone was expected to be there. My sister sent a photo of the table already set, and I could almost smell the familiar dishes. I knew how much these gatherings meant to my family, especially after how busy we\u2019d all been lately. But at the same time, my laptop screen glowed with diagrams and notes from the project team. We were still in the early stages, tossing around ideas for a new design, and I felt the pressure to contribute something innovative. My manager had hinted that fresh perspectives were needed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. I could hear my family laughing in the background as I weighed my options, feeling the tug of responsibility from both sides. The guilt of possibly letting someone down\u2014either my family or my team\u2014gnawed at me, and I sat frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the drive to prove myself at work."}
