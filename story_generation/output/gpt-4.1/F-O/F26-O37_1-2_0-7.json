My heart swelled; I wanted to sit with her, offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades, reassure her that uncertainty is part of every journey. But as I glanced at my gloved hands and the untouched cleaning supplies, I remembered the strict protocols my supervisor had drilled into us\u2014never touch your face, never remove your gloves, always sanitize before pausing. The checklist echoed in my mind, and I realized I hadn\u2019t finished sanitizing the counters yet. If I stopped now, I\u2019d risk contaminating the surfaces, maybe even bring germs closer to my granddaughter. Yet, her eyes searched mine, waiting for comfort only I could give. I stood there, torn between the urge to guide her and the responsibility to keep her safe, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
