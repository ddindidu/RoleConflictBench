My heart thudded with the pressure of the unannounced audit\u2014every move I made would be scrutinized for strict adherence to protocol. I straightened my posture, recalling every rule drilled into me during training. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down and saw my younger brother\u2019s name flash on the screen. He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there for him, to listen and be patient, to show him the respect he deserved even when we disagreed. But now, with the supervisor\u2019s eyes boring into me, I couldn\u2019t risk breaking focus or protocol. My brother\u2019s call was a silent plea for understanding, but my duty demanded unwavering professionalism.
