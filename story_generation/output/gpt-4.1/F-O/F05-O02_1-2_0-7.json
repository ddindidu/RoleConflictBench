She glanced up, offered a tired smile, and mentioned her day had been \u201ca bit much\u201d\u2014her boss had piled on last-minute tasks, and a coworker\u2019s offhand comment had stung more than she let on. I could see she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the kind of comfort that only comes from really hearing someone out.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. The project manager\u2019s message glared at me: \u201cNeed your estimates for the new features tonight. Can\u2019t finalize the roadmap without them.\u201d I knew the team was waiting, management was waiting, and any delay would ripple through the whole quarter. My mind raced with calculations, dependencies, and the pressure to be precise.\n\nI stood there, torn, feeling the weight of her unspoken need for support and the relentless demand for my technical input.
