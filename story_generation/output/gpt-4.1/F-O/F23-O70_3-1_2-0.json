My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in and discuss the situation immediately. My heart sank. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up for Ethan, especially now, when he needed guidance and accountability. But I glanced at the stack of packages in the back of my van\u2014one of them was already running late, and my supervisor had warned me about the importance of on-time deliveries. If I left my route now, I\u2019d risk a complaint and possibly my job. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be letting Ethan down, maybe confirming his worst fears about not being a priority. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn, the school\u2019s message open on my phone and the delivery scanner blinking in my hand, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
