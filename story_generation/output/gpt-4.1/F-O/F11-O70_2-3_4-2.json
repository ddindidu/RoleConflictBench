Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you!\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, expecting me to show up, laugh at Dad\u2019s jokes, and help set the table. But as I checked my delivery app, a new order popped up\u2014urgent medical supplies for the hospital, flagged as critical. The address was across town, and the delivery window overlapped exactly with dinner. My supervisor\u2019s earlier words echoed in my mind: \u201cLate deliveries, especially medical, are unacceptable.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family wanted me present, part of the laughter and stories, while my job demanded precision and reliability, especially when lives might depend on it. I stared at the clock, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility in my hands, feeling the knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do."}
