My family bustled around, laughing and sharing stories, expecting me to join in the tradition of preparing the meal together, just as we did every year. My mother handed me a wooden spoon, her eyes shining with pride, and I felt the weight of her expectation to honor our family\u2019s customs.\n\nBut as I reached for the ingredients, I noticed the raw chicken on the counter, the same counter where vegetables were being chopped. My mind flashed to my job as a housekeeping cleaner, where I was trained to always wear gloves and sanitize surfaces to prevent contamination. At work, following safety and hygiene protocols wasn\u2019t just a rule\u2014it was a responsibility I took seriously.\n\nYet here, in my family\u2019s kitchen, no one wore gloves or worried about cross-contamination. I hesitated, torn between my duty as a daughter to uphold our traditions and my professional commitment to cleanliness and safety. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the warmth of family and the strict standards of my other world, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
