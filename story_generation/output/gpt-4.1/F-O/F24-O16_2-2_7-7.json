My stepbrother, grinning with reckless confidence, adjusted his helmet and eyed the steep, cracked ramp. \u201cWatch this,\u201d he called, ready to attempt a trick he\u2019d only seen online. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, but he hated when I hovered. At the same time, my mind raced with the responsibility of my patient, who depended on me to prescribe the right treatment\u2014one mistake, and her health could spiral. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urge to rush to my brother\u2019s side, to stop him, to protect him, and the professional pull to step away, answer the call, and ensure my patient\u2019s care wasn\u2019t compromised. My heart pounded, torn between the ramp and the clinic, between family and duty, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
