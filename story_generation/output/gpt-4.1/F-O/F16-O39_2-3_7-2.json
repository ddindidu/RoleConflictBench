I knew I should sit down, ask what was wrong, and share how the foreman had been riding me all day. That\u2019s what we promised\u2014no bottling things up. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: \u201cCrane\u2019s here. Need you now.\u201d The crew was waiting for me to help guide a steel beam into place, and any delay could mean danger or a costly setback. My spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, silently pleading for connection, for me to be present. My mind raced\u2014if I stayed, I\u2019d break the team\u2019s trust and risk safety. If I left, I\u2019d break the trust at home, leaving worries unspoken.
