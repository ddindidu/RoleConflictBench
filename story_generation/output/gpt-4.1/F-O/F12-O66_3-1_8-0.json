It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. We\u2019d been circling around the topic of our finances for weeks, and I knew he expected me to be honest, to lay everything out so we could face it together. That\u2019s what a good wife does\u2014communicates openly, no matter how uncomfortable.\n\nBut right now, I was behind the wheel, a passenger in the backseat humming along to the radio, chatting about his upcoming lunch. He was in no rush, but I still felt the pressure to get him there safely and on time. That\u2019s what a good taxi driver does\u2014keeps the ride smooth, the customer happy, no distractions.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds.

The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in a different direction."}
