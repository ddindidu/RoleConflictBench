He was supposed to be learning table manners, and I knew I should gently correct him, remind him to sit up straight, to chew with his mouth closed. That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014teaches, guides, shapes character. But my mind kept drifting to the thick manila file that had landed on my desk just an hour ago. The case was simple, a procedural hearing in two weeks, but as a judge, I owed it to everyone involved to review every detail, to ensure fairness and justice. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPreliminary review\u2014today.\u201d I looked at my son, his eyes searching mine for approval, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Should I set aside the file and focus on being the father he needed right now, or retreat to my study and fulfill my duty to the court? The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between the demands of justice and the needs of my child."}
