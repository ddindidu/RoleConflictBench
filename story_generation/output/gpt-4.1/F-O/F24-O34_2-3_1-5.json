He\u2019d just gotten home from school, and the text was short: \u201cCan you talk? Bad day.\u201d I could picture him slumped on the couch, eyes red, needing someone to listen. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents married\u2014always be there, especially when things got rough.\n\nBut just as I started to type a reply, the radio crackled. \u201cTower, this is Delta 482, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart jumped.
