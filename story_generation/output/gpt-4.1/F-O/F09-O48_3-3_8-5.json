As a nursing assistant, I know how crucial it is to keep a close eye on Mr. Lee, whose blood pressure has been dangerously unstable all morning. Every few minutes, I check his vitals, jotting down numbers, alert for the slightest change. But in the back of my mind, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the home loan payment looming over me. Two months isn\u2019t long, and I need to pick up extra shifts if I want to make sure my family doesn\u2019t fall behind. My son\u2019s school fees, groceries, the electricity bill\u2014they all depend on me. Yet, if I ask for more hours, I\u2019ll barely see my children, and the guilt gnaws at me. The hospital expects my full attention, but so does my family. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing down on my chest as I stand by Mr. Lee\u2019s bedside, pen poised, mind racing."}
