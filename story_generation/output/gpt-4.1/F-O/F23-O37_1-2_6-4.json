Jamie\u2019s eyes had sparkled when I promised, and I could still hear his excited chatter echoing in my mind. As his step-parent, I wanted to keep my word, to show him he could trust me, that I could provide. But as I checked my bank app, the numbers glared back\u2014tight, as always. My other job as a housekeeping cleaner barely covered the bills, and now Mrs. Patel\u2019s message blinked on my phone: \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of floor cleaner. Can you bring some for Thursday?\u201d I knew she expected me to manage supplies, to keep her home spotless, and I couldn\u2019t risk losing her as a client. The cost of the Nintendo and the cleaning supplies together was more than I could afford this week. My chest tightened as I weighed Jamie\u2019s hopeful face against the risk of disappointing a client who depended on me. I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding more than I had to give, and I stood frozen, torn between keeping a promise and keeping a job."}
