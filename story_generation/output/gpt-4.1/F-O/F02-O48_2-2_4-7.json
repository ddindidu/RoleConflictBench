I know I should call him back, teach him about respect for public spaces, about discipline and self-control. That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014guides, corrects, shapes. But my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s the hospital. Mrs. Lee, my patient, is alone and anxious after her surgery. The nurse on the line says she\u2019s asking for me, her voice trembling, needing comfort and reassurance. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s wild energy, my patient\u2019s fragile fear. I want to be the father who teaches right from wrong, but I also want to be the nursing assistant who never lets a patient feel abandoned. My heart pounds as I watch my son disappear behind a stack of cereal boxes, while my mind drifts to Mrs. Lee\u2019s pale, worried face. I stand frozen, torn between the aisle and the hospital, between the demands of fatherhood and the call of compassion."}
