She chatted about her garden, and I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014a message from my daughter. \u201cGrandpa, can you come home early? Lily wants to tell everyone her big news at dinner.\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s excited face, the way she\u2019d tug at my sleeve, eager for my attention. \n\nBut the store was short-staffed tonight, and my manager had already asked if I could stay a little later. The line at my register was growing, and I could feel the customers\u2019 eyes on me, expecting the same friendly service. I wanted to be there for Lily, to be the grandparent she needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my coworkers or customers down. My heart tugged in two directions as I handed the woman her receipt, my smile faltering for just a moment."}
