My heart sank as I listened to the voicemail: my stepson had been caught bullying another student. The principal wanted me to come in immediately. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to prove I was there for the tough moments, not just the easy ones. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I glanced at the patient chart in my hand. Mrs. Carter, just out of surgery, was showing a low-grade fever and a rapid pulse. The nurse in me knew I couldn\u2019t ignore these signs; she needed close monitoring, and I was the only assistant on this floor right now. My supervisor expected me to be thorough, to never leave a patient\u2019s side when something was off. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my stepson needing guidance and support, my patient needing vigilance and care. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call from the school and the beeping monitor at Mrs. Carter\u2019s bedside, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
