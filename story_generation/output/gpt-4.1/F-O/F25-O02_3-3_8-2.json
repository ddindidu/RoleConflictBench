My phone buzzed\u2014my stepdad\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I hesitated, knowing the project team was waiting for my module to unlock the next phase. But when I answered, his voice was shaky, raw. He told me about his fears of losing his job, how he felt lost, and how he needed someone to talk to. I could hear the vulnerability in his words, the unspoken plea for comfort. At the same time, Slack notifications pinged relentlessly\u2014my manager asking for updates, teammates blocked and anxious. I felt torn, my mind split between the urgent technical problem only I could solve and the emotional support my stepdad desperately needed. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My heart raced as I stared at the screen, caught between being the engineer my team relied on and the step-child my family needed."}
