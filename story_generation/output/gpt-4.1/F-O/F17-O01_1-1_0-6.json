Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised myself I\u2019d be better about keeping in touch. But my laptop is open, blueprints scattered across the table, and my inbox is filling with updates from the construction site. As an architect, I\u2019m supposed to keep everything moving smoothly, but lately, I\u2019ve been reviewing project timelines only when I remember, trusting that things are on track. Now, a contractor\u2019s email flags a possible delay, and I feel the pressure to respond quickly, to be the reliable project manager everyone expects. My thumb hovers over my phone\u2014should I call Mom now, reassure her, or dive into the project issues before they spiral? The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my attention, and I sit there, torn, unable to give either the focus they deserve."}
