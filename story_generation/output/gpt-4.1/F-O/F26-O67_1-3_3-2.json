My daughter and her family were coming over, and I\u2019d promised my grandson we\u2019d bake his favorite cookies together. The house was filled with laughter and the smell of fresh coffee, and for a moment, I felt the warmth of being exactly where I belonged. Then, my radio crackled to life\u2014a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries reported. My heart skipped. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. My uniform hung by the door, ready for moments like this. But as I glanced at my grandson\u2019s hopeful eyes and the table set for our family meal, I felt torn in two. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and memories, but my duty demanded I leave everything behind and rush to help strangers in desperate need. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, my grandson\u2019s small hand in the other, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
