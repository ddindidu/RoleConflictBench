But as I tucked my phone away, the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, calling everyone to the daily safety briefing. It was non-negotiable\u2014miss it, and you\u2019re off the crew for the day, maybe longer. My boots were caked with mud, my hands rough from yesterday\u2019s work, but my mind was somewhere else, picturing her scanning the classroom for my face. I felt the weight of my hard hat and the heavier weight of her expectations. The team needed me focused, present, part of the unit. But my family needed me, too. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the site, torn between the whistle\u2019s sharp call and the memory of her hopeful smile, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
