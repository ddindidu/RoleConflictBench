The air felt heavy, and I knew they needed me to say something comforting, to be the bridge that kept us together. I wanted to ask if they were okay, to offer a listening ear, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: a check-in call with a new client. As I dialed, my stepdad glanced at me, his eyes silently pleading for connection. The client answered, cheerful but uncertain, and immediately asked for tips on using the new machine. I could hear the anxiety in their voice, and I knew they expected clear, patient guidance. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure my parents and the responsibility to support my client. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both at the same time."}
