She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to tell her everything\u2014how the supplier\u2019s email had landed like a bomb in my inbox, how the threat to halt shipments could cripple the company, how the numbers just didn\u2019t add up no matter how many times I checked. But as a husband, I knew she expected honesty, openness, a sharing of burdens. Yet as an accountant, I was bound by confidentiality, by the need to keep work stress from bleeding into home life, and by the professional obligation to resolve the crisis with the supplier before it became public knowledge. My phone buzzed with another message from the vendor, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I looked at my wife, words caught in my throat, torn between the urge to confide and the duty to protect both my job and our peace at home."}
