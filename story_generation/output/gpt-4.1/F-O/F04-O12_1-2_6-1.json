You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20146:15. I hadn\u2019t seen her in weeks, and I knew how much she valued these little traditions. Being there would show her I cared, that I respected our bond enough to make time for her. But my laptop screen glared back at me, code editor open, red warnings scattered across my new feature. The team\u2019s comments echoed in my mind: \u201cPerformance issues here,\u201d \u201cNeeds refactoring.\u201d I was so close to finishing, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the standards we set for ourselves. Clean, efficient code wasn\u2019t just a checkbox\u2014it was my responsibility to the team. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable brother who shows up, or the dependable developer who delivers quality work. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
