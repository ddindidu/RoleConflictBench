My mind raced, not just with police protocol, but with the echo of my stepfather\u2019s words from last night\u2019s family dinner. \u201cWe must never forget our traditions, even when the world changes around us,\u201d he\u2019d said, eyes fixed on me. Our family had always gathered at the old bakery on Fridays, a ritual that meant everything to my stepmother, especially since my father passed. But now, the bakery was the target\u2014my family inside, clinging to their customs, unaware of the danger.\n\nAs I parked outside, I saw the familiar faces through the window, huddled together, the old bread oven glowing behind them. My training screamed at me to act fast, to protect everyone, to enforce the law. But my heart twisted with the weight of my family\u2019s expectations, their need for unity and tradition. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the duty to my badge and the pull of my family\u2019s trust, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be at risk."}
