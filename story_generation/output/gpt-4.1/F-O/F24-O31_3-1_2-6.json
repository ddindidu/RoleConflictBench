The owner was my stepbrother, and I\u2019d just seen him rush inside, his face pale and eyes red. He\u2019d called me earlier, voice trembling, telling me our mother\u2019s test results were bad\u2014worse than we\u2019d feared. As a step-sibling, I knew he needed me, needed someone to lean on, someone to show understanding in this moment of crisis. But as a police officer, I was expected to treat everyone equally, to uphold the law without favoritism. The rules were clear: no exceptions, even for family. My heart ached as I watched him through the glass doors, shoulders shaking. I could feel the weight of my badge pressing against my chest, a constant reminder of my duty. Yet, the urge to protect him, to offer a small kindness in a terrible day, gnawed at me. I gripped the ticket book tighter, torn between the uniform I wore and the bond we shared, caught in the impossible space between compassion and responsibility."}
