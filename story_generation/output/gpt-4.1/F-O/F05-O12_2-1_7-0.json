The module I was working on was a mess, but with the generous deadline, I could afford to take my time and refactor it properly. Clean, maintainable code was always my goal, and I felt a quiet satisfaction knowing I could do it right this time.\n\nBut then I heard the soft sigh from the living room. My wife sat curled up on the couch, her eyes distant, worry etched across her face. I remembered our promise to communicate openly, to share our burdens instead of carrying them alone. She needed me to listen, to be present, to ask her what was wrong and really hear her answer.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I left my work now, I\u2019d lose my flow, and the code would stay tangled for another day. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019d built, ignoring the silent plea in her eyes. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, torn, unable to move."}
