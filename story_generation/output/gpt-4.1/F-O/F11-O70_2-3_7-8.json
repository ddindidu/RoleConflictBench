He\u2019d had a rough day, and I knew he needed someone to listen, someone who wouldn\u2019t judge him for his mistakes. As his sister, I always tried to be patient, to remind myself that we\u2019re different people and that respect meant accepting those differences. But just as I was about to call him, my work phone rang. A customer, frustrated and impatient, wanted to know why their package hadn\u2019t arrived. I could hear the irritation in their voice, and as a delivery person, I was expected to remain calm, polite, and professional, even though I\u2019d just learned the package had been misplaced. My brother\u2019s message blinked on my screen, a silent plea for understanding, while the customer\u2019s voice pressed for answers. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be someone different. My heart pounded as I tried to decide who needed me more in that moment."}
