My mind was half on the project deadlines\u2014two weeks left, and the contractor kept texting about delays. I scrolled through emails, making mental notes to follow up, but my focus kept slipping. Across from me, my spouse stirred their tea, eyes distant, lips pressed tight. I knew that look. Something was wrong. The expectation was clear: we promised to talk openly, to share our worries. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety gnawed at me. I should be double-checking the site reports, not just skimming them. The team depended on me to keep things moving, to catch problems before they grew. Yet here was my partner, waiting for me to ask, to listen, to be present. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the person I loved, and toward the work that defined me. I closed my laptop halfway, torn between the urge to reach out and the pressure to stay on top of my projects, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in."}
