The plans were due tomorrow, and I kept picturing the emergency routes, the flow of patients and staff, every detail needing to be perfect. Suddenly, I realized my son had darted away, weaving between aisles, giggling. Other shoppers glanced over, some frowning. I felt the familiar pressure: as a parent, I needed to teach him discipline, to show him boundaries and respect for others. But my mind was still half in the hospital, worrying about the placement of the operating rooms, the width of the corridors. I wanted to kneel down, speak calmly, guide him back to me, but my phone buzzed with a message from my project manager\u2014another urgent question about the design. My heart pounded. I was torn between the expectation to be a present, guiding parent and the demand to deliver a flawless, life-saving design. I stood there, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
