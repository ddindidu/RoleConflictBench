I really need you.\u201d I could hear the strain in his words, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless he was truly struggling. As his sister, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, especially when he\u2019s feeling low. But just as I was about to call him, an email notification popped up on my laptop. It was from one of our vendors, a standard payment confirmation that required a formal reply. As an accountant, I\u2019m expected to respond promptly and professionally, keeping our business relationships smooth and reliable.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. My brother\u2019s needs felt urgent, but so did my responsibility to my job. If I delayed the reply, it might reflect poorly on our company. If I ignored my brother, I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019ve built. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension rise as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
