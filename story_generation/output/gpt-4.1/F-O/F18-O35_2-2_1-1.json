Had a rough day.\u201d I could picture him, slumped on the couch, eyes red from holding back tears after another fallout with his friends. My heart twisted\u2014I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d always be there, especially when things got hard. But the break whistle sounded, and I had to return to the operator\u2019s cabin. The control panel blinked with a warning: a minor signal delay ahead. I needed to adjust the train\u2019s speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost time. Hundreds of passengers depended on me to get them home safely and on schedule. My brother\u2019s message tugged at me, but so did the responsibility of the train. I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to call him and the duty to focus on the tracks, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
