I knew something was wrong\u2014they\u2019d been quiet all evening. As a partner, I wanted to reach out, to ask what was on their mind, to share my own frustrations from work. I owed them honesty and support, and I could feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. Dispatch was calling: a major traffic accident on the highway, multiple vehicles involved. As a police officer, I was needed immediately to secure the scene and protect lives. My spouse looked up, concern deepening, and I saw the silent plea for connection in their eyes. Torn between the duty to my community and the promise I\u2019d made to be present at home, I felt the two worlds collide inside me, each demanding more than I could give."}
