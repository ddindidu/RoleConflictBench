Can you pick up some things after work?\u201d My heart sinks a little. As a mother, I know I need to make sure there\u2019s food on the table, that my kids have what they need. The extra shifts I\u2019ve been picking up as a nursing assistant are the only way to keep us afloat right now. \n\nBut as I step into Mrs. Carter\u2019s room, I see her eyes light up. She\u2019s been waiting for me, her only visitor today. She reaches for my hand, her voice trembling as she tells me about her granddaughter\u2019s birthday she\u2019ll miss. I know she needs me to stay, to listen, to be present. My mind races\u2014if I leave early, I can get to the store before it closes, but if I cut this visit short, I\u2019ll be letting Mrs. Carter down. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I feel torn, caught between the needs of my family and the needs of my patient, unsure which part of me to disappoint."}
