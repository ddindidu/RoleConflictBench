She\u2019d called earlier, reminding me how important it was to be there, how our traditions kept us close. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, \u201cYou know how much it means to your grandmother.\u201d At the same time, my inbox pinged with a reminder about the tax law seminar scheduled for the same evening. My manager had emphasized its importance, hinting that attending would show my commitment to staying ahead in our ever-changing field. I knew missing it could set me back, but missing the family dinner would disappoint everyone, especially my mother. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations\u2014one rooted in love and heritage, the other in professionalism and ambition. I felt torn, the pressure building as I tried to imagine how I could possibly be in two places at once, wishing the choice didn\u2019t have to be mine."}
