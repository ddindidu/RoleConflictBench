I promised them I\u2019d be there on time today, not like last week when I was late. But as I pulled up to the curb for my last fare, a passenger climbed in, clutching a dripping ice cream cone. I winced as a glob landed on the backseat. My heart pounded. The company expects spotless cars, and I\u2019d get a warning if the supervisor found a mess. But if I stopped to clean up, I\u2019d be late picking up my children\u2014again. I could already imagine their disappointed faces, the teacher\u2019s disapproving glance. My hands tightened on the wheel. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
