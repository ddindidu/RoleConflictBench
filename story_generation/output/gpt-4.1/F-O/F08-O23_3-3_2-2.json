The merger contract was dense, and the deadline for review loomed. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my granddaughter, Emma, her name lighting up with urgency. She entered the room, eyes red, voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d She needed guidance, the kind only a grandmother could give, and I saw the weight of her worry. But the contract\u2019s clauses gnawed at my mind; if I didn\u2019t catch a loophole now, my client could face disaster. Emma\u2019s expectation was for me to listen, to offer wisdom and comfort. My client\u2019s expectation was for sharp focus and immediate action. My heart pulled toward Emma, but my mind raced with legal consequences. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the grandmother Emma needed and the lawyer my client depended on."}
