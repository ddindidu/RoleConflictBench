Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how she missed Dad, how the house felt too quiet. She looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of support she used to give me when I was little. I wanted to reach out, to listen, to be the child she needed. But my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the plant. The old packaging machine, the one that only runs during slow periods, was acting up again. The line manager needed me to diagnose the glitch before the next shift. My mind raced with possible causes, error codes, and the pressure to keep production on track. I felt torn, my heart pulled toward my mother\u2019s pain, my mind yanked toward the technical problem waiting for me. Both needed me, right now, in completely different ways. I stared at my hands, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could let down."}
