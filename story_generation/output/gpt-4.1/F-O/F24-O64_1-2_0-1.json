My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over every so often, making sure I keep the line moving. I know I can\u2019t afford mistakes; every transaction has to be perfect, every customer greeted with a polite nod. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I know it\u2019s my stepbrother. He\u2019s been texting all morning, panicking about his final exam. He needs me\u2014he always says I\u2019m the only one who can calm him down. I promised I\u2019d be there for him, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through together. But right now, I\u2019m trapped behind the register, the beep of the scanner drowning out my thoughts. I can\u2019t just walk away, not with the queue growing and my supervisor watching. My heart pounds with guilt and frustration, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I made to my brother. I stare at the next customer, my mind racing, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
