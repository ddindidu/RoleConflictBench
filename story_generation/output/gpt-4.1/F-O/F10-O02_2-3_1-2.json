It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014our weekly call. I glance at the clock: 7:03 p.m. I should have wrapped up by now, but the code on my screen blinks with errors, and the team\u2019s messages pile up in the group chat. The project manager\u2019s last note is clear: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your module is done.\u201d I know everyone is waiting on me, and the deadline is tomorrow morning.\n\nBut my parents expect this call. Every week, I hear the relief in their voices when I ask about their health, their garden, the neighbors. They worry if I miss it, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way. My fingers hover over the mouse, torn between opening the video call app and diving back into the code. My heart pounds with guilt and frustration, caught between being the reliable daughter my parents need and the dependable engineer my team expects. The phone keeps ringing, and I can\u2019t decide which world to answer first."}
