It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014time for my weekly call with Mom and Dad. I know they\u2019re waiting, probably sitting together on the couch, eager to hear about my week and to tell me about the neighbor\u2019s new dog or Dad\u2019s latest gardening project. I promised them I\u2019d never miss these calls, especially since I moved out of state.\n\nBut my work phone flashes with a new email: the supplier\u2019s subject line is in all caps, \u201cFINAL NOTICE.\u201d If I don\u2019t resolve this overdue invoice tonight, our production line could grind to a halt tomorrow. My manager expects me to handle it, no excuses. I can already imagine the fallout if I don\u2019t respond immediately.\n\nI glance at my personal phone, then at my work laptop. My parents\u2019 faces float in my mind, their voices warm and expectant. At the same time, the weight of my professional responsibility presses down on me. My heart pounds as I sit at my desk, torn between the comfort of family and the urgency of my job, unable to silence the demands of either."}
