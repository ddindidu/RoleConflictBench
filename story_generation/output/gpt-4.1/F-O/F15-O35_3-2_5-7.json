I answered, heart pounding, and learned he\u2019d been caught stealing snacks at the corner store. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the mandatory pre-shift briefing on new operational procedures was about to start. Missing it could mean disciplinary action or even jeopardizing passenger safety. My supervisor expected me to be punctual and focused, but my son needed me to be present, to guide him through this mistake. I could hear his small, shaky voice in the background, and my chest tightened. I stood in the subway staff room, torn between the duty to my child and the responsibility to my job, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
