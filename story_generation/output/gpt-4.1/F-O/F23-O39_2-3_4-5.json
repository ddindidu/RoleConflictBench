I knew I should call him back, remind him about respect and safety, about not disturbing others. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does\u2014teaches right from wrong, sets boundaries. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a video call from the site. On the screen, I saw my coworker, oblivious, about to walk under a suspended load. My heart pounded. I needed to shout, to warn him, to keep the site safe\u2014my responsibility as a laborer. But my stepson was still running wild, and people were starting to stare. I felt torn, my voice caught between two worlds: one demanding I guide a child, the other insisting I protect a colleague. My hands shook on the cart, caught in the impossible pull of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
