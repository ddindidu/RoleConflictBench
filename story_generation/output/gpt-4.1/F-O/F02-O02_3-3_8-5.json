The list of safety concerns was longer than I\u2019d hoped, and the urgency in his voice still echoed in my mind. If I didn\u2019t address these issues immediately, the plant could be shut down, and the consequences for the company\u2014and my job\u2014would be severe. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the home loan repayment was due in two months. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My family depended on me to keep us financially secure, especially with the looming payment. But the work ahead would mean late nights, maybe weekends, and I\u2019d barely see my kids. My wife had already mentioned how distant I\u2019d become, and I could see the worry in her eyes. I wanted to be present for them, to reassure them that everything would be okay. But right now, the demands of my job and my responsibilities as a father were pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
