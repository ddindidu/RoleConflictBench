My mom\u2019s message popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t be late! We\u2019re counting on you for the toast.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant. As the oldest brother, I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially after a tough year. But as I pulled up to the next address, my work phone vibrated with a new delivery notification\u2014urgent, the customer had requested a specific time, and I was already cutting it close. I could picture the customer waiting, maybe tracking my van on their app, expecting a friendly, professional handoff. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cCustomer satisfaction is everything.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility of my job. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
