The family gathering was set for six, and I\u2019d promised my daughter I\u2019d be there early to help with the grandkids. But right now, I was standing behind a young woman in my chair, her eyes fixed on her reflection, lips pressed tight. She\u2019d asked for a warm chestnut, but the colour looked a shade too dark under the harsh lights. I could see the disappointment in her face, and I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to fix it, to make her feel beautiful and heard. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my son\u2014\u201cGrandma, are you coming soon?\u201d The tug in my chest was real. My family wanted me present, laughing and sharing stories, not running late with dye-stained hands. Yet, my client needed me too, and I couldn\u2019t just rush her out the door. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of myself to let down."}
