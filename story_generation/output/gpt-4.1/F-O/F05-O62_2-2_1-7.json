She\u2019d just told me about the promotion offer at work, the one that would mean longer hours and more responsibility. She looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance, for the kind of support she\u2019d always counted on. I reached for her hand, ready to listen, to help her sort through her worries. But through the window, I caught sight of the pool. A group of teenagers was gathering at the deep end, laughing, edging dangerously close to the no-diving signs. My heart thudded. As a lifeguard, I knew I had to act\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. But my wife\u2019s voice trembled, pulling me back. She needed me, right now, to be her partner, her confidant. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. My mind raced, caught between the urgent call of duty outside and the quiet plea for support beside me."}
