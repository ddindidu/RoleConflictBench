She wanted me to open up, to share more than just the surface details. I could feel her expectation, the gentle pressure to let her in. I started to mention something odd that happened at work, but my mind flashed back to the construction site, the clang of metal, the dust in the air. I remembered seeing a coworker, distracted, about to walk under a suspended load. My heart pounded as I realized I had to shout, to break the silence and keep everyone safe, even if it meant drawing attention or seeming harsh. Now, at home, I hesitated. If I told her about the incident, would she worry? Would I sound careless or too intense? I wanted to be honest, to communicate openly, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility at work, the need to always be alert, to keep things safe and orderly. The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, caught between what I owed to her and what I owed to the job."}
