Today was the day of our family\u2019s annual ancestor ceremony, and my mother had asked me to lead the prayers this year. It was an honor, a responsibility passed down through generations, and I knew how much it meant to her. But as I dressed in my uniform, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of my morning shift at the care home. Mrs. Lee, one of my regular patients, needed her vitals checked at 7:00 sharp. The ceremony at home was set to begin at the same time. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it was to keep our traditions alive, especially now that my grandmother was gone. At the same time, I pictured Mrs. Lee waiting for me, trusting me to care for her health. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and my duty to my patients. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, prayer book in the other, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
