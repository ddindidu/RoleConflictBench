He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to tell him everything\u2014to communicate openly, as we promised each other we would. But my mind kept drifting back to the accident scene from earlier, the screech of tires, the chaos, the responsibility pressing on my shoulders as I directed traffic and comforted shaken drivers. As a police officer, I was expected to protect everyone, to keep the city safe, and sometimes that meant carrying burdens I couldn\u2019t share. But as a wife, I was supposed to let him in, to trust him with my worries. I felt the words catch in my throat, torn between the duty to shield the public and the need to be honest with the person I loved most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I hesitated, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
