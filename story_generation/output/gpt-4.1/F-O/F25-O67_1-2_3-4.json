She always said that honoring these traditions meant we were truly a family, and I wanted to show her I belonged. The laughter from the living room made me smile, but my radio crackled to life on my belt. Dispatch called: a woman had fallen and broken her arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My heart pounded. I knew the expectation\u2014get there fast, stabilize her, manage her pain. But my stepmother\u2019s eyes met mine from across the room, silently pleading for me to stay, to be part of this family moment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the warmth of the home I was trying to build and the urgent responsibility to a stranger in pain. My hands trembled as I reached for my keys, torn between the call of duty and the call of family, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
