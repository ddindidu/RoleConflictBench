I knew I should open up, share the stress I\u2019d been carrying from work, and listen to their concerns. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honest communication, no matter how tired or distracted we felt. As I reached for their hand, my radio crackled. I glanced out the window and saw a child flailing in the deep end of the pool, a place strictly off-limits for kids. My heart lurched. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules and act immediately to keep everyone safe. But my spouse\u2019s eyes pleaded for my attention, for the conversation we both needed. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My mind raced, caught between the urgency outside and the vulnerability inside our room, not knowing which responsibility to answer first."}
