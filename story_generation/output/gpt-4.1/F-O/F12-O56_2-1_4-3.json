The basket was overflowing, and my husband had just reminded me that our daughter needed her soccer uniform clean for tomorrow. I promised I\u2019d handle it, but as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the salon\u2014my next client, Mrs. Lee, was already in the chair, waiting for a quick fix to her fringe. She was always so understanding, but I knew how much she valued her appointments with me. I could almost hear her gentle voice, \u201cJust a little trim, if you have time.\u201d My mind raced. If I left the laundry, my family would be frustrated, but if I kept Mrs. Lee waiting, I\u2019d risk disappointing a loyal client. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen between the laundry room and the front door, torn by the demands of being a good wife and a dedicated hairdresser."}
