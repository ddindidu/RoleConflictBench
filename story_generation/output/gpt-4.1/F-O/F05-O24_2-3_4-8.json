The kids\u2019 uniforms needed to be ready for tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised to help more around the house. My phone buzzed with a reminder: I had to be in court in an hour. As I slipped on my suit, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in.\n\nIn the courtroom, I was deep into jury instructions when my clerk rushed over, eyes wide, and handed me a note. The Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent my instructions relied on. I could feel the jurors\u2019 eyes on me, waiting. I knew I had to stop, review the new ruling, and rewrite everything on the spot. My mind raced\u2014if I delayed, the trial would be thrown into chaos, but if I rushed, I might misapply the law. At the same time, I remembered the half-finished laundry at home, the promise I\u2019d made to my wife, and the guilt of letting her down again. I stood there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
