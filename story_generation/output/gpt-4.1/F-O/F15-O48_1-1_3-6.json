My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was the hospital. Mrs. Carter, my favorite patient, was having a rough morning and had asked for me specifically. She\u2019d been so lonely since her family moved away, and I knew how much she depended on our daily chats. I glanced at my son, his big eyes searching mine for approval, for guidance. At the same time, I felt the weight of Mrs. Carter\u2019s loneliness, her need for comfort. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward my child, who needed my patience and presence, and the other toward my patient, who needed my compassion and support. I could feel the expectations pressing in, both roles demanding all of me at once, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need should come first."}
