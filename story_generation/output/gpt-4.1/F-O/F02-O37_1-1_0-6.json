My shift as a housekeeping cleaner was almost over, but I still had to finish sanitizing the staff restroom. The supervisor had reminded us again this morning: gloves must be worn at all times, no exceptions. I fumbled with the box of gloves, my mind drifting to my kids. School would be out in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019d promised to be there at the gate, just like I always tried to be. They looked for me, waving through the crowd, their faces lighting up when they spotted me. I couldn\u2019t let them down. But if I rushed and skipped the gloves, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking a warning or worse. If I took the time to do it right, I might be late, and my kids would be left waiting, wondering if I\u2019d forgotten. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the father my children needed and the responsible worker my job demanded."}
