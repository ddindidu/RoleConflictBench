My mind drifts to home, where my son is supposed to be practicing his daily manners\u2014saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d helping his mother set the table. I promised myself I\u2019d guide him, teach him right from wrong, but here I am, stuck at work, watching the clock tick by. The beep of the scanner pulls me back. I can\u2019t afford mistakes; every transaction must be perfect, every receipt correct. My manager expects nothing less. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my wife: \u201cHe\u2019s refusing to help again. Can you talk to him?\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down. My son needs my guidance, but these customers need my attention. I grip the scanner tighter, heart pounding, torn between the father I want to be and the employee I have to be."}
