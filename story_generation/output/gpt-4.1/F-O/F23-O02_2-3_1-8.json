The open class at Mia\u2019s school was circled in bright red\u2014her first since I became her step-parent. She\u2019d asked me twice this week if I\u2019d be there, her eyes hopeful, and I\u2019d promised I would. But just as I was about to leave for the day, my manager called an urgent meeting. The client was waiting for my time estimates to finalize the contract, and the whole project hinged on my input. My team was counting on me to be thorough and precise; any mistake could cost us the deal. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Mia\u2019s trust and excitement, my team\u2019s reliance and the company\u2019s expectations.

I felt torn, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
