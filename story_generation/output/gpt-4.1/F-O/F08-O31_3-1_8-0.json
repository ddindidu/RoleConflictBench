As a police officer, I was expected to respond quickly, enforce the law, and keep the peace. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d My grandson was struggling, and my family needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one a badge, the other a knitted shawl. I knew the neighbors expected me to handle the party, to be firm and fair. But my family expected warmth, understanding, and my undivided attention in their moment of crisis. My heart tugged in two directions, the flashing lights outside the party house competing with the silent plea from my family. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between duty and love, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
