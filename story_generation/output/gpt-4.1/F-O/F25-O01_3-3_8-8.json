The project deadline was looming, and every minute counted. My phone buzzed\u2014Mom. I hesitated, but answered. Her voice was shaky, and she told me about a fight with Dad, her fears about the future, how lost she felt. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d come to rely on since marrying Dad. I glanced at my screen\u2014another urgent message from the site manager. My mind split in two: one part desperate to comfort Mom, the other calculating how much time I could spare before the project slipped further behind. I could hear the expectation in her voice, the same way I felt the weight of my team\u2019s reliance on me. My heart pounded as I tried to be present for her, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the project, the deadlines, the people waiting for my decisions. I felt torn, unable to give either side what they needed from me, caught between being the supportive step-child and the responsible architect."}
