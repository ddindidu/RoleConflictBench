As his sister, I knew how much it meant to him that I be there, cheering him on, making him feel seen and supported. But just as I was about to leave work, my phone buzzed with a last-minute delivery assignment. The customer was waiting for an urgent package, and as a delivery person, I was expected to be prompt, polite, and professional, no matter what. My supervisor made it clear that any delay would reflect poorly on me and the company. I stared at my phone, torn between the joy of being there for my brother and the responsibility of my job. My heart pounded as I imagined my family waiting, my brother scanning the room for me, while at the same time picturing the customer growing impatient, expecting courteous service. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
