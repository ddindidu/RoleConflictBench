My phone buzzed again with another message from my brother: \u201cAre you coming? Mom\u2019s asking.\u201d Tonight was the family dinner\u2014my mother\u2019s birthday, no less. I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant, hoping I\u2019d be there to laugh and share stories. But in front of me sat a chemotherapy prescription, the kind that demanded every ounce of my attention. The dosage was complicated, the margin for error razor-thin. I knew the patient\u2019s life depended on my focus, on my precision. Yet, my family was waiting, plates set, candles lit, expecting me to be present, to be a sister. My hands trembled as I double-checked the calculations, my mind torn between the sterile, fluorescent-lit pharmacy and the cozy, laughter-filled dining room at home.
