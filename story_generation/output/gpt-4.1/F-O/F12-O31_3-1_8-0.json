He wanted honesty, full transparency\u2014he needed to know if we could keep up with the payments, if I was hiding any more bad news. I owed him that as his wife, to communicate openly, to be his partner in every sense. My phone buzzed, interrupting our tense conversation. Dispatch reported a noise complaint\u2014our own neighbors, just two doors down, were hosting a loud party. As a police officer, I was expected to respond, to enforce the law impartially, even if it meant confronting people I knew. My husband\u2019s voice faded as I stared at my badge, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. He needed my honesty and presence; the community needed my authority and fairness. I felt torn, the expectations of wife and officer pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
