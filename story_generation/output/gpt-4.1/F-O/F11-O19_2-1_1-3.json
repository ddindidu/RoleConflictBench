It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I could almost hear the anxiety in his words, and my heart clenched. He never reached out unless he really needed me. As his sister, I knew I should be there, to listen, to comfort him\u2014especially since he\u2019d been struggling lately.\n\nBut at that moment, a customer approached, clutching a box of painkillers. \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me which one is best for headaches?\u201d she asked, her voice tired. As a pharmacist, I was expected to provide clear, careful advice, even for simple questions. I glanced at my phone, then at the customer, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother needed me, but so did this patient. I could feel my chest tighten, torn between the urge to step away and call him, and the responsibility to give my patient the attention she deserved. The seconds stretched, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, not knowing which to choose."}
