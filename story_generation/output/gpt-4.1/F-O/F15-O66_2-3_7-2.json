My passenger in the back seat kept glancing at his watch, his voice tight with urgency\u2014he had to make his flight, he said, it was international, he couldn\u2019t miss it. I nodded, feeling the pressure mount. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, no matter the weather. But as a parent, I knew every fare mattered; my family was counting on me to bring home enough for groceries, for rent, for everything. The roads were slick, and I could barely see the lane lines, but if I canceled the ride or drove too slowly, I might lose the fare\u2014and the tip. If I rushed, I risked an accident, and what would happen to my kids if something happened to me? My heart pounded as I weighed the risks, torn between the demands of the job and the needs of my family, the storm outside nothing compared to the one inside me."}
