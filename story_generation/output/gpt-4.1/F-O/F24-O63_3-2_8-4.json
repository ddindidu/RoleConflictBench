Only an hour left, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, when I caught a glimpse of my stepbrother through the window. He was fiddling with his phone, heading straight for the busy street outside our house, not even glancing up at the traffic. My heart pounded. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe\u2014Mom had said so when we first moved in together. But if I left my desk now, I\u2019d lose precious minutes, maybe miss my last chance to make those sales. The pressure from work and the responsibility at home crashed together inside me, leaving me frozen, headset in hand, torn between the ringing phone and the open window."}
