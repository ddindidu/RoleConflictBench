But as I walk through the living room, I notice the dust gathering on the shelves, the crumbs on the floor, and the streaks on the windows. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need spotless results, every shift.\u201d I know if I don\u2019t tackle the mess now, it\u2019ll only get worse, and I\u2019ll fall behind on my cleaning schedule. But if I delay the call, my parents will worry, maybe even think I\u2019m avoiding them. They look forward to these weekly chats, and I know how much it means to them to hear my voice and updates about my life. My hands hover between the phone and the cleaning supplies, my heart pounding with the weight of both expectations. I can\u2019t seem to choose which role to fulfill first, feeling torn between being a good son and a responsible cleaner."}
