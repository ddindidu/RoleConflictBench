Family holidays meant everything to me, a chance to show I was still present in their lives, even as the years piled on. But as the whistle blew, signaling the end of our shift, my foreman\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone\u2014clean up your area before you go. Safety first.\u201d I looked around at the scattered debris, the dust, the tools left out. If I left now, I\u2019d be shirking my responsibility, risking someone\u2019s safety tomorrow. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the call, the chance to be the grandparent my family expected. My hands tightened around the broom, torn between the duty to my crew and the love for my family, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as the sun dipped behind the half-finished building."}
