My family laughed and shared stories, and I knew how much it meant to them that I was here, upholding our traditions. My father caught my eye and smiled, proud that I\u2019d made time for this. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from QA about the UI glitch. It wasn\u2019t critical, but users were starting to notice, and my team expected me to jump in and fix it quickly. I could picture my manager\u2019s face, the silent expectation that I\u2019d be responsive, even during the holidays. My laptop was in my bag, just a few steps away. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the warmth and belonging of my family, the responsibility and urgency of my work. My heart raced as I tried to decide which expectation I should meet, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
