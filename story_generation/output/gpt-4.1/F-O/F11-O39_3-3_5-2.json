It means a lot to Mom.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, full of hope and expectation. I wanted to be there, to laugh with my family, to be the reliable sister who never misses a celebration. But the roar of the construction site snapped me back. The foreman\u2019s shout cut through the noise: \u201cWe need you on the beam, now!\u201d The crane was already swinging the massive steel beam into place, and I was the only one close enough to help guide it. My gloves were slick with sweat, my heart pounding. If I left now, the crew would be short-handed, and the job could stall\u2014or worse, someone could get hurt. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, the urgent demands of my job on the other. I stood frozen, caught between the warmth of home and the cold steel of responsibility, not knowing which way to turn."}
