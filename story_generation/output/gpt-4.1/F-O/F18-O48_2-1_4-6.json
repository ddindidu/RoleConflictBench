Mom had sent a gentle reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d I could almost smell the familiar dishes, feel the warmth of home. But here I was, sitting beside Mrs. Carter in her small, quiet room at the care facility. She looked at me with hopeful eyes, her hands trembling slightly as she spoke about her late husband and the loneliness that crept in during evenings like this. My supervisor had reminded me earlier that companionship was just as important as medication, especially for patients like Mrs. Carter. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family expecting my presence, my patient needing my support. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and responsibility swirling inside me as I tried to decide where I was needed most tonight."}
