The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in half an hour, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, and I could still see her hopeful eyes as she hugged me goodbye this morning. But as I made my way around the pool, clipboard in hand, I noticed a few of the pool chairs were out of place. Not a safety hazard, but not up to the standards I was expected to maintain as the head lifeguard. My supervisor had been clear: every detail mattered, and I was responsible for the facility\u2019s appearance. I could hear the echo of her voice reminding me that even small lapses could reflect poorly on the team. I stood there, torn, the weight of my daughter\u2019s expectations pressing against the professional pride and responsibility I felt for my job. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
