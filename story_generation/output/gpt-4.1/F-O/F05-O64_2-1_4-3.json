The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d handle it before my shift, but now, standing behind the register at work, my mind kept drifting back home. The store was quiet, and as I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected a full report, and I knew I\u2019d have to stay late to sort it out. But if I did, the laundry wouldn\u2019t get done, and I\u2019d let my family down. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: be a reliable husband, be a responsible cashier. Both roles demanded my attention, and I felt pulled in two directions, unable to ignore either responsibility."}
