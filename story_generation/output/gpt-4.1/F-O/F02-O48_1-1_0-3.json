My shift as a nursing assistant was in full swing, and I still had two more patients to check before the end of my morning rounds. Mrs. Lee was waiting for her blood pressure to be taken, and I could see the anxious look in her eyes. I knew how important it was to be thorough and gentle, to make sure every reading was accurate and every patient felt cared for. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my kids would be finishing school soon. Today was special; they had asked me to pick them up and hear about their day, something I\u2019d promised after missing the last school event. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me. My patients needed me to be present and attentive, but my children needed their father, waiting at the school gate, hoping to see my face. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which way to turn."}
