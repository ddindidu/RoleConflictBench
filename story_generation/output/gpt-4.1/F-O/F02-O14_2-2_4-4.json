My laptop bag is slung over my shoulder, filled with hastily scribbled notes and half-finished data summaries. I know I need to finalize my report before the meeting, but right now, I\u2019m in the supermarket with my son. He darts between aisles, giggling, his small feet pattering against the linoleum. Other shoppers glance over, some with smiles, others with frowns. I know I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why running in public spaces isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014teaches discipline and moral values, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cMeeting in 30 minutes.\u201d My mind races with the expectation to present my research accurately, to not let my team down. I feel torn, my heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my son\u2019s need for guidance and my responsibility as a scientist. I stand frozen, caught between the demands of fatherhood and the pressures of my profession, unsure which role to answer first."}
