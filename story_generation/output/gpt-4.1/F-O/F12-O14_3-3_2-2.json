We need you now.\u201d My heart pounded. This was the moment I\u2019d waited months for\u2014the rare atmospheric conditions I needed to finally test my hypothesis. If I missed this, the data would be lost, and with the funding review looming, my research could stall for another year.\n\nBut across the room, my husband sat hunched on the couch, eyes red and distant. He\u2019d barely spoken all morning, and I knew he was barely holding it together. He needed me\u2014my presence, my reassurance, my arms around him. I could see the silent plea in his eyes, the expectation that I would be there, as I always had been, to help him weather this storm.\n\nI felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me.
