The trial had been long and complex, and now it was up to me to write the final judgment\u2014thirty days to craft a clear, thorough opinion that would affect real lives. My mind kept circling the evidence, the legal standards, the weight of responsibility. But my focus was shattered by the sound of wheels scraping pavement. I looked up to see my stepbrother, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp at the end of our driveway. He grinned, announcing he was about to try a new trick he\u2019d seen online. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But the clock was ticking on my judicial deadline, and the pressure to deliver a flawless, timely judgment pressed on my chest. I felt torn\u2014should I close the laptop and rush to his side, or trust he\u2019d be fine and keep working?
