The guilt gnaws at me as I pull on my uniform, the siren of my phone cutting through my thoughts. Dispatch is calling\u2014there\u2019s a patient with a broken leg across town, nothing life-threatening, but I know the city traffic will be a nightmare at this hour. My mind races with the expectations: at home, I\u2019m supposed to keep things running smoothly, to share the load, to be present. On the road, I\u2019m trusted to get there fast, but safe, to focus only on the patient and the rules of the road. My heart pounds as I grab my keys, torn between the pile of laundry and the blaring urgency of my job. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding I choose which promise to break."}
