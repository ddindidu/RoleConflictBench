Suddenly, I saw him slip a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable. But just as I was about to confront him, my phone buzzed\u2014a text from my foreman. There was a spill at the site, and I was the only one nearby who could clean it up before someone got hurt. I could picture the slick, dangerous walkway and the expectation that I\u2019d always keep the site safe. I stood frozen, torn between my duty to guide my stepson and my responsibility to my crew. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I felt the weight of failing either one pressing down on me."}
