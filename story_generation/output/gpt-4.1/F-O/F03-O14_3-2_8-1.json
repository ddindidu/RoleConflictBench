The lab had finally approved my experiment slot\u2014just two hours with the rare imaging equipment, a window I\u2019d waited months for. My mind raced with protocols and data sheets, but my mother\u2019s voice pulled me back. She sat across from me, her hands trembling as she spoke about her recent health scare, her fears spilling out in a way I\u2019d never seen before. My father hovered nearby, silent but clearly shaken. They needed me\u2014needed their son to listen, to reassure, to be present. But the minutes ticked by, and I knew the lab wouldn\u2019t wait. If I missed this chance, my research would be set back for months, maybe longer. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the urge to comfort my parents and the pressure to seize this rare scientific opportunity. Their eyes searched mine for understanding, while my mind screamed with the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
