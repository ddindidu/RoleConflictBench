It was the first time my stepdad\u2019s relatives would all be together, and I knew how much it meant to everyone\u2014especially my mom, who wanted me to feel like part of the family. I promised I\u2019d be there, even left work early, my uniform folded neatly in the backseat just in case.\n\nAs I drove, the police radio crackled: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress, Main and 5th. Multiple bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart pounded. I was the closest unit. I could already picture the chaos, the fear on people\u2019s faces, the responsibility pressing down on me. But my family was waiting, expecting me to show up, to finally belong. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to protect strangers and the hope of finally being accepted at home. The siren\u2019s wail echoed in my mind, mingling with my mom\u2019s voice, and I felt the weight of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
