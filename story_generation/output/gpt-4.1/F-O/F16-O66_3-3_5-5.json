Guilt gnawed at me as I left her with the chores, but I needed the fare. \n\nNow, behind the wheel, I\u2019m navigating a maze of orange cones and impatient drivers. Suddenly, a school zone sign flashes, and I spot a group of children giggling near the curb. My phone buzzes\u2014a message from home: \u201cAre you coming back soon? I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d My hands tighten on the steering wheel. I know I should slow down, drive carefully, keep everyone safe.
