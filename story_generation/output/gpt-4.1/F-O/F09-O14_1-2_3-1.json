My daughter sits at the kitchen table, fidgeting with her spoon, her eyes darting to the mess she\u2019s made on the floor. I know I should kneel beside her, gently reminding her to clean up after herself, to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d to help her grow into a kind, responsible person. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the lab\u2019s specialized microscope is available for only the next two hours. Months of planning, grant proposals, and late-night hypothesis-building have led to this moment. If I miss this window, my experiment\u2014my data\u2014will be set back for weeks, maybe months. My daughter looks up, waiting for my guidance, her small face open and trusting. My mind races, torn between nurturing her growth and seizing the fleeting opportunity in my research. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I feel the ache of wanting to be fully present in each, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
