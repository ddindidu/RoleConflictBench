It\u2019s important.\u201d I\u2019m in the lab, surrounded by the hum of machines and the faint smell of ethanol. I glance at the clock\u2014technically, I have time before I need to update the research logs. The data from today\u2019s experiment sits on my laptop, waiting to be entered. It\u2019s not urgent, but I know the importance of keeping records fresh and accurate. Still, my brother rarely asks for help. We\u2019ve always promised to be there for each other, especially when things get tough. I can hear his voice in my head, shaky and uncertain, and I feel the weight of that promise. But the scientist in me hesitates, thinking of the integrity of my work, the discipline I\u2019ve built. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my research. The lab feels colder, the silence pressing in as I wrestle with what to do next."}
