My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in twenty minutes, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play. She\u2019d asked me, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Dad?\u201d I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But the package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cURGENT\u2014HAND DELIVER ONLY.\u201d My boss had called twice already, reminding me how important it was to get a signature from the recipient, no exceptions. The address was across town, and traffic was already building up. I could picture my daughter scanning the classroom for me, her face falling if I wasn\u2019t there. At the same time, I imagined the consequences at work if I failed to deliver the package on time\u2014angry calls, maybe even a write-up. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the open class, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the two worlds that needed me, both expecting me to be in two places at once."}
