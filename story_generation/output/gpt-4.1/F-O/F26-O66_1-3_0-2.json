The snow was coming down harder now, swirling around the headlights and making the roads slick. He needed to catch an international flight, and every red light felt like a personal failure. My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I knew what it was about: my granddaughter, Emma, was waiting for me at home. She\u2019d asked if we could talk tonight, said she needed advice about starting high school and making new friends. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, to listen and share what I\u2019d learned over the years. But now, with the storm slowing everything and my passenger\u2019s growing urgency, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I was supposed to be the steady hand for my family, the wise grandparent Emma could count on. But right now, I was also responsible for getting this man to the airport safely and on time. My heart tugged in two directions, and I gripped the steering wheel tighter, caught between the needs of a stranger and the promise I\u2019d made to someone I love."}
