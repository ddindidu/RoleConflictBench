I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. I glanced at the lab monitor\u2014red warning lights flashed, signaling a possible leak in the containment chamber. My heart pounded. As a scientist, I knew the protocol: I had to stay, assess the risk, and secure the equipment. Any delay could endanger the entire lab. But as a sister, I couldn\u2019t ignore my brother\u2019s plea. He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I promised I\u2019d always be there for him. The weight of both worlds pressed on me. My colleagues looked to me for direction, while my brother waited for comfort only I could give. I stood frozen, torn between the sterile urgency of the lab and the raw, aching need of family."}
