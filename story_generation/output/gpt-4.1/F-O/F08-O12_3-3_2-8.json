My granddaughter, eyes wide and voice trembling, sat across from me. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I don\u2019t know what to do about my friend. She\u2019s in trouble, and I\u2019m scared for her.\u201d She looked at me, searching for the comfort and wisdom she believed I always had. At that same moment, my work laptop pinged with urgent Slack messages: \u201cProduction is down. Users can\u2019t log in. We need you to look at this now.\u201d My heart raced. I was the only developer on call, and the outage was traced to a bug in my code. Customers were locked out, and the team was waiting for me to fix it. My granddaughter\u2019s voice wavered, \u201cPlease, Grandma?\u201d I felt the weight of her trust and the pressure of my team\u2019s expectations. I wanted to be fully present for her, to offer the guidance she needed, but the demands of my job screamed for immediate action. I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me, unsure which to answer first."}
