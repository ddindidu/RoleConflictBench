My daughter has been reminding me all week\u2014\u201cDad, the kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, to play board games and tell stories, to be the grandfather they look forward to. But as I sit at my desk, headset on, the phone lines light up. The new service we\u2019re selling is complicated, and every other call is a barrage of technical questions. My script only scratches the surface, and my supervisor expects me to keep prospects engaged, answer their concerns, and not let a single lead slip away. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my family expects my presence, my warmth, my attention, while my job demands focus, patience, and quick thinking. My heart aches at the thought of missing my grandson\u2019s laughter, but my mind races with the fear of disappointing my boss.
