My son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my warnings to stay close and behave. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and discipline. I knew I should kneel down, speak to him firmly, and remind him about behaving in public. But just as I reached for his arm, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the salon: Mrs. Lee, my regular, had arrived early and was waiting in the lobby. I pictured her sitting there, expecting my warm greeting, the one that made her feel special and welcome. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice reminding me how important it was to make every client feel valued. My heart pounded as I stood in the cereal aisle, torn between the duty to guide my child and the professional expectation to be present for my client. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I didn\u2019t know which to answer first."}
