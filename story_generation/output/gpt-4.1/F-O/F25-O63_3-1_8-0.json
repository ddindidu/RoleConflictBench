My stepdad sat across from me, his eyes red-rimmed, voice trembling as he confided in me about his job troubles. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the steady presence he\u2019d always tried to be for me. My phone buzzed\u2014my shift was starting. I was supposed to be ready, script in hand, to answer questions and handle objections with a calm, professional tone. The calls were usually easy, but the company expected me to be sharp, focused, and never distracted. My stepdad\u2019s words blurred with the telemarketing script in my mind. I felt the weight of his need for comfort pressing against the rigid expectations of my job. My heart ached to stay and support him, but my mind raced with the fear of missing calls, of letting my team down. I stared at the blinking phone, torn between the family that needed me and the job that demanded my attention, feeling the pressure build as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
