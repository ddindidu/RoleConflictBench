My sales manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding us that every call mattered\u2014if we didn\u2019t hit our target today, the whole team would lose out on bonuses. My call list was long, and my fingers hovered over the dial, but my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, please come. Grandpa\u2019s not well. The kids need you.\u201d My heart twisted. I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, my daughter\u2019s worry, the family needing me there, not just as a comfort but as a steady presence in a moment of crisis. Yet, the pressure from work was relentless; I could almost feel my colleagues\u2019 eyes on me, counting on my numbers to help us all. I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent pull of family and the unyielding demands of my job, my chest tight with the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
