He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance as he explained the impossible choice his boss had given him at work. He needed my support, my encouragement, the gentle words that would help him find his way. I wanted to be there for him, to listen and comfort, but my phone buzzed insistently on the counter. Dispatch was calling\u2014there\u2019d been a minor traffic accident nearby, and I was the closest officer.\n\nAs I drove to the scene, my mind spun. At the intersection, two drivers argued heatedly, each blaming the other. I was expected to be calm, impartial, and fair, to uphold the law without bias. But my thoughts kept drifting back to my husband, waiting at home, needing me. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding empathy and presence, the other requiring objectivity and authority. I stood between the two drivers, pen poised, heart torn, unsure how to be both the wife my husband needed and the officer my badge demanded."}
