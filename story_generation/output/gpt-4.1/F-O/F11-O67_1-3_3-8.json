My little brother wanted to go hiking, and my mom hoped for a movie night. They looked at me, expecting me to join in, to promise I\u2019d be there. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who never missed a family moment. But my phone buzzed\u2014an emergency call. Minutes later, I was behind the wheel of the ambulance, rain pounding the windshield, wipers barely keeping up. The patient in the back was fading fast, and every second counted. My partner urged me to hurry, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, torn between the need to drive faster for the patient\u2019s sake and the responsibility to keep everyone safe. My mind flashed back to my family, their hopeful faces, and the promise I hadn\u2019t made. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the storm, not just outside, but inside too."}
