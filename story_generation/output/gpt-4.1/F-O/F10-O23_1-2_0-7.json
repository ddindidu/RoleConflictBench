My mom texted hours ago, asking how my week was, and I know she\u2019s waiting for a reply. I promised myself I\u2019d check in more often, but work has been relentless. Just as I start typing, my work phone buzzes. It\u2019s an assistant from the office, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files\u2014she says it\u2019ll help her prepare a report for Monday. I know the rules: only those directly involved can access these documents. But she sounds stressed, and I remember how overwhelmed I felt when I first started. My mom\u2019s message sits unread, and guilt tugs at me from both sides. I want to be the daughter who\u2019s present, who cares, but I\u2019m also the lawyer who must uphold my duty. My fingers hover over both keyboards, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my family and the demands of my profession."}
