I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. It was Sunday, our weekly call. She\u2019d be waiting to hear about my week, to tell me about Dad\u2019s new hobby, to ask if I was eating well. I knew how much these calls meant to her, especially since I moved out. But I was already running behind on my cleaning schedule, and the supervisor had just reminded us about the new hygiene protocols. Gloves, mask, sanitizer\u2014no exceptions, not even for a quick phone call. If I answered now, I\u2019d have to remove my gloves and risk contaminating my hands, or worse, get caught breaking the rules. But if I ignored the call, Mom would worry, maybe think something was wrong. My heart pounded as I stood in the empty hallway, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the responsible cleaner my job demanded."}
