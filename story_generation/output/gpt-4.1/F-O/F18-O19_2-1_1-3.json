Had a rough day.\u201d I glanced up and saw him waiting by the door, eyes red, backpack slumped. He looked so small and lost, and I knew he needed me\u2014needed his big sister to listen, to reassure him that things would be okay. But just then, a customer approached the counter, holding a box of ibuprofen. \u201cExcuse me, is this safe for headaches?\u201d she asked, her voice uncertain. I could see the line growing behind her, and I remembered the training: every patient deserves my full attention, even for simple questions. My brother\u2019s gaze met mine, pleading, while the customer waited expectantly. My heart twisted as I stood between them, torn by the urge to comfort my brother and the duty to care for my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
