He\u2019d been quieter lately, and Mom kept hinting that I should check in more, make sure he was okay. \u201cIs everything alright at home?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but my heart thudded with worry. He hesitated, and I could hear the weight in his silence. Just then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a coworker heading straight under a suspended load. My gut twisted\u2014if I didn\u2019t shout, he could get hurt, but if I yelled now, my stepdad would know I wasn\u2019t really present, that I was distracted again, not the supportive son Mom wanted me to be. My throat tightened as I hovered between the two worlds, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
