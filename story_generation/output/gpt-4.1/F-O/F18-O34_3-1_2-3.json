It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just past noon, the control room humming with the usual chatter. I called her during my break, and her voice cracked as she told me about the diagnosis. My heart clenched. She needed me, needed my words, my comfort, the way we always leaned on each other when the world felt too heavy. But as I listened, the headset on my desk beeped. I was back on shift. A pilot\u2019s voice came through, calm and routine: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My training kicked in, the expectation to be precise, focused, and unflappable. But my mind was split\u2014my sister\u2019s sobs echoing in one ear, the pilot\u2019s request in the other. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be present for her, the responsibility to keep the skies safe. My hands trembled as I hovered between the two, torn by the impossible demands of being both a good sibling and a vigilant controller."}
