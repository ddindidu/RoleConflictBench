The bills on the kitchen table remind me why I can\u2019t afford to miss a single shift. As a mother, I know I have to keep the lights on and food on the table. My job as a housekeeping cleaner is what keeps us afloat, but lately, the supervisor has been stricter about safety and hygiene protocols. I\u2019m supposed to wear gloves, masks, and follow every step, no shortcuts. But the equipment is sometimes in short supply, and the extra time it takes means I can\u2019t finish all my assigned rooms. If I fall behind, I risk losing hours\u2014or worse, my job. My mind races: do I cut corners to keep up and make sure I bring home enough money, or do I follow every rule and risk being seen as too slow? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I stand in the supply closet, torn between being the provider my family needs and the responsible worker my job demands."}
