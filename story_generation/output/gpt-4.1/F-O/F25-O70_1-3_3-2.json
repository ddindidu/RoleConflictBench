It was one of the few times I felt like I belonged, sitting at the table, sharing stories and laughter. But as I glanced at the stack of packages in my van, my heart pounded. One box was marked urgent\u2014medical supplies for the hospital, needed by 6:30 PM sharp. My supervisor had stressed the importance of this delivery; a delay could mean real consequences for someone\u2019s care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I left now, I\u2019d be late for dinner, disappointing my family and risking the fragile trust I\u2019d built. If I stayed, the hospital might not get what it needed in time. My hands trembled on the steering wheel, torn between the expectations of being a good step-child and a responsible delivery person, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
