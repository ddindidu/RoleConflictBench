He was determined to try a new trick he\u2019d seen online, but the ramp looked even more uneven than usual after last night\u2019s rain. As his older sibling, I knew I should stop him, or at least make sure he wore his helmet and pads. My heart pounded with worry\u2014what if he fell and got hurt?\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder from my housekeeping job. The client\u2019s floor cleaner was almost gone, and I was supposed to check the supply today and let them know if they needed to buy more before my next visit. If I forgot, I\u2019d risk disappointing them and maybe even losing the job. I glanced at my brother, already poised to drop in, and then at my phone, feeling the pressure from both sides. My mind raced, torn between running to my brother\u2019s side and sending the urgent message to my client."}
