My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my husband\u2019s name flashed on the screen. He\u2019d had a rough day, he\u2019d said earlier, his voice tired but trying to sound upbeat. I knew he needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be present. But the patient in front of me looked worried, clutching their prescription bag, clearly needing reassurance and guidance. My mind raced, torn between the urge to step away and call my husband, to be the supportive wife he deserved, and the responsibility to my patient, who depended on my expertise and calm. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention at the same moment. I took a deep breath, feeling the conflict twist inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed right now."}
