She had spent the morning reminding me how our customs, especially during festival season, were the glue that held us together. I could see the pride in her eyes, the unspoken expectation that I would be there, helping prepare the special dishes and participating in the rituals just as generations before me had done. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder popped up for the pharmacy workshop I\u2019d registered for weeks ago\u2014an essential session on the latest prescription guidelines. My manager had stressed how crucial it was to stay updated, not just for my career, but for the safety of my patients. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the warmth and duty of family, the responsibility and professionalism of my career. My heart pounded as I realized the workshop and the family gathering overlapped. I stared at my calendar, torn, feeling the tension build inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
