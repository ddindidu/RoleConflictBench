The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need this done by tomorrow, no excuses.\u201d I knew the electricians and plumbers were waiting on me, and any delay would throw the whole project off schedule. My phone buzzed on the workbench. It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about my exam.\u201d I could almost hear the tremble in her voice, remember how I promised I\u2019d always be there for her, especially when she was stressed. But the clock was ticking, and every minute I spent away from the workshop meant risking the trust of my team and the client. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to comfort my sister and the pressure to deliver flawless work on time. I wiped my hands on my jeans, staring at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one needed me more at that moment."}
