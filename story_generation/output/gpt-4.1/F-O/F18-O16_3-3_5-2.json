She\u2019s so excited.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, the warmth and anticipation. My family had planned this celebration for weeks, and I\u2019d promised\u2014no, I\u2019d insisted\u2014I wouldn\u2019t miss it this year. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, the ER doors burst open. A nurse rushed in, wheeling a man gasping for breath, his skin ashen, his eyes wild with fear. The team looked at me, waiting for my orders. I was the attending tonight. The symptoms didn\u2019t fit anything obvious, and every second mattered. My mind raced through possible diagnoses, the weight of responsibility pressing down. I could hear my family\u2019s laughter in my mind, the clink of glasses, the empty chair they\u2019d save for me. My heart twisted between the promise I\u2019d made to them and the oath I\u2019d taken as a doctor. Both needed me, right now, in ways that felt impossible to reconcile. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
