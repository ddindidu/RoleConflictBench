The kids can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of my grandkids, their laughter echoing in my mind. Family holidays were sacred\u2014my chance to reconnect, to be the grandfather who listens, who tells stories, who is present. But as I opened my laptop, a new email popped up from Product: \u201cOptional brainstorming session next week\u2014would love your input on the new features.\u201d I knew \u201coptional\u201d really meant \u201cwe hope you\u2019ll be there.\u201d My team counted on me to help shape the project\u2019s direction, and missing the session could mean losing my voice in decisions that would affect us all. I felt the tug from both sides\u2014my family expecting my presence, my colleagues expecting my expertise. I sat at my desk, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
