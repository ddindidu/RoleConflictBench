Every detail mattered\u2014emergency routes, sterile corridors, the flow between operating rooms. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message from my stepbrother: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about finals.\u201d I knew how much this exam meant to him, how he\u2019d struggled since our parents remarried, and how he counted on me to be there when things got tough. But the hospital\u2019s deadline loomed, and my mind was tangled in technical requirements and the pressure to get every inch right. I could hear his voice in my head, shaky and uncertain, needing reassurance. At the same time, I felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the responsibility to create a space that could save lives. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the brother who needed me, and the project that demanded my focus. I stared at my phone, torn, the cursor blinking on my screen, waiting for me to choose which role I would answer first."}
