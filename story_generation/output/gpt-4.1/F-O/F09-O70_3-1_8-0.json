My mind kept drifting back to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a mother, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability pressing down on me. Every delivery, every tip, every extra shift mattered. I needed to keep this job, to keep the roof over our heads.\n\nBut as a delivery person, I was expected to be fast, efficient, and accurate. Today, one package arrived at the depot later than scheduled. It was still within the same day, but I knew the customer would be watching the tracking updates, expecting it at their door soon. My supervisor had already reminded me twice this week about the importance of on-time deliveries.\n\nI could feel the tension building in my chest. If I rushed, I might make a mistake or get a traffic ticket\u2014something we couldn\u2019t afford. If I took my time, I risked a complaint, maybe even my job. My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter, asking if I\u2019d be home for dinner. I stared at the package, torn between the demands of my two worlds, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
