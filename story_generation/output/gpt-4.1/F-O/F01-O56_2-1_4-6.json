Jamie has big news to share!\u201d My heart leapt\u2014being a grandfather means everything to me, and I know how much these family moments matter. I pictured Jamie\u2019s excited face, the family\u2019s laughter, the warmth of being together. But just then, my next client arrived, hair still damp, smelling of fresh shampoo. \u201cI washed it right before coming,\u201d she said, settling into the chair. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before a cut, to ensure the best results and maintain salon standards. My boss is strict about this policy, and clients expect the full treatment. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the pull of family, the pride of my profession. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the cape, torn between the rules of my trade and the call of my family\u2019s joy."}
