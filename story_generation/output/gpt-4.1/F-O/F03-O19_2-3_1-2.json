The label glared at me, reminding me that even the smallest mistake could be devastating for the patient. My hands moved carefully, double-checking every calculation, every vial, every instruction. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my mom, right on time for our weekly call. I knew she and Dad waited for this all week, eager to hear about my life and to share their own stories. I could almost hear her gentle voice, asking if I was eating well, if I was happy. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014if I didn\u2019t answer, they\u2019d worry. But if I picked up now, my focus would slip, and I couldn\u2019t risk an error with this medication. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the duty to my parents and the responsibility to my patient, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
