My little sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents were excited about a movie night. They looked at me, expecting me to join in, to be part of the plan. I felt their warmth, their hope that I\u2019d finally spend a Saturday with them instead of working. Just as I was about to agree, my phone buzzed. It was a notification from work\u2014a customer had placed a rush order for groceries, needing them delivered within the next two hours for dinner. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cThis one\u2019s urgent. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d I stared at my family, their faces full of anticipation, and then at my phone, the weight of responsibility pressing down. My heart twisted as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The expectations clashed inside me, and I felt torn, wishing I could make everyone happy but knowing I\u2019d have to choose."}
