My stepmom\u2019s eyes flicked to me, hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to chime in, to show I was part of this family, not just a guest passing through. I wanted to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mandatory pre-shift briefing for subway operators was about to start. New procedures, they\u2019d said, and attendance was non-negotiable. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, a safety risk on my next shift. My stepbrother looked at me, waiting for my input, and my stepmom smiled, expecting me to join in. My heart pounded as I weighed their warmth against the cold, rigid demands of my job. I felt split in two, torn between the family I was trying to belong to and the professional standards I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
