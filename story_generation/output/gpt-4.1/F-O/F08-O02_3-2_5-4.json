My phone buzzed again\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She needed me. There was a family emergency, and as the grandmother, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to help, to hold things together. But my mind was tangled in the new safety standard that had just been released. The product launch was in two days, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail was compliant. The team was waiting for my review, and the company\u2019s reputation was on the line. I could hear my grandchildren\u2019s voices in the background of the call, anxious and needing reassurance. My heart ached to be with them, but my head throbbed with the pressure of regulatory deadlines. I stared at the screen, torn between the family that needed my warmth and the team that needed my expertise, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
