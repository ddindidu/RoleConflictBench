The radio crackled with urgency\u2014an unattended bag had been spotted in car three. Protocol demanded I stop at the next station, alert security, and keep passengers calm. My heart pounded, not just from the responsibility of hundreds of lives, but from the weight of my other role. As a step-parent, I was the main provider. My partner had lost their job last month, and every shift I worked was crucial for rent and groceries. Missing even a few hours could mean falling behind on bills. But now, if I followed safety procedures, the train would be delayed, and I might be pulled from my shift for questioning, risking my pay. If I ignored the report, I\u2019d be endangering passengers and violating my duty. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my family\u2019s needs and the safety of strangers. My hands trembled as I reached for the intercom, torn between the two worlds that depended on me."}
