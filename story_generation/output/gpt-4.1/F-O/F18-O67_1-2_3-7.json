My younger brother looked at me, eyes bright, and said, \u201cYou have to come this time. It\u2019s been ages since we all did something together.\u201d I promised I\u2019d try, feeling the warmth of belonging. Just then, my phone buzzed. Dispatch. I was needed for a call\u2014nothing critical, but someone was hurt and waiting. I grabbed my keys, my family\u2019s voices fading behind me. As I slid into the ambulance, the city\u2019s afternoon traffic loomed ahead, thick and slow. I knew I had to drive carefully, keep everyone safe, but the pressure to arrive quickly gnawed at me. My mind raced with the family\u2019s expectation to be present, to be the reliable sibling, and the professional demand to focus, to not let impatience or distraction endanger anyone. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pulled in two directions, as I tried to steady my breath and decide which role would guide me now."}
