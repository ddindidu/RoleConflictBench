The driver, a middle-aged man, pleaded with me, explaining he\u2019d only stopped for a few minutes to pick up his sick child from school. My mind wandered to my own family\u2014my daughter\u2019s laughter, the mortgage statement on the kitchen table, the looming home loan repayment. Overtime pay from ticket quotas could help bridge the gap, but I knew my badge demanded more than just numbers. I was expected to act with integrity, to be fair, not to let personal worries cloud my judgment. Yet, the pressure to provide for my family pressed down on me, heavy and relentless. I could feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wore on duty, and the invisible one I wore at home. My hand trembled slightly as I considered what to do, caught between the expectations of my job and the needs of my family."}
