As an accountant, accuracy and timeliness are non-negotiable\u2014my job depends on it. But my mind kept drifting upstairs, where my son was waiting, eyes bright with anticipation. I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo if he kept his grades up, and he had. Now, he was counting on me to keep my word. But the numbers in front of me told a different story: the budget was tight this month, and any extra expense would throw off the careful balance I\u2019d worked so hard to maintain. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing him, but the pressure of my professional responsibilities weighed just as heavily. I could hear his footsteps above, the hope in his voice echoing in my mind, while the silent demand of the financial records pulled me back to the screen. I felt torn, caught between being the reliable provider my family needed and the meticulous accountant my job required."}
