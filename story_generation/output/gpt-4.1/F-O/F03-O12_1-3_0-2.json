Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I haven\u2019t called home in two weeks, just sent a few quick texts. I know they want to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to feel like I\u2019m still part of their lives even though I\u2019m far away.\n\nBut my laptop screen is filled with error logs and performance graphs. The new code I pushed on Friday is causing our main service to crawl, and the team is counting on me to fix it before Monday. My lead has already messaged twice, asking for updates. I can\u2019t let the team down, not with the project\u2019s deadline looming.\n\nI stare at my phone, then back at the code. My parents\u2019 faces flash in my mind, their voices warm and expectant. At the same time, the pressure of the broken service weighs heavy on my chest. I want to be a good son, but I also need to be a reliable developer. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between dialing home and diving back into the code, caught in the silent tug-of-war between family and work."}
