The line stretches down the aisle, and I can feel the impatience of customers behind the next in line. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cKeep the line moving, accuracy is key.\u201d But then I see my granddaughter, Emma, standing off to the side, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She\u2019s come to visit after school, but something is clearly wrong. As a grandmother, I want nothing more than to step away, pull her into a hug, and offer the comfort and advice she needs. Yet, as a cashier, I\u2019m tethered to my station, responsible for every item, every dollar, every customer waiting. My heart aches with the urge to be there for Emma, to fulfill the role she needs from me right now, but the demands of my job press in, relentless and unyielding. I glance between the growing line and my granddaughter, torn by the impossible choice between duty and love."}
