It\u2019s tradition, and I know how much it means to everyone, especially the grandkids. I promised myself I\u2019d be more present this year, not just a voice on the line but a real part of their lives. \n\nBut as I walked past the pool, the water looked cloudy\u2014too cloudy. I checked the filtration system and my stomach dropped. The pressure gauge was off, and the pump was making a strange noise. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the water could become unsafe, and swimmers would be at risk. My supervisor always says, \u201cSafety first, no exceptions.\u201d \n\nI stood there, phone in one hand, wrench in the other, heart pounding. My family was waiting for me to reconnect, to be the grandparent they needed. But the pool needed me too, right now, to keep everyone safe. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call to answer first."}
