Her hair was still damp, smelling faintly of her own shampoo. I glanced at the appointment notes\u2014\u201cwash, condition, cut\u201d\u2014the routine my boss insisted on for every client, no exceptions. My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to respect rules and traditions, whether at home or work. At family gatherings, I was always expected to participate in every ritual, even if I didn\u2019t fully understand them, because \u201cthat\u2019s what family does.\u201d Now, as a hairdresser, I was expected to follow the salon\u2019s protocol, even if it seemed unnecessary. Mrs. Patel smiled at me in the mirror, clearly hoping to skip the extra wash. I felt the pressure from both sides: the salon\u2019s rules and my stepmother\u2019s lessons about respecting expectations, versus the client\u2019s comfort and my own sense of practicality. My hands hesitated, caught between what I was supposed to do and what felt right."}
