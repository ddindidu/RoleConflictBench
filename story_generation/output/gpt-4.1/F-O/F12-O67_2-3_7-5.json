I knew I should ask him what was wrong, open up the conversation like we always promised each other we would. But just as I opened my mouth, my radio crackled to life\u2014an emergency call. A patient was having a major heart attack, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My heart pounded. I could see the worry in my husband\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for me to stay, to talk, to be his partner in this moment. But the voice on the radio was urgent, and I knew someone\u2019s life depended on my quick response and medical care. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. I stood frozen, caught between the promise I made to my husband and the oath I took as an ambulance driver, not knowing which need to answer first."}
