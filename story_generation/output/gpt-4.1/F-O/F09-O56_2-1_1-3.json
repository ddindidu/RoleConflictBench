My daughter\u2019s open class was starting soon, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for days, her eyes shining with excitement every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d I\u2019d nodded, determined not to let her down.\n\nBut just as I was about to finish up with my last client, Mrs. Lee, she smiled and asked, \u201cCould you just trim my fringe a bit more? I think it\u2019s still a little long.\u201d She was always so understanding, never demanding, and I knew she trusted me to get it just right. I could see the expectation in her eyes\u2014she wanted to leave feeling her best, and I wanted to give her that.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both promises pressing down on me. My scissors hovered in my hand as I tried to steady my breath, caught between the needs of my child and the trust of my client, unsure which role to honor first."}
