They needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice. Their boss had just offered a promotion, but it meant longer hours and more stress. \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d they asked, voice barely above a whisper. I wanted to be present, to listen, to hold them and help them sort through the fear and excitement tangled in their words.\n\nBut my break was almost over. Down the hall, Mrs. Jenkins waited for me. She\u2019d been in agony all morning, her arthritis flaring so badly she could barely lift her spoon. She needed me, too\u2014needed my patience, my gentle hands, my encouragement to eat just a few more bites.\n\nMy heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. I felt split in two, pulled by the weight of my partner\u2019s trust and my patient\u2019s pain. Both deserved my full attention, but I only had one self to give. I closed my eyes, torn, the phone still warm in my hand, the call of duty echoing from both sides."}
