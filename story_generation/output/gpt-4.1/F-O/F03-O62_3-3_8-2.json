My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my responsibility. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was my mom, her voice trembling as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare last night. She needed me\u2014her son\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I could hear the fear in her voice, the way she was holding back tears, and I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to be the son she needed in that moment.\n\nBut as I listened, my gaze kept flicking back to the water, where the tide was rising and the swimmers were thick as flies. Every second I spent focused on my mom was a second I wasn\u2019t watching the surf, wasn\u2019t ready to blow my whistle or dive in if someone needed me. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety, torn between the desperate need in my mother\u2019s voice and the silent, ever-present danger in the waves. I felt split in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the son my parents needed and the lifeguard everyone on this beach depended on."}
