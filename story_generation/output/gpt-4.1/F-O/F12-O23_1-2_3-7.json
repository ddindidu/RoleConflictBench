He\u2019s been patient, but I know he\u2019s waiting for me to fold them, just as I said I would. My phone buzzes with a message from the office: the new assistant wants access to the client files I\u2019ve been working on. She says it\u2019ll help her organize the case load, but she\u2019s not cleared for this matter. I know the rules\u2014confidentiality is everything. My husband calls from the kitchen, asking if I\u2019ll help with dinner after the laundry. My mind races, torn between the home I\u2019ve built and the career I\u2019ve fought for. I feel the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, the need to be a good partner and a responsible lawyer. I clutch a wrinkled shirt in one hand and my phone in the other, heart pounding, caught between the demands of my two worlds."}
