My stepmother\u2019s eyes were hopeful, silently urging me to honor her family\u2019s tradition, to show I belonged. I could feel the weight of her expectation, the unspoken plea to bridge the gap between us by leading this ritual. But just beyond the fence, the community pool shimmered in the afternoon sun, and I could see a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, unsupervised. As the designated lifeguard, I was responsible for their safety, expected to enforce the rules and prevent any accidents. My heart pounded as I glanced between the lantern in my hand and the pool gate. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmother and the family, maybe even widen the distance I\u2019d worked so hard to close. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring my duty, risking the safety of those kids. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice between family and responsibility."}
