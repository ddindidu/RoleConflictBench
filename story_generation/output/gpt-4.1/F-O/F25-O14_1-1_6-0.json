My stepdad shuffled in, rubbing his eyes, and I remembered how Mom had asked me to check in on him more often. \u201cEverything okay at home?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but I could see the tiredness in his face. He smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. I wanted to press further, to be the supportive step-child Mom hoped I\u2019d be, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the experiment slot I\u2019d been eyeing was available tomorrow. If I didn\u2019t take it, I could always reschedule, but I knew my advisor expected me to show initiative, to gather data as soon as possible. I felt the weight of both expectations\u2014my family needing me present, my lab needing me productive. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between the warmth of home and the cold precision of the lab, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
