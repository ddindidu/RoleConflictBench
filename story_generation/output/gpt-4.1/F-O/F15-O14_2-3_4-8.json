My phone buzzed with an urgent alert: the gas chromatograph was overheating, and a hazardous leak was possible if not addressed immediately. My heart pounded. At that moment, my son darted away from my side, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked over a stack of cereal boxes. Shoppers stared. I knew I had to teach him discipline, to calmly correct his behavior and reinforce the values I wanted him to learn. But the lab alert flashed in my mind\u2014protocol demanded immediate action to prevent a dangerous situation. I felt torn, my hands gripping the cart, my mind racing between the responsibility to my child and the duty to my colleagues\u2019 safety. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
