My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou need three more sales to hit your target this week.\u201d I scrolled through the call list, my stomach tight with anxiety. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. It\u2019s important to your father and me that you\u2019re there on time. We\u2019re counting on you to help with the ceremony.\u201d \n\nI knew how much these traditions meant to them, especially since I\u2019d joined the family. They wanted me to fit in, to show respect for their customs. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss my sales target\u2014again. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s eyes, the warning in tomorrow\u2019s meeting. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling like I was being pulled apart by two worlds that refused to meet."}
