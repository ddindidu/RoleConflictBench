My spouse pours tea and sits across from me, their eyes searching mine. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d they ask, voice gentle, inviting. I know they want more than a one-word answer\u2014they want to share, to connect, to hear about my world and let me into theirs. But my mind is tangled in lines of code and urgent Slack messages. The project at work is at a standstill; everyone\u2019s waiting on my module, and the pressure is mounting. I can almost feel my team\u2019s impatience through the screen, the expectation that I\u2019ll deliver the solution that unblocks everyone. My spouse leans in, hoping for openness, for me to be present. But my thoughts are split, pulled between the need to communicate honestly at home and the relentless demand to solve problems at work. I want to be here, to talk, to listen. But the weight of unfinished work presses on me, and I can\u2019t seem to give either role what it deserves."}
