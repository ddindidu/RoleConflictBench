We need you to come in today.\u201d My heart clenched with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I glanced at the blueprints spread across my desk, the red circles marking areas where the contractor had cut corners. If I didn\u2019t address these safety issues now, the entire project could be delayed, or worse, someone could get hurt. My team was waiting for my final review before construction resumed, and the client expected a flawless, on-time delivery. But my son needed me, needed his mother to show up, to listen, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on both sides. My colleagues expected unwavering focus and expertise; my child needed compassion and guidance.
