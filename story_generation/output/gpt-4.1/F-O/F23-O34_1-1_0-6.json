I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, waving, just like their mom used to. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d I glanced at the radar. Flight 482 was approaching the sector boundary, right on schedule, but the handoff to the next controller hadn\u2019t gone through yet. Protocol demanded I stay until the transfer was confirmed, and my supervisor expected nothing less than seamless coordination. My heart thudded as I imagined my stepkids scanning the crowd, faces falling when they didn\u2019t see me.
