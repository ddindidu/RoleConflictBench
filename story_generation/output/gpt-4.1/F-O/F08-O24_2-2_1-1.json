The trial tomorrow was a complicated one, and I knew every detail mattered. My mind was deep in the facts and arguments when I heard the soft shuffle of slippers. My granddaughter hovered in the doorway, her eyes rimmed red, clutching her favorite book to her chest. I recognized that look\u2014something weighed heavy on her heart. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to set aside my work, offer her a warm hug, and listen to whatever troubled her. She needed my wisdom, my comfort, the assurance that things would be okay. But the clock ticked relentlessly, reminding me of my duty as a judge. The case demanded my full attention; justice for the parties depended on my careful review tonight. My heart ached as I glanced between the pleading eyes of my granddaughter and the dense pages before me. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in, each too important to ignore."}
