Mom\u2019s making your favorite,\u201d my sister wrote, followed by a string of heart emojis. I could almost hear their laughter, picture the table set with steaming dishes, and feel the warmth of being together. But my laptop screen glared back at me, filled with urgent emails and project updates. As the lead architect, I was responsible for coordinating three teams, and today, a major delay threatened to push us past the client\u2019s deadline. My phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a reminder from my project manager about the late-night call to resolve the issue. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, but my team needed me to troubleshoot, to lead, to deliver. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I felt torn, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
