His eyes were red, his voice barely above a whisper as he tried to make sense of the news he\u2019d just received. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my steady presence. I could feel the weight of his pain, and I wanted nothing more than to stay, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut my phone buzzed on the nightstand. The hospital. I was on call, and a patient recovering from surgery had slightly elevated vital signs. The nurse on the other end sounded worried; they needed me to come in, to check and record the patient\u2019s temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. My mind raced. My husband\u2019s grip tightened, silently pleading for me not to leave. At the same time, I knew my patient depended on me for their safety and care.\n\nTorn between the two, I felt my chest tighten. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to give my all. I stood there, caught in the middle, heart pounding, unable to move."}
