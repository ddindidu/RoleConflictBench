We need to figure out the medical bills.\u201d My chest tightened. He expected me to be honest, to lay out every detail of our finances, to talk through the hard choices together. I wanted to be present, to communicate openly, but my mind was already tangled with the day\u2019s work.\n\nJust then, a customer walked into my workshop, her little boy clutching a splintered wooden train. She looked at me with hope. \u201cCan you fix it? He loves this toy.\u201d I examined the damage, calculating the time and materials needed. She waited for a quote, her eyes anxious, and I knew she expected a fair price and a promise to restore her son\u2019s joy.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014my husband needed my honesty and attention, but this family needed my skill and care. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
