My phone buzzed with messages from the site manager\u2014another delay, another conflict to resolve. The project deadline loomed, and every minute counted. I could feel the pressure mounting, my mind racing through solutions, schedules, and compromises. Across from me, my spouse stirred their tea, eyes distant and troubled. I noticed the worry lines on their face, the way their fingers tapped nervously on the mug. I knew I should ask, should open up the conversation, share my own stress and invite theirs. That\u2019s what we promised each other: to communicate, to be present, to listen. But the demands of the project screamed louder in my head. If I didn\u2019t respond now, the whole team could fall behind. Yet if I ignored my spouse\u2019s silent plea, I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019d built.
