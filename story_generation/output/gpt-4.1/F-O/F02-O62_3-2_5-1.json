As a father, I wanted to teach him right from wrong, so when I caught him slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the snack stand, my heart sank. I knew I had to address it\u2014explain why stealing is wrong, make him apologize, and help him understand the consequences. But as I turned to him, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a swimmer flailing in the deep end, their head bobbing just above the water. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on the pool, to be ready to jump in at any second. I felt torn in two\u2014my son needed me to guide him, but someone else might need me to save them. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of being a good father and a vigilant lifeguard."}
