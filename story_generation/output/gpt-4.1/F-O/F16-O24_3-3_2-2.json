They reached for my hand, voice trembling as they tried to explain the weight of their crisis, needing me to listen, to hold them, to reassure them that everything would be okay. My phone buzzed on the table, the courthouse number flashing on the screen. An emergency motion had just been filed\u2014a temporary restraining order, urgent, demanding my immediate attention.
