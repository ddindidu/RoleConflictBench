My shift as a cashier was almost over, but the end-of-day cash deposit loomed\u2014a task that demanded my full attention and strict adherence to store policy. The manager had reminded me just this morning: every bill counted, every form signed, no shortcuts. Corporate audits were no joke, and mistakes could cost me my job. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw the time and felt a different kind of pressure. My kids would be waiting outside their school, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there, just like all the other parents, to pick them up and hear about their day. I could picture their hopeful eyes, the disappointment if I was late again. My hands shook as I started counting the bills, torn between the demands of my job and the promise I\u2019d made to my children. The minutes slipped away, and I felt trapped, pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
