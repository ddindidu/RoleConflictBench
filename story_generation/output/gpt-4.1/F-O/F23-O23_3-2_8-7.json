As a step-parent, I promised my partner and stepdaughter that I\u2019d keep us afloat, that we\u2019d never have to worry about losing our home. Every dollar mattered, and I\u2019d been working late, taking on extra cases at the firm to make sure we\u2019d have enough. \n\nThis morning, my assistant, new and eager, stopped by my office. \u201cCan I get access to the Thompson files? It\u2019ll help me organize the caseload faster.\u201d She didn\u2019t know the files contained sensitive information, and granting her access would be a breach of client confidentiality. But if I said no, I\u2019d have to handle the files myself, meaning more late nights, less time with my family, and less energy to manage our finances. \n\nI could feel the tension building inside me\u2014my duty to my clients clashing with my responsibility to my family. I stared at the files, torn between protecting my client\u2019s trust and the desperate need to keep my promise at home."}
