My break is scheduled in ten minutes, but my phone buzzes with a message from my spouse: \u201cCan you help vacuum before my parents arrive? They\u2019ll be here in an hour.\u201d I look around the living room, picturing the dust on the shelves and the dishes in the sink. The house needs to be spotless, and I promised I\u2019d help. But if I step away from my desk now, even for a minute, the compliance system will flag me. Last week, a coworker got a warning for being off the line for just three minutes. My heart pounds as I weigh the risk of disciplinary action against the disappointment in my spouse\u2019s voice if I don\u2019t help. I want to be a reliable partner, but I also need this job. The pressure builds in my chest as I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the demands of my home and the rigid rules of my work."}
