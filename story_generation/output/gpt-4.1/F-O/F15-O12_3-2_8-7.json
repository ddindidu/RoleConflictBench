My phone buzzes with another email from QA\u2014users are reporting intermittent errors, and the product manager wants answers by tomorrow. I know I should dive into the logs, trace the stack, and find the root cause before the issue escalates. But my mind keeps drifting to the calendar on the wall, where I\u2019ve circled the date for our home loan repayment. It\u2019s only two months away, and I need to make sure we\u2019re financially stable, that nothing jeopardizes our ability to pay. My partner\u2019s been anxious about it, and I promised I\u2019d take on extra freelance work if needed. The pressure to provide for my family weighs heavily on me, but so does the expectation to be a reliable developer. I feel torn, my chest tight with worry\u2014should I stay up late to fix the bugs, risking burnout and missing out on extra income, or focus on finding more freelance gigs to secure our finances, knowing the team is counting on me? The demands pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t ignore either one."}
