Every year, I\u2019m the one who gathers everyone together, the one who calls, who bakes, who listens to stories and laughter echoing through the house. My daughter had already texted, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you, Mom!\u201d and my grandson sent a drawing of us holding hands. I felt the warmth of their expectations, the comfort of tradition.\n\nBut on my desk, the lab schedule glared back at me. The experiment I\u2019d been planning for months was finally ready. The equipment was booked, the samples prepped, and the data I could collect during this window might be the breakthrough I\u2019d been chasing. My team was counting on me to lead, to be present, to push the boundaries of what we know.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached at the thought of missing the holiday, of disappointing my family. Yet, the thrill of discovery tugged at me, the responsibility to my colleagues and to science itself. I sat in silence, torn between the warmth of home and the call of the unknown, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
