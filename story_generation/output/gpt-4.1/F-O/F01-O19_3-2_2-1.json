My mind was focused, double-checking dosages, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from my daughter: \"Dad, can you talk to Sam? He\u2019s really upset and needs your advice.\" My grandson, Sam, rarely reached out like this. I knew something serious must be weighing on him. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to drop everything, to offer the wisdom and comfort only I could give. But as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t risk a single mistake\u2014one wrong pill could mean disaster for Mrs. Lee. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My hands hovered over the pill bottles, my heart torn between the counter and the call, wrestling with which part of me should come first."}
