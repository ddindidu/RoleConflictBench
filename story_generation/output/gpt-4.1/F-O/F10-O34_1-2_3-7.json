Today was the festival my family cherished, a day when every daughter was expected to help with rituals and serve the elders. But the sky outside was a churning gray, and the radar screen was already crowded with blips\u2014planes forced to reroute by the sudden thunderstorm. My headset crackled with urgent voices, each handoff requiring my full attention, every decision a matter of safety. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from home: \u201cWhen will you arrive?\u201d \u201cGrandma is waiting for you to light the candles.\u201d I felt the weight of my mother\u2019s expectations pressing against the relentless demands of the airspace. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the flight paths, but my mind kept drifting to the empty seat at the family table, the disappointment I\u2019d see in their eyes.
