I glance at the clock. If I leave now, I\u2019ll be on time, and the next crew won\u2019t be left waiting. But if I stay, I can finally help at home, show my wife I\u2019m not just a guest in our own house. My hands hover over the laundry, but my keys are already in my pocket. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014one a husband, expected to share the load at home, the other an ambulance driver, expected to be reliable and punctual. My chest tightens as I stand in the hallway, torn between the pile of clothes and the call of the road, knowing someone will be disappointed no matter what I choose."}
