My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it was to be present for the holiday\u2014how every year, we gathered, shared stories, and honored our traditions. I could almost smell the food, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of belonging. But here I was, responsible for hundreds of passengers, my hands steady on the controls, my eyes scanning the monitors. Suddenly, the intercom crackled. A passenger\u2019s voice, anxious, asked for directions to a hospital stop. I knew I had to respond quickly, calmly, and clearly\u2014my duty was to ensure their safety and provide help. Yet, as I reached for the microphone, guilt gnawed at me. Was I letting my family down by not being there? Or would I be failing my passengers if I let my mind wander to the dinner table instead of focusing on their needs? The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and for a moment, I just sat there, torn between the son I was raised to be and the operator I needed to become."}
