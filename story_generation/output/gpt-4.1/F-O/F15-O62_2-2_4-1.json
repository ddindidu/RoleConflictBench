My son tugged at my hand, begging for a snack, but I shook my head, focused on the swimmers. Suddenly, he darted away, weaving between shoppers in the supermarket section beside the pool. I saw him knock over a display, giggling, and my heart clenched. I knew I should correct him, teach him respect and discipline, but just then, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a swimmer in the middle lane flailing, their strokes uneven. My training screamed at me to keep my eyes on the water, to be ready to jump in at any sign of distress. But my instincts as a parent pulled me toward my son, who needed guidance and a firm hand. The expectations pressed in on me from both sides\u2014responsibility for every life in the pool, and the duty to raise my child right. My mind raced, torn between the whistle and the gentle scolding, between the safety of many and the upbringing of one."}
