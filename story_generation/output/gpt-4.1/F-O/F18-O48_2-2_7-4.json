My little brother was outside, helmet strapped on, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp with a determined grin. He\u2019d been talking about this new skateboard trick for days, and now he was ready to try it. As his sibling, I knew I should be out there, making sure he was safe, maybe even talking him out of it if it looked too risky. But inside, Mrs. Carter, my patient, was resting after her procedure. Her last set of vitals showed a slight spike in her pulse and temperature\u2014nothing alarming, but enough that I knew I should check on her again, just to be sure. My supervisor always emphasized how important it was to catch changes early. I stood in the hallway, torn, my heart pounding. If I left my brother alone, what if he got hurt? But if I delayed checking on Mrs. Carter, what if her condition worsened? Both needed me, both expected me to be there, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
