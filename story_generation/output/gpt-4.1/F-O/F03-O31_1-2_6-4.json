My radio crackled with updates, and I could see the fear and confusion on the faces of the people involved. As a police officer, I knew my job was to keep everyone safe, to stay calm and focused. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my mother\u2019s name on the screen. She rarely called during my shift. I remembered her voice from last night, a little shaky, and how I\u2019d promised to check in more often. I was supposed to be the son who asked if everything was okay, who listened and reassured her. Now, with the chaos around me, I felt torn. My duty was here, but my heart was with my parents, wondering if they needed me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, caught between the uniform on my back and the family waiting at home."}
