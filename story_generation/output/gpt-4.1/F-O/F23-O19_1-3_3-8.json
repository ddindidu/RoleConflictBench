The national continuing education program was live, and I needed these credits to keep my pharmacist license. My phone buzzed with reminders, and the lecturer\u2019s voice droned on about drug interactions. Just then, my stepson, Ethan, wandered in, slumping into the chair across from me. He mumbled a half-hearted \u201cplease\u201d as he reached for the juice, then left the fridge door open. I caught myself sighing, remembering the promise I\u2019d made to his dad: to help Ethan learn respect and responsibility, to be present and guide him, not just be a bystander. But the clock was ticking, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss this session. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the duty of shaping Ethan\u2019s character, the other toward the professional standards I\u2019d worked so hard to uphold. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart racing as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment."}
