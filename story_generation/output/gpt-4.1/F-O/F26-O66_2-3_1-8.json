I could see the worry in her eyes, the way she chewed her lip, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed the kind of gentle advice only a grandparent could give. I wanted to sit beside her, to share a story from my own childhood, to remind her that feeling lost is only temporary. But my phone buzzed insistently. The taxi app flashed: \u201cPassenger waiting. Please hurry.\u201d The message was followed by another: \u201cAre you close? I\u2019m late for work!\u201d I felt the familiar tug of duty. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt, reliable, and professional. My rating depended on it, and so did my income. Yet, as a grandmother, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom when it mattered most. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the anxious passenger and the granddaughter who needed me just as urgently."}
