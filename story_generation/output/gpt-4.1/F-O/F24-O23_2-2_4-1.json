The purchase agreement deadline was looming, and my client was counting on me to catch any errors before the morning. My phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner\u2019s at 7. Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken plea for me to show up, to be part of the family, not just the person who always had an excuse.\n\nMy mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my client and risk missing something crucial in the contract. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be the absent step-sibling again, the one who never quite fit in, who always put work first. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each tugging in a different direction. I wanted to be reliable, both as a lawyer and as a family member, but tonight, it felt impossible to be both. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to let down."}
