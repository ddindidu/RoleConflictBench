The deadline for closing the books was just hours away, and my manager had already sent two reminder emails. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind was elsewhere. My stepbrother\u2019s text from earlier replayed in my head: \u201cCan you come home? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just found out some devastating news about our family, and I could hear the pain in his voice even through the short message. As his step-sibling, I knew he expected me to be there, to listen, to help him through this. But as an accountant, I was expected to stay focused, to ensure every number lined up, every document was perfect. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, my heart torn between the urgent demands of my job and the emotional needs of my family. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, and wondered how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
