Can you vacuum and tidy the living room before you leave for work?\u201d I promised I would, knowing how important it was to present a spotless home. But as I rushed through the chores, I kept glancing at the clock, anxious about being late for my cashier shift. At the store, my mind was still at home, picturing the clutter I hadn\u2019t finished clearing. Then, a customer approached, frustrated, holding a blender and no receipt. \u201cI need to return this. It\u2019s broken,\u201d she insisted. I remembered the strict policy\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager had warned us: no exceptions. The customer\u2019s voice grew louder, drawing attention. I felt my phone vibrate again\u2014another reminder from my spouse. My chest tightened. At home, I was expected to be a reliable partner, making everything perfect for our guests. Here, I was expected to enforce the rules, no matter how upset the customer became. I stood there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
