The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and I was supposed to be there, waiting outside with a smile, just like I promised the kids. They\u2019d been looking forward to me picking them up, especially after missing the last parent-teacher meeting. But here I was, scrubbing the kitchen floor of Mrs. Patel\u2019s house, my hands raw and aching. I\u2019d run out of gloves halfway through the job, and the cleaning solution stung my skin. The agency was strict\u2014no shortcuts, always follow safety and hygiene protocols. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking the rules, risking my job, and maybe even my health. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let the kids down again, reinforcing that nagging feeling that I\u2019d never quite measure up as their step-parent. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the mop in my hand and the promise I\u2019d made."}
