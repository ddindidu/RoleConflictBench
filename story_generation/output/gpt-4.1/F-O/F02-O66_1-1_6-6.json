The backseat was spotless, just as the company demanded\u2014no crumbs, no wrappers, not even a stray hair. I prided myself on that. My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised Alex the Nintendo today.\u201d I could picture my son\u2019s hopeful face, the way he\u2019d been counting down the days. But the fares had been slow this week, and the cost of that game console would eat into the money I\u2019d set aside for rent. \n\nAs I pulled up to the curb for my last fare, a group of teenagers piled in, laughing and clutching greasy fast food bags. I hesitated, knowing the mess they\u2019d leave behind would mean extra cleaning\u2014time I could spend with Alex, or maybe squeezing in one more ride to make up the difference. My mind raced: should I risk the mess for the fare, or turn them away and disappoint the company? Either way, I\u2019d be letting someone down\u2014my son, my boss, or myself. My hand hovered over the meter, heart pounding, caught between the father I wanted to be and the driver I had to be."}
