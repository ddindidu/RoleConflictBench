I really need to talk.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew I should be there, to listen and support her like she\u2019s always done for me. But just as I was about to reply, I noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system making a strange noise. I checked the panel\u2014something was definitely wrong. As a lifeguard, it\u2019s my job to make sure everything is safe, and a malfunctioning filter could put every swimmer at risk. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my sister needed me, but so did everyone in the pool. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urgent call of family and the immediate responsibility for everyone\u2019s safety."}
