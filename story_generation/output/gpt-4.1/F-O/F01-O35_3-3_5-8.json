It\u2019s urgent. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew my family needed me\u2014my grandson was in the hospital, and my daughter was overwhelmed. I wanted nothing more than to be by their side, to offer comfort and strength. But just as I was about to call in for emergency leave, the cabin door slid open. My supervisor stepped in, clipboard in hand, announcing an immediate performance audit. My mind raced. The transit authority expected flawless adherence to every protocol, especially with a supervisor watching my every move. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the duty to my family, who needed my presence and love, and the responsibility to my job, where any mistake could have serious consequences. My hands trembled on the controls as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the two roles that defined me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my all to both at this moment."}
