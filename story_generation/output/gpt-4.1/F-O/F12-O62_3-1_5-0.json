The house was a whirlwind of laundry, dusting, and last-minute grocery runs. He counted on me to make everything perfect, and I could see the stress in his eyes as he asked if I\u2019d be home in time to help set the table. But my shift at the pool started at noon, and as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t just leave early or let my attention wander. Even now, as I scan the water, I catch glimpses of swimmers edging toward the deep end. They\u2019re not in trouble, but I know how quickly things can change. My phone buzzes with a message from my husband: \u201cCan you pick up dessert on your way home?\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my duty to keep these swimmers safe, and my promise to be the supportive wife my husband needs today. My heart pounds as I try to figure out how I can possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
