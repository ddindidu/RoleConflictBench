My daughter\u2019s message blinks on the screen: \u201cMom, are you coming for the holiday dinner? The kids are excited to see you.\u201d I picture my grandchildren\u2019s faces, their laughter echoing in my memory. It\u2019s tradition\u2014every year, I\u2019m the one who brings the pie and stories, the one who listens and hugs and makes everyone feel at home. But this year, the experiment I\u2019ve been planning for months is finally underway. The specialized equipment is only available for three days, and if I miss this window, I\u2019ll have to wait another year. My team is counting on me; the data could be groundbreaking. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s expectation for warmth and presence, my colleagues\u2019 trust in my dedication. My heart aches with the pull of both, and I stare at the timer, torn, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
