My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you start a load before dinner? The kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I nod, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. But my laptop pings insistently from the living room\u2014Slack messages piling up, reminders that the design documents for the new feature are due by morning. The product manager from another team is waiting for my technical input, and I know the project\u2019s timeline depends on my feedback tonight.\n\nI stand in the hallway, caught between the hum of the washing machine and the glow of my screen. My mind races, torn between being the reliable spouse who keeps the household running and the dependable developer who doesn\u2019t let the team down. Both roles demand my attention, both feel urgent, and I can sense the tension building inside me. I take a deep breath, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and wonder which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down tonight."}
