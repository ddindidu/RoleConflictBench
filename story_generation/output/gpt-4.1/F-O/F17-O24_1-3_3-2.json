My family gathered around, laughter and stories echoing through the rooms as we prepared for our annual tradition\u2014one I\u2019d never missed. My father caught my eye, his silent nod reminding me how much these moments meant to him, to all of us. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see an urgent message from the courthouse: an emergency motion had just been filed, and as the presiding judge, I was required to review the case and make a ruling within the hour. My heart pounded. I knew the gravity of the situation\u2014a family\u2019s safety could depend on my decision. But as I looked at my own family, waiting for me to join in the ritual, I felt torn. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, just as the responsibility of my robe did. I stood, caught between the warmth of tradition and the cold urgency of justice, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
