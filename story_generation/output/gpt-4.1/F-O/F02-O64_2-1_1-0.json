My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there. She\u2019d practiced her lines for the class play all week, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cWill you come, Dad?\u201d I could almost hear her voice now, echoing in my mind as I handed change to a customer.\n\nBut the line at my register was growing, and my manager had already reminded me twice today about the importance of accuracy and customer service. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford mistakes,\u201d he\u2019d said, watching me closely. I knew if I left, even for a short while, it would put extra pressure on my coworkers and risk my job. Yet, the thought of my daughter searching the crowd for my face, only to find an empty seat, twisted my stomach with guilt.\n\nI stood there, caught between the beep of the scanner and the memory of my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
