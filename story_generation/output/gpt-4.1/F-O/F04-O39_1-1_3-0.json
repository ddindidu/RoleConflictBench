My little sister\u2019s eyes sparkled as she talked about going to the lake, and my mom kept glancing at me, waiting for my input. I knew they wanted me there, to be part of the laughter and the plans, to show I cared. But my phone buzzed with a message from my supervisor, reminding me to move a heavy stack of unused materials before the end of my shift. The job was tough, and I couldn\u2019t afford to let anyone down at work\u2014not with how tight things were lately. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the weight of my responsibilities at the site. I could feel the pressure building inside me, the fear of disappointing someone no matter what I chose. My sister\u2019s voice pulled me back, \u201cWhat do you think, will you come?\u201d I looked at her, then at my phone, caught in the middle, not sure which part of me should answer."}
