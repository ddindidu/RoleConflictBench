My granddaughter, Emma, had come to visit after school, her eyes bright with curiosity. As I rang up a loaf of bread for Mrs. Jenkins, Emma leaned on the counter and asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d Her question tugged at my heart\u2014I wanted to pause, look her in the eye, and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But just then, a small line formed, and I caught the expectant gaze of the next customer. I smiled, greeted them, and kept scanning, my mind split between the need to offer Emma the thoughtful guidance she deserved and the obligation to keep the line moving with friendly efficiency. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my heart torn between being the attentive grandparent Emma needed and the reliable cashier my customers expected."}
