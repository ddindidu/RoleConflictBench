It was a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to call and share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present for these milestones. But as I glanced around, I saw sawdust piling up near the power tools, scraps of wood scattered underfoot. I remembered the safety training: a clean workspace is a safe workspace. If I stopped now to call her, I\u2019d be leaving the area messy, risking an accident for myself or anyone else who might walk in. Yet, if I waited, I\u2019d be letting her down, missing the chance to be the supportive grandmother she needed. My heart tugged in both directions, torn between the warmth of family and the discipline of my craft, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
