My eyes caught a few minor inconsistencies\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to nag at my conscience as an architect. I knew I should flag them, even if it meant delaying the project and facing the contractor\u2019s frustration. Just as I was weighing my options, my mother sat down across from me, her face drawn and tired. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt caring for Dad after his surgery, her voice trembling as she admitted she didn\u2019t know how much longer she could keep it up. I could see she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the daughter she could lean on. But my mind kept drifting back to the plans, the responsibility I carried for the safety of everyone who would use that building. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
