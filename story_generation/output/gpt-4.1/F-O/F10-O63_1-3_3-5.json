We need five more sales to hit target!\u201d My headset felt heavier than usual, pressing into my temples as I dialed another number. My heart pounded, not just from the pressure at work, but from the text I\u2019d just received from Mom: \u201cDinner starts at 6. Don\u2019t be late. Grandma made your favorite.\u201d It was the last night of the quarter, and every call counted. But tonight was also the family\u2019s annual holiday dinner, a tradition I\u2019d never missed. I could already picture the table, the laughter, the stories, and the look of disappointment on my parents\u2019 faces if I didn\u2019t show. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the team\u2019s reliance on me, while my mother\u2019s gentle words tugged at my heart. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
