Today was the family gathering\u2014my daughter and grandchildren would be arriving soon, expecting laughter, hugs, and homemade treats. As a grandmother, I longed to be present, to listen to their stories, to hold my youngest grandchild in my arms. But as I set out the plates, my phone buzzed with a reminder from my supervisor: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, all cleaning must be done with gloves, masks, and sanitizer. No exceptions.\u201d The new protocols at work were strict, and I was expected to model perfect hygiene, even at home. I stared at the box of gloves on the counter, the mask beside it. How could I greet my family, touch my grandchild, and share a meal while wrapped in layers of protection? Would they understand if I kept my distance, or would they feel hurt, thinking I was cold or afraid of them? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of my family and the duty to keep them safe."}
