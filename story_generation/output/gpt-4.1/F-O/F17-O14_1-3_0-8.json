The warning alert is insistent, shrill, and I know if I don\u2019t act fast, there\u2019s a real risk of a hazardous leak. My mind races through the safety protocols\u2014shut down, ventilate, alert the team. But the buzz comes again, and I glance at the screen: \u201cHi, just checking in. Love you. \u2013 Mom.\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last message from yesterday, and I know she worries when I go silent. I promised I\u2019d keep in touch, especially on weekends. My hands tremble as I weigh the urgency of the lab against the gentle expectation from home. I feel the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding immediate action to prevent disaster, the other quietly asking for a moment of connection. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the soft glow of my mother\u2019s message, unable to move toward either."}
