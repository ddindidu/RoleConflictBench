It means so much to your grandmother.\u201d My heart squeezed. This ceremony was more than a ritual\u2014it was a thread tying generations together, and my family expected me to honor it, to show I hadn\u2019t forgotten where I came from. But my calendar blinked with a court hearing scheduled for the same morning. It was a minor case, one that could be postponed, but I knew my client was anxious, counting on me to be there, to show that their concerns mattered. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s pride and tradition on one side, my professional duty and my client\u2019s trust on the other. I could almost hear my grandmother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, and my client\u2019s nervous questions echoing in my mind. My chest tightened as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
