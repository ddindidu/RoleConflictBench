Today was her open class, and she\u2019d practiced her lines all week, asking, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I promised I would. But as I drove to the control tower, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the open class at 8:30. I glanced at the schedule: pre-dawn traffic was light, the radar almost empty, but I was still on shift until 9. My supervisor expected unwavering focus, even during quiet hours. I watched the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds. My daughter\u2019s hopeful face lingered in my mind, but so did the responsibility of keeping the airspace safe. I gripped my headset, heart pounding, torn between the classroom and the control room, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
