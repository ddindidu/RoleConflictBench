As an architect, I was expected to keep projects on track, but lately, I\u2019d been reviewing timelines more casually, trusting my team to handle the details. My mind, though, was elsewhere\u2014on the promise I\u2019d made to my stepson. He\u2019d been counting down the days to his birthday, certain I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo he\u2019d wanted for months. My partner reminded me how important it was to keep promises, especially as a step-parent trying to build trust. But the cost gnawed at me. We\u2019d been tight on money, and I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability. If I bought the Nintendo, I\u2019d have to cut back somewhere else. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d risk disappointing him and undermining my role in his life. My phone buzzed again\u2014another project update. I stared at the screen, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations at home, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
