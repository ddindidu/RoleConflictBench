I called his name, trying to keep my voice calm, remembering how important it was to teach him respect and discipline in public spaces. He ignored me, giggling as he disappeared around a corner. I felt the familiar frustration rise\u2014he needed to learn boundaries, and I was responsible for guiding him.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed urgently. It was the control center: a passenger emergency alarm had been triggered on my train. Someone needed immediate help, and as the subway operator, I was expected to respond without delay, ensuring everyone\u2019s safety. My mind raced. My son needed me here, to correct and protect him, to teach him right from wrong. But my passengers needed me too\u2014someone\u2019s life could depend on my quick action. I stood frozen, torn between the father my son needed and the operator my passengers depended on, the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
