As a step-parent, I promised my partner and stepdaughter that I\u2019d keep us afloat, that we\u2019d never lose this house. My phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. There\u2019d been a major traffic accident on the highway, and all available officers were needed. I was supposed to meet with the bank in an hour to discuss our loan options, but duty called. I could hear my stepdaughter in the next room, humming as she did her homework, trusting that I\u2019d keep our world steady. But as a police officer, I knew lives might depend on my presence at that accident scene. The city expected me to protect its people, to be there when chaos struck. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the family that needed me to secure our future and the strangers who needed me to keep them safe right now."}
