I wanted to make sure she understood the importance of respect and kindness, even in small daily routines. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the salon. A new client, who had come in for a hair color, was unhappy with the result and wanted to speak with me immediately. My heart sank. I knew how crucial first impressions were in my line of work, and I prided myself on making every client feel heard and satisfied. But here I was, in the middle of a teaching moment with my daughter, trying to instill values that I believed would shape her character. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between the urgent need to address my client\u2019s disappointment and the equally important responsibility of guiding my child. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I stood there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
