He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much pressure he was under. As his sibling, I felt I should be there for him, maybe sit with him, listen, or just offer a reassuring word. But I was still in my work uniform, the smell of disinfectant clinging to my clothes. My shift as a housekeeping cleaner had just ended, and I remembered the supervisor\u2019s stern reminder: always change out of work clothes and wash up before interacting with family, especially now with stricter hygiene protocols. I glanced at my hands, still dry from sanitizer, and hesitated. My brother needed me, but so did the safety rules I was expected to follow. The urge to comfort him pulled at me, but the weight of responsibility pressed just as hard. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of family and the cold logic of safety, my heart pounding with indecision."}
