She\u2019d called, upset about something I\u2019d said earlier, and I knew I needed to listen, to be patient, to show her the respect she deserved as my sister. But the app pinged again\u2014my passenger was already waiting, sending messages asking how long I\u2019d be. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt, professional, and courteous, especially when someone was in a hurry. My sister\u2019s voice trembled, and I could hear how much she needed me to understand her side, to not brush her off. But the pressure from the passenger grew with every notification, reminding me that my job demanded my attention and punctuality. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014between being the brother my sister needed and the reliable driver my passenger expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, wrestling with which responsibility to answer first."}
