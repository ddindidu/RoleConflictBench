My family was gathered around, excitedly discussing plans for a weekend hiking trip. My younger brother looked at me, eyes bright, \u201cYou\u2019ll come this time, right?\u201d My mother chimed in, \u201cWe haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I felt their hope, the warmth of being wanted, and I wanted to say yes.\n\nBut my mind drifted to the pharmacy, where Mrs. Lee, a regular patient, was starting a new medication. She\u2019d called earlier, anxious about side effects and how to take it properly. I knew she depended on me for clear guidance and reassurance. My manager expected me to be thorough and available, especially for patients like her.\n\nAs my family waited for my answer, I felt the weight of their expectations pressing against the professional responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward laughter and togetherness at home, and toward the quiet trust of a patient who needed me. I stared at my phone, torn, not knowing which part of myself to let down."}
