The clock ticked louder with every passing minute, reminding me of the looming deadline for the purchase agreement I needed to review. As a lawyer, I knew missing this deadline could have serious consequences for my client\u2014and for my reputation. But then I heard footsteps and saw my stepson, eyes bright with anticipation. He reminded me, for the third time that week, about the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. He\u2019d been saving up, but he needed my help to buy it today, before the sale ended. I saw the hope in his face, the trust that I\u2019d keep my word, and I felt the weight of my promise. My partner expected me to be there for the family, to provide not just financially but emotionally. Yet, the documents on my screen demanded my full attention. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the child who needed me to show up, and the client who relied on my diligence. I stared at the screen, torn, the pressure mounting as I tried to decide which role to honor first."}
