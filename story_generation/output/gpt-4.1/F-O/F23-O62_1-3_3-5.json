He was fidgety, barely listening, and I knew I needed to be patient, to guide him gently but firmly\u2014just as I\u2019d promised his mother I would. My phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed right away, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. As the head lifeguard, it was my responsibility to check the equipment and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. I looked at Max, who was finally making eye contact, waiting for my next words. At the same time, I pictured the pool, the swimmers who trusted me, and the risk if I delayed. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the reliable step-parent, be the vigilant lifeguard. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
