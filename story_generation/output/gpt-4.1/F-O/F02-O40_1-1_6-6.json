I examined the toy, calculating the hours it would take and the cost of materials. My mind drifted to my own son, who had been asking for a Nintendo for months. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it soon, but money was tight. Every extra job counted toward that promise, toward keeping my word and making him happy. But I also knew that if I quoted too low, I\u2019d be shortchanging my own family, risking the financial stability I worked so hard to maintain. If I quoted too high, I might lose the job altogether. My heart ached, torn between the needs of my customer and the needs of my own child, between being a good father and a responsible craftsman. I hesitated, pen hovering over the notepad, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
