My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d join in this time. I wanted to say yes, to promise I\u2019d be there, but my mind kept drifting to the ambulance parked outside. I was supposed to be checking the first-aid kit, making sure nothing was missing or expired. If I missed something, it could mean the difference between life and death for someone out there. My mom caught my eye, her look a silent plea to be present, to be the brother they needed. But the weight of my other responsibility pressed down on me. I felt torn, the expectations of my family pulling me one way, the demands of my job tugging me another. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, caught between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of duty."}
