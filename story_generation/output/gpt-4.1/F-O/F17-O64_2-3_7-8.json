I wanted to stay, to sit with them and listen, maybe make them tea\u2014anything to ease their burden. But the holiday rush at the store meant I had to be there, and as soon as I clocked in, the demands shifted. The line snaked past the registers, and a customer in front of me was already raising their voice, frustrated about a price mismatch. I forced a smile, trying to sound calm and friendly, even as my mind wandered back home. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to be the supportive child my parents needed, and the pressure to be the perfect cashier, unflappable and kind. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my voice steady for the customer while my thoughts raced with worry for my parents."}
