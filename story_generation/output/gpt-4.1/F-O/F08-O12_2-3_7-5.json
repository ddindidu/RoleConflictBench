She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her excitement. I knew she\u2019d want to talk, to share every detail, and I wanted to be there for her, to listen and celebrate. But my laptop chimed insistently\u2014Slack messages piling up, architects from three different teams waiting for my input on the new feature set. The launch date had been moved up, and everyone was blocked until I made some decisions. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the pressure of work. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice reminding me how much it means to the kids when I\u2019m present, but the anxious faces of my colleagues flashed in my mind too, counting on me to keep the project moving. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
