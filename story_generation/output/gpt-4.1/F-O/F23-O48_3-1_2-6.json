My heart sank as I listened to the voicemail: my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in and discuss it. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to prove I was there for the hard moments, not just the easy ones. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice calling from her room. She\u2019d been especially down today, and I was scheduled to spend the next hour with her, just talking, maybe playing cards\u2014anything to help her feel less alone. My supervisor always reminded us how much our patients depended on us for comfort, especially those with no family nearby. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my stepson needing guidance and support, Mrs. Carter needing companionship and care. I stood in the hallway, torn, my mind racing with the expectations of being a good parent and a compassionate caregiver, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
