She looked up, eyes wide and searching. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to take a big step in life?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling with uncertainty. I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I\u2019d have some wise answer drawn from years of hard work and living. I opened my mouth, ready to share something meaningful, when my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent call from the site. Through the crackling line, I heard the foreman\u2019s voice, panic in the background. I glanced at the live feed on my phone and saw a coworker, oblivious, about to walk under a suspended load. My heart pounded. I needed to shout a warning, to keep everyone safe, but my granddaughter\u2019s question hung in the air, her hope for guidance clear in her eyes. I was torn, caught between the need to protect my crew and the desire to be the steady presence my granddaughter needed right now."}
