It means a lot to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. This was the first time I\u2019d be at the front, reciting prayers, guiding relatives, making sure everything honored our family\u2019s traditions. I knew how much it mattered to them, to all of us. But as I glanced at the back seat of my cab, I saw the mess left by my last passenger\u2014spilled coffee, crumbs, a faint but stubborn smell. My next fare was due in ten minutes, and I prided myself on keeping my taxi spotless. My regulars expected it, and so did my boss. If I was late or the car wasn\u2019t clean, I risked losing their trust, maybe even my job. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one shoulder, the demands of my work on the other. My hands trembled as I reached for the cleaning wipes, my mind racing, torn between duty to my family and responsibility to my passengers."}
