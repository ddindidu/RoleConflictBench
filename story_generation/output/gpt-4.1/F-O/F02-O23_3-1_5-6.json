My heart pounded\u2014part of me wanted to scold him right there, to teach him that stealing is wrong, that honesty matters above all. That\u2019s what a good father does, right? But as I knelt to meet his eyes, my phone buzzed. It was a colleague from the networking event earlier, following up on a question about a client\u2019s case. I remembered how I\u2019d dodged the question, feeling the pressure to share just enough to seem open, but not enough to betray my client\u2019s trust. Now, with my son, I felt the same tension\u2014how much do I reveal, how harsh should I be? I was expected to be a pillar of integrity for my child, but also a guardian of secrets for my clients. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding a different kind of honesty, a different kind of loyalty. I looked at my son, then at my phone, torn between the lessons I needed to teach and the promises I needed to keep."}
