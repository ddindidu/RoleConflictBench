It\u2019s a message from my husband: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I know he\u2019s been struggling, barely sleeping, and I promised I\u2019d be there whenever he needed me. But the foreman\u2019s voice is already echoing across the site, calling everyone to the safety briefing. Missing it isn\u2019t an option\u2014protocol is strict, and the team depends on everyone being present and focused. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn. If I don\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll let him down when he needs me most. If I do, I risk being late, drawing the team\u2019s frustration and possibly getting written up. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be failing someone who counts on me."}
