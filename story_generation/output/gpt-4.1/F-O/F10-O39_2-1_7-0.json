Dad barely touched his breakfast. I wanted to sit with them, ask what was wrong, offer comfort, but my shift started early. At the site, sweat already stung my eyes as I hauled bricks. My supervisor caught me on my way to grab water. \u201cMove those unused tiles to the back lot before you clock out,\u201d he said, voice clipped. I nodded, feeling the weight of the task. The pile was heavy, and the day was already long. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014Mom\u2019s name on the screen. I imagined her needing to talk, maybe just to hear my voice. But the stack of tiles loomed, and the supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I stood there, torn, the ache in my arms matched by the ache in my chest, unsure which duty to answer first."}
