My husband\u2019s tired eyes meet mine as he juggles dinner and our daughter\u2019s homework. I promised I\u2019d fold the clothes tonight, to share the load, to be present. My phone buzzes, sharp and urgent\u2014a call from dispatch. There\u2019s an armed robbery in progress, just blocks away. My heart pounds. I know what\u2019s expected of me: to suit up, to protect, to run toward danger when others run away. But here, in this living room, I\u2019m needed too. I see the disappointment flicker across my husband\u2019s face as I reach for my badge. The demands of both worlds pull at me, each urgent, each important. My hands tremble as I stand between the laundry and the door, torn by the impossible choice."}
