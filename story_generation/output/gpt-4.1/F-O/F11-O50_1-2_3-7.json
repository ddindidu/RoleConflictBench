My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my mom suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me for my opinion. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present and enthusiastic, to help make the weekend special. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the factory floor. The operator was having trouble with the new press, and his constant adjustments were wasting expensive material. My supervisor wanted me to call in, walk the operator through the correct settings, and make sure the problem stopped before the next shift.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides. My family wanted me to be the supportive sister, fully engaged in our plans. My job demanded I be the reliable expert, always available to guide clients and prevent costly mistakes. I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to focus on my brother\u2019s excited voice, while my mind raced through possible solutions for the machine issue. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both expectations pressed down on me, leaving me frozen between them."}
