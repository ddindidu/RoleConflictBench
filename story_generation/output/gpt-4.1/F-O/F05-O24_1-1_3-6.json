My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cWe agreed to share the chores, remember?\u201d\u2014and I know she\u2019s right. She\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d help more at home. But as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes with a notification: the new law review journal has arrived. I\u2019ve been waiting for this issue, eager to read the latest articles on emerging legal theories. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay sharp, to keep up with every shift in the law. My colleagues will be discussing these articles tomorrow, and I can\u2019t afford to fall behind. I glance from the laundry to the unopened journal, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My hands hover, uncertain, as I wrestle with the demands of being a good husband and a diligent judge, knowing that whichever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
