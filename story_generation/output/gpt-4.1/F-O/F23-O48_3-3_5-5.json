The manager explained he\u2019d caught him slipping candy into his pocket. My heart pounded\u2014at home, I\u2019m expected to teach him right from wrong, to be the steady hand guiding him. But my phone buzzed urgently: the hospital needed me back. My patient, Mr. Harris, was in critical condition, and I was the only one available to monitor his vital signs every few minutes. I could hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of accuracy and vigilance. But here was my stepson, eyes wide, waiting for my reaction. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down on me. My mind raced with questions\u2014do I stay and teach him a lesson, or rush back to the hospital where a life might depend on me? The expectations from both sides clashed inside me, leaving me frozen in the store aisle, unable to move."}
