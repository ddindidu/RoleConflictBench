My manager always reminded me to smile, make small talk, and keep the line moving smoothly. I greeted each person with a practiced cheerfulness, even though my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014three messages from my younger brother. He never texted this much unless something was wrong. I glanced at the screen: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart squeezed. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. But as I looked up, another customer approached, waiting expectantly. I could see the line growing, and I knew my manager was watching. I felt torn\u2014my brother needed me, but so did my job.
