My shift at the construction site is almost over, and I know the foreman expects every corner swept clean before we clock out. Safety is drilled into us\u2014no stray nails, no loose boards, nothing that could trip someone up. But as I push the broom, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my wife, her message urgent: our son is running wild in the supermarket, darting between aisles, ignoring her calls to stop. She needs me to talk to him, to remind him about respect and discipline, the values I promised we\u2019d teach together.\n\nI stare at the half-swept floor, dust swirling in the fading light. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let my crew down, maybe even risk someone\u2019s safety. But if I stay, I\u2019m not there for my son, not the father I want to be. My hands grip the broom tighter, torn between the duty to my team and the responsibility to guide my child. The minutes tick by, and I feel the pull from both worlds, each demanding more than I can give."}
