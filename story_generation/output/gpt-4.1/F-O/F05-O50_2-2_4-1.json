My wife had mentioned this morning how important it was to have clean clothes for the kids\u2019 school trip tomorrow. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d take care of it today, and I could already hear her voice in my head, reminding me how we needed to share the load at home. Just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed urgently. It was the plant manager\u2014again. The main production unit was down, and the sensor errors that had been plaguing us all week had finally brought everything to a halt. Thirty minutes of downtime already, and every minute meant lost revenue and mounting pressure from my boss. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectation to be a reliable partner at home and the go-to problem solver at work. My hands hovered between the laundry basket and my phone, my mind racing, torn by the demands of two lives that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
