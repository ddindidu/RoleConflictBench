The phone queue is relentless, and management has sent out another reminder: no unscheduled breaks, every minute accounted for. My headset feels heavy, pressing into my temples as I listen to another customer\u2019s voice. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my mom shuffling past my bedroom door, her shoulders slumped, eyes rimmed red. Dad\u2019s voice is low and tired in the kitchen. I know they\u2019re both struggling, more than they let on, and I ache to step away, to sit with them, to offer comfort and just be present. But my break isn\u2019t for another hour, and if I log off early, it\u2019ll be flagged. My job depends on following the rules, but my heart is with my parents. I stare at the blinking call light, torn between the demands of my work and the silent plea from my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which one I can bear to let down."}
