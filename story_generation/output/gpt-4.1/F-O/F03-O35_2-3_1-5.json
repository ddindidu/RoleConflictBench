It was Sunday evening\u2014my usual time to call Mom and Dad. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s gentle reminder from last week: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, even if you\u2019re busy.\u201d I knew how much they looked forward to these calls, how they worried if I missed even one. But before I could even unlock my phone, the emergency alarm blared through the train. The intercom crackled with urgency: \u201cMedical emergency in car three.\u201d Instantly, my training kicked in. I had to stay focused, keep the passengers calm, and coordinate with emergency services. But as I reached for the radio, my phone vibrated again\u2014Mom, calling this time. My heart twisted. I wanted to reassure her, to hear Dad\u2019s voice, to be the attentive son they needed. But right now, dozens of passengers depended on me to act quickly and keep them safe. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the voice of my family and the responsibility echoing through the train."}
