And don\u2019t forget the guest towels.\u201d My mind races through the checklist: dusting, setting the table, making sure everything is spotless for her relatives. I know how much this means to her, how she wants everything perfect. But as I look up, the radar screen is a blur of blips\u2014planes stacked in holding patterns, pilots requesting updates, the radio a constant hum. The holiday rush has turned the airspace into a puzzle with no easy solution, and every decision I make could ripple out for miles. My supervisor expects me to keep delays minimal, to keep everyone safe. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the home I share and the skies I manage. My hands hover over the keyboard, my mind torn between the chaos at home and the chaos in the air, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
