My father nodded, reminding me how much this meant to everyone. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the plant manager. The inspector\u2019s report was clear: unless we fixed the safety issues by tomorrow, the entire operation would be shut down. As an engineer, I knew the risks of ignoring those warnings. My team was already stretched thin, and I was expected to lead the emergency response. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family counting on me to honor our heritage, my colleagues relying on me to keep them safe and the plant running. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, the festival and the deadline colliding. I closed my eyes, torn between the legacy I was born into and the responsibility I had chosen."}
