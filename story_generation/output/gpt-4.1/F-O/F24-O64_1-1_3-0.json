My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014our family group chat lighting up with messages about this weekend\u2019s plans. My stepdad wanted everyone\u2019s input, and my mom had already hinted that I should be more involved, especially since I\u2019d missed the last movie night. I glanced at the screen, seeing my stepsister\u2019s name pop up, asking if I\u2019d join them for the hike. \n\nA customer approached, placing groceries on the belt. I forced a smile, scanning each item, but my mind was split. I knew I was expected to be present, to show I cared about this new family, but I also couldn\u2019t afford to mess up at work. My manager had warned me last week about distractions at the register. The line behind the customer grew, and my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, my mom asking for a quick answer. My hands hesitated over the register, heart pounding, torn between replying to my family and focusing on the transaction in front of me."}
