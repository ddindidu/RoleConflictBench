Only a few customers wait, their eyes flicking to their phones. My phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014Mom\u2019s name lights up the screen. I remember how she\u2019s been quiet lately, and I promised myself I\u2019d check in more, ask if everything\u2019s okay at home. I glance at the line; a woman shifts impatiently, her basket full. My manager expects me to keep things moving, no distractions, no mistakes. But Mom rarely calls during the day. What if she needs me? My fingers tremble as I scan a carton of milk, my mind split between the register and the worry gnawing at me. I want to be the daughter who listens, who notices when something\u2019s wrong. But right now, I\u2019m the cashier, and everyone expects me to focus. The phone buzzes again, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
