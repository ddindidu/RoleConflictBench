The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. Groceries, rent, the kids\u2019 school fees. I knew I had to pick up extra shifts, maybe even a second job, just to keep us afloat. As a father, it was my responsibility to make sure my family never went without. But as I walked into the pool facility for my lifeguard shift, the sharp smell of chlorine hit me, and I noticed the filtration system was making a strange, grinding noise. I checked the gauges\u2014something was definitely wrong. If the system failed, the water could become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. My supervisor had already warned us about the budget; repairs would mean closing the pool for a day, maybe more, and I\u2019d lose precious hours\u2014money my family desperately needed. My mind raced, torn between reporting the issue and risking our financial stability, or keeping quiet and hoping nothing happened. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
