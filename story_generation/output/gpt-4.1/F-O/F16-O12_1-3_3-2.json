My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you fold these tonight? I\u2019ve got to prep for tomorrow.\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, and lately, I\u2019ve been letting things slide. But my laptop pings\u2014a Slack message from my team lead. The critical service I just refactored is lagging, and traces point to my code. The team is waiting for a fix before the morning release. My mind races: clean, maintainable code is my pride, and now it\u2019s failing under pressure. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I ignore the laundry, I let my partner down again. If I ignore the code, I let my team down and risk a production outage. My heart pounds as I stand between the laundry and my laptop, torn by the demands of being a good spouse and a responsible developer, wishing I could split myself in two."}
