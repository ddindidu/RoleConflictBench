The Nintendo, remember?\u201d His birthday was just days away, and I could already picture his excitement, the way he\u2019d tell his friends at school. I wanted to give him that joy, to keep my promise, to be the father who never let him down. But my phone buzzed with a message from work: \u201cMachines overheating. Need urgent maintenance. Can you come in?\u201d As the lead repairer, I knew the risks\u2014if those machines failed, production would halt, and the company would lose money. Worse, my job could be on the line, and with it, the financial stability I worked so hard to provide for my family. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my son and the responsibility to my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stared at my son, then at my phone, feeling the knot in my stomach tighten as I wrestled with what to do next."}
