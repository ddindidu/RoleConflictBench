He looked up at me, eyes wide with worry, and I knew he needed me to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he could get through his final exam. That\u2019s what family does, right? We support each other, especially when things get tough. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the factory\u2019s machines were due for their annual maintenance next week, and I was responsible for making sure everything was ready for the shutdown. If I missed a step, the whole line could be delayed, costing the company thousands. My supervisor had made it clear\u2014no excuses, no mistakes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my brother\u2019s anxious voice blending with the hum of machines in my mind. I wanted to be the sibling he could count on, but I also couldn\u2019t let my team down. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, torn between the demands of family and work."}
