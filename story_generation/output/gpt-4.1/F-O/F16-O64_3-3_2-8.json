She was red-faced, her voice rising as she complained about the long line and the price of the holiday decorations. I nodded, apologizing, trying to keep my tone light and friendly, just as my manager expected. But every vibration from my phone reminded me that my partner was at home, alone, struggling with the weight of their father\u2019s illness. They needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted nothing more than to step away, to call them, to be the supportive spouse they needed right now. But the line of customers stretched down the aisle, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every so often, making sure I kept things moving. My heart ached with guilt as I handed the woman her receipt, my mind torn between the demands of the register and the desperate messages waiting for me just out of reach."}
