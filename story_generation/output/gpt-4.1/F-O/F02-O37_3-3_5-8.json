My heart skipped. I rushed to the front, still in my cleaner\u2019s uniform, gloves and mask on, the scent of disinfectant clinging to me. There he was, eyes wide, a half-opened bag of chips in his hand. The store manager looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to handle it as a parent. I knew what was expected: I had to teach my son right from wrong, show him that stealing is unacceptable, and discipline him firmly but fairly. But I was also still on the clock, and the store had strict hygiene rules\u2014no removing gloves or mask, no touching anyone without sanitizing. My son reached for me, tears in his eyes, wanting comfort. I hesitated, torn between the urge to hold him and the rules drilled into me as a cleaner. The manager\u2019s gaze, my son\u2019s trembling hands, the latex gloves between us\u2014I stood there, caught between being the father he needed and the employee I was supposed to be."}
