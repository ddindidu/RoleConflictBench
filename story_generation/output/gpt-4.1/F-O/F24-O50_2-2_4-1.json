It means a lot to your mom.\u201d My stepsister had already texted, \u201cYou\u2019re coming, right? It\u2019s been ages since we all sat together.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were, especially since I\u2019d joined the family only a year ago. They wanted me there, present, part of the new whole.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave, my work phone rang. The plant manager\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cThe main unit\u2019s down again. Sensor errors. We\u2019re losing time\u2014can you get here ASAP?\u201d I could picture the blinking red lights, the anxious faces of the crew waiting for me to fix what no one else could. Production was at a standstill, and every minute counted.\n\nMy jacket hung over one arm, car keys in hand, I stood frozen in the hallway. Family or factory? Both needed me, both expected me to show up, to be reliable. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my stepmom\u2019s eyes against the urgency in my manager\u2019s voice, torn between two worlds that refused to wait."}
