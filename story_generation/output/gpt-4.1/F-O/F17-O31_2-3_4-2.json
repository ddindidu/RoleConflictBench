As a police officer, I knew what was expected of me: act swiftly, enforce the law, protect innocent lives. But as I turned the corner, I caught sight of the suspect\u2014my own cousin, mask slipping, eyes wild with fear. My family had always taught me to protect our own, to never betray blood, especially now when they\u2019d been reminding me daily about the importance of our traditions. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, stern and pleading, reminding me that family comes first, that we handle things privately, never involving outsiders. Yet here I was, gun drawn, torn between the badge on my chest and the blood in my veins. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my hands trembling as I tried to steady my breath, knowing that whatever I did next would betray either my family or my oath."}
