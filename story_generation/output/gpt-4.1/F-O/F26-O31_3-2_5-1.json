My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and the family needed me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my steady hands. I could hear the worry in her words, the unspoken plea for me to come right away. Just as I was about to grab my coat, my police radio crackled to life. There was a protest downtown, and it was turning ugly. My sergeant\u2019s voice was urgent: all available officers were to report immediately. I stared at the family photo on the fridge, my heart pulled in two directions. My family needed their grandmother, but my city needed its officer. I could feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the soft cardigan and the crisp blue shirt\u2014pressing down on me, each demanding my loyalty. I stood frozen, torn between the call of duty and the call of love, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
