I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. I hesitated, but answered, hearing her voice tremble as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare last night. She needed me, not just as her son, but as someone to lean on, to reassure her that things would be okay. My heart twisted; I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen, to comfort her. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, her frail hands already reaching for the spoon, depending on me to help her eat. I could hear the expectation in Mom\u2019s voice, the silent plea for support, while at the same time, I saw the trust in Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes, relying on me for her basic needs. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, my care, my attention. I stood there, torn, the phone warm against my ear, Mrs. Lee\u2019s breakfast cooling on the tray, feeling the impossible pull between being a good son and a responsible nursing assistant."}
