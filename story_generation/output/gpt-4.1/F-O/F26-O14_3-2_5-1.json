My grandson had a high fever, and they needed me to help at home. As a grandmother, I knew my presence would bring comfort and stability, especially in moments like this. But my mind kept drifting to the lab, where the specialized equipment I\u2019d reserved for months was finally available\u2014just for today. The experiment was crucial, a rare chance to gather data that could shape my research for years. My colleagues were counting on me, and the funding agency expected results. Yet, the thought of my family struggling without me tugged at my heart. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s weak voice calling for me, but I could also see the blinking lights of the instruments, waiting for my hands. The weight of both worlds pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
