I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name, a string of desperate texts. She needed me, right now, her words shaky with anxiety. I knew she only reached out when things were really bad. My heart twisted; I was her brother, her safe place, and she was asking for help.\n\nBut in front of me, a young woman hovered uncertainly by the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting around the salon. She looked lost, maybe even scared. As a hairdresser, it was my job to greet her, to offer a warm smile and make her feel at ease. I could see her nerves, the way she hesitated, and I knew how much a kind welcome could mean.\n\nI stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the urgent call of family and the immediate needs of my client.
