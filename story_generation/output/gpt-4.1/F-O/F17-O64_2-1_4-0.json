My mind drifts to the conversation at breakfast, where my parents reminded me how important it is to keep our family traditions alive, especially now that the holidays are near. They expect me to help prepare for the upcoming festival, to be present, to honor our customs just as they always have. But here I am, in my cashier uniform, focused on counting change and making sure every transaction is perfect. My manager expects accuracy and efficiency, no mistakes, even when the store is slow and my thoughts wander home. As I hand a customer their receipt, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s hopes for tradition and my responsibility to do my job well. I glance at the clock, knowing my shift will end soon, but the pressure of choosing where I belong right now grows heavier with every passing minute."}
