My phone buzzed with a message from my spouse: \u201cCan we talk tonight? It\u2019s important.\u201d My stomach tightened. We\u2019d been dancing around the topic of our finances for weeks, and I knew tonight was the night for honesty. I promised myself I\u2019d be open, even if it meant admitting things I\u2019d rather keep hidden.\n\nJust then, my client arrived, her hair still damp. \u201cI washed it right before coming,\u201d she said, smiling. The salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client gets a wash and condition, no exceptions. But her hair was spotless, and I could see she\u2019d made an effort. If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be bending the rules, risking my boss\u2019s disapproval. If I insisted, I\u2019d seem rigid and unkind.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I was expected to be vulnerable and honest, to lay everything bare. Here, I was supposed to follow protocol, no matter what. My mind spun with the pressure of meeting everyone\u2019s expectations, wondering how I could possibly do right by both."}
