My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you please fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but now, as I sit at my desk in the control tower, my headset crackles with urgency. A major route closure has just been announced, and the radar screen blooms with holding patterns, flights circling in tight stacks, pilots requesting updates every few seconds. My supervisor expects me to keep the airspace safe and efficient, to make split-second decisions that could mean the difference between order and chaos. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a text from my wife, a gentle reminder about the laundry. My chest tightens. I want to be the partner she can rely on, but right now, dozens of planes depend on me, too. I grip the edge of the console, torn between the world at home and the one in the sky, both demanding more than I feel I can give."}
