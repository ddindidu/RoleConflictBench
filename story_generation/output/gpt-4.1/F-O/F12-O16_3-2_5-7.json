She needed reassurance, a new prescription, and a careful adjustment to her treatment plan. My laptop was open on the counter, medical records glowing on the screen. At the same time, I could hear my husband in the living room, vacuuming, his voice strained as he called out for help with the guest room. My mother-in-law was arriving in a few hours, and the house was far from ready. I felt the weight of expectation from both sides\u2014my patient trusting me to manage her health, my family relying on me to make our home welcoming. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of medical care and the unspoken rule that the house must be spotless for guests. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on my patient\u2019s needs, but guilt gnawed at me for not being present with my husband. I could feel the tension building, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
