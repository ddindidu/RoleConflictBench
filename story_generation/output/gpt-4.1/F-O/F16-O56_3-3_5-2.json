My spouse was counting on me to help scrub, vacuum, and make everything spotless. I promised I\u2019d be there, but as I reached for the mop, the salon phone rang. The bride and her bridesmaids were already at the door\u2014half an hour early, nerves fraying, eyes darting to the clock. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to greet them warmly, calm their jitters, and make their day special. But my mind kept drifting home, picturing my spouse juggling chores alone, disappointment growing with every passing minute. I felt torn, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety, knowing that no matter where I turned, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
