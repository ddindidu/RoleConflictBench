I knew she was waiting for my usual lunchtime call, eager to hear about my day and share her own. We\u2019d always talked daily, a ritual that made her feel close and reassured. But today, my mind was tangled in technical documents and regulatory checklists. The new safety standard had just been released, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure our product met every requirement before launch. My manager\u2019s email, marked urgent, reminded me that evidence of compliance was due by the end of the day. I glanced at my phone, guilt prickling at my conscience. If I called my mother now, I\u2019d lose precious time, but if I ignored her, she\u2019d worry and feel neglected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good daughter and a responsible engineer."}
