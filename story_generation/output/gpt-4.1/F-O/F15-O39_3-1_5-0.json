My son stood beside him, eyes wide and guilty, a half-opened bag of chips in his hand. The manager\u2019s voice was stern but not unkind, explaining what had happened. My heart pounded. As a parent, I knew I had to teach my son about honesty and consequences, to show him right from wrong. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my supervisor. I had to move a heavy stack of materials before the end of the day, or risk being written up. I glanced at my son, trembling, and then at the clock. If I stayed to handle this, I\u2019d be late for work and might lose hours or even my job. If I rushed off, I\u2019d miss the chance to teach my son a lesson he desperately needed. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my child."}
