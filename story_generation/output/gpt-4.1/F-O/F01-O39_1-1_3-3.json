The family gathering was circled in red on my calendar at home\u2014my daughter\u2019s reminder that the grandkids had been looking forward to seeing me all week. I could already picture their faces, the way they\u2019d run up for hugs, the laughter around the dinner table.

The sweep-up at the end of the shift wasn\u2019t just routine; it was crucial. If I left early, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking someone\u2019s safety tomorrow.
