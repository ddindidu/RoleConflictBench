My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, please come. Grandma\u2019s not well. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. I was supposed to be there, comforting my family, holding my granddaughter\u2019s hand, being the steady presence they counted on. But right now, I was responsible for hundreds of passengers, watching the signal lights ahead. A minor delay had just been announced, and I needed to adjust our speed carefully, keep everyone safe, and avoid any sudden jolts. The expectation was clear: I couldn\u2019t let my focus slip, not even for a moment. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my family, picturing their worried faces, feeling the weight of their need for me. The train rumbled on, and I felt torn in two, pulled by the demands of duty and love, each as urgent as the other."}
