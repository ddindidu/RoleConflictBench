Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014my telemarketing shift just started. I\u2019m supposed to send a quick reply, maybe a reassuring emoji, but my headset crackles and a new call connects. The customer on the line is asking about the technical specs of our latest service, rattling off questions that go way beyond my script. My supervisor expects me to keep the call going, handle every objection, and not let the customer hang up unsatisfied. But my mind keeps drifting to Mom\u2019s message, the guilt of not checking in gnawing at me. I want to be the attentive son she hopes for, but right now, I\u2019m supposed to be the expert telemarketer, focused and unflappable. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between typing a quick reply and scrolling through the FAQ to answer the customer. The pressure from both sides squeezes my chest, and I can\u2019t seem to breathe deeply enough to satisfy either role."}
