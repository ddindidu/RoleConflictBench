My younger sister\u2019s eyes sparkled as she described a hiking trip, and my parents chimed in with suggestions for a picnic. They looked at me, expecting me to join in, to be present and enthusiastic. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my project manager. The client was waiting for my time estimates before they could finalize the contract, and the pressure was mounting. I knew how critical my input was; the whole team was counting on me to be thorough and accurate. My mind raced between the laughter at the table and the spreadsheet on my laptop. I wanted to be the brother who showed up, who made memories with his family, but I was also the engineer who couldn\u2019t let his team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt myself torn, caught in the silence between my family\u2019s hopeful glances and the urgent ping of my work notifications."}
