Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how much these family gatherings meant, especially now that we all lived so far apart. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I caught sight of the chart in my hand\u2014the one for Mr. Patel, whose family waited anxiously in the consultation room. I knew what I had to tell them would shatter their world. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention, my empathy, my time. Yet, as a sister, I was expected to be present, to laugh and cook and share stories, to be part of the family\u2019s joy. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. My heart ached with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
