I really need to talk.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my next telemarketing shift. He never asked for help unless it was serious. As his sister, I was supposed to be there, especially when he was struggling. But as I logged into the call system, my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cStay focused, stick to the script, and don\u2019t let personal matters interfere.\u201d \n\nThe first call came in. The customer fired off technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely covered. I tried to sound confident, but my mind kept drifting to my brother. Was he okay? Was he in trouble? I felt the pressure to handle the customer\u2019s objections smoothly, to keep my numbers up, but my heart was pounding for a different reason. I was torn\u2014my brother needed me, but so did my job. The phone rang again, and I stared at the screen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I could let down."}
