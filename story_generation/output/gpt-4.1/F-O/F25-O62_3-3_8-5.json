His eyes were tired, and he started talking about how overwhelmed he felt at work, how he didn\u2019t know if he could keep up anymore. He looked at me, searching for comfort, and I could feel the weight of his need for support pressing on me. But my phone buzzed\u2014an alert from the pool. The filtration system was malfunctioning, and if I didn\u2019t get there soon, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. I knew the rules: as a lifeguard, I was responsible for the safety of everyone at the pool, and that meant acting fast. But here was my stepdad, opening up to me in a way he rarely did, expecting me to listen, to be there for him. My mind raced, torn between the urgent responsibility at work and the emotional support my family needed. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
