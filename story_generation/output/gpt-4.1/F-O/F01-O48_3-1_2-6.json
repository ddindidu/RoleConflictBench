It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew it must be serious. At the same moment, my supervisor poked her head in. \u201cMr. Lee in 204 is asking for you. He\u2019s been a bit down today\u2014could you spend some time with him?\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight settle on my shoulders.\n\nAs a grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to be there for my granddaughter, to offer her the wisdom and comfort she sought. But as a nursing assistant, I was expected to provide the same support and presence to my patients, especially those like Mr. Lee who depended on me for companionship. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need of my family and the responsibility I owed to my patient. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
