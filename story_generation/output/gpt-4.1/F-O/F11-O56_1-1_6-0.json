Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walked in, her face lighting up as she spotted me. I glanced at the receptionist, who was scrolling through her phone, clearly available to greet her, but Mrs. Patel was already heading my way, expecting our usual warm exchange. I knew how much she valued feeling welcomed and comfortable, and I prided myself on making every client feel special from the moment they arrived.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cAre you free tonight? I\u2019d love to hang out.\u201d I remembered our recent talk about including each other more, building that mutual respect we both wanted. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on Mrs. Patel, giving her the attention she expected, or quickly reply to my sister, making her feel included? My heart raced as I stood there, caught between the warmth of family and the professionalism my clients counted on, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
