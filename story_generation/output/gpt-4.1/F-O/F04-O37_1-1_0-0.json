Can\u2019t wait to see you there!\u201d I felt a surge of pride\u2014she\u2019d worked so hard, and I wanted to be the brother she could count on, cheering her on from the front row. But as I put my phone down, my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need the lobby spotless for the inspection this afternoon. No exceptions.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I left for the ceremony, the lobby would only get a quick once-over, not the deep clean expected of me. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my sister\u2019s big moment, the one she\u2019d remember for years. My hands shook as I picked up the mop, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility of my job. Both sides expected me to be there, to give my best, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of letting someone down pressed on my chest as I stood frozen, caught between the shining floors and my sister\u2019s proud smile."}
