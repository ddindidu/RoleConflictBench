The deadline isn\u2019t pressing, so I know I should take this chance to refactor, to make the module something I can be proud of. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my wife, asking if we can talk tonight about the medical bills that have been piling up. She wants honesty, openness, a real conversation where nothing is hidden. I feel the weight of her expectation, the need to be present and transparent, to share my worries and listen to hers. Yet, the code calls to me, promising satisfaction if I just stay a little longer, make it perfect. My mind tugs in two directions: the urge to fulfill my duty as a husband, to be open and vulnerable, and the pull of my professional pride, to leave behind something clean and lasting. I stare at the screen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of the person I love and the work I want to perfect, unsure which role to answer first."}
