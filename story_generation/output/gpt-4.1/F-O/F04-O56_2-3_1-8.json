She never asks for help unless she really needs it, and I could hear the strain in her voice. She needed me\u2014her brother\u2014to be there, to listen, maybe just to sit with her for a while. But right in front of me sat Mrs. Lee, her hair thick with product buildup, the strands clumping together in stubborn knots. As her hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition her hair thoroughly, to make sure every tangle was gone before I even thought about picking up my scissors. She was already running late for an event, and I could sense her impatience.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions. My sister\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, pleading for support, while Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectant gaze reminded me of my professional duty. I wanted to be the brother who always showed up, but I was also the hairdresser who couldn\u2019t cut corners. My hands trembled as I reached for the shampoo, my heart torn between the person who needed me most and the client who trusted me with her hair."}
