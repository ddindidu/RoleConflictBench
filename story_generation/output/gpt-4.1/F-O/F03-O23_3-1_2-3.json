Did you eat breakfast?\u201d she wrote, as she did every morning. I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a short call, to reassure her that I was taking care of myself. It was our routine, a thread of connection I cherished and tried never to break.\n\nBut today, I was scheduled to represent a client in a procedural hearing. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014postponing would be simple, and my client wouldn\u2019t be harmed. Still, I felt the weight of my professional responsibility. I\u2019d promised to be there, to stand up for them, no matter how minor the matter seemed.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. If I called my mother now, I\u2019d be late to court. If I ignored her, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call my office. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my mother\u2019s need for reassurance, my client\u2019s trust in my reliability. My thumb hovered over the screen, heart pounding, caught between the roles of devoted son and committed lawyer, unsure which duty to answer first."}
