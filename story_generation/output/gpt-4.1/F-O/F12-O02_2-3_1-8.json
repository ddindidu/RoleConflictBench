My phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cNeed your estimates by tonight. Client\u2019s waiting.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours left before the contract deadline. My mind raced through calculations, risks, and dependencies, knowing how crucial it was to get this right.\n\nJust then, my husband walked in, his face drawn and anxious. He slumped into the chair across from me, eyes searching mine. \u201cI need to talk,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI have to make a big decision at work, and I don\u2019t know what to do. Can you help me think it through?\u201d His voice trembled, and I could see how much he needed me\u2014my support, my attention, my reassurance.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My team and client were counting on my expertise and precision, but my husband needed my empathy and presence. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, caught between the demands of being a good engineer and a supportive wife, unsure which role to answer first."}
