It\u2019s important.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I\u2019d promised to make more time for her, to show her she mattered. Building mutual respect meant being present, including her in my life, and not letting work always come first. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. Tomorrow morning, I had a contested motion in court\u2014a high-stakes hearing that could make or break my client\u2019s case. She was counting on me to be prepared, to fight for her position with every ounce of skill I had. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my sister\u2019s hope for connection, my client\u2019s need for advocacy. I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of family and the cold demands of justice, wishing I could be two people at once."}
