Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling in my chest. I know she worries, especially since Dad\u2019s health has been up and down. I should call, or at least send a longer reply, but I\u2019m at work, and Mrs. Carter, my patient, is gripping my hand. She\u2019s just come out of surgery, her eyes wide and searching. \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer?\u201d she whispers, her voice trembling. I can see the fear in her face, and I know how much it means for her to have someone there. My supervisor expects us to be present, to offer comfort, not just medical care. But my mom\u2019s message sits there, a silent reminder that I\u2019m her son, and she needs to hear from me too. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014between the anxious woman in the hospital bed and the worried voice waiting for me at home."}
