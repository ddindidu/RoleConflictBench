My supervisor had mentioned we could take our breaks flexibly, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. My phone buzzed with a message from my brother: \u201cDinner\u2019s starting soon. Mom\u2019s asking for you.\u201d I could almost hear the clatter of plates and laughter from the kitchen, the warmth of being with my family. As a sister, I knew how much it meant to them for me to be there, especially since we rarely had these dinners together.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my scheduled hours, to be available in case the call volume picked up. I didn\u2019t want to let my team down or risk being seen as unreliable. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the comfort of my family and the responsibility of my job. I stared at the \u201cLog Out\u201d button, my fingers hovering, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
