The store manager\u2019s words echoed in my ears: \u201cHe was caught taking candy from the shelf.\u201d As a parent, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and discipline. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the looming deadline for the judgment I needed to write. The case was complex, and the parties were waiting for my clear, thorough decision.
