She wanted the whole family there, and I could see how much it meant to her. My daughter caught my eye, silently asking if I\u2019d be able to make it. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a client, panic in his voice. The old house I\u2019d been working on had suffered sudden, severe termite damage. He needed me to come immediately, inspect the beams, and draw up a repair plan before the city inspector arrived in the morning. He was counting on me\u2014his family\u2019s safety depended on it.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. My family expected me to be present, to cheer and celebrate. My client expected me to act fast, to use my skills to prevent disaster. I stared at my hands, rough from years of carpentry, and felt my heart twist, torn between the people I love and the work I take pride in."}
