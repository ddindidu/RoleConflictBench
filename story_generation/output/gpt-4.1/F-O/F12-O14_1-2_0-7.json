The memory of the flagged equipment\u2014just a few minor issues, but enough to keep me on edge\u2014lingers as I set my bag down. My husband glances up from the couch, his face tired. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he says, his voice casual but softer than usual. I know he wants me to sit beside him, to listen, to offer the comfort he\u2019s come to expect from me. But my phone vibrates with a reminder: the lab needs my attention, and the audit is less than 24 hours away. If I don\u2019t double-check the equipment tonight, I risk letting my team down and compromising safety. I feel the weight of his unspoken need for support, pressing against the urgency of my professional responsibility. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, torn between being the partner he needs and the scientist my team relies on. I stand in the hallway, caught in the silent battle between love and duty, unsure which way to turn."}
