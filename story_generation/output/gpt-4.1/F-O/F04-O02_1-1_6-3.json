You in?\u201d I could almost hear his hopeful tone, remembering how I\u2019d promised to be more present, to include him in my life the way he always tried to include me. I wanted to say yes, to show him that he mattered, that I respected our bond enough to make time for him.\n\nBut as I glanced at my laptop, the audit checklist glared back at me. The routine safety audit was still weeks away, but I knew the documentation needed careful updates. My team relied on me to ensure everything was perfect\u2014no shortcuts, no missed details. If I let things slide now, it could mean trouble later, not just for me, but for everyone on the project.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides. My brother\u2019s expectation for connection and inclusion clashed with my responsibility to my team and the standards I was sworn to uphold. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, each demanding a different version of me."}
