I know it\u2019s my stepmom\u2014she expects me to check in every day, to tell her how my shift is going, if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m okay. I usually text her back right away, but right now, the line at the register snakes past the candy aisle, and the man in front of me is red-faced, waving a receipt and demanding a refund. I force a smile, trying to remember the script: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Let me see what I can do.\u201d My hands shake as I scan the receipt, my mind split between the angry customer and the unread messages piling up. I can almost hear my stepmom\u2019s voice in my head, worried, maybe hurt, if I don\u2019t reply soon. The customer\u2019s voice rises, and I feel my cheeks burn. I want to be the patient cashier everyone expects, but I also want to be the attentive stepchild my family needs. My phone vibrates again, and I swallow hard, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to answer first."}
