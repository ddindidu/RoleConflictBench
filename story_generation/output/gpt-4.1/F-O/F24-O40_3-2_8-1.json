My boss always reminded me that a cluttered workspace was an accident waiting to happen, and I took pride in keeping things safe and tidy. Just as I was about to put away the last hammer, I glanced out the open door and saw my stepbrother, Jamie, on the sidewalk. He was fiddling with his phone, not paying attention, and started to step off the curb into the street. My heart jumped\u2014cars sped down this road all the time. I knew I should drop everything and call out, maybe even run after him. But the floor was scattered with nails and boards, and if I left it like this, someone could get hurt, maybe even me. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014my duty to keep the site safe, and my promise to always look out for Jamie. My hands shook as I hesitated, caught between the two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
