The store is quiet, and I try to keep my tone warm, remembering the manager\u2019s words about friendly service. But my mind keeps drifting to the bills waiting at home, the empty fridge, and my kids\u2019 hopeful faces when I left this morning. I need this job\u2014every shift, every hour\u2014to keep the lights on and food on the table. As I hand a customer their receipt, my phone buzzes in my pocket. I know it\u2019s from home, maybe my partner asking if I can pick up milk, or maybe it\u2019s the daycare with another unexpected fee. I want to check, to make sure everything is okay, but I can\u2019t break the flow of service. Another customer steps up, and I force another smile, my heart pounding with worry. I feel pulled in two directions: the need to be present and pleasant here, and the desperate urge to be the provider my family needs. The pressure builds as I try to balance both, not sure which role I\u2019m failing more."}
