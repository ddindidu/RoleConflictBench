Did you eat?\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call. We talked every evening, and I could almost hear her voice in my head, warm and insistent. But tonight, I was in the lab, prepping for an experiment I\u2019d been planning for weeks. The equipment was finally available, and my hypothesis was ready to be tested. I could run the experiment another day, but the anticipation and momentum were hard to ignore. My parents valued our daily conversations, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them. Yet, as a scientist, I felt the pull of discovery, the need to seize the moment. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. I stood there, torn, the hum of the lab and the glow of my phone both calling my name."}
