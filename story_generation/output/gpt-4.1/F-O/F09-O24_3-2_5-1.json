The trial tomorrow was complicated, and I needed every minute to prepare. My phone buzzed\u2014an urgent call from the store manager. My heart dropped as I heard my son\u2019s name. He\u2019d been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. I rushed to the store, my mind racing. As a mother, I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline. But as a judge, I knew the importance of fairness, of not letting emotions cloud judgment. My son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears, and the manager looked to me for a response. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down\u2014my child needed my guidance, but my work demanded my focus. The case files waited at home, untouched, and the trial loomed. I stood there, torn, knowing whatever I did next would mean letting down someone who needed me."}
