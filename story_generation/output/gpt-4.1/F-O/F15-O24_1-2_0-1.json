The civil trial starts tomorrow, and the weight of the case presses on my shoulders\u2014so many details, so many lives affected by my judgment. I know I need to give these files my undivided attention, to comb through every argument and precedent, to be the fair and thorough judge the court expects me to be. But my phone buzzes, and I see a message from my daughter: \u201cAre you coming to pick us up? School\u2019s almost over!\u201d My heart twists. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I wouldn\u2019t miss another pickup, that I\u2019d listen to their stories about the day. I can picture them waiting by the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. The expectation to be present, to be the parent they can count on, clashes with the duty to be the judge who never cuts corners. I stare at the files, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
