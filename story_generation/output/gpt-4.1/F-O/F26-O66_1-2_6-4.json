My phone buzzes in the cup holder\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me about the family holiday dinner this weekend. She wants to make sure I\u2019ll be there, that I\u2019ll call tonight to confirm what dish I\u2019m bringing. I know how much these gatherings mean, especially now that the grandkids are old enough to remember who shows up and who doesn\u2019t. But right now, my focus is split. The traffic is unpredictable, cars weaving in and out, brake lights flaring without warning. I have to keep my attention sharp, follow every rule, anticipate every move, or risk an accident. Yet, the guilt gnaws at me\u2014should I pull over and call, reassure my family I haven\u2019t forgotten them? Or do I keep both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, and hope they understand? The rain keeps falling, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I can give at once."}
