As a step-parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability. Groceries, school fees, rent\u2014every expense seemed to grow heavier each month. My partner trusted me to help keep us afloat, and the kids looked to me for reassurance that everything would be okay. \n\nBut as an architect, I craved a space of my own\u2014a small studio where I could sketch and think. I\u2019d started drawing up a simple renovation layout, focusing on basic usability, nothing extravagant. Yet, even the most modest plan would cost money we didn\u2019t really have. My mind raced with calculations: could I justify spending on myself when the family needed every cent? \n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides. I wanted to provide, to be responsible, but I also needed a place to nurture my creativity and career. My pencil hovered over the sketch, my heart torn between duty and desire, unsure which role should take precedence."}
