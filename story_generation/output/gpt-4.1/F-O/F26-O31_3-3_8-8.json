She told me that my grandson was struggling, caught up in something serious, and she needed me to be there for him. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to drop everything, to call, to comfort, to show up and remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But just as I reached for the phone, another message came through\u2014this time from the precinct. I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d been working on for months. My testimony was crucial, and I knew the weight of my words could change someone\u2019s life. The department expected me to act with integrity, to be present, and to uphold the law without fail. My heart ached as I stared at the two messages, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in. I wanted to be the steady hand for my family, but I also knew my duty as an officer couldn\u2019t be ignored. The demands of both roles pressed against me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
