My stepbrother trudged in, his backpack barely hanging on his shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school again. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of expectation: I should be there for him, listen, offer comfort, maybe even distract him with a joke or a snack. But the email from work blinked insistently on my phone. As a subway operator, I was expected to be prompt and professional, to show initiative by signing up for these seminars, and to respond quickly to management. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that opportunities like this could affect my future shifts or promotions. My brother dropped his bag and looked at me, waiting. My phone buzzed again. I stood frozen, torn between the silent plea in his eyes and the professional duty demanding my attention, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
