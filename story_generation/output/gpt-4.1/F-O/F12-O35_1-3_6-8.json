He asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I hesitated, remembering the supervisor\u2019s sudden entrance into my cabin that afternoon. The audit was unannounced, and every move I made was under scrutiny. My mind replayed the tension, the pressure to follow every protocol perfectly, the fear of making a mistake. But at home, I was expected to share, to be open and honest. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to speak. I wanted to tell him everything, to let him in on the stress and anxiety I felt, but I also knew the importance of maintaining professionalism and confidentiality about work procedures. The words caught in my throat, torn between the need to communicate openly as a wife and the duty to uphold my responsibilities as a subway operator. I stared at my plate, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet."}
