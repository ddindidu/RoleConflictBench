It was one of those rare evenings when everyone would be together, and I knew how much it meant to my stepmom that I showed up, participated, and made an effort to bond. \n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my work phone buzzed. The message was short and urgent: \u201cCourt testimony required, 7:30 PM. Your presence is mandatory.\u201d As a police officer, I knew the importance of showing up in court\u2014my testimony could make or break a case. Integrity and fairness were at the core of my job, and skipping out wasn\u2019t an option if I wanted to do right by the badge I wore.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the family that wanted me present and the duty that demanded my honesty and commitment. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my stepmom\u2019s eyes against the trust the justice system placed in me. I sat there, phone in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
