It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling with uncertainty as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d I could hear the weight in her words, the kind of question that deserved my full attention and the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But as I listened, the bell above the door jingled. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids swept in, faces flushed with nerves, glancing at their watches. I caught the anxious eyes of the bride, expecting a warm welcome and reassurance that everything would run smoothly. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one part wanting to offer my granddaughter the thoughtful guidance she needed, the other knowing my clients expected my undivided attention and calm presence. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being the steady hand for my family and the professional comfort for my clients, both needing me in ways that seemed impossible to balance in that moment."}
