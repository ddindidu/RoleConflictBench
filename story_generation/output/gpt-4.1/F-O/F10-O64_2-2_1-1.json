My fingers flew over the keys, scanning groceries, counting change, trying to keep the line moving. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014Mom\u2019s name lit up the screen. It was Sunday, our weekly call, the one time she expected to hear my voice, to know I was okay, to share her stories and worries. I glanced at the clock. If I didn\u2019t answer, she\u2019d worry, maybe think something was wrong. But the customers were restless, shifting from foot to foot, some already sighing loudly. My manager had reminded us just this morning: no distractions, no phones, accuracy above all. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mother\u2019s gentle expectation for connection, the store\u2019s demand for flawless, undivided attention. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the two roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
