They needed me\u2014really needed me. The words on the screen were heavy with pain, and I could almost hear their voice trembling. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold them, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But just as I started to type a reply, the call light blinked for Mr. Harris in room 204. He\u2019d just had surgery, and I knew he couldn\u2019t get out of bed without help. He depended on me to help him dress, to move safely, to keep his dignity intact. My supervisor expected me to be attentive, gentle, and quick. My partner expected me to be present, loving, and supportive. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart aching for home while my hands were needed here. I stared at my phone, then at the hallway, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
