They needed me\u2014needed my advice, my comfort, my undivided attention. I reached out, wanting to be present, to reassure them that I was here, that I cared. But just as I opened my mouth to speak, my radio crackled to life. Dispatch was calling: a patient with a broken leg, nothing life-threatening, but I was the closest ambulance. I glanced at my partner, then at my keys. The city traffic would be a nightmare, and I\u2019d have to focus, drive carefully, keep everyone safe. My partner\u2019s eyes pleaded for me to stay, to listen, to help them through their crisis. My heart twisted, torn between the person I loved and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold. I stood there, caught in the space between two worlds, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
