She and Dad were sitting together, her hands twisting a tissue, his eyes fixed on the carpet. \u201cWe\u2019re just\u2026 feeling lost lately,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see how much they needed me to sit with them, to listen, to offer the comfort they rarely asked for. But as I glanced around, I noticed the dust gathering on the shelves, the crumbs under the table, the streaks on the windows\u2014reminders of the standards I was expected to uphold as the housekeeper. My supervisor had already mentioned the importance of keeping everything spotless, and I knew I was falling behind. My parents\u2019 eyes pleaded for my attention, but the mess around us seemed to grow heavier by the minute. I felt torn, my heart aching to be the supportive son they needed, while my mind raced with the pressure to keep the house immaculate. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the urge to comfort and the duty to clean."}
