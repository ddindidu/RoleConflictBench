Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, expecting me to show up, laugh at Dad\u2019s jokes, and help set the table. But at the same time, my work phone vibrated with a different urgency. The maintenance log showed three machines running hotter than they should, all overdue for cleaning. If I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we risked a breakdown, and I knew how much the team depended on me to keep things running smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of home and the cold, humming machines at work. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family wanting me present, my job needing me responsible. I sat in my car, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the silent, mechanical demands of my job, unsure which direction to turn."}
