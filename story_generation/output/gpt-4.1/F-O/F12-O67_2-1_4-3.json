My husband had gently reminded me this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for their school trip tomorrow, and I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done before my shift. As I loaded the washing machine, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my supervisor. \u201cCan you check the first-aid kit before your shift? We\u2019re short-staffed, and it\u2019s urgent.\u201d I glanced at the clock, calculating how long the laundry would take, and how much time I\u2019d need at the station. My heart pounded with the weight of both expectations: my family counting on me for the little things that keep our home running, and my team relying on me to ensure we\u2019re ready for emergencies. I felt torn, knowing that if I left now, the laundry wouldn\u2019t get done, but if I stayed, I\u2019d risk letting my colleagues down. The pressure built inside me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with which part of myself I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
