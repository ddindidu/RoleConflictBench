She\u2019s been looking forward to this for weeks.\u201d My family expects me to be there, to laugh and share stories, to be present for the holiday dinner that means so much to all of us. But as the subway rumbled on, the intercom crackled. A passenger\u2019s voice, uncertain and anxious, asked for directions to the hospital\u2014routine, but important. My job is to keep everyone safe, to answer questions, to be attentive and calm. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s warmth and expectations tugged at me, while the responsibility of hundreds of passengers demanded my focus. My heart pounded as I stared at the intercom, torn between the comfort of home and the duty of my uniform, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
