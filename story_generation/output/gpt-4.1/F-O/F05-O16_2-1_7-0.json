I knew I should ask her what was wrong, open up the conversation like we promised we would. But my mind kept drifting back to the clinic, to the patient I\u2019d seen just an hour ago. She\u2019d come in for a routine check-up, complaining of a sore throat and a runny nose\u2014classic cold symptoms, nothing alarming. But something about her fatigue and the way she described her headaches nagged at me. I kept replaying the visit in my head, wondering if I\u2019d missed something more serious.\n\nMy wife sighed, and I caught the flicker of disappointment on her face. She needed me to be present, to listen, to share my own worries. But the weight of my responsibility as a doctor pressed down on me. What if I\u2019d overlooked a crucial symptom? What if my patient\u2019s health was at risk because I was distracted? I wanted to be the attentive husband she deserved, but the demands of my profession tugged at me relentlessly. I sat there, torn, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
