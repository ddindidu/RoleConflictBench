It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my client valued thoroughness and expected me to review every detail. As I scrolled through the clauses, my phone buzzed with a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan we talk? I think we misunderstood each other earlier.\u201d My heart tightened. We\u2019d argued that morning, and I knew she wanted to clear the air. As her sister, I wanted to be there, to listen and rebuild the trust between us. But as a lawyer, I felt the weight of my professional responsibility, the expectation to be diligent and timely, even if the deadline wasn\u2019t pressing. I stared at the screen, torn between the need to be present for my sister and the pull of my work. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being stretched too thin, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
