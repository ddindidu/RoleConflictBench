My phone buzzes with another message from QA\u2014users are getting kicked out of the app, and the product manager wants a fix by tonight. I rub my temples, feeling the pressure mount. Then, from the hallway, I hear my stepson\u2019s excited voice, reminding me, \u201cYou promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo today, remember?\u201d His eyes are bright, full of trust. I know how much this means to him, how hard I\u2019ve worked to make him feel secure and cared for. But the bank account is tight, and the bugs won\u2019t fix themselves. My partner expects me to keep my word, to be present and reliable, but my team is counting on me too. I feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give. My heart aches as I realize I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I\u2019m left frozen, caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my job."}
