They were laughing, daring each other to dive despite the bold red \"NO DIVING\" signs. My heart tightened\u2014she knew better, but I could see the strain on her face, the way she clung to her friends for support. Just this morning, she\u2019d confided in me about feeling left out, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to have her back no matter what.
