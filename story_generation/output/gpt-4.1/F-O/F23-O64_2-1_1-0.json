The store is quiet, just a few customers in line, but my mind is racing. Today is the open class at Lily\u2019s school\u2014the first one since I became her step-parent. She asked me to come, her eyes hopeful, and I promised I\u2019d try. But my manager made it clear: no one leaves early unless it\u2019s an emergency. I know how important it is to process every transaction carefully, to avoid mistakes that could cost the store money or upset a customer. Still, I can\u2019t shake the image of Lily searching the classroom for my face, waiting for me to show up. My heart aches with the weight of both roles\u2014wanting to be the parent she needs, but also the reliable cashier my job demands. The next customer steps forward, and I force a smile, my mind torn between the beeping scanner and the clock ticking down to the start of Lily\u2019s open class."}
