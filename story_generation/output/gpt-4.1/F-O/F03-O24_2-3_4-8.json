My family has always prided itself on tradition\u2014Sunday dinners, the same prayers, the same stories passed down for generations. Just last night, my father reminded me, \u201cWe are who we are because we honor our past.\u201d But now, in the middle of delivering jury instructions, my clerk slips me a note: the Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I\u2019m relying on. The law has changed, and as a judge, I am expected to adapt instantly, to set aside what was and embrace what is. My heart pounds. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, \u201cNever forget where you come from.\u201d Yet, the courtroom expects me to lead with the law, not with nostalgia. I feel torn\u2014between the unyielding pull of my family\u2019s values and the immediate, unrelenting demand of my judicial oath. The room is silent, waiting for my next words, while inside, I am wrestling with which part of myself I must betray."}
