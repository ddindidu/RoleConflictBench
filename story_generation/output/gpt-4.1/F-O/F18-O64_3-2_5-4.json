Everyone\u2019s counting on you!\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and missing one was unthinkable. But as I slipped my phone back into my apron pocket, the bell above the store door jingled. A woman approached the counter, holding a blender. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she said, her voice tense. I asked for her receipt, but she shook her head. \u201cI lost it, but I just bought it last week.\u201d My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo receipt, no return. No exceptions.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my family expecting me to be present and helpful, my job demanding I enforce the rules. My hands trembled as I weighed the disappointment I\u2019d cause at home against the consequences of bending store policy.
