My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to lead the family ceremony this year, to honor our ancestors and show respect for our traditions. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting me to recite the prayers perfectly, to guide the rituals just as my grandfather once did. My heart pounded, not just from the pressure of the ceremony, but from the memory of my shift at the store earlier that day.\n\nAs a cashier, I was supposed to follow every policy to the letter. When I noticed a small discrepancy in the register, I hesitated. It was minor, barely noticeable, and didn\u2019t affect the total sales. But the rules were clear: report every error, no matter how small. I could still feel the weight of that decision pressing on me as I stood before my family, torn between upholding our traditions and maintaining my integrity at work. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, leaving me caught in the middle, unsure which role I was supposed to honor first."}
