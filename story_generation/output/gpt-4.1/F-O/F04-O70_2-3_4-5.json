Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d As the eldest brother, I knew how much these gatherings meant, especially to her. But just as I was about to leave, my work phone vibrated. Dispatch had assigned me a last-minute delivery\u2014a high-value package that had to be handed directly to the recipient, with ID verification. No exceptions. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cThis is important. Don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d\n\nI stared at my uniforms\u2014one for work, one for home\u2014hanging side by side. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations. If I missed dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even hurt Mom\u2019s feelings. But if I skipped the delivery, I\u2019d risk my job and let my team down. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being the reliable brother and the responsible delivery person."}
