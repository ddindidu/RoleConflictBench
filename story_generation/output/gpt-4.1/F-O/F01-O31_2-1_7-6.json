My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to talk, to share her first day\u2019s stories, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened. I promised her I\u2019d always be there, always interested, always present. But just then, I spotted a car parked in a no-parking zone. The driver was a young man, nervously glancing at his watch, clearly in a hurry. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to treat everyone fairly, and not let personal feelings cloud my judgment. Yet, I knew that sometimes discretion was allowed, especially if the situation called for understanding. My radio crackled, my phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one of duty, one of love\u2014pressing down on me. I stared at the ticket book in my hand, torn between answering my granddaughter\u2019s call and upholding the law, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
