My husband\u2019s voice trembled from the living room as he recounted the latest blow in his ongoing crisis. He needed me\u2014my full attention, my comfort, my words to steady him. I wanted to be there, to hold his hand, to listen without distraction. But the clock on the wall ticked louder with every passing minute, reminding me of the departmental meeting looming ahead. My team expected a clear, accurate summary of our preliminary findings, and I hadn\u2019t finished compiling the data. The pressure to deliver was immense; my reputation as a scientist depended on it. Yet, every time I tried to focus, guilt gnawed at me. How could I turn away from the person I loved when he was at his lowest? My heart pulled in one direction, my mind in another, and I felt myself stretched thin, caught between the demands of my marriage and my career, unsure which part of myself to let down."}
