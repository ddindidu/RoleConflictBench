It was Mom, her voice trembling as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the grown-up child she could lean on. My heart twisted\u2014I wanted to be there, to say the right words, to hold her hand through the phone. But just then, the foreman shouted my name. The crane was swinging a steel beam overhead, and I was needed on the ground, hands steady, eyes sharp, guiding the load before it could be bolted in place. My coworkers depended on me; a single mistake could mean disaster. I could hear Mom\u2019s quiet sobs, but the clang of metal and the urgency in my boss\u2019s voice pulled me in the opposite direction. I stood frozen, the phone pressed to my ear, the weight of two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
