The weather outside was perfect\u2014clear, dry, the exact conditions I needed to collect the data that could make or break my research funding. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cAtmospheric window open\u2014experiment now or wait a year.\u201d At that moment, my stepson darted away, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt every eye on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and self-control. But my mind was split\u2014if I left now, I could set up the equipment in time, maybe secure my career. If I stayed, I could guide him, show him the boundaries he needed. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
