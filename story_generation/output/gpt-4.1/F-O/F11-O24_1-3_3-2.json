My younger brother nudged me, asking if I\u2019d rather go hiking or try that new restaurant. I smiled, feeling the warmth of being included, and tried to focus on the conversation. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the court clerk. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. I was expected to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My heart pounded. As a judge, I knew the gravity of such cases; someone\u2019s safety could depend on my careful, immediate attention. But as a sister, I saw the hopeful faces around me, waiting for my input, wanting me to be present. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
