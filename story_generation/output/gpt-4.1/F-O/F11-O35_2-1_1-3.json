I pressed the button to respond, but my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a message from my younger brother. \u201cCan you call me? I really need you right now.\u201d My heart clenched. He never asked for help unless it was serious. As his sister, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to support him when he was struggling. But as the subway operator, I was responsible for hundreds of passengers, expected to answer questions, keep everyone safe, and never let my attention waver. The intercom light blinked insistently, the passenger waiting. My brother\u2019s message glowed on my screen. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. My hand hovered between the intercom and my phone, my mind racing, caught between duty and family, not knowing which voice to answer first."}
