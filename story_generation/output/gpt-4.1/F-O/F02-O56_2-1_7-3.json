As a father, I felt the weight of every bill pressing down on me, reminding me that I needed every tip, every satisfied client, to keep my family afloat. My next client, Mrs. Lee, slid into the chair with her usual warm smile. She was a regular, always easy to please, but today she hesitated, running her fingers through her fringe. \u201cCould you just trim it a bit more?\u201d she asked softly.\n\nI knew her appointment was nearly over, and another client was already waiting. If I took extra time, I\u2019d run late, possibly lose a walk-in, and with it, the money my family needed. But as a hairdresser, I was expected to make sure every client left happy, no matter how small the request. My hands hovered over the scissors, my mind torn between the need to rush for my family\u2019s sake and the duty to give Mrs. Lee the attention she deserved. The pressure built in my chest, and I found myself frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me, but in different ways."}
