Dad barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. But as I sat with them, my mind kept drifting back to the code I\u2019d left unfinished at work. The module was a mess, and though the deadline was generous, I wanted to refactor it now, while the logic was still fresh in my mind. My team expected clean, maintainable code, and I prided myself on delivering just that. Yet, here I was, torn between the urge to open my laptop and the guilt of not being fully present for my parents. Their unspoken need for comfort pressed against the silent demand of my professional standards, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to give either the attention they deserved."}
