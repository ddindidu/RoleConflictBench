The family gathering was circled in bright red, a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They\u2019d been talking about it for days\u2014how Grandma would bake her famous cookies, how we\u2019d play board games and laugh together. But my phone buzzed again, another urgent message from my project manager. The build was stalled, and the team couldn\u2019t move forward until I finished the core module. I could almost hear the frustration in their voices, the weight of the deadline pressing on all of us. I felt the pressure of being the reliable engineer, the one everyone counted on to solve the toughest problems. Yet, the thought of disappointing my family, of missing those precious moments with my grandchildren, made my chest ache. I sat at my desk, torn between the expectations of my work and the love of my family, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
