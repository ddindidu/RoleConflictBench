It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart squeezed. My grandson had been sick all week, and now things sounded worse. I knew they needed me\u2014my daughter always said my presence calmed the kids, and I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold my grandson\u2019s hand and reassure my daughter.\n\nBut as I looked around the apartment, I saw the mess left behind by the tenants. Crumbs on the counter, muddy footprints in the hall, and a bathroom that needed more than a quick wipe.
