It was my granddaughter, texting about her first day at her new job. She\u2019d been so excited, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to listen and share in her joy. The radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling me to a minor accident across town. The city traffic was thick, horns blaring, drivers impatient. I gripped the wheel, feeling the weight of my uniform and the responsibility it carried. My mind kept drifting to my granddaughter, picturing her waiting for my reply, maybe feeling let down if I didn\u2019t respond soon. But I knew the rules: no distractions, safety first. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my attention, and toward the patient, who depended on my focus. The phone buzzed again, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the expectations of being a caring grandparent and a responsible ambulance driver."}
