I knew I should be more present, ask questions, show I cared. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or distracted we felt. But my mind kept drifting back to the salon, to the last client of the day. Her hair was a mess of product buildup, so tangled I could barely get my fingers through it. I\u2019d have to wash and condition it thoroughly before I could even think about cutting, but she was already running late and seemed impatient. I felt the pressure to keep the schedule moving, to not fall behind for the next client. Now, at home, I was supposed to be attentive, supportive, but all I could think about was the knot of hair and the knot in my stomach. My partner\u2019s voice faded into the background as I wrestled with the demands of both worlds, unsure which one needed me more in this moment."}
