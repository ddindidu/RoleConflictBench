Pre-dawn traffic was light, a rare lull in the usual chaos. My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can we talk about the holiday plans? The kids want to know if you\u2019ll be there.\u201d I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s hopeful voice, and a pang of guilt twisted in my chest. Family holidays were sacred\u2014my late wife always insisted we gather, no matter what. But as an air traffic controller, I knew the calm wouldn\u2019t last.
