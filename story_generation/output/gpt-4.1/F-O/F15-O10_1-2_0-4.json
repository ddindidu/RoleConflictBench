They\u2019ve been looking forward to it all week, and I can already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. But my computer screen is filled with spreadsheets and tax forms. The quarterly tax filing deadline is looming, and I\u2019m behind. The company depends on me to ensure everything is accurate and compliant; a single mistake could mean penalties or worse. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d My heart tightens. I want to be the parent who shows up, who keeps promises. But I\u2019m also the accountant who can\u2019t let the company down. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stare at the clock, torn, feeling the minutes slip away as I wrestle with what to do next."}
