My father, usually so quick with a joke, had been silent all evening. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer the comfort of presence. But as I reached for my phone to check in on them, my eyes caught the thick manila envelope on my desk. The case file for the upcoming hearing had arrived, and though it was supposed to be routine, I knew the expectation: every detail must be reviewed, every precedent considered. My chambers demanded my focus, my diligence. Yet, my heart tugged me toward my parents, who needed their child, not a judge, tonight. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, my care, my undivided self. I sat at my desk, torn, the silence of the room amplifying the noise inside my head."}
