My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, \u201cCan we talk now? It\u2019s important.\u201d I knew what he meant\u2014our finances had been tight, and he wanted to go over the numbers together, to make sure we were both on the same page. He expected honesty, openness, and my full attention. But my mind was tangled in lines of code. Just an hour ago, my manager had pinged me: the new service I\u2019d written was causing slowdowns, and the team was waiting for me to fix it. The pressure was immense; I was expected to deliver clean, efficient code, and any mistake could ripple through the whole system. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My husband\u2019s trust depended on my transparency, but my team\u2019s trust depended on my technical competence. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the pull of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they deserved."}
