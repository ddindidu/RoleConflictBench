The store manager\u2019s stern gaze was fixed on us, and I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and firmness. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the merger contract I\u2019d been reviewing was due in less than an hour. If I didn\u2019t catch the risky clauses, my client could face devastating losses.\n\nMy stepson\u2019s eyes brimmed with fear and confusion, and I wanted to kneel down, talk him through the mistake, and help him understand the importance of honesty. But the legal documents waited, and my client\u2019s trust\u2014and livelihood\u2014rested on my diligence. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions: the urgent need to be present for my family, and the professional duty that demanded my immediate attention. The store manager cleared his throat, my phone buzzed again, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the parent my stepson needed and the lawyer my client depended on."}
