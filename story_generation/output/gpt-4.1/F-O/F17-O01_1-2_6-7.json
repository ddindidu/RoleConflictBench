The project was behind schedule, and I needed to clarify details before the end of the day. My mind raced with deadlines and the pressure to keep everything moving smoothly. Just then, my mom called. Her voice was softer than usual, and I could hear the heaviness in her words. I knew she needed me to ask, to check in, to be the attentive child who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home. But as she spoke, my laptop pinged with urgent questions from the site. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my parents needing my emotional presence, my team needing my professional focus. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to listen to my mom, while my mind kept drifting to the construction site, torn between being the supportive child and the responsible architect."}
