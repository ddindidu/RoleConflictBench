It\u2019s my stepdad, asking if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m sleeping enough, if I can call him and Mom tonight. I know they expect me to check in every day, to share how things are going, to reassure them that I\u2019m okay. But my laptop screen is filled with Slack messages and urgent emails\u2014product managers, architects, and designers all waiting for my input. The launch date was just moved up, and now everyone\u2019s blocked until I make some decisions about the new features. I can feel the pressure from both sides: my family wanting connection, my team needing answers. My heart pounds as I stare at the unread messages, torn between the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices and the responsibility of unblocking my colleagues. I want to be present for both, but right now, it feels impossible."}
