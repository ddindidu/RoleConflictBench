The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014groceries, rent, the kids\u2019 school fees. I knew I had to find a way to bring in more money, maybe by taking on extra shifts or overtime at the plant. My family depended on me to keep us afloat, and I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nBut at work, as an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every safety protocol was up to date. The next audit was months away, and my manager hinted that I could relax on the paperwork for now, maybe focus on production instead. Still, I knew that cutting corners, even temporarily, could risk compliance and safety. My professional integrity was on the line, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the standards I was trained to uphold.\n\nCaught between the urgent needs of my family and the ethical demands of my job, I felt torn. The pressure built inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
