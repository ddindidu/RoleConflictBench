My husband\u2019s meeting is early tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform is somewhere in that pile, stained from last week\u2019s game. I promised I\u2019d have everything ready, and I know how much it means to them to have clean clothes for their busy days.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a reminder: the lab safety audit is in two hours. I\u2019m the lead scientist, and last week\u2019s inspection already flagged a few minor issues with the centrifuge and the chemical storage. If I don\u2019t address them now, it could mean a failed audit, or worse, a safety risk for my team. My supervisor expects everything to be perfect, and I take pride in running a safe, efficient lab.\n\nI stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, laundry basket in the other, my mind racing. Both worlds are pulling at me, each with its own urgent demands, and I feel the weight of letting someone down no matter which way I turn."}
