Today was the last day of the holiday, and my family expected me to join them for the morning prayer\u2014a tradition I\u2019d never missed. But as a nursing assistant, my shift started at dawn, and I was already in the hospital, clipboard in hand, moving from room to room. My supervisor reminded me that Mrs. Lee\u2019s vitals needed to be taken precisely at 7:00 a.m. for her new medication schedule. My phone buzzed with a message from my father: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re waiting for you to light the incense.\u201d I could almost hear the disappointment in his voice if I didn\u2019t show up. I stood in the hallway, torn between the sterile beeping of monitors and the warmth of my family\u2019s voices echoing in my memory, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
