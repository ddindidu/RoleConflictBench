The invite said \u201coptional,\u201d but I knew how much my input mattered\u2014my team always expected me to help shape new features, and I prided myself on being a collaborative developer. Just as I was jotting down some ideas, my granddaughter, Emma, came in, her face clouded with worry. She hesitated, then asked if we could talk. She needed advice about a friendship that was falling apart, and I could see how much she was struggling. My heart ached to be the grandmother she needed, to offer the wisdom and comfort only I could give. But the session was scheduled for the same time, and I knew missing it might mean letting my team down. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something only I could provide."}
