He flashed me a grin, announcing he was about to try a trick he\u2019d only watched online. My stomach twisted. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But my phone buzzed\u2014a customer was calling back, and I was expected to answer, to handle any objections smoothly, just like the script said. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that every call mattered, that I couldn\u2019t let personal distractions interfere. Jamie was already climbing the ramp, helmet askew, and I could see the uneven cracks in the concrete. My heart pounded as I weighed the headset in my hand, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility I felt for Jamie\u2019s safety. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding my full attention."}
