As a father, I felt the weight of every dollar owed, every meal that needed to be put on the table. My wife glanced at me, her eyes quietly asking if we\u2019d be alright this month. I nodded, but inside, anxiety gnawed at me. I knew I needed to step up, maybe take on more work, push for that promotion, or at least make sure my current projects ran smoothly.\n\nBut as an architect, I\u2019d always prided myself on a relaxed, creative approach. I liked to let ideas simmer, to check in on my team without breathing down their necks. My boss, though, had started hinting that I needed to tighten up, manage more aggressively, deliver results faster. If I shifted gears, I could impress him, maybe earn that raise. But it would mean longer hours, less time at home, and more stress.\n\nI stared at the project timelines on my laptop, then at the family photos on the fridge. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which role needed me more."}
