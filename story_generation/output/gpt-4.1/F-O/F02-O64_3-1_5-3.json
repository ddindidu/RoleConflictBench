He looked up at me, eyes wide, and I felt a familiar warmth\u2014until I noticed a crumpled candy wrapper peeking from his pocket. My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing, no matter how small, was unacceptable. But as the cashier, I was expected to report any theft, even if it was my own child. Store policy was clear: every incident must be logged, no exceptions.\n\nAt that moment, my manager called me over to discuss a minor discrepancy in the register. It was barely noticeable, and I could have easily brushed it off, but the rules said I had to account for every cent. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my son\u2019s anxious face, the store\u2019s unwavering policies. I wanted to protect him, to guide him gently, but I also had a responsibility to my job. My mind raced, torn between being a good father and a dutiful employee, unsure which path to take."}
