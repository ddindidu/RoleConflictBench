The client wanted it by the end of the week, and I still needed to estimate the wood and hardware, then call the supplier before they closed. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build in my chest. That\u2019s when my sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She never called during work hours unless it was serious. I answered, and her shaky voice told me everything\u2014she\u2019d had a rough day, and she needed someone to talk to, maybe even come over. I could hear the expectation in her voice, the silent plea for support, the way we\u2019d always been there for each other. But the order was urgent, and if I didn\u2019t get the materials sorted today, I\u2019d miss the deadline and disappoint a client who\u2019d already paid a deposit. My mind raced, torn between the sister who needed me and the carpenter who had a job to do. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
