My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t leave until your area\u2019s spotless. Safety first, always.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just a few more minutes and I\u2019d be done. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my stepbrother, waiting for me across the street, waving impatiently. He hated when I was late, but I had to finish my shift properly.\n\nSuddenly, I saw him step off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart lurched. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe\u2014Mom\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cHe looks up to you. Take care of him.\u201d But if I left my post now, the site wouldn\u2019t be secure, and I\u2019d be letting my crew down, maybe even risking someone\u2019s safety tomorrow. My broom paused mid-sweep, torn between the two worlds, both demanding my attention, both unwilling to wait."}
