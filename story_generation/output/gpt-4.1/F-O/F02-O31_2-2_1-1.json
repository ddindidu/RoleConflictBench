Today was her open class\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised I would. But the radio crackled, dispatch calling all available units to the city square. A protest was turning ugly, and as a senior officer, I was expected to be there, to help keep the peace, to lead by example. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cOpen class, 2:00 PM.\u201d My heart twisted. I could picture her scanning the crowd, searching for my face, hoping I\u2019d kept my word. At the same time, I knew my team would be looking for me too, counting on my presence if things got out of hand. The weight of both uniforms\u2014father and officer\u2014pressed down on me, each demanding I stand with them. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the promise I made to my little girl and the duty I swore to uphold."}
