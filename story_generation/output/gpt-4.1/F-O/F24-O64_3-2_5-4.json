My stepmom\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIt would mean a lot if you were there. We\u2019re all counting on you.\u201d I knew how important it was to show up, to be part of the family, especially since I was still trying to fit in. But as I slipped on my work vest and clocked in at the store, my manager reminded me, \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed today. We need you here the whole shift.\u201d\n\nMidway through my shift, a woman approached my register, frustration written all over her face. She wanted to return a blender, but she didn\u2019t have a receipt. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. She pleaded, saying it was a gift and she needed the money for her own family\u2019s holiday. My heart twisted. I wanted to help, but I also knew I could get in trouble for breaking the rules.\n\nI glanced at the clock, knowing my shift would run late, making it impossible to get to the family dinner on time. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable step-sibling my family wanted and the responsible cashier my job demanded."}
