I glanced at the screen\u2014three unread messages from my stepmom, each more insistent than the last. She expected daily updates, little check-ins about my day, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But Mrs. Lee was peering into the mirror, hesitating. \u201cCould you just snip a bit more off the fringe?\u201d she asked, her tone gentle but hopeful. I could see she wanted to feel heard and cared for, and as her hairdresser, it was my job to make sure she left happy. My stepmom\u2019s texts weighed on me, a silent demand for attention, while Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectant eyes pulled me in the opposite direction. I felt my heart race, torn between the urge to reassure my family and the responsibility to my client. The scissors felt heavy in my hand as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
