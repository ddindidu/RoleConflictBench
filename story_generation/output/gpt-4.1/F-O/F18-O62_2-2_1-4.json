He sounded off, his voice shaky, and I could tell something was wrong. When I got home, he was slumped on the couch, eyes red, backpack tossed aside. I knew I should sit with him, listen, and help him through whatever happened at school. That\u2019s what siblings do\u2014we\u2019re supposed to be there for each other, especially when things get rough.\n\nBut as I dropped my bag, my phone buzzed with a message from my supervisor: \u201cBroken lane rope needs fixing ASAP. Swim lessons start in 30 minutes.\u201d I remembered seeing the frayed rope earlier and thinking I\u2019d get to it later. Now, if I didn\u2019t go back and fix it, the lessons would be a mess, and I\u2019d be letting down the team. My brother looked up at me, eyes pleading for comfort, while my mind raced with the responsibility waiting at the pool. I stood frozen, torn between being the sibling he needed and the lifeguard everyone depended on."}
