We\u2019d agreed to talk about our finances\u2014something we\u2019d both been putting off, but now it couldn\u2019t wait. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for honesty, for the kind of open communication we promised each other when we got married. I could feel the weight of their expectation, the need to be fully present, to listen and share everything.\n\nBut as they spoke, my gaze kept flicking to the water. I was on duty, and the pool was busy. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to focus, to be ready to act in an instant. I felt my partner\u2019s hand squeeze mine, urging me to respond, to be here, now, with them. But my mind was split\u2014torn between the promise I made as a spouse to be open and attentive, and the responsibility I carried as a lifeguard to keep every swimmer safe. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my full self to either role in this moment."}
