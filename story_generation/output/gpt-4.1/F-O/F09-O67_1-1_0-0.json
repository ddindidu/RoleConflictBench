I could already picture their faces scanning the crowd, searching for me, hoping I wouldn\u2019t be late again. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. \n\nBut I was still at the ambulance station, uniform crisp, radio clipped to my shoulder. Any second, a call could come in\u2014a heart attack, a car crash, someone\u2019s life hanging in the balance. My supervisor expected me to be ready, to respond without hesitation. The city depended on me, and I took pride in that responsibility.\n\nI stared at the keys in my hand, torn between the two worlds. My children needed their mother; my community needed their ambulance driver. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I could feel my heart racing as I waited, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
