Come watch?\u201d I glanced at the patient\u2019s door\u2014Mrs. Lee was waiting for her morning vitals, and I knew how anxious she got if I was late. But the image of my stepbrother, helmet askew, standing at the top of that cracked, steep ramp flashed in my mind. He\u2019d promised to be careful, but I\u2019d seen him fall before.
