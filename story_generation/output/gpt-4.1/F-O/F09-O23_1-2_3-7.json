My phone buzzed with a message from the office: the new assistant needed access to the Thompson files, and she was waiting for my approval. I knew those files contained confidential details, and as a lawyer, I was bound by strict ethical codes. But the assistant was overwhelmed, and granting her access would make her job easier and help the team. My son dropped his spoon, milk splashing onto the floor. I took a deep breath, torn between teaching him patience and discipline, and the pressing demand to respond to my colleague. Both roles demanded my full attention\u2014one to nurture and guide, the other to protect and uphold trust. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
