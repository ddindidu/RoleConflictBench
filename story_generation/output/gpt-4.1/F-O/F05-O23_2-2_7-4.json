My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation; the motion was complicated, and I knew I had to be at my sharpest. But across from me, my wife stirred her tea, her eyes distant and troubled. I\u2019d noticed her silence all evening, the way she kept glancing at her phone and sighing. I knew I should ask her what was wrong, listen, and be present\u2014she always said how much it meant when we talked things through. But every minute I spent away from my work felt like a risk to my client, who trusted me to fight for them. My mind raced between the courtroom and my kitchen, between the duty to my client and the promise I\u2019d made to my wife to always be there for her. I wanted to close my laptop and reach for her hand, but the weight of my client\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me, unsure which one to let down."}
