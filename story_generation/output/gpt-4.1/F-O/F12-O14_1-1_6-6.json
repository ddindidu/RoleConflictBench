He asks about my day, his eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I know he wants me to open up, to share the small frustrations and victories, to let him in. But my mind is tangled with thoughts of the lab\u2014tomorrow is the equipment maintenance check, and though everything seems fine, I can\u2019t shake the anxiety that I might miss something critical. The safety of my team depends on my vigilance, and the checklist is looming over me like a shadow. I want to reassure him, to be present, to communicate honestly as a good wife should. But every time I try to form words, my thoughts drift back to the lab, to the protocols, to the what-ifs. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I\u2019m caught in the space between, unsure which part of myself to give."}
