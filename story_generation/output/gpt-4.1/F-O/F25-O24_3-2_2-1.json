The case is complex, and as a judge, I know I must review every detail, anticipate arguments, and ensure I am prepared to preside fairly. My phone buzzes for the third time in ten minutes. It\u2019s my stepmother, sending another message in our family group chat. She expects me to reply, to share how my day is going, to keep up the daily rhythm of communication that reassures her I\u2019m still part of the family. I glance at the unread messages piling up, feeling the weight of her expectations. I know she worries when I go silent, and I don\u2019t want to disappoint her or my father. But the briefs in front of me are urgent, and the responsibility of the courtroom looms large. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the family that wants my presence, and the profession that demands my focus. I stare at my phone, torn, the pressure building as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
