But as I moved through the hallway, my cleaning cart rattled, and I noticed the shelves in the supply closet were nearly bare. The disinfectant was almost gone, and we were out of sponges. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cInventory must be checked and restocked before the weekend. No exceptions.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My daughter had called just this morning, \u201cMom, the kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d Yet, if I left the supplies unchecked, I risked disappointing my boss and letting down the team.
