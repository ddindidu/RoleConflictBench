But the price tag gnawed at me\u2014money was tight, and I needed to make sure we had enough for groceries and bills. As I mulled over the numbers in my head, a coworker rushed in, breathless. \u201cThe lane rope snapped again. Swim lessons start in twenty minutes. If we don\u2019t fix it, we\u2019ll have to cancel.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything running smoothly, to make sure the kids in the water were safe and the lessons could go on. But the replacement rope wasn\u2019t cheap, and the budget for pool maintenance was already stretched thin. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my son\u2019s happiness and our family\u2019s stability on one side, my responsibility to the swimmers and my job on the other. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between what I owed my child and what I owed my team."}
