He had his final exam in a few hours, and I knew how much pressure he was under. As his step-sibling, I felt I should be there for him, maybe sit with him for a while, offer some encouragement, or just listen if he needed to vent. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was due at the construction site in twenty minutes. As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late, especially today. We were starting structural work, and it was my responsibility to inspect and maintain all the tools before anyone else arrived. Skipping the safety check wasn\u2019t an option\u2014one missed detail could mean someone gets hurt. I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to knock on his door and the weight of my professional duty. My heart pounded with the pressure of both roles, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
