The expectation was clear: I had to draft a precise, thorough release order\u2014no room for error or delay. My mind was already sorting through the legal language when my phone buzzed. It was a text from my younger brother, who was waiting for me outside the courthouse. I glanced out the window and saw him, headphones in, stepping off the curb, oblivious to the rush of traffic. As his sibling, I was supposed to protect him, to make sure he was safe. But as a judge, I was expected to remain at my desk, focused, impartial, and prompt. My heart pounded as I watched him, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to the law. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention, each impossible to ignore."}
