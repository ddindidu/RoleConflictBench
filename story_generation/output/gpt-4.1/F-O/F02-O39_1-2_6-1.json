My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I know it\u2019s a message from home\u2014my son, reminding me about the Nintendo I promised him for his birthday. He\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he mentions it. I want to give him that joy, to keep my promise, to be the father who provides not just food and shelter, but happiness too.\n\nBut the foreman\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, sharp and impatient. \u201cHurry up! The carpenter\u2019s waiting!\u201d I see the carpenter tapping his foot, tools in hand, glancing my way. If I slow down, the whole crew falls behind, and I can\u2019t afford to lose this job. My hands ache, my back is sore, and I wonder if the overtime I\u2019m working will be enough to cover the bills and still buy that Nintendo. The weight of the lumber feels lighter than the weight in my chest as I stand there, torn between the expectations of my son and the demands of my job, not sure which way to turn."}
