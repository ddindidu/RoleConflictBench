Just an hour ago, I had caught my son slipping a candy bar into his pocket at the grocery store. The look in his eyes\u2014guilt, fear, and a silent plea for understanding\u2014haunted me. As his mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with firm but loving discipline. But now, as a pharmacist, I was staring at a chemotherapy prescription, double-checking every calculation, every label. The weight of responsibility pressed on me; a single mistake could endanger a life. My phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cHe\u2019s crying. What should I do?\u201d My heart ached to rush home, to comfort and correct my son, but my mind screamed that I couldn\u2019t afford a single distraction here. Both roles demanded my full attention, both needed me to be perfect, and I felt myself pulled apart, unable to give either the care they deserved."}
