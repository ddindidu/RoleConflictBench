He\u2019d been upset with me lately, saying I never listened, that I always cut our conversations short. I knew he wanted me to be patient, to understand his point of view, especially now that he was struggling with his new job. But as I glanced at the blueprints spread across my desk, my mind raced with deadlines. The project was behind schedule, and my team was waiting for my decision on a major design change. Every minute counted. I could hear the muffled voices of my colleagues outside my office, waiting for me to resolve yet another conflict between departments. My brother\u2019s call was a chance to show him respect, to be the understanding sibling he needed. But the project demanded my focus, my efficiency. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart pounding as I hovered between answering the call and stepping out to manage my team."}
