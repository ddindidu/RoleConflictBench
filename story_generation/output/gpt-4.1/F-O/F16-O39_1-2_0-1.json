It was a message from my partner: \u201cRough day at work. Just need to vent later.\u201d I could picture them at home, waiting for me to listen, to offer a hug and a few kind words. That\u2019s what they expected from me\u2014someone who would be there, emotionally present, ready to support them after a long day.\n\nBut right now, the carpenter was waving at me impatiently, tapping his foot. The crew was on a tight schedule, and if I didn\u2019t get the lumber over in the next minute, the whole line of work would stall. My foreman had already warned me about keeping up the pace. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my partner\u2019s need for comfort, the team\u2019s need for speed. My heart raced as I stood there, torn, the phone in my hand and the lumber at my feet, not sure which demand to answer first."}
