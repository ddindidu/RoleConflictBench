My regular client, Mrs. Lee, had left a message: \u201cJust a quick fix to my fringe, if you have a moment.\u201d She was always so understanding, but I knew she valued feeling her best, especially before her big presentation tomorrow.\n\nI stared at the laundry basket, then at my scissors on the counter.
