My father, usually so quick with a joke, moved through the house in silence, his shoulders hunched. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to be present. But my phone buzzed with a message from the lab: the atmospheric conditions were perfect, a rare alignment I\u2019d been waiting months for. If I missed this window, my experiment\u2014and possibly my funding\u2014would be set back for another year. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents\u2019 unspoken plea for comfort tugged at my heart, while the scientist in me screamed not to waste this chance. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of family and career pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
