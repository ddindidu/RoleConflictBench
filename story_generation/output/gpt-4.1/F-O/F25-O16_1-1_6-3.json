She asked about her recent blood work, her voice trembling with worry. I knew she needed reassurance, clear answers, and a gentle touch\u2014everything I\u2019d been trained to provide as a doctor. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my stepfather: \u201cCan we talk tonight? Your mom\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I remembered how I\u2019d promised myself to check in more, to be the supportive step-child they needed, especially after the rough patch last year. My mind split in two\u2014one part focused on Mrs. Lee\u2019s anxious eyes, the other on the weight of my family\u2019s unspoken needs. I wanted to be present for both, to offer comfort and clarity, but the expectations pressed in from both sides. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my voice, feeling the tug-of-war between the exam room and my own living room, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
