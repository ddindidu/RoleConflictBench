He was frustrated, raising his voice, and I could feel my patience slipping. I reminded myself to be understanding, to respect his feelings even if I didn\u2019t agree. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a customer was calling about their package. I took a deep breath and answered, switching to my delivery person voice, calm and professional. The customer was upset, demanding to know why their order was late. I could hear my brother muttering angrily in the background, and I struggled to keep my tone polite, even as my own irritation grew. I wanted to snap at both of them, to tell my brother to be quiet and the customer to be patient, but I knew I was expected to be respectful and professional in both roles. The pressure built inside me, torn between being a good brother and a reliable delivery person, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
