She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to tell her everything\u2014the exhaustion, the constant vigilance at the pool, the way I felt invisible sometimes. But I hesitated, not wanting to burden her. Instead, I mumbled something about it being a typical day.\n\nMy mind drifted back to the pool, where I\u2019d noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end while I was on break. I should have enforced the rules more strictly, but I was tired, and the supervisor was watching. The expectation to keep everyone safe weighed on me, just as the expectation to be open and honest with my wife did. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to protect the swimmers, wanting to protect my marriage. The words caught in my throat as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
