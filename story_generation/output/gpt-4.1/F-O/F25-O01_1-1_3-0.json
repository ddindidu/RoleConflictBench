She smiled at me, expecting I\u2019d help decorate the house for the holiday, just as her family always had. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep these traditions alive,\u201d she said, her eyes hopeful. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. \n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the office, to the building plans I\u2019d reviewed that morning. As an architect, I was trained to spot even the smallest inconsistencies\u2014this time, a minor deviation in the stair measurements. It probably wouldn\u2019t cause any harm, but the code was clear. My boss had brushed it off, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff, we\u2019re on a deadline.\u201d \n\nNow, as my stepmother handed me a box of ornaments, I felt torn. Should I stay and help, honoring her wish to make me part of the family? Or should I slip away to double-check the plans, upholding my responsibility to safety and compliance? The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
