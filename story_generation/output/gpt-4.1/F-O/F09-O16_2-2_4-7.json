My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an urgent message from the clinic about Mrs. Patel\u2019s new lab results. She needed a medication adjustment, and I was the only doctor on call. At that moment, my son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked over a stack of cereal boxes. Other shoppers stared, some with disapproval. I felt the weight of their eyes, the expectation that I should teach my child respect and discipline right then and there. But my phone buzzed again, the clinic waiting for my response. I was torn\u2014my son needed my guidance, but my patient needed my expertise. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between the duty to shape my child\u2019s character and the responsibility to care for someone\u2019s health."}
