The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a constant reminder that I needed to keep everything afloat for my family. As a parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our financial stability, calculating and recalculating our budget, wondering if I should take on extra work or cut back on expenses. \n\nJust then, an email notification pinged. A client had sent over a standard contract for a routine service engagement. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014the deadline was weeks away\u2014but as a lawyer, I knew the importance of being thorough and timely. My reputation depended on it. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me: should I spend the evening reviewing the contract, getting ahead on work and securing future income, or should I focus on planning our finances, maybe even spend time with my kids to reassure them everything would be okay? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I found myself frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and the needs of my family."}
