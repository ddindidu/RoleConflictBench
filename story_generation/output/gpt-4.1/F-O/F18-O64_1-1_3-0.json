My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014our family group chat is alive with messages about this weekend. Mom wants everyone\u2019s input for a family hike, and my little sister is already begging me to come. I know how much it means to them, especially since I\u2019ve missed the last few outings. As I ring up a customer\u2019s groceries, I try to type a quick reply, but my manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cStay focused, no distractions at the register.\u201d I glance at the line\u2014just two people, but I can\u2019t afford to make a mistake. My hands move automatically, but my mind is split. I want to be the sibling who shows up, who laughs and makes memories, but right now, I\u2019m the cashier who needs to be precise, attentive, and professional. The pressure builds as another message pops up, asking for my answer. I feel torn, caught between the family that needs me and the job that demands my full attention."}
