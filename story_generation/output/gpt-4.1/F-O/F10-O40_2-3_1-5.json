Tomorrow, I\u2019d start the biggest project of my career\u2014a custom library for a client who expected perfection. Every line on the drawings demanded my full attention, every measurement a potential pitfall if I missed a detail. My phone buzzed, jolting me from my concentration. It was Thursday\u2014time for my weekly call with my parents. I could already hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, asking about my week, my father\u2019s quiet questions about my health. They counted on these calls, a thread connecting us across the miles. But the blueprints stared back at me, reminding me of the hours I still needed to spend, the mistakes I couldn\u2019t afford. My heart tugged in two directions: the daughter who didn\u2019t want to disappoint, the carpenter who couldn\u2019t risk distraction. I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of family and the weight of responsibility, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
