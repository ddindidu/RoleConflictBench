Call when you can.\u201d I hadn\u2019t replied to her last message, and guilt pricked at me. She always wanted to hear from me, especially since I started working nights. I promised her I\u2019d check in more, but the job always seemed to get in the way.\n\nAs I walked my beat, I spotted a car parked in a no-parking zone. The driver was an older woman, struggling with grocery bags. She reminded me of my mom. Technically, I should issue a ticket, but I had some discretion. My duty demanded fairness\u2014if I let her go, was I being too lenient? If I ticketed her, was I being too harsh? My phone buzzed again. Another message from Mom: \u201cJust want to know you\u2019re safe.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of my badge on one side, my mother\u2019s gentle concern on the other. I stood there, ticket book in hand, wrestling with what was right\u2014for my job, and for the daughter I was supposed to be."}
