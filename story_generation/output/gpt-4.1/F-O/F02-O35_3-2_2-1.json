A minor delay up ahead meant I had to adjust my speed with precision\u2014too fast, and I\u2019d risk passenger safety; too slow, and I\u2019d throw off the entire schedule. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I remembered the call from the school earlier. My son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in, to talk things through, to show my son that I was present and involved. I could almost hear my wife\u2019s voice, urging me to be the father our son needed, especially now. But the train was full, and every passenger depended on me to get them to their destinations safely and on time. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility of hundreds of strangers and the needs of my own child. The next station approached, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding my attention, my presence, my choice."}
