My phone buzzed in the cup holder\u2014another message from my younger sister. She was holed up in her dorm, nerves frayed, desperate for reassurance before her final exam. I could hear her voice in my head, shaky and small, asking if I thought she\u2019d fail. I wanted to pull over, call her, and be the big brother she needed, to remind her she was stronger than she thought. But the wipers barely kept up with the downpour, and cars darted unpredictably in and out of lanes. My passenger in the back seat gripped the door, eyes wide as we braked for another sudden stop. I knew I had to keep my focus on the road, to drive safely and get my passenger home in one piece. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my sister\u2019s anxiety and the responsibility of the lives in my cab. I stared at the red light ahead, torn, the rain blurring the world outside and the choice I had to make."}
