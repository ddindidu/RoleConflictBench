My heart pounded; every second mattered. As I pulled out of the station, I spotted my stepbrother on the sidewalk, headphones in, eyes glued to his phone. He stepped off the curb, oblivious to the rush of traffic. Instinct screamed at me to stop, to shout, to do anything to keep him safe\u2014after all, I promised our parents I\u2019d always look out for him. But the siren blared, reminding me of the lives depending on my speed, the expectation that I\u2019d reach the accident scene without delay. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between slamming the brakes for my brother or pushing forward for strangers in desperate need. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other."}
