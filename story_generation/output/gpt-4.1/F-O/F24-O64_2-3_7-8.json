My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cStay calm, be friendly, no matter what.\u201d The woman in front of me was red-faced, waving a receipt, her voice rising. I forced a smile, trying to listen, but my eyes kept darting to the window. Outside, my stepbrother, Jamie, was setting up his skateboard at the top of the old, cracked ramp. He\u2019d been talking about this trick for weeks, but the ramp was steeper than it looked, and I knew how reckless he could be. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But right now, I was trapped behind the register, expected to be the perfect cashier, patient and cheerful, even as my heart pounded with worry. The customer\u2019s complaints blurred into the background as I watched Jamie crouch, ready to launch. I felt torn in two\u2014should I drop everything and run to stop him, or stay and do my job? The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of family and work."}
