The cloud tops were rising fast, and I could hear the tension in the pilots\u2019 voices as they awaited my revised climb instructions. My fingers hovered over the mic, ready to issue clearances, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter, her words tumbling out in a rush: \u201cGrandma, how do you know when it\u2019s time to move out on your own? I\u2019m scared.\u201d My heart clenched. She needed my wisdom, my calm reassurance, the kind only a grandmother could give. But the pilots needed me too\u2014my focus, my precision, my undivided attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the expectation to guide my family and the responsibility to keep strangers safe in the sky. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of the airspace and the quiet plea of someone I love."}
