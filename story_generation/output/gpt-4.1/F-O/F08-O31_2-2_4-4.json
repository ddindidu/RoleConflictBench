Today was her big day\u2014she\u2019d just won the school art contest, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate. She\u2019d been practicing her speech all week, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. My daughter smiled at me, grateful I was there, and I felt the warmth of being needed, of being present.\n\nThen my phone buzzed. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: a multi-car accident on Main Street, injuries reported, traffic snarled. They needed all available officers. My badge felt heavy in my pocket. I looked at my granddaughter, her eyes shining with anticipation, and then at my uniform hanging by the door. My duty was clear, but so was my promise. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family expecting my love and presence, my community needing my protection. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn by the impossible choice."}
