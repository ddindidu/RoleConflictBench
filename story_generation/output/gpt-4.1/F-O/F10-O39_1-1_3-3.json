The foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, reminding us to sweep up before we left. I knew the drill\u2014every corner had to be spotless, every tool in its place. Safety and order were non-negotiable here. But my phone buzzed again, a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner starts at six. Grandma expects you to help set the table.\u201d It was the first night of the holiday, and missing the family meal would be unthinkable. I could already picture my grandmother\u2019s disappointed face, the quiet judgment if I arrived late or, worse, didn\u2019t show up at all. My heart pounded as I looked from the broom in my hand to the fading sunlight outside. If I stayed to finish the cleanup, I\u2019d be late for dinner. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my crew and risking a reprimand. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of home and the demands of the job."}
