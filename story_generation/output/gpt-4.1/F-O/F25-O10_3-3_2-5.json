She expected daily updates, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But my laptop screen glared back at me, displaying a notice from the tax authority: a discrepancy in last quarter\u2019s filing, demanding an immediate response. As an accountant, I was expected to drop everything and ensure compliance, to protect the company from penalties. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting a careful response to the tax office and sending a reassuring message to my stepmother. The pressure built in my chest; I could almost hear her voice, anxious if I delayed, while my manager\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind, warning of the consequences of any mistake. I stared at both screens, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which demand to answer first."}
