I knew something was weighing on her, and as her husband, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask her what was wrong and share my own worries. We\u2019d always promised to communicate openly, to never let silence build walls between us. But my phone buzzed, and the message was urgent: a protest downtown was turning volatile, and all available officers were being called in. As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to help restore order and keep people safe. My wife looked up, concern flickering across her face as she saw the tension in mine. I wanted to stay, to talk, to be the supportive partner she needed. But duty pulled at me, demanding I put on my uniform and step into the chaos. My heart pounded as I stood between these two worlds, torn by the expectations of the man I loved being and the job I\u2019d sworn to do."}
