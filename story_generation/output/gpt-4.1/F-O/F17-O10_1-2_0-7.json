My phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend! Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, and guilt pricks at me. I know they worry if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised I\u2019d be better about staying in touch. But just as I start to type a reply, my work email pings. A client is confused about a line item on their invoice and wants an immediate explanation. I know I should respond quickly; it\u2019s part of my job to be available and clear, even on weekends. My mind races, torn between the warmth of my parents\u2019 expectations and the professional responsibility pressing on me. I stare at my phone, then at my laptop, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
