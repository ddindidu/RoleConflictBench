Every line I drew had to serve a purpose\u2014enough light, privacy, collaboration zones. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cTalk to Jamie.\u201d I glanced up and saw my spouse standing by the sink, shoulders tense, eyes distant. I remembered our promise to communicate openly, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. Jamie had been quieter lately, and I knew I should ask what was wrong, listen, and share my own stress. But the deadline for the floor plan loomed, and my team was counting on me to deliver a design that worked for everyone. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward the person I loved, who needed me present and honest, and toward the architect I was, responsible for creating spaces that made others\u2019 lives easier. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to step into first."}
