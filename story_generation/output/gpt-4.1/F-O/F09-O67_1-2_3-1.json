He looked up at me, eyes wide, and I could see he was trying to remember the manners we\u2019d practiced. Just as I was about to praise his effort, my radio crackled to life on the counter. \u201cUnit 12, we have a call\u2014possible broken femur, three miles out, moderate traffic. Please respond.\u201d My heart skipped. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift.\n\nI glanced at my son, torn. He needed me to guide him, to reinforce the lessons I\u2019d promised to teach.
