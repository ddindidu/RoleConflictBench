My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my granddaughter, eager to tell me about her first day at her new job. She\u2019d been waiting for this moment, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to listen, to celebrate with her. I could almost hear her voice, bubbling with excitement, and I knew how much it meant for her to have my attention.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I caught a glimpse of a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My training kicked in: never take your eyes off the water, not even for a second. The expectation was clear\u2014lives depended on my vigilance. Yet, my heart tugged in two directions, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to these swimmers. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, the urge to connect with my granddaughter battling the need to stay alert, every muscle tense as I wrestled with what to do next."}
