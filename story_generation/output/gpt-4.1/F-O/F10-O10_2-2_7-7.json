My mind raced, trying to recall the details of the transaction, but I kept glancing at my phone, where a string of missed calls from my mom blinked at me. She and Dad had seemed so worn out at dinner last night, their voices heavy with worry. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. But now, my client\u2019s tone grew sharper, expecting immediate answers and clarity. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my parents needed their daughter, someone to lean on, while my job demanded my full attention and professionalism. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to split my focus, feeling like I was failing both. The client waited for my response, and my phone buzzed again with another call from home. I closed my eyes, torn between the two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
