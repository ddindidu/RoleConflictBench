My parents chimed in, asking if I could finally join them after so many missed outings. I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the hospital: my patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis and was anxious, waiting for me to explain what it meant for her life. I knew she needed me to be present, to answer her questions with patience and empathy, to help her navigate the uncertainty ahead. My family\u2019s hopeful eyes were on me, expecting a simple yes, while my mind raced with the responsibility I owed to Mrs. Lee. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my time, my care, and my presence. I felt torn, wishing I could be fully there for both, but knowing I had to choose."}
