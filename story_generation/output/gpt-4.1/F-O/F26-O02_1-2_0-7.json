I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she wanted the kind of wisdom only years could provide. At the same time, my phone buzzed insistently. Management was waiting for my project estimates, and the deadline was now. They needed precision, numbers, and my undivided attention to keep the roadmap on track. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close the laptop and give my granddaughter the guidance she sought, and the pressure to deliver the data my team depended on. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached as I looked from her expectant eyes to the blinking cursor on my screen, caught in the impossible space between being the grandparent she needed and the engineer my colleagues relied on."}
