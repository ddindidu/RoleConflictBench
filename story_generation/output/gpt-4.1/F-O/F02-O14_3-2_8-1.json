My wife\u2019s gentle reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t miss this payment.\u201d As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down, the need to keep our home secure for my family. But my phone buzzed with a calendar alert\u2014my experiment\u2019s time slot at the lab was just days away. The specialized instruments I needed were only available for a short window, and missing it would set my research back by months, maybe even jeopardize my grant. My supervisor expected results, and my team was counting on me. I stared at the numbers on the page, then at my lab notes, feeling the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the provider my family needed and the scientist my work demanded."}
