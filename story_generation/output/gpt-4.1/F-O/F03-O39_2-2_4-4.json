Our family has always believed that skipping this ritual brings bad luck, and lately, everyone\u2019s been extra strict about it. At work, though, things are different. Safety is everything. Today, as I walked through the site, I spotted a small puddle of oil in the main walkway. It wasn\u2019t big, but it was right where people pass with heavy loads. My supervisor always says, \u201cIf you see a hazard, fix it right away.\u201d Noon was approaching fast. If I stopped to clean the spill, I\u2019d miss the incense ritual at home. If I left it, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be responsible. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my mom. I stood there, mop in hand, heart pounding, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I owed to my coworkers\u2019 safety."}
