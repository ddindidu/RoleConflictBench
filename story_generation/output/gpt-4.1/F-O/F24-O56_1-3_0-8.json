He\u2019d come straight from his study session, eyes rimmed red, shoulders hunched with the weight of tomorrow\u2019s final exam. As his step-sibling, I knew I should offer comfort, maybe a pep talk or a gentle squeeze of his hand. But as his hairdresser, I saw the knots and buildup, the way my comb snagged and refused to glide. I needed to wash and condition his hair thoroughly, to do my job right, but he was already tense, flinching at every tug. If I pushed him to the sink, would I be adding to his stress? If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d be unprofessional, risking a bad cut and my reputation. My heart ached to be the supportive sibling he needed, but my hands itched with the responsibility of my craft. I hovered, caught between the urge to soothe and the need to act, unsure which role to let guide me."}
