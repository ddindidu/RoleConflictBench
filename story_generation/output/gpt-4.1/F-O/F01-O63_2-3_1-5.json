My sales manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need five more sign-ups, or we all lose the bonus.\u201d The pressure was suffocating. Just then, my grandson shuffled into the room, eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. I could tell something was weighing on him, something more important than any sales call. As a grandfather, I knew I should set aside my work, offer him a seat, and listen\u2014share some of the hard-earned wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But the phone lines were lighting up, and every second I hesitated meant another missed opportunity, another step closer to letting my team down. My heart ached as I looked from my grandson to the blinking screen, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
