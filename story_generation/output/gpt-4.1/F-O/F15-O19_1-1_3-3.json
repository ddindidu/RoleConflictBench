She had just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew I needed to step in, to teach her about kindness and respect\u2014values I promised myself I\u2019d instill. As I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the pharmacy: a patient was waiting, confused about which over-the-counter pain reliever to choose. I was supposed to be available for quick questions, to offer clear, careful advice, even after hours if needed. My daughter\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for guidance, while my mind raced with the responsibility to the patient who trusted my expertise. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my child needing my presence and patience, my patient needing my knowledge and reassurance. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, torn between being the parent my daughter deserved and the pharmacist my patient relied on."}
