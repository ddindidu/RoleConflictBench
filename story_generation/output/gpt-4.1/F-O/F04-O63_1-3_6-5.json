The office buzzes with tension\u2014every call, every pitch, every \u201cno\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d is a step closer or further from the sales target. My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, then to me, silently urging me to keep dialing. I know if I don\u2019t help the team hit the number, we all lose our bonuses, and I\u2019ll have to answer for it.\n\nMy phone vibrates. It\u2019s my younger sister, texting: \u201cHey, are you coming to the movies with us tonight? Everyone\u2019s going. It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I remember promising her last week that I\u2019d make more time, that I\u2019d be there for her and not just a voice on the other end of a phone. She\u2019s counting on me to show up, to be the brother she can rely on, not the one who always cancels.\n\nI stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the relentless pressure to keep calling and the quiet hope in her message. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014my team\u2019s, my manager\u2019s, my sister\u2019s, and my own."}
