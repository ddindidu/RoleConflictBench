My little sister\u2019s text blinked on my screen: \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s bad.\u201d I knew she\u2019d just gotten the news about her scholarship\u2014she\u2019d been waiting for weeks, and now it was a rejection. My heart twisted, wanting nothing more than to call her, to be the big brother she needed, to listen and reassure her that she\u2019d get through this.\n\nBut the next call was already ringing through. \u201cHello, this is Alex from Greenline Services, how can I help you today?\u201d The customer\u2019s voice was friendly, asking about our rates\u2014something I could answer in my sleep. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flicked over, expecting me to keep my numbers up, to stay focused and professional. My sister\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more desperate. I felt split in two, my mind racing between the script in front of me and the ache in my chest for my sister. I wanted to be there for her, but I was trapped by the demands of my job, my voice steady while my thoughts were anything but."}
