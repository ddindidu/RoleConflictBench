My little sister had finally agreed to join me and my friends for dinner\u2014a rare chance to include her in my world, to show her I respected her enough to want her there. She\u2019d been distant lately, and I knew how much it meant to her that I made the effort. I was just about to leave the house when my radio crackled: a call for an ambulance, a woman had fallen and broken her arm, pain management and stabilization needed immediately. My heart sank. As an ambulance driver, I knew the expectation\u2014someone was depending on me for urgent care, and I couldn\u2019t ignore that responsibility. But as a brother, I\u2019d promised my sister I\u2019d be there, to make her feel included and valued. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the duty to a stranger in pain and the duty to my own family, both roles demanding more than I felt able to give."}
