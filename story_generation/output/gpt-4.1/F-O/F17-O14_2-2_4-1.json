I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the experiment I\u2019d scheduled at the lab. The specialized equipment I needed was only available for a few hours, and missing this window could set my research back by months. My advisor had stressed how crucial this data was for our project, and I knew my team was counting on me. I felt torn, the pull of family and the demands of science stretching me in opposite directions.
