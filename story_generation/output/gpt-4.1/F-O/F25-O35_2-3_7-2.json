The radio crackled with routine updates, but my mind kept drifting to last night\u2014my stepdad\u2019s slumped shoulders at the dinner table, my mom\u2019s forced smile. They\u2019d always leaned on me, especially since the remarriage, and lately, their exhaustion seemed to seep into every corner of our home. I wanted to be there for them, to listen, to reassure them that things would get better.\n\nSuddenly, a piercing alarm jolted me back. The dashboard flashed red: brake system malfunction.
