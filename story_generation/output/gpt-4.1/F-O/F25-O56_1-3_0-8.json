Everything okay?\u201d Guilt pricked at me. She and Dad always said it meant a lot to get a quick check-in, especially since I moved out. I\u2019d promised to text every weekend, but work had been nonstop. Now, my client\u2019s hair was a mess of knots, the product buildup so dense my comb barely moved. She was already anxious about the time, and I knew I\u2019d have to spend extra minutes detangling before I could even think about cutting. My manager expected me to keep appointments on schedule, but I couldn\u2019t rush this without risking damage. My phone buzzed again. I felt torn\u2014if I paused to text my stepmom, I\u2019d fall further behind, but if I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting down my family. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I stood there, hands dripping, heart racing, caught between the two worlds that needed me."}
