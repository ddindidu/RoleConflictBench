My little sister\u2019s eyes sparkled as she suggested a picnic by the river, and my mother looked at me, expecting me to join in, to be present, to be the brother who laughs and makes memories. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the site supervisor. The carpenter was waiting for the next load of lumber, and if I didn\u2019t hurry, the whole crew would be delayed. I could almost feel the weight of the boards in my arms, the urgency in the carpenter\u2019s voice. My father nudged me, asking what I thought about the picnic, but my mind was split. I wanted to be the brother they needed, but I also knew the team was counting on me. The pressure built inside me, two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, caught between the warmth of my family and the demands of the jobsite, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
