Mom\u2019s counting on you for the family photo.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there for the holiday celebration, but my shift as a taxi driver is running long. My last passenger is anxious, urging me to hurry so she won\u2019t miss her train. As I turn onto the detour, orange cones squeeze the road into a single lane. Suddenly, a school zone sign flashes, and I spot a group of children giggling near the curb. My passenger sighs impatiently, tapping her foot, while my family\u2019s texts keep coming. I know I\u2019m expected to drive carefully, especially here, but the pressure to get my passenger to the station\u2014and to my family on time\u2014tightens in my chest. I grip the wheel, torn between slowing down for safety and the urge to speed up for everyone\u2019s sake, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
