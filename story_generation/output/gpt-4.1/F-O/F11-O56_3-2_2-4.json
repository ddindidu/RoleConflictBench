She was a first-time visitor, and I could sense her disappointment with the colour tone. My heart raced\u2014I knew how important it was to make a good impression, to listen carefully, and to fix any concerns right away. Just as I was about to ask her what she\u2019d like changed, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you right now.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I felt a wave of guilt and worry. As her sister, I was supposed to be there, to support her no matter what. But as a hairdresser, I couldn\u2019t just leave my client, especially when she needed reassurance and a solution. My mind spun with the weight of both expectations, torn between the urge to rush to my sister\u2019s side and the responsibility to my client sitting anxiously in my chair."}
