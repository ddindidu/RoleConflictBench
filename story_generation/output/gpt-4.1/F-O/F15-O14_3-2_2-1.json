We request your presence to discuss the matter.\u201d My mind raced with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have noticed something was wrong? I knew I needed to be there for my child, to listen, to guide, to show that I cared about their actions and feelings. But as I reached for my phone to call the school, another notification flashed: a reminder that my experiment slot was in just two hours. The specialized equipment I\u2019d waited months to access was only available today, and missing this window would set my research back indefinitely. My team was counting on me, and the data we hoped to gather could be crucial for our project. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my child needed me as a parent, my work demanded me as a scientist. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second, unsure which part of myself I could afford to let down."}
