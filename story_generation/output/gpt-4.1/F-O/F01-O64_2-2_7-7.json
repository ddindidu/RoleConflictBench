Each person expected a smile, a bit of small talk, and efficient service. My manager had reminded me just this morning: \u201cFriendly faces keep them coming back.\u201d I tried to keep my tone light, but my mind kept drifting to my granddaughter. She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her updates. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014another message, probably a photo or a funny story she wanted to share. I knew how much it meant to her that I responded, that I showed I cared and was proud. But the customers were waiting, and I could feel their impatience growing. I wanted to be the supportive grandfather she needed, but right now, I was the cashier everyone expected. My heart tugged in two directions, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I reached for the next item on the belt."}
