I was so close to smashing my weekly target, and it was only Wednesday. Every call I made felt like a step closer to the recognition I\u2019d been craving at work. But then my sister\u2019s message popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re leaving for the family trip tomorrow. Mom\u2019s counting on you to help with the kids.\u201d I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, warm but firm, reminding me how important it was to be present, to make memories together. My mind spun with the pressure\u2014my manager\u2019s praise if I kept dialing, my family\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up. I wanted to be the reliable sister, the one who never missed a holiday, but I also wanted to prove myself at work, to finally be seen as more than just another voice on the phone. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phone and the family waiting for me."}
