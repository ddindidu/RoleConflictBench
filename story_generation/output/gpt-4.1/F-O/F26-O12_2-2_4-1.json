My daughter\u2019s message glowed: \u201cGrandpa, can you come over? Jamie wants to show everyone her first piano recital video tonight!\u201d I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s excited voice, see her proud little smile. But on my screen, red flags from the code review stared back at me\u2014performance warnings I couldn\u2019t ignore. The new feature was so close to being finished, but if I left now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought and risk missing tomorrow\u2019s deadline.
