My sister sent a photo of the table already set, my mom\u2019s message trailing with, \u201cDon\u2019t be late, we miss you.\u201d I could almost smell the familiar dishes, hear the laughter. But at the pharmacy, Mrs. Patel sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like a puzzle. She looked anxious, her new prescriptions complicated and potentially dangerous if misunderstood. My manager had emphasized the importance of thorough counseling, especially with high-risk medications. I knew how much my family valued these dinners, how my absence would disappoint them. But Mrs. Patel needed me to explain every detail, to ensure her safety. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of home and the responsibility of my profession. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be the sibling my family needed and the pharmacist my patient deserved."}
