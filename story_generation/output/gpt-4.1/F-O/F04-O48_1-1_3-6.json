My sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for a hike on Saturday. I could see the hope in my mom\u2019s eyes\u2014she wanted us all together, just like old times. I wanted that too. But as I nodded along, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the nursing home: Mrs. Carter, one of my regular patients, was feeling especially lonely and had asked if I could spend a little extra time with her during my Saturday shift. I knew how much she relied on our talks, how her eyes lit up when I walked in. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, but Mrs. Carter needed me too, in a different, quieter way. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the warmth of home and the quiet comfort I could offer someone who had no one else."}
