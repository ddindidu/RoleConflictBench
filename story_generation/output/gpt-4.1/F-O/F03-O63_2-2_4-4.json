My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou need three more sales before the end of your shift.\u201d The pressure was suffocating. I knew if I didn\u2019t meet my target, I\u2019d be letting the team down\u2014and risking my job. But my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family ceremony. It\u2019s important to us.\u201d My family had been talking for weeks about how crucial it was to honor our traditions, especially now that my grandparents were getting older. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice, reminding me that family comes first, that our customs are what bind us together. But here I was, torn between the duty to my family and the demands of my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014should I log off and rush home, or stay and keep calling, hoping for those last few sales? The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
