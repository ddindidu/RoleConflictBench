The smell of roast chicken and laughter drifted from the kitchen, and I could already picture my family gathered around the table, waiting for me to join them. I wanted to be there, to share stories and make Mom smile. But my uniform was neatly folded on the chair, and my radio sat beside it, volume turned low but ready to crackle to life at any moment. As an ambulance driver, I was on standby tonight, and the expectation was clear: if a call came in, I had to drop everything and go, no matter what. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family and the cold, urgent responsibility of my job. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, knowing that soon I might have to choose between them."}
