My screen flashes with another prospect\u2019s number, and I force a smile into my voice. \u201cHello, this is Anna from BrightConnect. How can I help you today?\u201d The man on the other end immediately launches into a barrage of technical questions about our new service\u2014questions my script only half answers. My supervisor expects me to handle every objection smoothly, to never let a customer feel uncertain. I scramble for the right words, feeling my confidence slip.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzes with a text from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you\u2019re free? Dad seems down today.\u201d My heart twists. I\u2019m supposed to check in, to be the daughter who notices when things aren\u2019t right at home, who asks if everything is okay. But I can\u2019t step away; I can\u2019t let my team down or risk a bad call review. My mind races, torn between the voice in my ear demanding answers and the quiet plea from home. I grip the phone tighter, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needs me more right now."}
