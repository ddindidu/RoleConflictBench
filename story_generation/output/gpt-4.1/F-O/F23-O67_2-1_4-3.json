My partner\u2019s text: \u201cCan you pick up some groceries on your way home?\u201d I agreed, and soon I was at the supermarket with my stepson, Ethan. As I scanned the shelves, Ethan darted off, weaving between carts, giggling. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him respect and discipline. But my mind was still half in the ambulance, running through protocols, picturing the kit\u2014what if I missed something? What if a patient needed a supply I\u2019d overlooked? I wanted to call Ethan back, to kneel and explain why we walk, not run, in public. But my phone vibrated again: a reminder from dispatch about tomorrow\u2019s shift. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding I be a steady, guiding parent, the other insisting I be a meticulous, prepared medic. My heart pounded as I watched Ethan disappear around the corner, and I stood frozen, caught between the duty to my family and the duty to my patients, unsure which to answer first."}
