The home loan repayment loomed over me like a storm cloud, just two months away. I knew I had to find a way to make the payment\u2014my family depended on me to keep a roof over our heads. But as I tried to focus on the budget, my phone buzzed with a message from the factory: \u201cMachines overheating. Need urgent maintenance. Can you come in today?\u201d \n\nI felt my chest tighten. As a machine repairer, I was expected to keep everything running smoothly, and missing another service window could mean costly breakdowns or even lost jobs for my coworkers. But if I left now, I\u2019d lose precious hours I needed to sort out our finances, maybe even miss the chance to pick up extra shifts that could help with the loan.

I closed my eyes, torn between the call of the machines and the silent plea of my family."}
