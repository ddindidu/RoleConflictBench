My family had come to the community center today, gathering for our annual reunion\u2014a tradition my parents insisted we never miss. They\u2019d reminded me just this morning how important it was to honor our customs, to be present, to show respect for our elders and our roots. But as I watched my younger cousin and his friends laughing near the deep end, I noticed them edging closer to the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs, daring each other to jump.\n\nAs a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, no exceptions. Safety came first, even if it meant calling out my own family. But I could already hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, warning me not to embarrass the family or disrupt the gathering. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of my job against the pressure to uphold family harmony. The whistle felt heavy in my hand, and I hesitated, caught between the duty to protect and the fear of disappointing those I loved most."}
