Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I know what she wants\u2014just to talk, to hear me ask if everything\u2019s okay at home, to feel I\u2019m there for them. But as I tuck my phone away, I hear soft sobs from Room 204. Mrs. Lee, my patient, has just learned her cancer has returned. She\u2019s alone, her hands trembling, tears streaming down her face. My supervisor expects me to be present, to offer comfort and companionship, to sit with her and help her through this moment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my parents needing their son, my patient needing her nursing assistant. My heart aches, torn between the urge to call home and the duty to stay by Mrs. Lee\u2019s side. I stand in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between two lives, unsure which need is greater, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
