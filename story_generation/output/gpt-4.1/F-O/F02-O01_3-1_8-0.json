As an architect, I knew the importance of precision\u2014every detail mattered, especially when it came to safety and compliance. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the building plan. They weren\u2019t likely to cause immediate problems, but they nagged at me. Fixing them would mean more hours, more back-and-forth with the contractors, and possibly delaying the project.\n\nBut then, the weight of my other role pressed in. As a father, I was acutely aware that our home loan repayment was due in two months. My family depended on me for financial stability. If I delayed the project, I risked losing the client\u2019s trust, maybe even the contract, and that bonus I was counting on to cover the loan.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my responsibility to my family and my duty as an architect. The expectations clashed inside me, each demanding my full attention. I stared at the plans, feeling the pressure build, knowing I had to choose which role to honor first."}
