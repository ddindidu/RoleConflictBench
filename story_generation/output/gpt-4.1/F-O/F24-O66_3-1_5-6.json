My stepbrother sent a picture of the packed car, and my stepmom reminded me, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we leave at 8 a.m. sharp!\u201d I knew how much it meant to them for me to be there, to show I was really part of the family. But as I glanced at my taxi parked outside, I remembered the late-night call from dispatch: a VIP client needed a ride at 7 a.m., and the company was counting on me. The cab had to be spotless, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d clean it tonight, but I was already running late for dinner with my family. My mind spun with the pressure\u2014if I skipped the trip, I\u2019d disappoint my stepfamily, maybe make them feel I didn\u2019t care. But if I let the company down, I risked my job and my reputation. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between being the reliable step-sibling they wanted and the professional driver I needed to be."}
