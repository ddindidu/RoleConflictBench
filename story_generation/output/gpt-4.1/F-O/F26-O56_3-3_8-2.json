It was my daughter, her name lighting up the screen, and I knew it wasn\u2019t just a casual call. My mind raced\u2014she\u2019d mentioned her husband hadn\u2019t been himself lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to check in, to be the steady presence our family needed. But before I could answer, the bell above the salon door jingled. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids swept in, faces tight with nerves, glancing at their watches. I was supposed to greet them warmly, put them at ease, make this day special. My hand hovered over my phone, heart pounding. I could hear my daughter\u2019s voice in my head, needing comfort, and at the same time, I saw the anxious eyes of the bridal party, expecting my full attention. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, torn between the family who needed me and the clients who depended on me to make their day perfect."}
