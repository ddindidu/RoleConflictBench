My phone buzzed with another email from our supplier, the subject line in all caps: \u201cFINAL NOTICE.\u201d I knew I needed to call them, to negotiate, to keep the business afloat. But across the room, my granddaughter slouched on the couch, her eyes red and distant. She\u2019d barely touched her lunch, and I could sense the heaviness in her silence. As her grandmother, I wanted to sit beside her, offer the comfort and wisdom she\u2019d always found in my stories, to help her untangle whatever was weighing her down. Yet, as an accountant, I felt the pressure of looming deadlines and the responsibility to resolve the crisis before it spiraled. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the child who needed me and the business that depended on me. I stared at the phone, then at her, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
