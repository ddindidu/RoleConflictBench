The words \u201cimmediate safety concern\u201d glared at me from the screen, and I knew the plant couldn\u2019t afford a shutdown. My mind raced through protocols, possible fixes, and the pressure of my team\u2019s expectations. Then, another message popped up\u2014this time from my sister. \u201cCan you come? It\u2019s about Dad. He\u2019s not doing well.\u201d My heart clenched. As a brother, I was supposed to be there, especially now, when my family needed me most. But as an engineer, I was responsible for the safety of dozens of people and the future of our operations. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my care. I stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing in from both sides, torn between the call of family and the duty of my profession, unsure which path to take."}
