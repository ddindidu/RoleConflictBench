It was my daughter, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had just won his first art competition, and the family was gathering to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile, to be the grandfather who never missed a moment. I glanced around at the cluttered benches, the scattered nails and wood shavings. The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cA clean site is a safe site. One slip, and someone could get hurt.\u201d I knew I couldn\u2019t leave the workshop in this state, not with the risk of an accident hanging over my head. But the thought of my grandson\u2019s hopeful eyes, searching the room for me, tugged at my heart. I stood there, broom in hand, torn between the duty to my craft and the love for my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
