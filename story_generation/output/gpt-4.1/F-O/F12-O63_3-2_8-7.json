My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed as he slid the medical bills toward me. \u201cWe need to talk about this,\u201d he said, his voice gentle but firm. I knew he expected me to be honest, to share my worries and thoughts openly, just as we promised when we married. But my mind kept drifting to the clock\u2014my break was almost over, and management had sent another email this morning about not exceeding our allotted time. The phone queue would be piling up, and I could already imagine the supervisor\u2019s disappointed look if I was late logging back in. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to open up, but my heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds. I wanted to be present, to give him the transparency he deserved, but the weight of my job\u2019s strict demands pressed in, making it hard to breathe. I stared at the bills, torn between the need to be a good wife and the fear of letting down my team."}
