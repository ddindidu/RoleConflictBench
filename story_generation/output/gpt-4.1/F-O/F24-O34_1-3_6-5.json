Mom always says I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood. I keep an eye on the traffic, making sure he doesn\u2019t dart into the street. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my shift as an air traffic controller is starting, and I\u2019m on call for emergencies. I answer, and the supervisor\u2019s voice is tense: \u201cA pilot\u2019s declared low fuel on approach. We need you to coordinate vectors now.\u201d My heart pounds. I know the expectation\u2014lives depend on my clear, immediate instructions. But Sam tugs my sleeve, asking if we can stop for a snack. I glance at him, then at the busy road, and then at my phone, where the pilot\u2019s anxious voice crackles through. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my responsibility to keep Sam safe, and my duty to guide that plane safely to the ground. My mind races, torn between the brother who trusts me and the strangers in the sky who need me."}
