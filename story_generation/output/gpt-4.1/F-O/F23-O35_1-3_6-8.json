He stood stiffly behind me, pen poised, ready to mark down any slip. My heart pounded, not just from the pressure of the audit, but from the text I\u2019d read on my break\u2014my stepdaughter\u2019s hopeful message: \u201cDid you get the Nintendo yet? You promised.\u201d I\u2019d been saving for weeks, pinching every penny, but the rent was due, and overtime wasn\u2019t guaranteed. The supervisor cleared his throat, reminding me to announce the next stop. My voice wavered as I spoke into the mic, thinking of my partner\u2019s worried face and my stepdaughter\u2019s disappointment if I failed to keep my word. The train rumbled on, the supervisor\u2019s eyes sharp, my phone buzzing in my pocket. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding flawless professionalism, the other begging me not to break a promise that meant the world to a child who was still learning to trust me. The next station loomed, and I had to choose which expectation to meet, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
