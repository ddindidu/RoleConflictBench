He\u2019d been talking about this new skateboard trick for days, and now he was determined to try it, despite the uneven surface and my gut feeling that it was too risky. As his step-sibling, I felt responsible for his safety, knowing our parents trusted me to look out for him. But my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the optional brainstorming session for next sprint was starting in ten minutes. As a software developer, I knew how much my team valued cross-functional input, and skipping the session might mean missing a chance to shape the new features\u2014or worse, letting my team down. I stood there, torn, watching my brother adjust his pads, my mind racing between the urge to stay and supervise him and the professional pull to log in and collaborate. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
