She asked about my day, and I hesitated, not wanting to burden her with the chaos of my shift. Still, I knew she expected honesty, so I mentioned the call I\u2019d just received\u2014a patient with a broken leg, nothing life-threatening, but the city traffic was a nightmare. As I spoke, my phone buzzed again: dispatch urging me to hurry, the patient\u2019s pain growing. My wife reached for my hand, her silent plea for connection clear. I felt the weight of her expectation to open up, to be present, but my mind raced with the responsibility of getting behind the wheel, navigating sirens and impatient drivers, knowing I had to keep everyone safe. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the attentive partner she needed and the focused professional my job demanded. I looked at her, then at my phone, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
