My son darts between the supermarket aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls. I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and teach him about respect and safety, just as I promised myself I would. But my phone buzzes: a reminder that my shift as a subway operator starts soon. The pre-departure check isn\u2019t critical, but it\u2019s expected, and skipping it could mean delays or, worse, a safety risk. My supervisor trusts me to be thorough and punctual. My son\u2019s laughter echoes, but so does the memory of last week\u2019s near-miss on the tracks. I feel my heart tugged in two directions\u2014one by the little hand I should be holding, the other by the train I should be preparing. I stand frozen, torn between the lesson my child needs and the responsibility my passengers expect."}
