My son, Ethan, shuffled in, dragging his feet, mumbling a half-hearted \u201cgood morning.\u201d I caught the eye roll when I reminded him to greet everyone properly. As a father, I knew I should pause, sit with him, and talk about respect and kindness\u2014reinforce the values I want him to carry. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the client was expecting an update on the new library\u2019s progress. As the architect, I needed to check the contractors\u2019 reports, make sure the timeline wasn\u2019t slipping. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one voice urging me to close the laptop and focus on Ethan, the other insisting I couldn\u2019t let the project drift. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
