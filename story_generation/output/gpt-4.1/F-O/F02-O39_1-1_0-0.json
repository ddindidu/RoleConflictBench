I wiped the sweat from my brow, glancing at the pile of unused bricks my supervisor had just pointed out. \u201cMove those to the back lot before you clock out,\u201d he\u2019d said, his tone leaving no room for argument. My arms ached from the day\u2019s work, but I knew the job wasn\u2019t done until every brick was stacked where it belonged. Still, my mind kept drifting to my children\u2014how their faces would light up when they saw me, how they\u2019d scan the crowd for their dad. I could almost hear their voices, feel their small hands in mine. But here I was, torn between the weight of bricks and the weight of being there for my kids. The minutes ticked by, each one pressing harder on my chest, as I stood between the demands of my job and the promise I\u2019d made to my family."}
