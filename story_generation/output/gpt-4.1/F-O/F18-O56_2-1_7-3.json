Come watch?\u201d I looked up from my client\u2019s hair, scissors poised mid-air. My brother had been obsessed with skateboarding lately, and I knew that ramp he mentioned was rough and dangerous. As his sibling, I felt a knot of worry twist in my stomach\u2014what if he got hurt and I wasn\u2019t there? But right in front of me, my regular client smiled in the mirror, gently touching her fringe. \u201cCould you just trim a little more off here?\u201d she asked, her tone as warm as always. I knew how much she trusted me to get it just right, and I prided myself on making sure every client left happy. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to my brother\u2019s side and the responsibility to finish my client\u2019s cut with care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
