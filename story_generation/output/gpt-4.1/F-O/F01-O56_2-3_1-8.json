The salon was busy, and I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014she expected me to work my usual magic, to leave her hair soft and manageable before the cut. But my mind kept drifting to the waiting area, where my grandson sat, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the floor. He\u2019d come to visit after school, and I could tell something was weighing on him. As a grandfather, I wanted to sit beside him, offer the kind of advice only years of living can provide, to help him find his way through whatever was troubling him. Yet, as a hairdresser, my hands were tied\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014by the demands of my client and the tangle before me. The expectation to be present and attentive in both roles pulled at me, and I felt the ache of being needed in two places at once, uncertain which responsibility should come first."}
