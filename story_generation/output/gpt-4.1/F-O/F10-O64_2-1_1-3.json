They always waited for my update, eager to hear about my week, and I knew how much it meant to them. As I started counting the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: any difference, no matter how small, had to be reported and logged before leaving. My manager was strict about this, and I\u2019d seen coworkers get written up for less.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Mom, right on time, probably sitting with Dad, waiting for me to pick up. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I followed procedure, I\u2019d be late calling home, and I knew how much my parents worried if I didn\u2019t answer right away. But if I ignored the policy, I\u2019d be risking my job. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, torn between the rules of the store and the expectations of my family, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
