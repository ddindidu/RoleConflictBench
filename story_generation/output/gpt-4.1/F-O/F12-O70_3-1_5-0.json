My phone buzzed on the counter\u2014dispatch again. The package for Maple Street had just arrived at the depot, later than scheduled, but still within my shift. I was supposed to deliver it immediately. My heart pounded as I glanced around the living room, half-vacuumed, and the pile of laundry waiting to be folded. My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, reminding me that his parents would be here in two hours. \u201cCan you finish the guest room?\u201d he called. I nodded, forcing a smile, but inside I was torn. If I left now, the house wouldn\u2019t be ready, and I\u2019d let my husband down. If I stayed, the package would be late, and I\u2019d risk a complaint at work. Both sides expected me to be reliable, to not let anyone down. I felt the weight of their trust pressing on my chest, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, cleaning spray in the other, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
