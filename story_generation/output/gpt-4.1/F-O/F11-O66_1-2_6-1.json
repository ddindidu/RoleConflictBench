It was my younger brother, texting: \u201cHey, we\u2019re all at the park. Come join us!\u201d I could picture them\u2014my siblings, laughing, tossing a frisbee, probably wondering why I always missed out. I wanted to be there, to show I cared, to be the sister who included herself, who built those memories with them. But as I glanced in the rearview mirror, my passenger\u2019s anxious eyes met mine. \u201cMy train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d she said, voice tight. The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. She was counting on me to get her there safely and on time. My hands tightened on the wheel. I felt the pull\u2014my family expecting me to be present, my passenger needing me to be professional. I could hear my brother\u2019s laughter in my mind, but also the ticking clock for the woman in my back seat. I sat at the intersection, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which direction to turn."}
