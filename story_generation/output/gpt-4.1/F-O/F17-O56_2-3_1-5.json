It\u2019s Sunday evening, our weekly call time. She\u2019ll be waiting, probably already worrying if I don\u2019t pick up soon. But right now, I\u2019m standing in the salon, scissors still in hand, facing a client whose voice is rising with every word. She\u2019s furious about her haircut, gesturing at the mirror, demanding I fix it before she leaves. The other stylists are packing up, glancing at me with sympathy as the clock ticks past closing. My mind races\u2014if I answer my mom, I\u2019ll be distracted and the client will feel ignored, maybe even angrier. But if I focus on the client, I\u2019ll miss my call, and my mom will be hurt, maybe think I\u2019m too busy for her. I feel pulled in two directions, my heart pounding as I try to figure out how to be a good child and a good hairdresser at the same time."}
