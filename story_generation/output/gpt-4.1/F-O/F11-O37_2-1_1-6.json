It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart squeezed. He never asked for help unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014my supervisor would be making rounds soon, and I still had two rooms left to clean. The rules were clear: no phones during work, gloves on at all times, and no distractions. But my brother\u2019s words echoed in my mind. As a sister, I was supposed to be there for him, especially when he was struggling. But as a cleaner, I was expected to put the job and its protocols first. I stared at my gloved hands, torn between peeling them off to call him and risking a reprimand, or ignoring his plea and finishing my shift as expected. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and family."}
