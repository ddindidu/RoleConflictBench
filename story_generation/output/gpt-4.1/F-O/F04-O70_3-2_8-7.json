As her brother, I knew I needed to be patient, listen, and talk things through so we could rebuild the respect we\u2019d always had. My phone buzzed again, but this time it was a call from a customer. I was on my delivery route, and the customer wanted an update on their package. I could hear the impatience in their voice, and I knew I had to respond with calm professionalism, no matter how distracted I felt. My sister\u2019s messages kept popping up, each one more emotional than the last, while the customer waited for a clear, polite answer. I felt torn\u2014my sister needed my attention and honesty, but my job demanded I stay composed and courteous. The pressure built inside me as I tried to juggle both conversations, feeling the weight of expectations from both sides, unsure which role to prioritize in that moment."}
