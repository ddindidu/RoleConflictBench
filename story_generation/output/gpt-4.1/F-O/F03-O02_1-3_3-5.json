Grandpa will say the blessing.\u201d It was the annual family gathering, a tradition I\u2019d never missed. My father always said, \u201cFamily comes first, no matter what.\u201d I could already picture the table, the laughter, the stories passed down through generations. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014at the plant, where an inspector\u2019s report sat heavy on my desk. \u201cImmediate action required,\u201d it read. If I didn\u2019t address the safety concerns tonight, operations could be shut down, and my team would be left scrambling. My manager expected me to lead, to ensure every standard was met, no matter the hour. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s pride and warmth on one side, my responsibility as an engineer on the other. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my parents\u2019 eyes against the trust my colleagues placed in me. I glanced at the clock, torn between the call of home and the demands of duty, unsure which path to take."}
