I knew it was probably my mom\u2014she always texted on weekends, just to check in, to make sure I was eating well and getting enough sleep. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d reply more often, that I\u2019d let her know I was safe. But now, my hands gripped the wheel, and my mind was on the call: a man in his fifties, chest pain, shortness of breath, possible heart attack. My partner was prepping the equipment in the back, and I could already feel the pressure mounting. I glanced at my phone, the unread message glaring at me. I wanted to reassure my mom, to be the daughter she expected\u2014present, communicative, caring. But the city lights blurred past, and the patient\u2019s life depended on every second I shaved off the drive. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the ambulance driver my patient depended on."}
