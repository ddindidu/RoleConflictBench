My hands move automatically, scanning items, bagging, smiling at each customer. But my mind is elsewhere\u2014on the promise I made to my stepson last month. He\u2019s been counting down the days until I\u2019d buy him that Nintendo, his eyes lighting up every time he mentions it. I want to keep my word, to be the reliable parent he deserves, but the numbers in my bank account don\u2019t add up, not with rent due and groceries to buy.\n\nA customer slams a box of ornaments on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about a missing sale price. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to stay calm and helpful as the line grows longer. My manager\u2019s watching, expecting me to keep things moving, to be the model cashier. But inside, I\u2019m torn\u2014how can I be the parent my stepson needs if I can\u2019t afford what I promised? How can I be the employee my boss expects when my mind is tangled in worry? The register drawer pops open, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, both demanding more than I feel I can give."}
