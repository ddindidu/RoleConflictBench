Don\u2019t forget your sweep-up, folks.\u201d I pulled off my gloves, hands aching, and checked the message. It was from my little brother: \u201cSis, I got the scholarship! Family dinner tonight?\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014he\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there to celebrate every milestone. But as I looked around, dust and debris still littered my section. The foreman\u2019s eyes swept over us, making it clear that leaving early wasn\u2019t an option. Safety and cleanliness were non-negotiable here; I\u2019d seen what happened when someone cut corners. My brother expected me to show up, to be the supportive sister I\u2019d always been.
