He looked anxious, his hands wrapped around a mug of coffee. \u201cI need to talk,\u201d he said, voice trembling. He\u2019d been wrestling with a big decision at work, and I knew he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through his thoughts. I sat down, trying to focus, but my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the head lifeguard. The morning swim lessons were about to start, and someone had discovered a broken lane rope. If it wasn\u2019t fixed immediately, the lessons would be delayed, and the kids would be left waiting, parents growing impatient. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my husband\u2019s searching eyes, hoping for comfort, and the urgent expectation that I\u2019d keep the pool running smoothly. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between being the supportive wife he counted on and the responsible lifeguard my team depended on."}
