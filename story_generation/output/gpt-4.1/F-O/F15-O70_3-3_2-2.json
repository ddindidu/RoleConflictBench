My heart sank as I read it\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me immediately. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions had consequences and to support him in making things right. But as I glanced at the medical supply box on the passenger seat, I felt a different kind of pressure. The hospital was expecting this delivery within the hour, and any delay could affect patient care. My supervisor had stressed the importance of this run, and I knew the hospital staff\u2014and the patients\u2014were counting on me. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urgent needs of my child and the critical responsibility of my job. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt paralyzed, unsure which road to take."}
