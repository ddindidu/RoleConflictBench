The weight of ensuring financial stability for my family pressed on my chest. Every cent mattered, and I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to lose any work hours. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the factory floor. The operator was at it again, tweaking the machine settings without guidance, and the material waste was piling up. As the machine repairer, I was expected to step in, provide clear instructions, and prevent further losses for the company. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the evening with my kids, the only time I had to help them with homework and reassure them that everything would be okay. My mind raced between the demands: the need to secure our home, and the responsibility to my clients. The pressure built inside me, a tug-of-war between being the provider and being present, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
