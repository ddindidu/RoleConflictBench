You seemed distant this morning.\u201d Guilt tugs at me. She expects me to open up, to share what\u2019s weighing on me, just as she does. I want to be present for her, to listen and be honest about the stress I\u2019ve been carrying from work. But as the train slows, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice comes through, asking for directions to the hospital. My job demands my full attention\u2014passenger safety comes first, and I\u2019m expected to be calm, clear, and helpful. My mind races, torn between the urge to text my wife back right away, to reassure her, and the responsibility to focus on the train and the passengers relying on me.
