He chatters about his day, but my mind is elsewhere\u2014at the office, where a new safety standard is about to take effect. My manager\u2019s email flashes in my memory: \u201cWe need documentation of compliance before the release. No exceptions.\u201d I know the team is waiting for my report, and the deadline is tonight. \n\nSuddenly, my brother darts ahead, chasing a stray soccer ball into the street. My heart leaps, and I call out, grabbing his arm just in time. He laughs, oblivious to the danger, but I can\u2019t shake the anxiety. I\u2019m supposed to keep him safe, to be present, but my phone buzzes with reminders and questions from work. I feel torn\u2014my brother needs my attention, but so does my team. Both roles demand vigilance, responsibility, and care, but I can\u2019t give my full self to either. As we continue walking, I wrestle with the impossible choice: do I focus on my brother\u2019s safety, or do I step aside to ensure my engineering responsibilities are met?"}
