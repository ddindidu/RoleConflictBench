My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that the kids need clean clothes for school tomorrow, and we promised to split the chores this week. I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done tonight. But my phone buzzes\u2014an urgent message from the nursing home. Mrs. Carter, who just had surgery, is struggling more than expected. They\u2019re short-staffed, and she needs someone gentle and patient to help her move and get dressed for bed. I know how much she relies on me, how anxious she gets with unfamiliar faces. My chest tightens as I look from the laundry to my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expects me to be present, to keep our home running smoothly. My patients expect me to be reliable, compassionate, and attentive. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both need me right now. My hands tremble as I try to decide which role to step into, knowing that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
