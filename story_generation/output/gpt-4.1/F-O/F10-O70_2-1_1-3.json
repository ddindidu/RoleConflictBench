It was Sunday evening\u2014time for my weekly call with Mom and Dad. I could already picture Mom waiting by the phone, eager to hear about my week, and Dad ready with his usual questions about my health and work. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved out. But as I glanced at the package in my hand, I noticed the address matched the house with the tricky front steps and the neighbor\u2019s dog that sometimes wandered over. The delivery instructions were clear: leave the package out of sight and send a photo confirmation. If I delayed, I risked missing the delivery window and possibly losing my job. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mom this time, asking if I was okay. I stood on the porch, torn between answering her call and making sure the package was safe. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, and I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me as I hesitated, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible delivery person."}
