My stepmother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis year, you must help us prepare for the festival. It\u2019s important to your father.\u201d I knew what she meant\u2014my presence, my effort, would prove I belonged, that I respected their traditions. But my phone buzzed with another reminder from my project manager: \u201cPrototype demo in two days. Stakeholders need to see progress.\u201d The pressure was mounting. I was supposed to be the reliable engineer, the one who could deliver under tight deadlines. Yet, as the festival approached, my family\u2019s expectations grew louder, their glances sharper.
