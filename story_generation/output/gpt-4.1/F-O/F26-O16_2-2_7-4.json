My daughter had just texted me about her new job\u2014her excitement practically leapt off the screen. She wanted to call, to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I celebrated these milestones with her. At the same time, my pager buzzed insistently. Down the hall, a patient and her anxious husband waited for me. She\u2019d just been diagnosed with diabetes, and I could already picture the questions in their eyes, the need for reassurance and clear guidance. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in: the loving grandparent who should be present and attentive, the compassionate doctor who must offer comfort and clarity. My heart tugged in both directions, guilt and responsibility swirling together as I stared at the phone, torn between the family I cherished and the patients who depended on me."}
