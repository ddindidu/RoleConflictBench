I kept an eye on him, like Mom always asked, making sure he didn\u2019t dart into the road or get too close to the curb. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my foreman. There was a spill at the site, right in the main walkway, and I was the closest one. He needed me to get there and clean it up before someone slipped. My mind raced. If I left my brother to hurry to the site, he\u2019d have to walk the last few blocks alone, and I\u2019d be breaking the promise I made to always look out for him. But if I stayed with him, the spill could cause an accident at work, and I\u2019d be letting my crew down. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, my steps slowing as I tried to figure out what to do."}
