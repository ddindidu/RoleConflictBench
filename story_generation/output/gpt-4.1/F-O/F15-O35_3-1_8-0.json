Two months left, and every shift I take is a step toward keeping our home. As a parent, I can\u2019t afford to slip up\u2014my family depends on me to keep the roof over our heads. But right now, I\u2019m standing in the subway cab, the clock ticking down to departure. The routine pre-departure check of the train\u2019s non-critical systems is due, and though it\u2019s not urgent, skipping it could mean risking passenger safety or a delay, which my supervisor would not tolerate. My mind races: if I rush the check, I might miss something important, but if I take too long, I could be late, and that could mean a warning or even a docked pay. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s security on one side, the safety and punctuality of hundreds of commuters on the other. My hands tremble as I reach for the checklist, torn between doing what\u2019s best for my family and what\u2019s right for my job."}
