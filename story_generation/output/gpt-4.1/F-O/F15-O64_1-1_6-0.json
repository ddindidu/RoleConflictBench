My mind drifts to the promise I made to my son last week\u2014if I worked extra shifts, I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about. He\u2019s been counting down the days, his excitement bubbling over every morning before school. I want to see that joy on his face, to keep my word, to be the parent he believes I am. But as a cashier, every dollar matters. I know the numbers in my bank account, the bills waiting at home, and the pressure to process each transaction without error. A customer approaches, and I force a smile, scanning their groceries while my thoughts race. Can I really afford the Nintendo? If I buy it, will I be short for rent? My hands move automatically, but my heart is heavy, torn between the promise I made and the reality of my paycheck. The line grows, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding an answer I\u2019m not sure I have."}
