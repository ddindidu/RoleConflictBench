My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren were looking forward to our afternoon together. I could already hear their laughter echoing in my mind, see their eager faces as they ran into my arms. But as I wiped my hands, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was my turn to check the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit before the next shift. The station was only ten minutes away, but the task was meticulous\u2014every bandage, every vial, every expiration date had to be checked. My supervisor expected nothing less; lives depended on our readiness. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family needed me present, warm, and attentive. My team needed me thorough, focused, and reliable. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, apron in the other, my heart torn between the laughter waiting at home and the silent responsibility waiting at the station."}
