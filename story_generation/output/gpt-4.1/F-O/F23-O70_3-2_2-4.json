My heart sank as I listened to the voicemail: my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in immediately to discuss what happened. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to prove I was there for the tough moments, not just the easy ones. But as I sat in my delivery van, I glanced at the stack of packages behind me. One was marked \u201csignature required\u201d\u2014a moderately valuable item, and my supervisor had been clear: no missed signatures, no exceptions. The customer was waiting at the far end of my route, and if I delayed, I\u2019d risk a complaint or even disciplinary action. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the urgent call to parenthood and the pressing demands of my job. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to drop everything for them. My mind raced, caught in the impossible space between being the parent my stepson needed and the reliable worker my job demanded."}
