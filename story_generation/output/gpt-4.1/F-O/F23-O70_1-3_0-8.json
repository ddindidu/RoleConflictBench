It was almost three, and I was supposed to pick up Mia and Lucas from school. Their mom had reminded me twice this morning\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t be late, it\u2019s their last day!\u201d I wanted to be there, to show them I cared, to prove I could be counted on. But my phone buzzed again. Another message from Mrs. Patel, my delivery customer. Her package was delayed, and she was getting anxious. \u201cWhere is my order? I need it today!\u201d she wrote, her tone growing sharper with each text. I tried to type a polite, reassuring reply, but my mind was split. If I left now, I\u2019d risk upsetting Mrs. Patel and maybe even my job. If I stayed to sort out the delivery, I\u2019d let down Mia and Lucas\u2014again. My hands trembled on the steering wheel, torn between the voices of my family and my work, both expecting me to be present, reliable, and understanding. I stared at the school\u2019s address on my GPS, then at the delivery app flashing red. I took a shaky breath, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
