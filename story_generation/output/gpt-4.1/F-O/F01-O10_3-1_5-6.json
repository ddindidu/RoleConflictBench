My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you come over? Mom\u2019s not feeling well, and the kids are worried.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew my family needed me, especially now. I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, waiting for comfort and reassurance.\n\nBut just as I stood to grab my coat, an email notification popped up. It was from one of our key vendors\u2014a standard automated confirmation of the payment I\u2019d processed yesterday. Company policy required a prompt, formal reply to maintain our professional relationship. I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of timely communication with clients and vendors.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. My family expected my presence and support, but my role as an accountant demanded immediate attention to business correspondence. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and I felt caught between two worlds, each pulling me in a different direction."}
