The bright red circle around \u201cOpen Class \u2013 10:00 AM\u201d glared at me, a reminder of my promise to my daughter. She had been practicing her lines for weeks, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I could almost hear her voice now, full of expectation. But my laptop screen pulled me back\u2014emails from my co-authors, the journal\u2019s submission portal blinking with urgency. The deadline was noon, and the final datasets still needed my review. My team was counting on me; the culmination of months of research depended on my accuracy and attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the guilt of possibly letting down my child and the anxiety of failing my colleagues. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the classroom where my daughter would search for my face and the lab where my reputation was on the line. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, caught between two lives that demanded all of me at once."}
