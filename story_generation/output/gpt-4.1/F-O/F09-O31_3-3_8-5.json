As a mother, I know the home loan repayment is looming\u2014just two months away. Every overtime shift, every late night, is for my family\u2019s security, to keep a roof over my children\u2019s heads. I promised them stability, and I can\u2019t let them down. But the radio crackles, urgent: a violent assault is unfolding downtown, bystanders screaming for help. As a police officer, I\u2019m sworn to protect them, to run toward danger when others run away. My heart pounds with the knowledge that if I respond, I\u2019ll miss the extra shift at the station tonight\u2014the one that would help cover the loan. If I don\u2019t, innocent people could be hurt. The demands of both worlds pull me apart, my duty to my family clashing with my oath to the public. I can feel the tears threatening, the pressure mounting, as I sit at the intersection, torn between two roads, each demanding everything from me."}
