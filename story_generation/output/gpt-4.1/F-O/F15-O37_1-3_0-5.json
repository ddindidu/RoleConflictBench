My shift as a housekeeping cleaner was almost over, but as I opened the supply cabinet, my stomach dropped. The specialized cleaner for the marble floors was gone\u2014completely out. My client expected the floors to be spotless before their guests arrived tonight, and I knew how important it was to keep up my reputation for thoroughness. I could run to the store, but that would take at least half an hour.\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school\u2014early dismissal today.\u201d My children would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I could picture their disappointment if I was late, the way their shoulders would slump, the questions in their eyes. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My client\u2019s expectations and my children\u2019s needs collided in my mind, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, cleaning list in the other, caught between being the reliable parent and the dependable cleaner."}
