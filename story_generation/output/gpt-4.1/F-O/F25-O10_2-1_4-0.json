As an accountant, I knew the quarterly filing was non-negotiable\u2014every number had to be perfect, every document in order. The deadline loomed, and my supervisor had already reminded me twice about the importance of accuracy and timeliness. But my phone buzzed again, a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family tradition dinner. It\u2019s important to your father and me that you\u2019re there. We\u2019re counting on you.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My family had been talking for weeks about reviving old customs, making it clear that my presence was a sign of respect and belonging. I wanted to honor that, to show them I cared about being part of this family. But the numbers on my screen wouldn\u2019t wait, and neither would my boss\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the duty to my work and the longing to fit in with my family. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which one I could bear to let down."}
