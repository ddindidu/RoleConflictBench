My manager\u2019s voice was in my ear, reminding me that even minor glitches could erode user trust. I was halfway through explaining my plan for a fix when I glanced out the window and saw my younger brother, phone in hand, stepping off the curb without looking. My heart jumped. I knew I should shout, run outside, do something\u2014anything\u2014to keep him safe. But my team was waiting, watching my cursor hover over the problematic line of code. If I left now, I\u2019d disrupt the meeting and delay the fix, letting down my colleagues and risking another round of complaints. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring the instinct to protect my brother, the expectation that I\u2019d always look out for him. My mind raced, torn between the urgent pull of family and the professional responsibility pressing in from my screen."}
