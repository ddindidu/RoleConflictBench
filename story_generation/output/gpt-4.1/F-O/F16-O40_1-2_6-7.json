My spouse poured us both some tea, their eyes searching mine for connection. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d they asked, voice gentle, expecting more than the usual one-word answer. I knew they wanted me to open up, to share the frustrations and small victories of my work, to let them in. But my phone buzzed, a message from a homeowner whose deck was splintered and unsafe. They needed it fixed before the weekend, and I was the only one available. My mind raced with measurements, wood types, and the urgency of the repair. I wanted to be present, to talk honestly with my spouse, but the weight of the job pressed on me. I felt torn, caught between the expectation to communicate openly at home and the responsibility to restore someone\u2019s safe space. My spouse waited, hopeful, as I struggled to find the right words, my thoughts split between the warmth of our kitchen and the cold, broken boards waiting for me elsewhere."}
