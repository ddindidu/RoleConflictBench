My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, reminding me that the kids needed clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I nodded, feeling the weight of the expectation\u2014this was my turn to handle the laundry, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. But my phone buzzed with a message from the site manager: \u201cWe need you here early. Tool inspection before we start the framing.\u201d As a carpenter, I knew how crucial it was to check every saw and drill, to make sure nothing would put anyone at risk. The thought of skipping the inspection made my stomach twist with anxiety; safety was non-negotiable. Yet, the sight of my family\u2019s overflowing laundry basket tugged at me just as hard. I could feel the tension building inside, torn between the promise I made at home and the responsibility I carried at work."}
