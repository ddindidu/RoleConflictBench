Her eyes were wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share the lessons I\u2019d gathered over the years, but my work phone chimed insistently. A customer was calling, upset about a delayed package. I could hear the frustration in their voice as I answered, trying to sound calm and professional, but my mind was split. My granddaughter waited, hope flickering in her eyes, while the customer demanded answers I didn\u2019t have. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me desperate to be the wise, attentive grandparent she needed, the other bound by the expectation to resolve the delivery issue with patience and courtesy. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once."}
