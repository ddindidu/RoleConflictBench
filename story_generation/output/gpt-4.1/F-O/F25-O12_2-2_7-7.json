My phone buzzed with another Slack notification\u2014QA had flagged a critical bug, and users were already complaining about intermittent errors. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need this fixed ASAP.\u201d I stared at the error logs, my mind racing through possible causes, but my concentration kept slipping. From the living room, I could hear my stepdad sigh, the sound heavy and tired. My mom\u2019s voice was softer than usual, her laughter missing from the background. I knew they\u2019d both had a rough week at work, and I could feel the tension in the air every time I left my room. I wanted to close my laptop, go sit with them, and just listen\u2014be the support they needed. But the pressure from work was relentless, and I felt torn in two directions. My parents needed me to be present, to show I cared, but my team needed me to be reliable, to solve problems fast. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which role to answer first."}
