My husband\u2019s messages kept coming\u2014he was having another rough morning, and I knew he needed me. He\u2019d barely slept, and his words were heavy with worry. I wanted nothing more than to step outside, call him, and just listen, reassure him that I was here, that he wasn\u2019t alone. But just then, the salon door swung open. The bride-to-be and her friends spilled in, all nerves and excitement, chattering about timelines and makeup. They were early, and I could see the tension in their faces.
