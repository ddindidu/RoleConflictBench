My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d Guilt prickles at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, and I see the fatigue in their eyes. But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder for the pharmacy workshop tonight, the one on new prescription guidelines. Missing it means falling behind, risking mistakes at work, letting down my patients and my boss. I know how important it is to stay sharp, to keep up with the changes. But I also know how much my partner needs me here, how the little things like laundry add up. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations: the professional who must always be competent, the spouse who must always be present. I glance between the laundry and my phone, feeling the pressure build, wishing I could split myself in two."}
