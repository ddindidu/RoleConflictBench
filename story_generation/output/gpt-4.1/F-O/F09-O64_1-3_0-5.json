My heart thudded as I glanced at the line of customers, each with carts piled high. I knew I should be locking my drawer soon, counting every bill and coin, double-checking the deposit slip, and waiting for the manager to sign off. Store policy was clear: no shortcuts, no early departures, especially with large sums. But my phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014a reminder that today was early dismissal. My children would be waiting at the curb, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there on time. I imagined their disappointment if I was late, the worry in their eyes. Yet, if I rushed the deposit or left before the process was complete, I\u2019d risk my job and break the trust my manager placed in me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the rules of my workplace and the needs of my children, unsure which demand to answer first."}
