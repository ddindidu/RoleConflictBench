I listen intently, mind racing through possible diagnoses, but nothing fits neatly. I know I need to focus, to ask the right questions, to order the right tests. But the phone vibrates again. I know it\u2019s my mother; we talk every evening, and she worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly. She expects me to share how my day went, to reassure her that I\u2019m okay. I feel the weight of her expectation, the comfort she finds in our routine. Yet, right now, my patient needs my full attention. I can\u2019t split myself in two, but both roles demand it. My heart aches with guilt\u2014if I answer, I risk missing a crucial detail in Mrs. Lee\u2019s case; if I ignore the call, I know my mother will worry, imagining the worst. The phone buzzes again, and I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the child my mother needs and the doctor my patient depends on."}
