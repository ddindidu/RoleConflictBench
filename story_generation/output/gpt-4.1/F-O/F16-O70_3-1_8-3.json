My spouse had just texted, \u201cCan we talk tonight? It\u2019s important.\u201d We\u2019d been dancing around the topic of our mounting bills, and I knew tonight was the night for honesty. I promised myself I\u2019d be open, that I\u2019d listen and share everything, no matter how uncomfortable. But as I pulled up to the next house on my delivery route, my work phone buzzed. \u201cUrgent: Customer requests package be handed directly to recipient. No doorstep drop-offs.\u201d I stared at the empty porch, knowing the customer wasn\u2019t home. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cNo exceptions. Secure every delivery.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My spouse needed my full attention and honesty, but my job demanded I follow strict protocol, even if it meant running late or risking a complaint. I stood there, package in hand, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the rules I had to follow at work, anxiety twisting in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
