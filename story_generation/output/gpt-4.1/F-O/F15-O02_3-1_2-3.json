We request your presence to discuss the matter.\u201d I knew I had to be there for my child, to understand what happened, to show the school I took this seriously. But as I reached for my phone to call my manager, another notification popped up\u2014a reminder about the upcoming safety audit at work. As the lead engineer, I was expected to ensure every document was flawless, every standard met. The audit was still weeks away, but I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d review the new compliance checklist today, and they were waiting for my feedback.

I could feel the anxiety rising, torn between the urgent call of family and the steady, relentless demands of my profession."}
