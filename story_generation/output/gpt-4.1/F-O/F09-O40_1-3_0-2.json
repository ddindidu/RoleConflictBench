The school bell would ring in twenty minutes, and my kids would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there\u2014today was the last day before summer break, and they\u2019d been talking about it all week. But as I set the hammer down, I noticed the frayed cord on the power saw, the dull edge of the chisel, the clutter of nails scattered across the bench. The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Inspect everything before you start.\u201d If I left now, the tools wouldn\u2019t be ready, and the risk of an accident tomorrow would be on me. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014my children\u2019s eager faces, the silent demand of the jobsite. I stood frozen, torn between the safety of my crew and the promise I made to my kids, feeling the pressure of two lives pulling me in opposite directions."}
