Dad\u2019s voice was softer than usual, and I caught him staring out the window, lost in thought. They\u2019d always been my anchors, but lately, they seemed adrift, weighed down by worries they tried to hide. I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer comfort\u2014be the daughter they needed right now.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the machines at work. The planned shutdown was next week, and I was responsible for the maintenance. If I missed a step, the whole line could stall, costing the company time and money. My supervisor had reminded me twice already: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my parents needing me at home, my team relying on me at work. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which role to answer first."}
