It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. She never reached out like this unless something was really weighing on her. I glanced at the clock\u2014my next client, Mrs. Lee, was due any minute. She\u2019d just come from the gym, and I knew she\u2019d expect her hair to be washed and conditioned before her usual trim. She always insisted on a thorough wash, especially when her hair was greasy.\n\nI could already picture Mrs. Lee\u2019s disappointed face if I was distracted or late. But my granddaughter\u2019s words echoed in my mind. She needed me, not just as a relative, but as someone who could offer guidance and comfort. I felt torn\u2014my hands were needed in two places at once, and both roles demanded my full attention. The weight of being a reliable professional and a loving grandfather pressed down on me, and I stood there, towel in hand, caught between the needs of my family and my client."}
