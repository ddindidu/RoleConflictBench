But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: \u201cLab safety audit tomorrow.\u201d My heart tightened. The equipment in my lab had been acting up, and the last inspection had already flagged a few issues. If I didn\u2019t stay late tonight to recalibrate and double-check everything, I risked not only failing the audit but also endangering my colleagues.
