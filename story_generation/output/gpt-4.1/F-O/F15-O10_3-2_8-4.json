As an accountant, the company\u2019s quarterly tax filing was looming, and I knew every number had to be perfect. The deadline was next week, and my manager expected nothing less than flawless compliance. But as a parent, my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment due in two months. I needed to review our family budget, cut unnecessary expenses, and maybe even pick up extra work to ensure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. My partner was counting on me to keep us afloat, to make sure our kids never felt the weight of financial uncertainty. The pressure from both sides pressed in\u2014my professional integrity on one hand, my family\u2019s security on the other. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, persistent needs of my home."}
