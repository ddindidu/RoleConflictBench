The radio crackles\u2014there\u2019s a minor signal delay ahead. I need to adjust my speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost time. My passengers depend on me to get them to work safely and on schedule. But my mind drifts to home, to the laundry basket overflowing in the hallway. My husband texted earlier, asking if I could handle the laundry today so our daughter has clean clothes for her field trip tomorrow. I promised I would, but my shift ends late, and I know the machines will be waiting for me, humming their endless cycle. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014here, I must be vigilant and precise, but at home, I\u2019m expected to share the load, to be present and responsible. The train slows as I approach the signal, and I feel the tug of guilt and frustration, torn between the tracks beneath me and the home that needs me just as much."}
