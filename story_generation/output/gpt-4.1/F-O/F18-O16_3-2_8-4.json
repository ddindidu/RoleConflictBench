Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him on the other side of the street, waving at me, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart leapt\u2014my instinct as his sibling screamed at me to shout, to run, to do anything to keep him safe. At the same moment, my patient\u2019s mother tugged at my sleeve, her eyes wide and anxious. \u201cDoctor, can you explain again what this means for my son\u2019s future?\u201d she pleaded, her voice trembling. I knew she needed my full attention, my calm and clear explanation, my empathy. But my brother was already in motion, and I could see the traffic light changing. My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect my brother and the responsibility to support my patient\u2019s family. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my immediate presence, each expecting me to be everything they needed in that moment."}
