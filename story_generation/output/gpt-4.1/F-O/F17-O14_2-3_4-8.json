I knew how much it meant to her, to all of us, especially after the recent reminders about keeping our customs alive. But as I glanced at my phone, a notification from the lab flashed urgently: \u201cWarning\u2014containment breach risk. Immediate attention required.\u201d My heart pounded. As a scientist, I was responsible for the safety of everyone in the building. Ignoring the alert could mean disaster, but leaving now would mean letting my family down, breaking a promise to honor our heritage. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, my mind racing between the warmth of home and the cold, sterile lab.
