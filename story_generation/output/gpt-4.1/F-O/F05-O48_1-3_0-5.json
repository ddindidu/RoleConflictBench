My wife sighed as she recounted her day, her voice soft but tired. She didn\u2019t ask for much\u2014just a listening ear, a gentle word, maybe a hug. I wanted to be present, to reassure her that her feelings mattered, that I was here for her. But my phone buzzed again, the hospital\u2019s number flashing on the screen. My patient was in critical condition tonight, and I was responsible for checking their vitals every few minutes. Missing even one reading could mean missing a sign of decline. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my wife\u2019s need for comfort and my patient\u2019s need for vigilance. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my heart torn by the impossibility of being fully present in both places at once."}
