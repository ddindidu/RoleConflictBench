Months of planning, grant writing, and late nights had led to this moment. Missing it would mean waiting another six months, maybe more, and possibly losing funding. My mind raced with protocols and hypotheses, but then I heard my son\u2019s voice from the living room, excitedly reminding me about the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. He\u2019d been saving up, counting the days, and I\u2019d told him we\u2019d go together to pick it out this weekend. I knew how much it meant to him, how he\u2019d been telling his friends, how he looked at me with trust and expectation. But the experiment required my full attention\u2014preparation, calibration, and long hours in the lab. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to provide and be present as a father, and the relentless demands of my scientific work. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
