The bug report from QA blinked on my screen\u2014a minor UI glitch, nothing urgent, but the team expected a quick fix. I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to keep the user experience smooth. As I scrolled through lines of code, I caught a glimpse of my granddaughter shuffling past the doorway, her shoulders slumped, eyes downcast. She\u2019d been quiet all morning, and I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her. My heart ached to reach out, to offer the kind of comfort only a grandparent could give, to share a story or a gentle word that might help her find her way. But the bug report nagged at me, the expectation to be reliable and responsive tugging me back to the screen. I felt torn, caught between the urge to close my laptop and be present for her, and the pressure to fulfill my responsibilities as a developer. The two worlds collided in that moment, and I sat there, wrestling with which role needed me more."}
