My shift as a nursing assistant was almost over, but Mrs. Lee, my patient, was gripping my hand tightly. She\u2019d just come out of surgery this morning, and now her eyes darted around the room, searching for reassurance. \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer?\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I glanced at my phone\u2014my children would be waiting outside their school in fifteen minutes, expecting me to be there, like always, to greet them with a smile and ask about their day. I could picture their faces, scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. But here was Mrs. Lee, needing comfort, her family hours away.

The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the pull of home and the call of care, not knowing which way to turn."}
