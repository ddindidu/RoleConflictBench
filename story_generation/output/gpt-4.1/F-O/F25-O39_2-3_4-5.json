My mind was still replaying the conversation from last night\u2014my stepmother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s traditions, especially now, with the holidays approaching. She wanted me to be respectful, to speak softly, to never raise my voice in public, just as my late father had always insisted.\n\nBut here, on the site, things were different. Safety was everything. We\u2019d just finished hoisting a heavy beam, and I caught sight of Marco, distracted, about to walk right under the load. My heart pounded. I knew what I had to do\u2014shout, loud and sharp, to stop him. But the words caught in my throat. I could almost hear my stepmother\u2019s disappointment if she saw me now, yelling in front of everyone, breaking the calm she valued so much. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which voice to listen to as the seconds ticked by."}
