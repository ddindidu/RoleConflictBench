My little sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen, her message full of exclamation points: \u201cI got the scholarship! Come celebrate with us\u2014just for a bit?\u201d My heart swelled with pride. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for her big moments. But the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, calling us in. The new operational procedures were non-negotiable\u2014missing the briefing could mean disciplinary action, or worse, putting passengers at risk.
