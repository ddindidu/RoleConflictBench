The family would arrive soon, laughter and stories waiting to be shared. My heart fluttered with anticipation\u2014I cherished these rare gatherings, the chance to be the grandmother who listens, hugs, and spoils her grandchildren. But my phone buzzed, a reminder of my shift as a telemarketer. The script was open on the table, and I knew the routine: answer questions, handle objections, keep the calls moving. Most days, it was easy, but today, every ring felt like a wedge between me and my family. My supervisor expected me to be available, to not miss a call, especially when the customers were in a good mood. I could hear my grandson\u2019s giggle from the living room, and my chest tightened. Should I slip away to my home office and put on my headset, or stay and savor these fleeting moments? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction."}
