I knew I should reach out, ask her what was wrong, and share my own worries from the hospital. We\u2019d always promised to be open with each other, to talk through our burdens. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the hospital. A patient\u2019s family was waiting for me, desperate for answers, and I had to find the right words to explain a diagnosis that would shatter their world. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations: to be the supportive husband who listens and shares, and the compassionate doctor who delivers painful truths with empathy. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the person my wife needed at home and the professional my patients needed at the hospital. I looked at her, then at my phone, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
