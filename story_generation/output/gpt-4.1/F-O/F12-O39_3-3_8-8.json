We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about how we\u2019d manage if I took on more shifts. He looked at me, waiting for answers, for honesty, for the kind of open communication we promised each other. My phone buzzed\u2014work. I was on call today. Suddenly, the site-wide evacuation alarm blared through the speaker. Protocol was clear: drop everything, get to the muster point, no exceptions. My team depended on me to be there, to follow the rules, to keep everyone safe. But my husband\u2019s eyes were searching mine, needing reassurance, needing me to stay and talk. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds\u2014one demanding my presence and trust, the other my responsibility and discipline. I felt torn, the expectations of wife and worker pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent, each impossible to ignore."}
