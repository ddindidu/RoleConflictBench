My wife greeted me with a tired smile, mentioning offhand that her day at work had been rough\u2014her boss had been critical, and a project had gone sideways. I could see the tension in her eyes, the way she lingered in the kitchen, waiting for me to ask more, to listen, to comfort her. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was the hospital\u2014Mrs. Patel, my patient, had just received news of her chronic illness. Her daughter was on the line, anxious and confused, needing me to explain the diagnosis and next steps with patience and clarity. I stood in the hallway, torn. My wife needed me to be present, to offer the support only a husband could give. But my patient and her family needed my expertise and compassion as their doctor. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, unsure which need to answer first."}
