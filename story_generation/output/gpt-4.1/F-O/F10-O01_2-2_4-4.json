They\u2019d spoken passionately about the importance of keeping our family\u2019s traditions alive, especially now, with so much changing in the world. As their daughter, I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014Sunday dinners, the annual family gathering, the rituals that had shaped my childhood. But as an architect, I was under pressure to deliver a design that prioritized efficiency and modern needs, not nostalgia. The client wanted open spaces, flexible workstations, and minimal private offices\u2014nothing like the compartmentalized, closed-off rooms my family believed fostered closeness and continuity. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother, reminding me about the upcoming family event. At the same time, my supervisor\u2019s email popped up, asking for revisions to make the layout even more open. I stared at the plans, feeling the tension knot in my chest, torn between honoring my family\u2019s values and meeting the demands of my profession."}
