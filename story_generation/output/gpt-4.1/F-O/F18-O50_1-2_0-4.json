She had her final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much it meant to her. I wanted to be there, to sit with her, listen, maybe make her some tea\u2014anything to help her feel less alone. But my phone buzzed with another alert from the factory: the machines were running hot, overdue for maintenance. If I didn\u2019t get there soon, we could be looking at a costly breakdown, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. My supervisor had already reminded me twice this week about the importance of keeping everything running smoothly. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My sister needed me, but so did the machines\u2014and both expected me to be the one who wouldn\u2019t let them down. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
