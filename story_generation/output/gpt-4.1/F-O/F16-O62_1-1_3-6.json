The basket has been sitting there for days, and I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight. I can almost hear my partner\u2019s voice, gentle but tired, reminding me that we\u2019re in this together. But as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes\u2014a text from the pool manager. They\u2019re short-staffed, and swimmers have been sneaking into the shallow end without supervision. I know the rules: as a lifeguard, I\u2019m responsible for their safety, and if something happens, it\u2019s on me. My heart pounds as I look from the laundry to my lifeguard uniform hanging by the door. I feel torn, pulled by the need to be a reliable partner at home and the duty to keep people safe at work. Both roles matter, but right now, I can\u2019t see how to meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
