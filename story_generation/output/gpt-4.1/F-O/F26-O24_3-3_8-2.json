My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, telling me that my grandson was in trouble\u2014something serious, something that needed me. My heart clenched; I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance as any grandparent should. But as I hung up, my clerk rushed in, breathless, waving an emergency motion. A restraining order, urgent, demanding my immediate attention. The law required me to be impartial, thorough, and swift. I stared at the files, feeling the weight of justice pressing on my shoulders, while my mind kept drifting to my family, to the pain in my daughter\u2019s voice. Both worlds pulled at me, each expecting my full devotion, and I sat frozen, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to the law, knowing I could not give both what they needed from me in this moment."}
