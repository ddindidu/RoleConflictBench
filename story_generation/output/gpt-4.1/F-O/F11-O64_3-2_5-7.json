Mom says you have to be there.\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. Family holidays were sacred, and I was expected to be present, laughing and sharing stories, not just physically but emotionally too. But as I looked up, the line at my register stretched past the bakery. My manager had already reminded me twice to keep things moving and stay cheerful\u2014customers expected a smile, a little small talk, even when the store was packed. I forced a grin for the next shopper, scanning items and making change, but my mind kept drifting to my family, probably already packing the car, waiting for me. The pressure built in my chest, torn between the warmth of family and the demands of my job. I could feel my patience thinning, my smile faltering, as I wrestled with the impossible choice: disappoint my family or let down my team and the customers counting on me."}
