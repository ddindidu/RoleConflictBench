I knew how much it meant to them, to all of us, to try and feel like a real family. But as I looked up from my phone, the blinking red light on the lab\u2019s safety panel caught my eye. The safety audit was tomorrow morning, and I\u2019d just found a calibration error in one of the centrifuges. If I left now, I\u2019d be risking a failed audit, which could shut down our research for weeks. My supervisor had made it clear: \u201cNo mistakes, not this time.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family expecting me at the table, my lab expecting me to keep everything running smoothly. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
