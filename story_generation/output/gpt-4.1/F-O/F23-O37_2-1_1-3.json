The list of cleaning supplies I needed to check off was half-finished, and I knew the manager would be upset if I didn\u2019t submit the inventory by noon. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cOpen Class, 10:30 AM.\u201d My stepdaughter had been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on like the other parents. I could almost hear her voice, \u201cWill you come this time?\u201d The guilt twisted in my stomach. I wanted to be the supportive step-parent she deserved, but the thought of leaving the cleaning unfinished\u2014and risking my job\u2014made my chest tighten. The mop handle felt heavy in my grip as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of my boss and the silent plea in my stepdaughter\u2019s eyes. I stared at the clock again, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to move."}
