My husband just reminded me that our daughter needs her soccer uniform clean for tomorrow, and I promised I\u2019d take care of it. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a Slack notification\u2014QA has flagged a minor UI glitch that\u2019s been popping up for some users. It\u2019s not critical, but my manager expects quick turnarounds, and I know I could fix it in half an hour if I just sit down at my laptop. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to keep our home running smoothly, to be a reliable partner, and the unspoken pressure to be the responsive, dependable developer my team counts on. My mind races, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the glow of my screen, knowing that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
