My training kicked in, every second mattered. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night, harsh words exchanged, and I\u2019d promised to call him today to talk things through, to rebuild the trust we\u2019d always shared. I knew he was waiting, probably hurting, expecting me to reach out and make things right.\n\nBut now, as sirens wailed and the city blurred past, my duty as an ambulance driver demanded my full attention. The patient\u2019s life depended on my focus, my skill, my presence.
