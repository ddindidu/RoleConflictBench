My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the relatives would arrive in just a few hours. The house was only half-ready, and I\u2019d promised to help with the last-minute cleaning. But my phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed now, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. As a lifeguard, I knew the risk\u2014one overlooked detail could mean someone\u2019s health, or worse. My spouse expected me to be present, to share the load and make our home welcoming. My job demanded I act immediately, to prevent a potential hazard. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, my mind racing between the image of my partner\u2019s disappointed face and the thought of swimmers unknowingly diving into danger. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the mop in my hand and the keys to my car."}
