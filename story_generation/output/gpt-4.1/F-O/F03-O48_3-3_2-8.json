I knew it was my mom\u2014she always expected a quick reply, especially since Dad\u2019s surgery last month. We had a routine: I\u2019d text her updates about my day, and she\u2019d share how things were at home. But right now, I was sitting beside Mrs. Carter, a patient who had just learned her cancer had returned. She was sobbing, clutching my hand, her eyes searching mine for comfort. My supervisor always said that being present, truly present, was the most important part of my job. I could feel the weight of Mrs. Carter\u2019s grief, and I wanted to be there for her, to offer the support she needed. But my phone kept vibrating, each buzz a reminder of my parents\u2019 need for reassurance, their expectation that I\u2019d always be there, even from afar. My heart pounded as I stared at the unread messages, torn between the family who raised me and the patient who needed me right now."}
