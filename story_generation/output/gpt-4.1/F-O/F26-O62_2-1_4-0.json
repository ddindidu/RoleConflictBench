My daughter called out, her voice bright with excitement, \u201cDad, come over! Jamie has something to tell everyone!\u201d My grandson\u2019s face glowed with anticipation, and I knew this was one of those moments\u2014one of those memories I was supposed to be a part of. But my gaze kept flicking back to the far end of the pool, where a couple of teenagers were drifting closer to the deep end, laughing and splashing. No one seemed in trouble, but I\u2019d been trained to never let my guard down, not even for a second. The family\u2019s laughter and the promise of togetherness tugged at me, but so did the responsibility of every swimmer\u2019s safety. My heart thudded with the weight of both worlds, torn between the call of family and the duty of vigilance, knowing I couldn\u2019t give myself fully to either without letting the other down."}
