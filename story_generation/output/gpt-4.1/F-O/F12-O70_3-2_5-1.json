My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that his parents would arrive in two hours. The house was only half-ready\u2014laundry still in the dryer, floors unswept, and the guest room untouched. I felt the weight of expectation pressing down: everything had to be spotless, welcoming, perfect. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A notification from work: a customer\u2019s groceries needed to be delivered within the next hour, and I was the closest driver. The order was marked urgent\u2014someone\u2019s dinner plans depended on me. I imagined the disappointment on their face if I was late, the possible complaint to my supervisor, the risk to my reliability rating.\n\nI looked around at the mess, then at my phone, feeling my chest tighten. My husband called out, asking if I could help make the beds. I hesitated, torn between the home that needed me and the job that demanded my punctuality. Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my full attention, and I stood frozen, caught in the impossible space between them."}
