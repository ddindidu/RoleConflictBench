She sighs, mentioning her boss\u2019s offhand comment that left her feeling unappreciated. I see the slump in her shoulders, the way she looks at me, hoping for comfort. I want to sit beside her, listen, and reassure her that she\u2019s valued. But my phone buzzes\u2014my break is over. I hurry back to the control room, headset on, eyes scanning the radar. The cloud tops are rising fast, and pilots are calling in, waiting for my instructions. My mind splits: part of me is still at home, wishing I could be the husband she needs right now; the other part is here, responsible for dozens of lives in the sky. My heart pounds as I hear her voice in my memory and the pilots\u2019 voices in my ears, both needing me, both expecting me to be present. I grip the mic, torn, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
