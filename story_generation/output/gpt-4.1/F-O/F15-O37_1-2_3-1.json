As a parent, I knew this was the perfect moment to teach her about cleaning up after herself, about responsibility and respect for our home. I wanted to sit beside her, gently guide her to pick up the crumbs, explain why it mattered, and praise her for every small effort. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I saw the dust gathering on the shelves, the streaks on the windows, and the sticky fingerprints on the table. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery corner spotless, every surface shining.\u201d I felt the pressure to grab my cleaning supplies and tackle the mess myself, to meet the high standards expected of me. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one part urging me to slow down and teach, the other pushing me to clean quickly and thoroughly. I stood there, torn, the vacuum in one hand and my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes on me, unsure which role to answer first."}
