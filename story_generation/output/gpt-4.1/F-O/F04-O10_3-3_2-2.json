The external auditor had emailed, urgently requesting the financial statements for an immediate review. My heart raced\u2014I knew how critical it was to provide accurate records, and any delay could raise suspicion or cause trouble for the company. As I started gathering the files, my phone rang again. It was my younger sister, her voice trembling. She was in tears, saying she needed me right now. She\u2019d always been able to count on me, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there whenever she needed support. But the auditor\u2019s deadline loomed, and my mind spun with the pressure of both roles. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s trust pulling me one way, and my professional responsibility anchoring me the other. My hands shook as I stared at the computer screen, caught between the expectations of being a dependable brother and a diligent accountant, not knowing which demand I could afford to let down."}
