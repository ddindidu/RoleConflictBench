My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an email from the client, asking for a quick estimate on materials so they could approve the design. I mentally ran through the measurements, picturing the wood grain and the joinery, but my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter and the slap of sneakers on tile. My son was darting between aisles, weaving dangerously close to other shoppers. I felt the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for others. At the same time, I knew if I didn\u2019t respond to the client soon, I might lose the job or delay the project. My heart pounded as I gripped the cart, torn between calling my son back and pulling out my phone to send the estimate. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
