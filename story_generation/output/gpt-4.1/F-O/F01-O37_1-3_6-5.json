It was our tradition, a way to bridge the miles and keep our family close. But as I set down my mop in the client\u2019s kitchen, I realized the bottle of specialized cleaner was empty. The next task on my list\u2014removing stubborn stains from the marble countertop\u2014absolutely required it. My supervisor had emphasized, \u201cDon\u2019t skip steps, and never leave a job unfinished.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. If I left to buy the cleaner, I\u2019d miss the family call. If I stayed for the call, I\u2019d fall behind at work and risk disappointing my employer. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family\u2019s voices, the pride in doing my job right. I stood there, phone in one hand, empty bottle in the other, torn between the people who needed me and the work that defined me."}
