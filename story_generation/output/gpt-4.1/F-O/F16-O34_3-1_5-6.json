The living room needed dusting, the guest room sheets had to be changed, and the bathroom was still a mess. I could hear the stress in their voice, and I knew they were counting on me to help make the house perfect. At the same time, my headset crackled with the voice of a fellow air traffic controller. An aircraft was approaching the sector boundary, and I needed to coordinate the handoff to ensure a smooth transition. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands at home and the critical responsibility at work. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which call to answer first, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
