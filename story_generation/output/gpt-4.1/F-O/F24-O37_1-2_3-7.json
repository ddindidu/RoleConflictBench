I wanted to say yes, to be part of the family, to not seem distant or uninterested. But my mind kept drifting to my other job\u2014the one I\u2019d just come from, where I scrubbed floors and sanitized surfaces as a housekeeping cleaner. I remembered the supervisor\u2019s stern warning earlier: \u201cYou must always use gloves and masks, no exceptions. We can\u2019t risk anyone\u2019s health.\u201d I\u2019d noticed some coworkers skipping steps, and I knew I should set an example, especially with flu season starting. But if I joined the family outing, I\u2019d have to rush from work, maybe not even have time to shower or change, and I worried about bringing germs home. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and relax with them, but my job demanded vigilance and strict hygiene. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure how to meet both sets of expectations without letting someone down."}
