I want to show everyone what I made at school!\u201d Her excitement was contagious, and I knew how much these moments meant to her\u2014and to me. But as I glanced around, I noticed crumbs scattered under the coffee table, dust gathering on the shelves, and muddy footprints trailing from the hallway. The house was slipping out of order, and I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that a clean home was my responsibility, that I was trusted to keep everything spotless.\n\nMy daughter called from the kitchen, \u201cDad, can you come join us? We\u2019re all waiting!\u201d I felt the tug of family, the warmth of being present, but the mess gnawed at me. If I ignored it, it would only get worse, and I\u2019d be letting down the trust placed in me as the cleaner. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and stories in the next room, and toward the broom and dustpan leaning against the wall. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation to answer first."}
