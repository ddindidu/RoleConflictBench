He\u2019s waiting, tapping his foot, and I know if I\u2019m slow, the whole crew will be held up. My arms ache, but I push through, trying to keep up with the pace everyone expects. Just as I hoist the next board, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you get a break? Dad seems quiet today.\u201d My chest tightens. I know they count on me to check in, to ask if everything\u2019s okay, to be the one who holds us together at home. But here, I\u2019m just another pair of hands, and if I stop now, I\u2019ll let the team down. I stand there, torn, the weight of the lumber in my arms and the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing on my heart, unsure which burden to set down first."}
