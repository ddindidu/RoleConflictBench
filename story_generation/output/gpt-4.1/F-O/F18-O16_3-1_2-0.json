The words on the screen made my heart drop\u2014he\u2019d just lost his job, and he was spiraling. He needed me, his big sister, the one who always listened and reassured him that things would be okay. I wanted to call him right away, to be the shoulder he could lean on, but just then, my nurse knocked and ushered in my next patient. The woman coughed and sniffled, her chart in my hands. As a doctor, I was expected to focus, to listen carefully, to make sure her symptoms weren\u2019t masking something more serious. But my mind kept drifting to my brother\u2019s pain, the urge to comfort him warring with my duty to this patient. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides\u2014my family needed me, but so did my patient. I took a deep breath, the weight of both roles heavy on my chest, unsure which part of me should come first."}
