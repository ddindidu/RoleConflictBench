Had a rough day.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014she\u2019d be home from school by now, probably sitting on her bed, eyes red, waiting for me to be the big brother she could lean on. But at that moment, the radio crackled with urgency: \u201cWe\u2019ve got an emergency diversion, crossing three sectors. Need immediate coordination.\u201d My headset felt heavier as I juggled the demands in my mind. My team expected me to be sharp, focused, and ready to coordinate with precision\u2014lives depended on it. But my sister needed me, too, and I could almost hear her voice trembling, hoping I\u2019d be there to listen. The weight of both worlds pressed in, each demanding my full attention, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
