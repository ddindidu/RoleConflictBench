He didn\u2019t say much, just a passing comment about a difficult meeting, but I could sense he needed me to be present, to offer comfort and understanding. I wanted to reach out, to ask more, to let him know I was there for him. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my next patient was waiting, a routine check-up, but she always had a list of questions and worries. As a doctor, I knew I needed to be patient, attentive, and clear, to reassure her and address her concerns with empathy. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my husband\u2019s unspoken need for support and my patient\u2019s expectation for my undivided attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving it. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person I loved at home and the person who needed me in my office, unsure which door to open first."}
