The holiday rush was in full swing, and the woman in front of me was growing more agitated with every beep, her voice sharp as she complained about the wait. I forced a smile, trying to stay patient and friendly, even as my phone buzzed in my pocket for the third time. I knew it was my daughter, probably sending another picture of my grandson\u2019s first piano recital\u2014an event I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss, a moment the whole family had gathered to celebrate. My heart ached to be there, to clap and cheer and see his proud little face. But here I was, stuck behind the counter, expected to be the calm, cheerful cashier everyone needed. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, the demands of my job and the pull of my family, each insisting I give them my best. My fingers hovered over the register, my mind torn, not knowing which role to let down."}
