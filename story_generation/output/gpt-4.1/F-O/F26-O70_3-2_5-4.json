My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cMom, please come. We need you.\u201d Something serious was happening at home, and as a grandmother, I knew my family expected me to be there, to comfort, to help, to be the steady presence they could lean on. But as I sat in my delivery van, a moderately valuable package in my hands, I remembered the instructions from my supervisor: \u201cNo exceptions\u2014get a signature for every delivery.\u201d The customer was waiting at the next stop, and if I left now, the package would be unsecured, my job on the line. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds\u2014my family\u2019s urgent need for me, and my responsibility to do my job right. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice, needing reassurance, while at the same time, I pictured the customer\u2019s frustration if I failed to deliver. My hands trembled as I stared at the steering wheel, torn between the two roles that defined me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
