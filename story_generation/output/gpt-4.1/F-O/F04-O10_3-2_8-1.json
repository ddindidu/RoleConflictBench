My phone buzzed again\u2014my younger sister, texting for the third time tonight. She wanted to talk, said she felt I\u2019d been distant lately, and hinted at a misunderstanding from last weekend. I knew I should call her, listen, and clear the air. That\u2019s what a good brother does\u2014communicates, builds trust, and doesn\u2019t let things fester. But the pressure from work was crushing. My manager had made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. The company depended on my accuracy. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. If I called my sister, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk errors. If I ignored her, I\u2019d let our relationship suffer. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between the numbers on my screen and the words I needed to say to my sister."}
