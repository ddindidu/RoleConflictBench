She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to tell her everything\u2014the exhaustion, the pressure, the way my hands still trembled from the adrenaline of the ER. But I hesitated, knowing she expected honesty, openness, a window into my world. At that very moment, my phone buzzed. The hospital. A patient had just arrived with a severe infection, the kind that could turn fatal in hours without the right treatment. As a doctor, I was expected to act fast, prescribe the most effective antibiotics, make life-or-death decisions without delay. My wife\u2019s gaze lingered, waiting for me to share, to be present. My mind raced between the urgent call of the hospital and the quiet plea for connection at home. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, and I sat there, caught in the impossible space between them."}
