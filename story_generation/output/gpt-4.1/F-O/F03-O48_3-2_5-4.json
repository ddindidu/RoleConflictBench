It\u2019s important for the family, for our traditions.\u201d I could almost see her eyes, searching for reassurance that I would not let her down. At the same time, my pager buzzed insistently at my hip. Room 214. Mrs. Carter, fresh out of surgery, her chart showing a slight spike in her blood pressure. I knew I needed to check on her, to record her vitals and make sure she was stable. My supervisor had made it clear: patient safety comes first, no exceptions.
