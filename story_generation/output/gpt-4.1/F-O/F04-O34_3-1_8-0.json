Pre-dawn shifts were usually quiet, and today was no exception\u2014no holding patterns, no congestion, just the occasional blip of a cargo flight. My headset crackled, but it was only routine chatter. I should have felt calm, but my phone buzzed with a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan we talk? I can\u2019t sleep after our fight.\u201d Guilt twisted in my chest. We\u2019d argued last night, harsh words thrown carelessly. I knew he expected me to reach out, to talk things through and rebuild the trust between us. But as an air traffic controller, I was expected to be vigilant, focused, ready for any sudden change in the airspace. My supervisor trusted me to keep the skies safe, even in these quiet hours. I stared at my phone, torn between the duty to my brother and the responsibility of my job. The silence in the tower felt heavier than ever as I wrestled with what to do next."}
