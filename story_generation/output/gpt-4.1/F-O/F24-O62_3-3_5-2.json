The whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder that every second counted. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my stepmom, asking if I was coming to the family holiday picnic. My dad had already called twice, reminding me how important it was to show up, to be part of the family, especially since things were still new between us all. I could picture them setting up the grill, my little stepsister waiting for me to join the games, everyone hoping I\u2019d finally fit in. But here, on this crowded beach, I was the only lifeguard on duty. If I left, even for a short while, I\u2019d be letting down everyone who trusted me to keep them safe. The pressure built inside me\u2014torn between the family that wanted me present and the strangers who needed me vigilant. I stared at the waves, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
