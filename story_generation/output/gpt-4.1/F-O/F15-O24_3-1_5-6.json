I rushed over, my mind racing with the day\u2019s legal arguments and the unopened law review journal waiting on my desk. As a parent, I knew I had to teach Ben about honesty and consequences\u2014this was a moment to instill values, to discipline with care. But as a judge, I felt the tug of professional duty; the new legal theories in that journal could shape my next ruling, and I was already behind on my reading. The store manager looked at me expectantly, Ben\u2019s eyes were wide with fear, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be present for my son, to guide him, but the demands of my profession whispered that I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. My heart pounded as I stood between my child and my calling, torn by the impossible expectations of both."}
