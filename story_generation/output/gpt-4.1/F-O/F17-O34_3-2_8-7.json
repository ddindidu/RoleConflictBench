My headset crackles with voices\u2014colleagues relaying handoffs, pilots requesting new headings, the air thick with urgency as thunderstorm cells force us to reroute flight after flight. My mind is a map of shifting airways, every decision critical. Then my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my mom, her voice trembling. She tells me about Dad\u2019s health scare, how scared she is, how she needs me to listen, to reassure her. I hear the pain in her words, the expectation that I\u2019ll be her anchor. But in my other ear, the radio demands my focus\u2014another flight needs clearance, another controller needs coordination. My heart aches to comfort my mom, to be the child she needs, but my hands hover over the controls, knowing a single lapse could mean disaster. The weight of both worlds presses in, each demanding all of me, and I feel myself pulled apart, desperate not to fail either."}
