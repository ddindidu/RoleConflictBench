My heart pounded as I looked down at the crumpled snack wrapper in his pocket. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. He needed to understand honesty and discipline, and I could see the fear and confusion in his eyes, waiting for my response. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that a medical supply delivery was due at the hospital in less than twenty minutes. As a delivery person, I was expected to be reliable, to ensure that critical supplies reached patients on time. If I delayed, someone\u2019s care could be compromised. I felt torn, caught between my duty to my son and my responsibility to my job. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which demand to answer first."}
