My husband had mentioned this morning that the kids need their uniforms clean for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d take care of it tonight.

I know the news I have to deliver will shatter their world, and they need me to be present, compassionate, and clear. My mind races\u2014my family expects me to be reliable, to share the load at home, but my patients and their loved ones expect me to be their anchor in a storm. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the laundry room and the hospital corridor, knowing that no matter what I choose, someone will be left waiting."}
