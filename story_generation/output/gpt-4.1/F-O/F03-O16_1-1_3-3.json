She\u2019d reminded me, as she always did, that the family expected me home for the annual holiday dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition,\u201d she\u2019d said, her tone gentle but firm. I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I show up, share stories, and uphold the rituals that made us feel like a family. But now, as I faced Mrs. Patel, my patient for a routine check-up, I felt the weight of another expectation. She looked at me, anxious, asking about her test results and what they meant for her future. She needed my full attention, my empathy, my ability to explain things clearly and reassure her. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my brother about the dinner. I felt torn, my mind pulled between the warmth of home and the responsibility in front of me. How could I be the son my family needed and the doctor my patient deserved, all at once? The pressure built inside me, and I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both demands perfectly."}
