I could tell something was off\u2014her eyes kept darting away, her smile forced. As a husband, I knew I should ask, should open up about my own day, and invite her to share what was weighing on her. But my mind kept drifting back to the office, to the building plans I\u2019d reviewed just before leaving. There were small inconsistencies\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to nag at my conscience as an architect. I was expected to ensure every detail was safe, every line compliant. My boss had brushed it off, but I couldn\u2019t. Now, as my wife finally looked up, her lips parting to speak, I felt torn. Should I be present, the attentive husband she needed, or let her in on the stress gnawing at me, risking her worrying even more? My roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the demands of home and the weight of responsibility at work."}
