My daughter had called last night, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. \u201cWe\u2019ll play board games, Grandma!\u201d they\u2019d squealed. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing their eager faces and the warmth of their hugs. But as I poured my coffee, my work phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the compliance system: \u201cScheduled break in 30 minutes. Unscheduled downtime will be flagged.\u201d The words made my stomach twist. As a telemarketer, every minute was tracked, every call logged. Missing a shift, even for family, could mean a warning or worse. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my presence, my laughter, my stories. My job demanded strict adherence, no exceptions. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my grandchildren and the rules that kept my job secure."}
