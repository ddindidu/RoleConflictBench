My stepbrother, Max, was slumped on the porch, his backpack at his feet, eyes red and puffy. I could tell something was wrong; he barely looked up when I greeted him. As his step-sibling, I knew I should sit down, ask him what happened, and be there for him. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents got married\u2014support, no matter what.\n\nBut the delivery person in me was on the clock. The company policy was strict: I needed a signature for this package, and I couldn\u2019t leave it unattended. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014confirm delivery within five minutes or risk a write-up. I glanced at Max, torn. He needed me, but so did my job. My heart pounded as I stood there, package in hand, caught between comforting my stepbrother and fulfilling my duty as a delivery person."}
