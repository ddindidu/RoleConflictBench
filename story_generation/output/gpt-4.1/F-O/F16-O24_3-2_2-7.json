My partner sat across from me, eyes red and voice trembling as they recounted the latest blow in their ongoing crisis. I could see how much they needed me\u2014my hand in theirs, my full attention, my words of comfort. But the attorney\u2019s email echoed in my mind: \u201cYour Honor, I trust you\u2019ll review the new precedent before tomorrow\u2019s session.\u201d The weight of my robe pressed invisibly on my shoulders, demanding diligence and impartiality. My partner\u2019s pain pulled at my heart, but the law demanded my mind. I tried to listen, to offer a reassuring squeeze, but my thoughts kept drifting to the legal arguments I hadn\u2019t yet read. I felt torn, guilty for not being fully present in either world, knowing that both needed all of me, and that tonight, I could not give it."}
