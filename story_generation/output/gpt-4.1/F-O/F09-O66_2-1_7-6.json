As a mother, I knew every fare counted\u2014my kids needed groceries, school supplies, and the rent was due soon. The pressure to keep our heads above water pressed on my chest. But as a taxi driver, I had to keep my cab spotless for the next passenger, especially after the last customer left muddy footprints and a sticky mess on the back seat. My phone buzzed with a new ride request, but the back seat was a disaster. If I took the next fare, I risked a bad review and maybe even a complaint to my boss. If I stopped to clean, I\u2019d lose precious minutes\u2014and money we desperately needed. My heart pounded as I stared at the mess, torn between the need to provide for my family and the duty to uphold my job\u2019s standards."}
