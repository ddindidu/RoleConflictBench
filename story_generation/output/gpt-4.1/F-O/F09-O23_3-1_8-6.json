My mind kept drifting back to the looming home loan repayment. Two months. I needed to make sure we had enough, and every decision I made at work felt heavier, knowing my family\u2019s stability depended on it. As a mother, I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my chest.\n\nA colleague approached, smiling, and asked about one of my high-profile cases. \u201cJust between us,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on with your client?\u201d The question was casual, but I felt my stomach twist. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality and ethics\u2014no matter how much I wanted to fit in, to maybe secure a referral or a new client that could help with our finances. The expectations of my profession clashed with the desperate need to provide for my family. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between the urge to protect my client\u2019s trust and the silent plea to do whatever it took for my family\u2019s future."}
