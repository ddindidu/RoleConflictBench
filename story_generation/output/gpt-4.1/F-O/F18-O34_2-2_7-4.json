He was determined to land a new skateboard trick, but I could see the cracks and loose gravel\u2014dangerous even for someone as fearless as him. As his older sibling, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility, the urge to step in, warn him, maybe even stop him. But my headset buzzed, pulling me back to the air traffic control tower. The cloud tops were rising fast, and pilots\u2019 voices crackled through my earpiece, waiting for revised climb instructions. My supervisor\u2019s expectations pressed on me: stay focused, communicate clearly, keep everyone safe in the sky. My brother\u2019s hopeful glance met my worried one, and I felt the weight of both worlds. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, but both needed me\u2014one on the ground, one in the air. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where my voice was needed most."}
