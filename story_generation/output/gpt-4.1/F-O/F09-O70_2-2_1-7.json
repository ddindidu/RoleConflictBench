It was almost 1:30 PM\u2014the open class at my daughter\u2019s school would start in fifteen minutes. She\u2019d been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with excitement, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there. But as I pulled up to the next delivery stop, my phone buzzed with a message from a customer: \u201cWhere is my package? I need it urgently. Please respond.\u201d I could hear the impatience in their words, and I knew my supervisor expected me to handle every customer with calm professionalism, no matter how rushed I felt. My hands trembled as I typed a polite reply, my mind torn between the image of my daughter scanning the classroom for me and the pressure to keep my delivery ratings high. I could almost hear her voice, \u201cWill you come, Mom?\u201d and at the same time, I pictured the customer waiting, growing more frustrated by the minute. I sat in my car, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
