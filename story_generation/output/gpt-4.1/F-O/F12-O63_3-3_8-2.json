He wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about our finances, about his recent diagnosis, about what we were going to do next. He needed me to be honest, to share my fears and hopes, to be his partner. But just as he started to open up, my work phone buzzed. It was a long-time customer, furious about a recent offer, demanding answers, threatening to cancel. My manager expected me to handle objections calmly, to keep the customer satisfied, to protect the company\u2019s reputation. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine for reassurance, for openness, while the customer\u2019s voice grew louder in my ear, insisting on explanations. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding my heart, the other my professionalism. My hands shook as I tried to decide which voice to answer first, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
