My mother\u2019s hands trembled as she poured coffee, and my father barely touched his toast. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted to sit down, to offer comfort, to be the daughter they could lean on.\n\nBut my phone buzzed urgently. The hospital\u2019s biomedical team was calling: a life-support device in the ICU was flashing critical fault codes. They needed me to diagnose and fix it\u2014lives depended on it. My mind raced with technical checklists and possible malfunctions, but my heart ached for my parents, who looked so small and fragile in that moment.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the desperate need in my parents\u2019 eyes and the knowledge that a patient\u2019s life might hinge on my expertise. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
