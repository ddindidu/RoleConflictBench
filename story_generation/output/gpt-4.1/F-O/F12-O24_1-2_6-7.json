He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew he wanted me to open up, to share the weight I carried from court, but my mind was elsewhere. Just hours ago, an attorney had cited a brand-new appellate decision\u2014one I hadn\u2019t yet read. The next session was tomorrow, and I needed to review it thoroughly to ensure fairness and accuracy in my ruling. \n\nBut here, at home, my husband waited for me to be present, to talk, to connect. I felt the pressure of his expectation, the gentle ache of wanting to be a good partner. Yet, the judge in me couldn\u2019t let go of the urgency to stay updated, to not let anything slip through the cracks. My heart tugged in two directions, the demands of my robe and my ring pulling me apart. I stared at my plate, words caught in my throat, unsure which role to serve first."}
