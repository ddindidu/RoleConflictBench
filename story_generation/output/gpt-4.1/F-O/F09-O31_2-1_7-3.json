My shift starts in an hour, and I know I need to keep up with my training\u2014being a police officer means staying strong, alert, and ready for anything. But as I zip up my bag, I hear my son\u2019s voice from the kitchen, asking if we have enough milk for breakfast. My heart tightens. Lately, every grocery trip feels like a calculation, every dollar stretched thin. I promised myself I\u2019d pick up extra shifts to cover the bills, to make sure my kids never feel the pinch. But those extra hours mean less time for the gym, less time to keep myself in shape for the job that pays those bills. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wear at home, the one I wear on the street. My family needs me to provide, but my duty demands I stay fit to protect others. I stand in the hallway, torn, the expectations of mother and officer pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which door to walk through first."}
