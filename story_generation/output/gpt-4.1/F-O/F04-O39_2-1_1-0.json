My supervisor caught my eye and called me over. \u201cBefore you clock out, move those unused bricks to the new storage area,\u201d he said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. I nodded, already feeling the ache in my arms. The pile was bigger than it looked, and I knew it would take at least an hour, maybe more.\n\nJust as I was about to get started, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you come home? I really need to talk.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I could picture her sitting on the edge of her bed, eyes red, waiting for me to show up like I always did. But the bricks weren\u2019t going to move themselves, and if I left them, I\u2019d be letting my crew down\u2014and risking my job. I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between being the brother she needed and the worker my team depended on."}
