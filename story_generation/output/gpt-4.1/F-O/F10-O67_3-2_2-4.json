I knew it was my mom\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to know how my day was going. We had a rule: daily updates, no matter what. It was her way of feeling close, especially since Dad passed. I glanced at the screen, saw her name, and felt a pang of guilt for not answering right away.\n\nBut the radio crackled, and dispatch\u2019s voice cut through: \u201cUnit 14, respond to a fall, possible fracture, 5th and Main.\u201d I flicked on the siren, adrenaline kicking in. My partner and I arrived to find an elderly woman cradling her arm, her face pale with pain. I knelt beside her, trying to offer comfort while assessing the injury, my mind half on the patient, half on the unread message in my pocket.\n\nI could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, worried if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But right now, this woman needed me to be focused, calm, and competent. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which to answer first."}
