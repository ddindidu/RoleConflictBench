Her eyes were red, and my father sat beside her, silent and withdrawn. She started talking about how overwhelmed they both felt lately, about health worries and the loneliness that crept in since I started working longer hours. I could see how much they needed me to listen, to reassure them, to be present as their daughter. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mandatory pre-shift briefing on new subway procedures was about to begin. Missing it could mean disciplinary action or even jeopardizing passenger safety. My heart pounded as I glanced between my parents\u2019 hopeful faces and the clock ticking down to my briefing. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing on me from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
