My team\u2019s messages kept popping up\u2014\u201cAny update on the module?\u201d\u2014and I knew the project was at a standstill until I finished. My son, meanwhile, was at the other end of the table, fidgeting with his spoon, refusing to eat his vegetables. He looked up at me, eyes searching for guidance, waiting for me to remind him about table manners and why we don\u2019t waste food. I could hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, pressing for progress, and at the same time, my own mother\u2019s voice, reminding me that teaching values starts at home, in these small moments. My heart tugged in two directions: the urgency of my team\u2019s reliance on me, and the quiet, persistent need to be present for my child, to shape him into a kind, disciplined person. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
