Come with us?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was in ten minutes, but it was only fifteen minutes long, and the burger place was a good ten-minute walk from the office. As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I showed up, especially since she\u2019d been feeling left out lately. I wanted to be there, to laugh with her and her friends, to show her she mattered.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, my breaks were strictly timed. Management had sent out another warning this morning: \u201cNo extended breaks. We\u2019re watching the logs.\u201d The phone queue was relentless, and if I left my desk for even a few extra minutes, I\u2019d risk a write-up\u2014or worse. My headset felt heavier as I weighed my options. My sister\u2019s expectation of inclusion and respect tugged at me, but so did the pressure from work to follow every rule. My heart pounded as I stared at her message, torn between being the brother she needed and the employee my job demanded."}
