My last client, Mrs. Evans, is glaring at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about her haircut. I try to stay calm, apologizing and offering to fix it, but she\u2019s relentless. My mind keeps drifting to my spouse, who texted earlier, \u201cCan we talk tonight? I need you.\u201d I know they\u2019ve been stressed at work, and I promised I\u2019d be home early to listen. But Mrs. Evans won\u2019t let up, and I can\u2019t just rush her out the door. My boss expects me to handle every client with care, no matter how late it gets. I feel my phone buzz again in my pocket\u2014my spouse, waiting, probably worrying. I want to be there for them, to listen and support, but right now, I\u2019m trapped between the demands of my job and the needs of the person I love most. My heart pounds as I try to juggle apologies and reassurance, all while my mind is already at home, torn between two worlds that both need me, right now."}
