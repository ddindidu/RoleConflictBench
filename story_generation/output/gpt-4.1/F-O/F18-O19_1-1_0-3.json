His final exam was tomorrow, and he was spiraling, desperate for reassurance. I knew he needed me\u2014he always counted on me to calm him down, to remind him he was capable.

I was supposed to offer thorough counseling, to make sure she understood the dosage, the side effects, the alternatives. My mind tugged in two directions: my brother\u2019s panic on one side, the patient\u2019s trust on the other.
