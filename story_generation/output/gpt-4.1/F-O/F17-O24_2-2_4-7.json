As a judge, I knew I had to review the new appellate decision the attorney mentioned today\u2014my reputation depended on staying current, and the next session was tomorrow morning. But my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. We\u2019re counting on you to help lead the traditional blessing.\u201d My family had been insistent lately about honoring our customs, especially after my father\u2019s passing.

Yet, the weight of my judicial robe pressed on my shoulders, reminding me of my duty to the law and the people who relied on my impartiality and diligence. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the cold, pressing demands of my profession."}
