I knew I should remind him to use his napkin and chew with his mouth closed\u2014small lessons, but important ones. My partner always said I needed to be more involved, to help teach him the right way to behave. Just as I opened my mouth to gently correct him, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the pharmacy: a patient was waiting, confused about which pain reliever to buy. I was supposed to be available for quick consultations, even on my day off, and the manager expected prompt, clear advice. I stared at my stepson, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I focus on guiding him now, or step away to fulfill my professional duty? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations\u2014wanting to be a good parent, but also a responsible pharmacist."}
