There\u2019s a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expects me to report it, fill out the paperwork, and wait for them to review the tapes. But my shift is almost over, and I promised my stepson I\u2019d pick up the Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about. He\u2019s been counting down the days, and I know how much it means to him. We\u2019ve been tight on money, and I\u2019ve worked extra hours just to make this happen. If I stay late to sort out the register, the store might close before I can buy the Nintendo. If I ignore the discrepancy, I risk my job and the financial stability my family depends on. My heart pounds as I stare at the register, torn between being the reliable step-parent my family needs and the trustworthy cashier my boss expects."}
