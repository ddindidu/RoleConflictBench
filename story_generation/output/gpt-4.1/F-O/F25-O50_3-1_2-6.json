He\u2019d sent a photo of his dinner, asking how my day was going, expecting the usual quick reply. I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014he and Mom liked to hear from me every day, and I knew if I didn\u2019t answer soon, they\u2019d worry or feel ignored. But the client was already on the line, her voice uncertain as she asked for advice on using the new machine. She was new to the equipment, and I could hear the anxiety in her questions. I knew I should take the time to walk her through the basics, reassure her, and make sure she felt supported. My stepdad\u2019s message blinked on my screen, waiting. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I focused on the client, I\u2019d be letting my parents down, but if I paused to text back, I\u2019d be unprofessional and leave the client hanging. My mind raced, caught between the need to be a good step-child and a reliable repairer, wishing I could split myself in two."}
