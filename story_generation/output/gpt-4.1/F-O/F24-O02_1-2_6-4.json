Mom always reminded me to look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood. I kept an eye on him, making sure he didn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another email from work. The engineering team needed my input on the new safety standard for our upcoming product release. The deadline was tight, and my manager expected evidence of compliance by tomorrow morning. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me: Alex\u2019s safety in the here and now, and the company\u2019s trust in my technical expertise. My mind raced with checklists and regulatory clauses, but Alex\u2019s laughter pulled me back to the present. I tried to focus, but the anxiety gnawed at me\u2014if I stopped to answer the email, I might miss something important with Alex. If I waited, I risked letting my team down. The two worlds collided in my chest, and I hesitated, torn between the demands of family and profession."}
