My heart twisted with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not be there for him when he needed me most? But as I looked up, the foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, reminding everyone that it was time for the end-of-shift sweep. My section was a mess, scattered with debris and tools, and I knew the safety inspector would be making rounds. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking a warning or worse. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be the mother who didn\u2019t show up when her child was in trouble. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. My hands trembled, torn between the dust and noise of the site and the silent plea in my son\u2019s eyes that I could almost see."}
