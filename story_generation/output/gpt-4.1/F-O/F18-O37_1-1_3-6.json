My little brother wanted to go hiking, my sister suggested a movie night, and my parents looked at me, waiting for my input. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present and enthusiastic, but my mind kept drifting to my job as a housekeeping cleaner. Just this morning, my supervisor reminded me about the strict safety and hygiene protocols\u2014gloves on at all times, no exceptions. I\u2019d been slipping up, only wearing them for the messiest jobs, and now I worried about bringing germs home. My hands still felt raw from the chemicals, and I wondered if I should skip the family outing to avoid putting them at risk. But I could see the hope in my brother\u2019s eyes, the way my parents wanted us all together. The pressure to be a good sibling pulled me one way, while the responsibility to keep everyone safe tugged me in another. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to say, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
