As a mother, I know my family depends on me to keep the lights on, to make sure there\u2019s food in the fridge. The money I bring in from my job as a machine repairer is what keeps us afloat. But next week, during the planned shutdown at the plant, I\u2019m expected to perform routine maintenance and cleaning on the machines. It\u2019s a critical task\u2014if I don\u2019t do it right, the machines could break down, costing the company and risking my job. My supervisor has made it clear: this maintenance is non-negotiable, and any mistake could mean trouble. At the same time, my kids need me at home. The school called today; my youngest is struggling, and they want me to come in for a meeting\u2014right in the middle of the shutdown week. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give. My hands tremble as I try to figure out how I can possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I choose, something important will be left undone."}
