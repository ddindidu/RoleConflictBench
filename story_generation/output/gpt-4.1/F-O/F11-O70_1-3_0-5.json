As his sister, I knew how much this meant to him\u2014and to me. We\u2019d always promised to show up for each other\u2019s big moments. But as I pulled into the driveway of my last delivery, my work phone rang. Dispatch insisted I hand-deliver a high-value package to the recipient, verify their ID, and wait for confirmation. No shortcuts, no exceptions. The address was across town, and the recipient was running late. My brother\u2019s dinner was starting soon, and I could already picture his hopeful face scanning the room for me. My heart pounded as I weighed the pressure from my job against my promise as a sister. I stood by my van, package in hand, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
