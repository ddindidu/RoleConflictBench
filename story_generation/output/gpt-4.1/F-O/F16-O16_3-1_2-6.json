My partner\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cCan you come home early? I really need you.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in their voice, the weight of the crisis they\u2019d been carrying for weeks. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold them, to listen and reassure them that things would be okay. But inside the clinic, a waiting room full of patients depended on me. One of them, a young woman with a fever and sore throat, waited for my diagnosis and the right prescription to ease her pain. I knew she was counting on my expertise, just as my partner was counting on my love. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my heart tugged toward home, my sense of duty anchoring me to the clinic. I stared at the clinic doors, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my whole self to both."}
