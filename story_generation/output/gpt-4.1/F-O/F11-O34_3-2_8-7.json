I scanned the radar, heart pounding as storm cells forced a dozen flights to reroute, each blip a life in my hands. My phone buzzed on the console\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed. We\u2019d argued last night, harsh words hanging between us. She wanted to talk, to clear the air, to rebuild the trust we\u2019d chipped away. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d call her back today, that I\u2019d listen, really listen. But now, every second counted. My supervisor expected seamless coordination, no distractions, not when the sky was chaos. My sister expected honesty, respect, a chance to fix what we\u2019d broken.
