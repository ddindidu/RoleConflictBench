It was my daughter, her voice trembling as she told me about my grandson\u2019s accident at school. My heart clenched; I could hear my little Emma crying in the background. As a grandmother, I knew I should be there, comforting them, making sure everyone was okay, and keeping the family together in this moment of crisis. But as I hung up, my delivery app pinged with a high-priority order\u2014groceries that had to reach a customer within the next hour. The address was across town, and the customer had already called twice, desperate to have everything in time for dinner. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my family needed me, but so did my job, and I couldn\u2019t let either down. My hands shook as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the pull of home and the demands of my route, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
