It was my mom. Her voice trembled as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare that morning. She needed me\u2014her only child\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I could hear the fear in her words, and I wanted nothing more than to rush home, sit beside her, and hold her hand. But as I tried to comfort her, my other phone rang. It was Mrs. Evans, the homeowner whose deck I\u2019d promised to fix today. She sounded anxious, reminding me that her family gathering was tomorrow and the deck was unsafe. I could picture the splintered boards, the risk to her guests, and my responsibility as a carpenter to make it right. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the workshop, torn between being the child my parents needed and the professional my client depended on. Both roles pulled at me, their expectations heavy, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
