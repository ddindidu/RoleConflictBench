The main production unit had stopped again\u2014sensor errors, the same ones I\u2019d fixed last week. Every minute the line was down cost the company money, and I was the only one who knew the system inside out. My toolbox was already in the car, ready to go.

Today was the day I was supposed to lead the family ceremony, a role passed down for generations. My parents\u2019 eyes met mine, full of hope and pride, expecting me to honor our traditions and guide the family through the rituals.

I could hear my supervisor asking, \u201cCan you get here now?\u201d while my mother called softly, \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you.\u201d I stood frozen, torn between the demands of the son I was raised to be and the machine repairer I had become."}
