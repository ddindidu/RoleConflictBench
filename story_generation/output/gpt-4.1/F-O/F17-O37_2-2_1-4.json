It was Sunday evening, the time I always called my parents. They\u2019d be waiting, probably already sitting together in the living room, eager to hear about my week and tell me about theirs. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved out. But my mind kept drifting to work. Earlier today, I\u2019d noticed the floor cleaner at Mrs. Lee\u2019s house was almost gone. If I didn\u2019t remind her to buy more, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job properly at her place next week. She relied on me to keep track of these things, and I prided myself on being responsible. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my parents\u2019 gentle expectation for connection, and my client\u2019s unspoken trust in my reliability. My heart pounded as I weighed which call to make first, feeling the tug of guilt and responsibility pulling me in opposite directions."}
