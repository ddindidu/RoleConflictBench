My wife was at the kitchen table, scrolling through her phone, her shoulders a little tense. She looked up and smiled, but I could tell something was off. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, her voice light but her eyes tired. I wanted to sit beside her, listen, and offer the comfort she deserved. That\u2019s what she expected from me\u2014her partner, her support.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the machines at the plant needed pre-shutdown checks. The schedule was tight, and if I didn\u2019t get a head start on the maintenance logs tonight, next week\u2019s servicing could be a disaster. The company counted on me to keep everything running smoothly, and any slip-up could mean costly downtime.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My wife needed me to be present, to listen and care. My job demanded my attention and diligence, even outside working hours. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which role to step into first."}
