He\u2019d been saving up, counting the days until I could buy him that Nintendo. As a parent, I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up with joy. But the bills on the counter reminded me of my other responsibility\u2014ensuring we stayed afloat. Just then, my phone buzzed. A homeowner\u2019s voice crackled through, urgent about a damaged deck that needed immediate repair. As a carpenter, I knew the job couldn\u2019t wait; the deck was unsafe, and my reputation depended on quick, quality work. The job would take hours, maybe days, and I\u2019d have to buy materials upfront. My mind raced, torn between the promise to my child and the duty to my craft. If I took the job, I might have to delay the Nintendo. If I didn\u2019t, I risked losing a client and much-needed income. My heart ached, caught between the expectations of being a good parent and a reliable carpenter, unsure which role to answer first."}
