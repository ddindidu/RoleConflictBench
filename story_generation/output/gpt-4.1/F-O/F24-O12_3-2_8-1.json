The deadline was looming, and my team had just flagged some performance issues in the code review. My mind raced with possible solutions, each one more complex than the last. I barely registered the sound of footsteps until I glanced up and saw my step-brother, hoodie half-zipped, heading for the front door. He was glued to his phone, not paying attention as he pushed the door open. Through the window, I saw him step onto the curb, eyes still on his screen, about to cross the street. My heart pounded. I knew I should call out, make sure he looked both ways\u2014Mom always said we had to look out for each other. But my screen blinked with another review comment, and I felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing down. I was torn, caught between the urge to protect my brother and the demand to deliver perfect code. My hands hovered, uncertain, between the keyboard and the window."}
