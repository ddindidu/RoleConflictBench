They mention a frustrating meeting, a new colleague, something about dinner plans. I nod, trying to seem engaged, but my mind is tangled in Gantt charts and deadlines. Management has been pinging me all afternoon, pressing for my estimates on the new project. They need numbers\u2014firm ones\u2014for the quarterly roadmap, and I know how much rides on getting them right. But I also know my spouse expects more than just a distracted nod; they want me to really listen, to share, to be present. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the urge to close my laptop and the anxiety of leaving my team waiting. My spouse\u2019s voice softens, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I want to answer honestly, to communicate openly like we promised each other, but the clock is ticking and my inbox is filling. I take a breath, caught between the demands of my work and the needs of my marriage, unsure which to answer first."}
