As a grandmother, I felt the pull to call her right away, to offer comfort and advice, to be the steady presence my family expects. But before I could dial, an email notification popped up on my laptop\u2014a notice from the tax authority. There was a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return, and they demanded an immediate response. As an accountant, I knew the stakes: missing the deadline could mean penalties for my client and damage to my reputation. My heart raced as I stared at the phone in one hand and the laptop in the other. My family needed me, but so did my client. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation urgent, each demand impossible to ignore."}
