Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear his voice, half-joking, half-serious, reminding me how much it meant to him that I show up, that I be part of the group. We\u2019d been working on building a better relationship, making time for each other, and I knew skipping out would set us back.\n\nBut at my desk, the new engineering standard document glared at me from my monitor. The company\u2019s next product release was in two days, and the updated safety regulations were non-negotiable. My manager had made it clear: \u201cWe need documented proof of compliance before launch. No exceptions.\u201d The pressure was immense\u2014if I missed something, the consequences could be severe.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My brother wanted me to be present, to show I cared. My team needed me to ensure everything was safe and up to code. I sat there, torn, the clock ticking, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
