It was my brother, his voice trembling, asking if I could come over. He\u2019d just broken up with his long-term girlfriend and sounded completely shattered. As his sister, I knew he needed me\u2014he\u2019d always been there for me, and I\u2019d promised to do the same. But as I hung up, my eyes fell on the thick printout of the new appellate court decision the attorney had cited today. I hadn\u2019t read it yet, and the next session was in the morning. As a judge, I was expected to be fully prepared, to know the latest legal precedents inside and out. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my brother\u2019s pain, my duty to the court. I paced the living room, torn between the urge to rush to my brother\u2019s side and the responsibility to uphold the integrity of my courtroom. My heart ached with the knowledge that, whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
