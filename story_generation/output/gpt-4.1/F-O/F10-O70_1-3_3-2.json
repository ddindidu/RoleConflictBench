Grandma\u2019s expecting you to help with the dumplings.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Every year, our family gathered to make dumplings together, a tradition that meant everything to Grandma. I knew how much it mattered to her, and to my mom, that I was there, hands dusted with flour, laughing and sharing stories.\n\nBut my delivery app buzzed at the same time\u2014a rush order, medical supplies for the hospital, marked urgent. The address was across town, and the package had to be there by six-thirty, no exceptions. I could picture the hospital staff waiting, maybe even a patient depending on what I brought. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cLate deliveries, especially medical, are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nI felt torn, my chest tight. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the start of dinner, maybe even the whole thing. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk someone\u2019s care and my job. Both sides pulled at me, each expecting me to be reliable, present, and responsible. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, apron in the other, not sure which role to let down."}
