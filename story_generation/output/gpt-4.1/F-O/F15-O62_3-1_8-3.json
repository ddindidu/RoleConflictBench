As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in perfect order\u2014every chair aligned, every piece of equipment checked. Today, a few pool chairs were slightly misaligned, not a safety hazard, but not up to standard either. My supervisor had been strict lately, reminding us that even small details mattered. I knew I should fix them, but my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a parent, I was responsible for our family\u2019s financial stability, and every minute I spent here was a minute I could be using to look for extra work or plan our budget. The pressure to provide for my family pressed against the duty to maintain the pool\u2019s order. I felt torn, my hands gripping the clipboard tighter, heart pounding as I weighed the expectations of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t ignore either."}
