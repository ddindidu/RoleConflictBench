Haven\u2019t heard from you this weekend.\u201d I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. I started typing a quick reply, wanting to reassure her, but just then, the radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling in a new emergency. A patient with a broken leg, a few miles away, traffic already building up. My partner looked at me, waiting for me to hit the siren and go. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my mother\u2019s anxious hope for a sign I was okay, and the city\u2019s expectation that I\u2019d get to the scene fast, someone else\u2019s child waiting for help. My thumb hovered over the send button, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my job, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed in this moment."}
