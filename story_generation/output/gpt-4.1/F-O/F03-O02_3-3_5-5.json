It means so much to your father and me.\u201d My heart tightened. This ceremony wasn\u2019t just a ritual\u2014it was the thread that held our family\u2019s traditions together, and my parents expected me to step up, to honor our heritage. But as I sat at my desk, my work phone buzzed urgently. The inspector\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIf these safety issues aren\u2019t addressed today, we\u2019ll have to shut down the site.\u201d As the lead engineer, I was responsible for every detail, every regulation. My team and the company were counting on me to fix this, fast. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s pride and expectations on one side, my professional duty and the livelihoods of my colleagues on the other. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the call of tradition and the demands of my career, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
