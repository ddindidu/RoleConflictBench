Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter and clinking dishes, the warmth of being together after weeks apart. My family expected me there, present and engaged, not just physically but emotionally\u2014my sisterly role was to show up, to be part of the memories.\n\nSuddenly, the emergency alarm blared through the train. My heart jumped. The control panel flashed: medical emergency, car three. Instinct took over\u2014I was the operator, responsible for every soul on board. I had to act quickly, coordinate with emergency services, reassure panicked passengers, and keep the train safe. My duty was clear, and the weight of it pressed on my shoulders.\n\nBut as I reached for the intercom, my mind raced. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the dinner, disappoint my family, and break a promise.

My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
