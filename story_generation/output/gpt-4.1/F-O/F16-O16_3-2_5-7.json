The scent of cleaning spray lingered in the air as I scrubbed the counter, glancing at the clock. My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the guest towels still needed folding and the guest room needed vacuuming before the relatives arrived. I nodded, feeling the weight of expectation\u2014our home had to be spotless, welcoming, a reflection of our shared effort.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, this time with a message from the hospital. My patient, Mrs. Lee, was having a flare-up. Her autoimmune disease was unpredictable, and her treatment plan required careful adjustment. The nurse\u2019s message was urgent: Mrs. Lee needed a new prescription, and only I knew the nuances of her case. I could picture her anxious face, waiting for relief.\n\nI felt torn, my mind racing between the demands of home and hospital. My spouse expected partnership, reliability, presence. My patient needed expertise, compassion, immediate action. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the two worlds that defined me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
