But as I started dialing the next number, my mother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me about the family ceremony this weekend. \u201cYou\u2019re leading the prayers this year. It\u2019s important to your grandfather.\u201d I knew what that meant\u2014hours of preparation, learning the chants, and being present for every ritual. My family expected me to honor our traditions, to show respect and keep our heritage alive. But the ceremony clashed with the company\u2019s biggest sales push. If I stepped away, I might lose momentum, maybe even the bonus. If I stayed glued to my headset, I\u2019d disappoint my family, especially my grandfather, who always said tradition was our backbone. My chest tightened as I weighed the pride in my mother\u2019s eyes against the thrill of smashing my targets. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt trapped, unable to satisfy both worlds that meant so much to me."}
