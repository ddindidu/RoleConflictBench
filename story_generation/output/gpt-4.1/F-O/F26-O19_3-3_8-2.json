My hands paused, pill bottle hovering over the tray. It was my daughter, her name lighting up the screen, and I remembered her voice from this morning\u2014strained, on the verge of tears. My mind flashed to my grandson, who\u2019d been struggling lately, and the unspoken expectation that I would be there, a steady presence, someone to talk to, someone to help. But here, in my white coat, the world narrowed to the prescription in front of me. The patient\u2019s life depended on my focus; a single miscount or misread instruction could be catastrophic. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family needing comfort and support, my patient needing precision and care. My heart ached to answer the call, to be the grandparent my family expected, but my mind screamed that I couldn\u2019t afford a single distraction. The phone buzzed again, insistent, as I stood frozen, torn between the two roles that defined me."}
