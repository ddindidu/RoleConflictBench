They needed me\u2014tonight more than ever. I whispered reassurances, promising I wouldn\u2019t leave, that I\u2019d be here, always. But the radio crackled to life, dispatch\u2019s urgent voice slicing through the quiet: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress, multiple bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart lurched. I was the closest unit. I could already picture the chaos, the fear in strangers\u2019 eyes, the responsibility pressing down on me to protect them. But here, in my arms, was the person I loved most, desperate for me to stay, to be their anchor. I felt torn in two, the weight of my badge and my vows pulling me in opposite directions. My partner\u2019s grip tightened, silently pleading. The radio repeated the call, more desperate this time. I stood frozen, caught between the duty to the city and the promise I made at home, my mind racing, my chest tight, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left unprotected."}
