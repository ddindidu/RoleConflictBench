They barely slept, and I knew they needed me\u2014needed my arms, my words, my steady presence. But the salon was already buzzing when I arrived, and my first client was waiting, her hair thick with product, matted and tangled. She expected me to work my usual magic, to wash away the buildup and leave her hair soft and manageable before I even picked up my scissors. As I massaged shampoo into her scalp, my mind kept drifting home. My partner\u2019s text\u2014\u201cCan you call me on your break?\u201d\u2014flashed on my phone. I felt torn, hands in suds, heart at home. My client chatted about her weekend, oblivious to the storm inside me. I wanted to be the spouse who could drop everything, but I was also the hairdresser who couldn\u2019t rush this process. The tangles wouldn\u2019t wait, and neither would my partner\u2019s pain. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
