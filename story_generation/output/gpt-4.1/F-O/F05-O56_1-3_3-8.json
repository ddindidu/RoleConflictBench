My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes\u2014another client squeezed in at the salon, desperate for a last-minute cut before her big event. She\u2019s already in the chair, her hair thick with product, tangles tight as knots. I know I can\u2019t just rush through; I need to wash and condition her hair thoroughly, or my scissors will snag and the cut will be a disaster. My hands itch to get started, but my mind is split. At home, I\u2019m a husband, expected to share the load, to be present. Here, I\u2019m a hairdresser, expected to give every client my best. Both roles demand my time, my care, and right now, I can\u2019t see how to give enough to either."}
