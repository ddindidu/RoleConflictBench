My husband left a note on the fridge: \u201cCan you handle the laundry today? Kids need uniforms.\u201d I nod to myself, feeling the weight of the expectation. But my phone buzzes\u2014a new message from a client. They want a custom bookshelf, and they need an estimate by the end of the day. I glance at my workbench, scattered with sketches and wood samples, and my mind races through measurements, material lists, and supplier contacts. I know if I don\u2019t get the order in today, the project will be delayed, and my reputation as a reliable carpenter will take a hit. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the call of my workshop. Both roles demand my attention, both are urgent, and I feel the pressure mounting as I try to decide which responsibility to tackle first."}
