She jabbed a finger at her hair, her words sharp and loud, demanding a fix before closing. My hands trembled as I tried to soothe her, promising to make it right, all while my phone buzzed in my pocket. I knew it was my husband\u2014he\u2019d been quiet all week, and tonight I\u2019d promised we\u2019d talk, really talk, about what was weighing on him. He needed me to listen, to be present, to share my own worries too. But here I was, trapped between the expectations of my job and my marriage. My client\u2019s frustration demanded my full attention, but my mind kept drifting to home, to the conversation waiting for me. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure how to be the wife my husband needed and the professional my client expected\u2014all at the same time."}
