Mom always says to stick together, especially on this busy street. I keep an eye on him, making sure he doesn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my telemarketing shift starts in five minutes. Management has been strict lately; every break, every login, is tracked. If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get another warning, maybe even lose my job. But my brother\u2019s hand is warm in mine, and I can\u2019t just leave him to walk the last few blocks alone. I glance at the time, heart pounding, torn between the responsibility to protect him and the pressure to clock in on time. The phone queue will be full, and my supervisor will notice if I\u2019m not there. I squeeze my brother\u2019s hand tighter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019m about to let down."}
