My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that her parents would arrive in two hours and everything had to be spotless. As a husband, I wanted to share the load, to prove I could help make our home shine. But as a professional cleaner, I knew the rules\u2014gloves for chemicals, separate cloths for each surface, never mix products. My wife, though, was in a hurry, urging me to skip steps, to just \u201cwipe things down quickly\u201d so we could move on to the next room. I felt the pressure mounting: her anxious glances, the ticking clock, my own standards clashing with her expectations. Should I cut corners to keep the peace, or insist on doing things the right way, risking an argument and running out of time? My hands hovered over the cleaning supplies, heart pounding, caught between being the helpful husband and the responsible cleaner."}
