He asked about my day, his eyes warm and expectant. I wanted to tell him everything\u2014how a customer had gotten upset when I insisted on a signature for a moderately valuable package, how my supervisor had reminded me that securing deliveries was non-negotiable. But I hesitated. I knew he valued honesty and open communication, and I could see he was genuinely interested. At the same time, my mind replayed the tense moment at the customer\u2019s door, the pressure to follow company policy, and the fear of making a mistake that could cost me my job. I felt torn between being the supportive, open wife he needed and the diligent, by-the-book delivery person my job demanded. My heart pounded as I weighed whether to share my stress or keep it to myself, not wanting to burden him or seem incapable. The silence stretched between us, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding different things from me at the very same moment."}
