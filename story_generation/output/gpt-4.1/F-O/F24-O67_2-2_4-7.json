My stepbrother had sent a message: \u201cDon\u2019t be late this time, okay?\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant to my new family, especially since I\u2019d missed the last one. I promised myself I\u2019d be there, even left work early to make sure. But as I was about to clock out, the radio crackled\u2014dispatch needed an ambulance driver for a call across town. The patient wasn\u2019t in critical danger, but protocol demanded I respond immediately and drive safely, no matter the traffic. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cSafety first, always. No shortcuts.\u201d I could already picture my family waiting, my stepmother\u2019s disappointed smile, my stepbrother\u2019s teasing. The city lights blurred as I gripped the wheel, torn between the duty to my patients and the fragile trust I was building at home. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both."}
