I knew I should be patient, guiding him with kindness, but my mind kept drifting to the clinic, where a patient waited for me with a runny nose and a cough. As a doctor, I was expected to listen carefully, ask the right questions, and not dismiss symptoms, even if they seemed minor. But here, at home, I was supposed to teach respect and discipline, to not let small acts of rudeness slide. My phone buzzed with a message from the clinic, reminding me of the patient\u2019s appointment. My stepson slouched in his chair, mumbling under his breath. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my clinical focus and empathy, the other my steady guidance and authority. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment, feeling the pull of both expectations, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy either without letting the other down."}
