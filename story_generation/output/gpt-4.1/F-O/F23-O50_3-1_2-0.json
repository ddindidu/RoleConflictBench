The vice principal\u2019s voice was calm but firm: my stepson had been caught bullying another student. They wanted me at the school, now, to discuss what happened and how we\u2019d address it. I promised I\u2019d come, but as I hung up, my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed from the shop floor. The old packaging machine, the one that only ran during slow periods, was acting up again\u2014intermittent glitches, nothing we could pin down, but enough to halt production. \u201cWe need you to look at it right away,\u201d he said, urgency in his tone. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My partner expected me to be there for her son, to show him that I cared, that I was part of the family. The company needed me to keep the line running, to solve problems no one else could. I could picture my stepson waiting in the principal\u2019s office, anxious and alone, while at the same time, I imagined the machine\u2019s blinking error light, the crew standing idle, waiting for me to fix things. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
