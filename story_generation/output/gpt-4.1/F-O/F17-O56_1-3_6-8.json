She\u2019s waiting for me to work my magic, but the knots are stubborn, and I know I\u2019ll need extra time to wash and condition before I can even think about cutting. My mind drifts to my parents at home. Lately, they\u2019ve seemed distant, and I promised myself I\u2019d check in more often, to be the supportive child they need. I glance at the clock\u2014if I take too long with this client, I\u2019ll miss the window to call my parents before their dinner. My client expects me to be thorough and gentle, to make her hair feel new again. My parents expect me to care, to ask if everything is okay, to be present. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, the tug of responsibility in two directions. My hands keep working, but my heart is split, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
