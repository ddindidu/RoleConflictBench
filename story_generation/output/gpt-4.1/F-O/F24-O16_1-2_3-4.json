My stepmother looked at me, her eyes hopeful, expecting me to join in the excitement and help plan the outing. I wanted to be present, to laugh and share in the anticipation, but my phone buzzed with a message from the hospital. My patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis and was anxious, waiting for me to call and explain what it meant for her life. I knew she needed reassurance and clear answers, and I could picture her sitting by her phone, worried and confused. My family\u2019s voices blurred as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of belonging at the table and the responsibility I felt toward my patient. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my heart race as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
