My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My fingers hovered over the call list, but my thoughts kept drifting upstairs, where my stepbrother sat hunched over his textbooks. He\u2019d barely slept, and I\u2019d promised Mom I\u2019d be there for him, especially today\u2014his final exam was tomorrow, and he was on the verge of a breakdown. I could hear him pacing, muttering formulas, his anxiety almost palpable through the floorboards. I knew he needed me, maybe just to listen or make him tea, but every minute away from my desk meant fewer calls, fewer chances to hit my quota. The pressure from work was suffocating, but so was the guilt of not being the supportive sibling I was supposed to be.
