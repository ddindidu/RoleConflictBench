The airport was still miles away, and my passenger kept checking his watch, his anxiety filling the cab. He\u2019d told me his flight was international\u2014missing it wasn\u2019t an option. I felt the weight of his expectation: get him there safely, and on time, despite the storm.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in the cupholder. It was my husband. He\u2019d sounded off this morning, and I\u2019d promised we\u2019d talk tonight. He wanted me to open up, to share what was on my mind, just as he was trying to do. I knew he needed me to be present, to listen, to be honest about my own worries. But right now, my mind was split\u2014half on the icy roads, half on the conversation waiting at home.\n\nThe storm outside mirrored the one inside me.
