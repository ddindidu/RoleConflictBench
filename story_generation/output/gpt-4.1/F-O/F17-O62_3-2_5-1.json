My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that today was the day I was supposed to lead the family ceremony\u2014an honor passed down for generations. My relatives gathered on the other side of the pool, waiting for me to begin the ritual, their eyes full of expectation. I could almost feel the weight of their hopes pressing on my shoulders, urging me to step away from my post and join them, to show respect for our traditions and make them proud.\n\nBut as I glanced back at the water, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, their strokes growing weaker. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to jump in at any moment. The responsibility of keeping everyone safe was just as heavy as the responsibility to my family. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the call of my heritage and the duty to protect those in the water, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
