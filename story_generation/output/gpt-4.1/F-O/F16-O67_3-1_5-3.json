My spouse\u2019s voice was tense\u2014her parents would arrive in two hours, and the house still looked like a tornado had passed through. I promised I\u2019d finish the chores, but as I hung up, the radio on my belt crackled. Dispatch needed all ambulance drivers to check their first-aid kits immediately; there\u2019d been a report of expired supplies in another unit. I knew the drill\u2014every item had to be accounted for, and any mistake could cost a life. My mind raced. If I left the chores, my spouse would be overwhelmed and disappointed, maybe even embarrassed in front of her family. But if I ignored the kit check, I\u2019d be risking my patients\u2019 safety and letting down my team. I stared at the mop in my hand, heart pounding, torn between the demands of home and the responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
