They didn\u2019t ask for much\u2014just a listening ear, maybe a hug, a few words to show I cared. I wanted to be present, to offer comfort, to let them know I was there for them. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a message from the charge nurse. One of my patients was in severe pain, unable to eat, and needed help right away. I could picture her face, the way she clenched her jaw and tried to hide her discomfort. My partner\u2019s hand reached for mine, seeking reassurance, but my mind was already racing through the steps I\u2019d need to take at work. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people who needed me for different reasons. My heart ached with guilt and frustration, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between the demands of love and duty."}
