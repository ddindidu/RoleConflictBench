My headset is snug, my focus absolute\u2014at least, it should be. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a message from my daughter: \u201cCan you confirm you\u2019ll be at the family dinner this weekend? The kids are excited to see you.\u201d The holiday is almost here, and I know how much it means to everyone, especially the grandkids. I\u2019m expected to be present, to share stories and laughter, to keep the family bonds strong. Yet, right now, I\u2019m expected to be present in a different way\u2014alert, precise, the steady voice guiding aircraft safely through the sky. My mind tugs in two directions: the warmth of family, the gravity of responsibility. The pilot repeats his request, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided attention."}
