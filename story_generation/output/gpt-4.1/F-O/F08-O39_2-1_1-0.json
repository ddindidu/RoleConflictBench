My phone buzzed in my pocket, and when I checked it during my break, I saw a message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Lily? She\u2019s been quiet all day.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I knew Lily needed me\u2014she always opened up when I listened, offering her the comfort and wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But just then, my supervisor called out, reminding me to move the stack of unused bricks before the shift ended. I glanced at the heavy pile, knowing it would take time and effort. The clock was ticking, and I felt torn. My hands were rough from work, but my heart ached for my granddaughter. I stood there, phone in hand, wrestling with the weight of bricks and the weight of Lily\u2019s silence, feeling the pull of both worlds and not knowing which one needed me more in that moment."}
