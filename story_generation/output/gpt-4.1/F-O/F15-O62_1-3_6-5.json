As the head lifeguard, I knew the risk\u2014unclean water could make swimmers sick, and it was my responsibility to ensure everything was safe and up to code. The repair bill would be steep, and the manager was already hinting that the cost might come out of our limited maintenance budget. At the same time, my son tugged at my sleeve, eyes shining with anticipation. I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo for his birthday, and he\u2019d been counting down the days. He\u2019d even drawn a picture of us playing together, taping it to the fridge as a reminder. My heart twisted. The money I\u2019d set aside for his gift would barely cover the pool repair, and if I didn\u2019t act fast, the facility might have to close for a few days, costing me hours and pay. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to protect the swimmers, and my promise to bring joy to my child. I stood there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
