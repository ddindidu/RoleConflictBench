The line stretches past the candy racks, and I can feel the impatience radiating from the customers. My manager\u2019s eyes flick over every so often, making sure I\u2019m fast and accurate. I can\u2019t afford to make a mistake, not with so many people waiting. But my mind keeps drifting back to this morning, to the way my stepdad barely touched his coffee, the way my mom\u2019s voice trembled when she said goodbye. They\u2019ve both been so tired lately, shadows under their eyes, snapping at each other over little things. I know they need me to be present, to listen, to help hold things together at home. But right now, I\u2019m trapped behind this counter, forced to smile and count change, when all I want is to be there for them. The pressure builds in my chest\u2014if I slow down, I\u2019ll get in trouble at work, but if I don\u2019t find a way to help at home, I\u2019ll let my family down. The next customer steps forward, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, not sure which one needs me more."}
