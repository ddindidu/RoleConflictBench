Two drivers, both insistent they were in the right, had looked to me for a fair judgment. As a police officer, I was expected to be impartial, to weigh the facts and act with unwavering integrity. But my mind kept drifting to my son\u2019s hopeful eyes this morning, reminding me of the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. Money was tight, and the overtime from this shift would make a difference. If I sided with the driver who hinted at a \u201cthank you,\u201d I could secure that extra cash, maybe even buy the Nintendo tonight. But the badge on my chest felt heavier than ever. I was torn\u2014between being the father who keeps his promises and the officer who upholds the law.
