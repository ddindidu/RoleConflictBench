The trial had been long and complex, and the parties were waiting for my written judgment. The law demanded clarity, precision, and timeliness\u2014my duty as a judge was to deliver a thorough, impartial decision. Yet, as I stared at the screen, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I come over? I really need to talk.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew something serious must be weighing on her. As a grandmother, I was expected to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom, to be present in her moment of need. But the court\u2019s deadline loomed, and the responsibility to the litigants and the law pressed on my conscience. I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014my family\u2019s trust and the public\u2019s expectation\u2014pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
