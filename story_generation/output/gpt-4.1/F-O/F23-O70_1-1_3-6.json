He\u2019d just rolled his eyes at me, and I was trying to keep my patience, reminding myself that consistency was key if I wanted him to learn respect. My phone buzzed\u2014another delivery request. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the customer\u2019s address on time. My boss had already warned me about being late again, and I knew I had to be extra polite and professional with every customer. But Max was watching me, waiting for my reaction, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I stay and finish this important lesson, or rush out to meet the customer with a smile, as expected? My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, Max\u2019s disappointed face in the other room, and the delivery app blinking on my phone."}
