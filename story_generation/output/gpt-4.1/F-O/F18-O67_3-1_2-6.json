The radio crackled with routine updates, but all I could hear was my sister\u2019s voice from just minutes ago, trembling as she told me about the diagnosis. She needed me\u2014her big brother, her confidant. I could picture her curled up on the couch, eyes red, waiting for me to call back, to say something comforting, to just be there. But I was behind the wheel, responsible for this hulking vehicle, expected to drive it safely to the satellite station for the shift change. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning: no distractions, no phone calls, no exceptions. The weight of the uniform pressed against my chest, but the ache in my heart was heavier. I glanced at my phone on the passenger seat, vibrating with another message from her. My hands tightened, torn between the duty to my sister and the duty to the job. The world outside blurred as I wrestled with the impossible choice, the ambulance rolling steadily forward while my thoughts spun in place."}
