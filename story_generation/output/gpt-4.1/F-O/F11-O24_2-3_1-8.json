She slipped me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of this case. My mind raced, trying to recall the new ruling\u2019s details, knowing I had to halt proceedings and review the law immediately. But then, another message flashed on my phone: my younger sister, in tears, begging for help. She was having a panic attack, alone in her apartment, and needed me. \n\nI felt the weight of my robe and the invisible bond of sisterhood pulling me in opposite directions. The courtroom expected me to be the impartial judge, up-to-date and unflappable, but my heart ached for my sister, who had always counted on me to be there in her darkest moments. The jury waited, the law demanded my attention, but my sister\u2019s trembling voice echoed in my mind. I stood frozen, torn between duty and love, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
