My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, \u201cCan you help me with the guest towels?\u201d Relatives would be arriving in a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. I wiped my hands, glancing at the clock, feeling the pressure of time. The phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was a client. I answered, trying to keep my voice steady. The client, new and eager, asked for basic operating tips for the machine I\u2019d just serviced last week. I could hear the clatter of dishes in the background, a subtle reminder of my other responsibilities. My mind raced: if I gave the client the attention they needed, I\u2019d fall behind on the chores, disappointing my spouse. But if I brushed the client off, I\u2019d risk their trust and possibly my reputation. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the demands of my home and my work."}
