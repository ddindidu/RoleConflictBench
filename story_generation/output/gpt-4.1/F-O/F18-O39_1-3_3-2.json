My mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I nodded, feeling the warmth of their smiles, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was the site manager: \u201cCrane\u2019s in position. Need you now.\u201d My heart thudded. I pictured the massive steel beam dangling above the half-built frame, the crew waiting for me to help guide it into place. If I didn\u2019t go, the whole operation would stall, and I\u2019d let the team down. But if I left now, I\u2019d break the moment with my family, the one they\u2019d been looking forward to all week. My mom\u2019s hand rested on mine, my sister\u2019s laughter echoing, but the urgency of the job pressed on me. I stared at my phone, torn between the weight of steel and the weight of their expectations, caught in the space where both worlds demanded all of me at once."}
