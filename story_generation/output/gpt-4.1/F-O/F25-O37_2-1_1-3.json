They want to hear about my week, my work, and they always ask if I\u2019m eating well. Today, though, I\u2019m at Mrs. Patel\u2019s house, halfway through my cleaning shift. I\u2019m kneeling on the kitchen floor, scribbling down what\u2019s running low\u2014bleach, sponges, glass cleaner\u2014when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my mom, right on schedule. I know she\u2019ll worry if I don\u2019t answer, maybe think I\u2019m avoiding her, or that something\u2019s wrong. But Mrs. Patel is particular; she expects the supplies list before I leave, and she\u2019s already mentioned last week\u2019s delay. I stare at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job. If I answer, I\u2019ll fall behind and risk Mrs. Patel\u2019s trust. If I ignore the call, I\u2019ll disappoint my parents, maybe even hurt them. The phone keeps ringing, and I feel the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both need me, both right now."}
