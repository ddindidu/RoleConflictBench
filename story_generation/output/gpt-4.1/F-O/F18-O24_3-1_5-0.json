The hearing was in two weeks, and though it seemed straightforward, I knew the importance of being thorough\u2014every detail mattered, every precedent needed to be considered. My chambers were quiet, but my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re all counting on you to be there for the family trip next weekend. It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, too, reminding me how rare it was for all of us to be together. \n\nAs a sibling, I was expected to show up, to laugh and reminisce, to be present for the people who had shaped my life.
