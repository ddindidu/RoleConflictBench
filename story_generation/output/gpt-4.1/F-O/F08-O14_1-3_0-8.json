Her eyes were wide, searching, and she asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d I could see she needed more than a simple answer\u2014she wanted the kind of wisdom only years could give. My heart ached to be fully present, to offer her the guidance she deserved.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an urgent alert from the lab. The spectrometer was issuing warning signals\u2014if I didn\u2019t address it soon, there could be a hazardous leak. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure everyone\u2019s safety and prevent any damage. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my team and the love for my granddaughter. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my immediate attention, each impossible to ignore."}
