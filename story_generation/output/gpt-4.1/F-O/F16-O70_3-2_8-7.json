She wanted honesty\u2014she needed to know exactly where we stood, what bills were coming up, and how much we could save. I could see the worry in her eyes, and I knew I owed her my full attention and complete transparency. My phone buzzed on the table, and I glanced at the screen: a customer was asking about the status of their delivery. As a delivery person, I was expected to respond quickly, politely, and with all the details they needed. My wife\u2019s voice wavered, asking if I was listening, but the customer\u2019s message blinked insistently. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding honesty and presence, the other professionalism and promptness. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
