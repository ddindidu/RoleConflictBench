An emergency motion\u2014restraining order\u2014needed my immediate attention. I could already picture the thick stack of documents waiting for me in the study, the expectation that I would comb through every detail before making a ruling that could change someone\u2019s life. But here, in the kitchen, my husband waited, wanting me to share, to be present, to communicate openly as we promised we would. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mind racing with legal arguments and my heart aching with guilt. I wanted to tell him everything, to listen to his day, to be the wife he needed. But the judge in me knew I couldn\u2019t afford distraction or delay. I stood there, torn, the clock ticking louder than ever, caught between the demands of justice and the quiet plea for connection at home."}
