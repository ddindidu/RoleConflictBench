I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo for his birthday, and today was the last day of the sale. The store closed in an hour, and I still needed to pick up the console. But just as I was about to end my shift, a new ride request popped up on my app\u2014an urgent booking, the passenger\u2019s messages coming in rapid succession: \u201cPlease hurry, I can\u2019t be late!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. As a father, I wanted to keep my promise, to see my son\u2019s eyes light up with joy. But as a taxi driver, I knew I couldn\u2019t just cancel on a passenger who was counting on me, not when every ride mattered for our bills. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job. The minutes ticked by, and I sat there, caught in the middle, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
