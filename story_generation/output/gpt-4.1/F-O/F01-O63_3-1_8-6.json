My phone vibrated with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. My heart clenched. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, but the urgency in her words made my hands tremble. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to drop everything, to call her right away, to be the steady voice my family needed. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to take my break only during the flexible window my supervisor allowed. The call volume was light, and technically, I could step away, but I worried about being seen as unreliable, about missing the next round of calls and letting my team down. My mind raced between the need to be present for my family and the responsibility to my job. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between dialing my daughter\u2019s number and waiting for the next customer to pick up."}
