He looked up at me, uncertain, and I could see he needed my patience and guidance. Just then, my work phone buzzed. My shift as a subway operator was about to start. I hurried to the control room, my mind still on my son\u2019s uncertain eyes.\n\nAs the train rumbled through the tunnel, a passenger\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, asking for directions to a transfer line. I was expected to answer promptly and clearly, ensuring everyone\u2019s safety and comfort. But my thoughts kept drifting back home\u2014was I too harsh, or not firm enough?
