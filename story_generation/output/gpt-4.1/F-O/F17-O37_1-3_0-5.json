It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Miss you!\u201d I haven\u2019t replied to her last text yet, and guilt prickles at me. She always says she worries when I don\u2019t check in. I want to send a quick reply, but as I stand up, I realize I\u2019m out of the special wood polish Mrs. Grant insists on for her antique table. She\u2019s very particular, and I know she expects me to manage supplies and never let this happen. My mind races\u2014should I call her now, or try to find a substitute? My phone buzzes again. I feel torn, caught between being a good child who reassures their parent and a responsible cleaner who never lets a client down. My hands tremble, holding the phone in one and the empty bottle in the other, as I stand in the middle of Mrs. Grant\u2019s spotless kitchen, not sure which role to answer first."}
