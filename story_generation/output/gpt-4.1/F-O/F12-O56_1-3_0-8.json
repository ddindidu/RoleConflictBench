My phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cRough day. Just want to talk when you\u2019re home.\u201d I could picture him, slumped on the couch, needing me to listen, to reassure him, to be present. But as my client settled into the chair, I ran my fingers through her hair and felt the thick, sticky buildup. The tangles were tight, stubborn, and I knew I\u2019d need extra time to wash and condition before I could even think about cutting. She expected me to work my magic, to make her hair feel light and fresh again. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014my husband\u2019s quiet plea for comfort, and the client\u2019s unspoken hope for transformation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, the urge to be a caring wife and a dedicated hairdresser, each demanding my full attention. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be enough for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t give all of myself to either at the same time."}
