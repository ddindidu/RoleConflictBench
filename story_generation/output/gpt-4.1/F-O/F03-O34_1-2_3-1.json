My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that tonight was the family\u2019s annual holiday dinner\u2014a tradition I\u2019d never missed. She expected me to be there, to carve the roast and lead the toast, just like Dad used to. But the airspace was a tangled web tonight, every approach fix stacked with holding patterns, pilots growing anxious as the minutes ticked by. My supervisor\u2019s voice was firm: \u201cWe need all hands on deck. No early outs.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me at the table, my team needed me at the scope. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the warmth of home and the cold precision of the radar, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
