The external auditor\u2019s email was marked urgent\u2014he needed the quarterly statements now, not later. My brother was already outside, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, cracked ramp in our driveway. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless.
