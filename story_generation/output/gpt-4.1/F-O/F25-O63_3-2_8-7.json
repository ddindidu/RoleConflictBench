My headset feels heavy, and my supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t go over your break time. We\u2019re watching the logs.\u201d I\u2019m about to log out when my stepdad\u2019s name flashes on my phone. I hesitate, but answer. His voice is shaky, and he tells me Mom\u2019s been having a hard time lately, and he doesn\u2019t know how to help her. He needs me to listen, to be there, to say something comforting. I hear the pain in his voice, and I know he\u2019s reaching out because he trusts me. But my break is ticking away, and if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get another warning. I want to be the stepchild they can lean on, but I also need this job. My heart pounds as I try to split my attention, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I can\u2019t give either what they truly need from me in this moment."}
