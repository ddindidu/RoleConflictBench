The numbers from the home loan statement echoed in my head\u2014two months until the next payment, and I needed to make sure we were covered. My son\u2019s school fees, groceries, the electricity bill\u2014every expense seemed to weigh heavier than the last. As a mother, I felt the pressure to keep our home secure, to never let my family feel the uncertainty I carried.\n\nBut as I traced the lines of the building plan, I noticed small inconsistencies. Nothing catastrophic, but enough to make me pause. As an architect, I was expected to ensure every detail was safe and compliant, no matter how minor.

My supervisor expected efficiency, my family expected stability, and I was caught in the middle, heart pounding, torn between the demands of my two worlds."}
