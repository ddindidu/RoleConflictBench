The foreman\u2019s voice is urgent\u2014\u201cThat bearing\u2019s about to seize, we need you now.\u201d I glance at the clock. My hands are still greasy, but I see the missed call from the school, and then the message: \u201cYour son was involved in a bullying incident. Please come in today.\u201d My heart sinks. I know I should be there for him, to show him right from wrong, to stand by him when he\u2019s made a mistake. But the factory floor is humming, and if that bearing fails, the whole line could go down, costing hours of work and thousands of dollars. The expectation is clear: I\u2019m the only one who can fix this, and fast. But I\u2019m also the only father my son has, and he needs me now, maybe more than ever. I stare at my hands, torn between the screech of metal and the silent plea of my child, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
