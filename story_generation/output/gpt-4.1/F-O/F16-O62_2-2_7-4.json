Their eyes lingered on the floor, and the usual warmth in their voice was missing. I knew I should sit down, ask what was wrong, and really listen\u2014Jamie always says open communication is what keeps us strong. But as I set my bag down, my phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: the lane rope was broken, and swim lessons started in less than an hour. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids\u2019 class would be chaos, and I\u2019d be letting down my team. Jamie looked up, searching my face for attention, maybe for comfort. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made to always be present for Jamie and the responsibility I felt to keep the pool running smoothly. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
