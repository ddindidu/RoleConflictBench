My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to honor our family\u2019s traditions\u2014never overcharge, always help neighbors, and treat every customer like kin. Just this morning, she\u2019d reminded me, \u201cWe don\u2019t put profit before people.\u201d \n\nNow, a customer stood before me, holding out a battered wooden toy\u2014a train, its wheels barely hanging on. Her little boy clung to her leg, eyes wide with hope. As a carpenter, I knew the repair would take hours, maybe more than the toy was worth. My training told me to quote fairly for my time and materials, to value my craft and make a living. But my family\u2019s words pressed on me, urging generosity, especially for children. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds: the daughter who must uphold our values, and the carpenter who must respect her own labor. My heart pounded as I looked from the mother\u2019s anxious face to the broken toy in my hands, caught between what I owed my family and what I owed myself."}
