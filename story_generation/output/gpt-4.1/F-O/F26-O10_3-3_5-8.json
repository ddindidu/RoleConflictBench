I knew I had to call the client, negotiate, and somehow resolve this before the business ground to a halt. But just as I hung up, my daughter\u2019s voice trembled through another call. \u201cMom, can you come over? It\u2019s Grandma. She\u2019s not well, and the kids are scared.\u201d My heart clenched.
