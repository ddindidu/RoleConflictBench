She had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I would be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I scrolled through my emails, a new message from my firm popped up\u2014urgent, flagged red. The purchase agreement for our biggest client needed a final review before the filing deadline tomorrow. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any mistakes or delays.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My daughter\u2019s hopeful face flashed before me, and then the stern, expectant look of my boss. I could almost hear the applause in the school auditorium, and at the same time, the tense silence of the office as the clock ticked toward the deadline. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
