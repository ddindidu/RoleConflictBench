She looked up, eyes wide, waiting for my approval or correction. I knew these moments mattered\u2014teaching her patience, respect, and responsibility. But my phone buzzed again, the lab group chat lighting up with urgent messages. The atmospheric sensors were ready, and the rare conditions we\u2019d waited months for were finally here. If I missed this window, years of research\u2014and our funding\u2014could be lost. My mind raced: my daughter needed my steady presence, my guidance; my team needed my expertise, my hands on the equipment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait.
