My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me not to be late for the family\u2019s holiday dinner\u2014one of those traditions she cherished, where everyone gathered, shared stories, and laughed over old memories. I knew how much it meant to her, and to my father, that I show up on time, honoring the values they\u2019d raised me with.\n\nBut as a taxi driver, I had a passenger in the backseat, a young woman nervously checking her watch every few seconds. She pleaded with me to get her to the train station as quickly as possible\u2014her train was leaving soon, and missing it would mean missing her own family\u2019s celebration. The roads were clear, the speed limit tempting me to push just a little faster. Yet, my training and the law demanded I drive safely, never risking a ticket or accident, no matter how empty the streets looked.\n\nCaught between my duty as a son and my responsibility as a driver, I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
