It was a message from my son\u2019s school: he\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and they needed me to come in and discuss it. My heart dropped. I knew how important it was to be there for him, to show the school I took this seriously, to help him understand what he\u2019d done. But as I opened the supply closet, I realized we were out of the special wood cleaner Mrs. Lee insisted on for her antique table. She\u2019d be home in two hours, and she always checked my work. If I left now, I\u2019d let her down, maybe even lose the job I needed to support my family. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the parent who didn\u2019t show up when my child needed me most. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a parent, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
