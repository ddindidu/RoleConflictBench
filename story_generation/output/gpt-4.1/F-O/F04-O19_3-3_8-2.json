The chemotherapy dose was precise, and any mistake could be catastrophic. My mind raced through the calculations, but I couldn\u2019t shake the memory of the argument I\u2019d had with my younger sister that morning. She\u2019d accused me of never listening, of always putting work first. I wanted to call her, to clear the air, to show her that I respected her feelings and that our relationship mattered. But the pharmacy was busy, and this prescription demanded my full attention. My phone buzzed with her name flashing on the screen, a reminder of the promise I\u2019d made to communicate openly and resolve our conflict. I felt torn\u2014my duty as a pharmacist was to ensure the patient\u2019s safety, but as a brother, I owed my sister my time and respect. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of family and profession."}
