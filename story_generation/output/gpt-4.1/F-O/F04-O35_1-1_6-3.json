Everyone\u2019s going.\u201d I knew she wanted me there, not just for the food, but because she wanted us to feel like a real family, to show we cared enough to include each other. I promised her last week I\u2019d try harder, be more present, not just the brother who\u2019s always too busy. \n\nBut as the train rolled into the next stop, the intercom crackled. A passenger\u2019s voice, anxious and uncertain, asked for directions to the hospital. I could hear the tension in their words, and I knew my job demanded I respond quickly and clearly, to keep everyone safe and help those who needed it. My hand hovered over the intercom button, but my mind was split\u2014my sister\u2019s expectation of family togetherness tugging at me, the responsibility to my passengers pressing just as hard. I felt the weight of both roles, the impossibility of being the brother she needed and the operator my passengers depended on, all in the same moment."}
