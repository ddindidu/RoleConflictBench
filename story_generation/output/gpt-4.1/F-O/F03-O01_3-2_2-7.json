I glanced at the unread messages\u2014questions about my day, reminders to eat, a photo of our dog. I knew she expected a reply, a sign that I was safe and thinking of them. But my laptop was open to a spreadsheet, and my inbox was filling with urgent emails from the site manager. The contractor needed my approval on the revised floor plan, and a delay now could throw the whole project off schedule. My team was waiting for my decision, and the client was already anxious about the timeline. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: the warmth and concern of my parents, the relentless pace of the construction site. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a reassuring message home and diving back into the blueprints. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
