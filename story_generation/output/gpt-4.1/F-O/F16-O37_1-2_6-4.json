They asked how my day was, and I started to mention the cleaning job, how the client\u2019s floor cleaner was almost gone and I\u2019d need to remind them before my next visit. But as I spoke, I saw my partner\u2019s eyes glaze over, and I remembered how they\u2019d once said they wished we talked about more than just work. I wanted to share, to communicate openly like a good spouse should, but I also felt the pressure of my other role\u2014if I didn\u2019t sort out the supply issue, I\u2019d be unprepared and maybe even let my client down. My mind raced: should I keep talking about my work problem, risking another evening of distant conversation, or should I change the subject to something more personal, leaving the supply issue unresolved for now? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between being the attentive spouse and the responsible cleaner."}
