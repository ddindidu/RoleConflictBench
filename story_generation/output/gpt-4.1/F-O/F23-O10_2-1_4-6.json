I felt the familiar pressure of my role as a step-parent\u2014this was one of those moments where I needed to step in, teach him about respect and discipline, and make sure he understood the importance of behaving properly in public. But just as I opened my mouth to call him over, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was an email from a vendor, a standard payment confirmation, but protocol required a prompt, formal reply. As an accountant, I knew the expectation: timely, professional communication, no matter where I was. I could feel my heart rate pick up, torn between the need to address my stepson\u2019s behavior and the obligation to respond to the vendor. My mind raced, weighing the consequences of delaying either responsibility, feeling the tension of being pulled in two directions at once."}
