I know I should step in\u2014teach her about respect for public spaces, about self-control. That\u2019s what a good parent does, especially a step-parent trying to earn trust and set boundaries. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a reminder of the trial starting tomorrow. My client\u2019s future hangs in the balance, and I need every spare moment to review evidence, anticipate arguments, and prepare for cross-examination. The pressure is immense; there\u2019s no room for distraction or delay.\n\nYet here I am, torn. If I let her behavior slide, I risk undermining my role at home, but if I stop to discipline her, I lose precious time I desperately need for my case. My mind races with the expectations of both worlds\u2014my family needing guidance, my client needing my undivided attention. I grip the shopping cart, heart pounding, caught between two lives that refuse to wait for each other."}
