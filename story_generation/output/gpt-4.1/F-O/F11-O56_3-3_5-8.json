It means a lot to her.\u201d My heart squeezed. I wanted to be there, laughing with my family, making Grandma smile. But as I glanced at the salon chair, my client\u2019s hair was a matted mess, thick with product and impossible knots. She looked at me, hopeful, trusting I\u2019d work my magic. I knew I couldn\u2019t just rush through the wash and conditioning\u2014if I did, the tangles would ruin the cut, and she\u2019d leave disappointed. My boss expected me to give every client my best, no matter what. But my family expected me to show up, to be present, to be a good sister. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. I could almost hear Grandma\u2019s voice, gentle and expectant, while my client waited, needing my skill and patience. I stood there, hands trembling, caught between the salon and my family, not knowing which part of me to let down."}
