My spouse had mentioned, not unkindly, that the kids were running out of clean clothes for their activities this week. I knew it was my turn to handle the laundry, and I wanted to do my part\u2014keep the house running smoothly, share the load. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. A customer was at the workshop door, holding a small, splintered wooden toy. Her child clung to her side, eyes wide with hope. She needed a repair quote today, she said, so her son wouldn\u2019t be disappointed any longer. I could see the expectation in her face, the trust that I\u2019d fix what was broken. I glanced back at the laundry, then at the toy, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the responsibility I felt to my craft and my customer. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the hum of the washing machine and the quiet plea in the child\u2019s eyes, unsure which demand to answer first."}
