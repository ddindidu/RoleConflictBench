The inspector\u2019s report was scathing\u2014if I didn\u2019t address the flagged safety issues tonight, production would stop tomorrow. My mind raced through protocols and checklists, calculating what could be fixed remotely and what needed my physical presence. Just then, my stepbrother walked in, eyes red, shoulders slumped. He dropped his backpack and sat at the kitchen table, silent but clearly waiting for me to notice. I remembered our promise to always be there for each other, especially after the chaos of blending our families. He needed me to listen, to be present, to help him untangle whatever had happened at school. But the plant needed me too\u2014my team was waiting for answers, and any delay could cost us dearly. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the brother who needed comfort and the job that demanded my expertise. I stood frozen, caught between the expectations of family and profession, unsure which call to answer first."}
