Can we talk later?\u201d I felt that familiar tug in my chest\u2014the one that always comes when he reaches out. I know he counts on me to check in, to ask if he and Mom are okay, to be the glue that keeps our patched-together family from falling apart. But just as I typed a quick reply, the bell above the salon door jingled. A woman stepped in, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. I recognized the look; she was new, probably anxious about trusting a stranger with her hair. My boss always says, \u201cFirst impressions matter\u2014make them feel at home.\u201d I could see her scanning the room, waiting for someone to greet her, to offer a smile and a seat. My phone vibrated again in my pocket, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the client. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urge to comfort my stepdad and the duty to welcome this woman, both expecting me to be present, to care, to make things better."}
