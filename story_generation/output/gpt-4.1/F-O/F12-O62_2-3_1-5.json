He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance as he explained the impossible choice his boss had given him. I could see the worry etched on his face, and I knew he needed me to listen, to comfort him, to help him find clarity. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was a message from the pool manager: the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if it wasn\u2019t fixed right away, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for making sure everything was in working order, and I knew the risk if I ignored it. My husband\u2019s voice wavered, and I reached for his hand, but my mind was already racing, torn between staying to support him and rushing to the pool to prevent a potential accident. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
