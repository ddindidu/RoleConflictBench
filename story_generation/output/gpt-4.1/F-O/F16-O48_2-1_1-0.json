I glanced at the screen\u2014my partner\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate message: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I knew today was the day they had to decide whether to take that risky promotion at work, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to listen, to help them sort through their fears. But Mrs. Carter was waiting, her frail hands already reaching for mine, trusting me to help her start her day with dignity and care. I could hear the expectation in both voices\u2014my partner\u2019s need for reassurance, Mrs. Carter\u2019s need for gentle assistance. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to step into the hallway and call my partner, and the responsibility to stay by Mrs. Carter\u2019s side. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
