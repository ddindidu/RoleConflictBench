I kept one eye on the water, a habit I couldn\u2019t shake, even when I was off duty. Suddenly, I saw my son slip a candy bar into his pocket at the snack stand. My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake and help him understand honesty and discipline. But just as I started to approach him, I noticed a group of swimmers drifting toward the deep end. No one seemed in immediate danger, but as a lifeguard, I was trained to never let my guard down, to always be vigilant and ready to act. I felt torn\u2014my son needed me to be his father in this moment, to address his behavior, but my lifeguard instincts screamed at me to keep my eyes on the water, to protect everyone in the pool. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of being a good father and a responsible lifeguard."}
