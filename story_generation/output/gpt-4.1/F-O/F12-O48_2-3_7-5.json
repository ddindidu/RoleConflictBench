He hadn\u2019t said much all evening, and I knew something was wrong. As his wife, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask him what was bothering him, to share my own worries about work and listen to his. We always promised to communicate openly, to never let things fester between us. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another alert from the hospital. My patient in room 204 was in critical condition, and I was responsible for checking and recording her vital signs every few minutes. The thought of missing a reading, of not being there if something changed, made my stomach twist with anxiety. I looked at my husband, then at my phone, torn between the need to be present for him and the duty to care for my patient. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, unable to choose which role to fulfill in that moment."}
