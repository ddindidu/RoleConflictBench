My parents chimed in, their faces bright with anticipation, and I felt the familiar warmth of belonging. They wanted me there, laughing and sharing stories, just like old times. But as I nodded along, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the jury trial I\u2019d been preparing for months was set to begin Friday morning. The case was high-stakes, my client\u2019s future hanging in the balance, and the court\u2019s schedule was inflexible. My family\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my input, while my mind raced with legal arguments and witness lists. I wanted to be the supportive sibling, present and engaged, but the weight of my professional responsibility pressed down hard. Torn between the comfort of home and the demands of the courtroom, I felt my chest tighten, caught in the silent tug-of-war between who I am to my family and who I must be for my client."}
