My stepbrother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school. As his step-sibling, I felt the urge to drop everything, sit with him, and let him talk it out. He needed me to listen, to be there for him, especially since our parents were both working late.\n\nBut as I glanced back at the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner, my other role tugged at me. The client I cleaned for was particular about spotless floors, and I was expected to keep track of supplies. If I didn\u2019t act now, I might not have time to buy more before the next cleaning, and I couldn\u2019t risk disappointing them. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the store\u2019s closing time.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My stepbrother\u2019s quiet sniffles echoed from the living room, while the responsibility of my job pressed on my mind. Both needed me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
