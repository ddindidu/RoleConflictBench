My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my wife. She\u2019d barely slept in days, her world unraveling after the news about her father. She needed me, needed my words, my arms, my presence. I could picture her curled on the couch, waiting for a reply, hoping I\u2019d come home early or at least call. But the clock on the wall glared at me: it was time for the pre-departure check. The passengers above trusted me to keep them safe, to make sure every system was ready, even if it wasn\u2019t a critical check. My supervisor expected punctuality, thoroughness. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s trembling voice in my mind, the silent responsibility of hundreds of lives in my hands. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between stepping onto the train for the check and stepping outside to call her."}
