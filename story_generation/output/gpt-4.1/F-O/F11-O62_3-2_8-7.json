My little sister, Mia, was among a group of teenagers clustered near the deep end, laughter echoing off the tiles. Suddenly, I saw her climb onto the pool edge, egged on by her friends, ignoring the bold red \u201cNo Diving\u201d sign. My heart clenched. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, no exceptions, to keep everyone safe. But as her sister, I knew Mia hated being called out in front of her friends\u2014she\u2019d see it as a betrayal, another reason to accuse me of acting superior. I could already imagine her glare, the cold shoulder later, the accusations that I never take her side. But if I let it slide, I\u2019d be failing my duty, risking her safety and my job. The whistle felt heavy in my hand as I wrestled with what to do, torn between the responsibility to protect and the hope of building trust with my sister."}
