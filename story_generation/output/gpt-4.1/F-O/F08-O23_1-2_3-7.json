My granddaughter had even called last night, her small voice bubbling with excitement about baking cookies together. I could almost smell the sugar and cinnamon already. But as I packed up my briefcase, my assistant poked her head into my office, her tone casual. \u201cCould you give me access to the Thompson files? It\u2019ll save you time, and I can prep the documents for Monday.\u201d I hesitated, knowing she wasn\u2019t cleared for those files. The rules were clear\u2014client confidentiality above all.
