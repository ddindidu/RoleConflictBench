Did you eat breakfast?\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my lunch, and a rundown of my day so far. That was our routine\u2014constant, reassuring communication, a way to bridge the gap that sometimes lingered between us. But as I sat in the cramped pharmacy break room, my mind was elsewhere.

I needed to stay sharp, to keep up with the changes so I could answer patients\u2019 questions and avoid mistakes.
