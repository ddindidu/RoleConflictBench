Can you transfer some money?\u201d My heart tightens. I know the bills are piling up, and my salary is what keeps us afloat. But right now, my mind is tangled in the mess of a critical service that\u2019s buckling under user load. The logs point straight to the functions I merged last night. My team expects me to fix it\u2014fast\u2014and to do it right, with code that won\u2019t break again. I can\u2019t afford to lose focus, not with the company watching. But the thought of my family, waiting for me to provide, gnaws at me. I feel pulled in two directions: the need to be the reliable provider at home, and the responsible developer at work. My fingers hover over the keyboard, paralyzed by the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give."}
