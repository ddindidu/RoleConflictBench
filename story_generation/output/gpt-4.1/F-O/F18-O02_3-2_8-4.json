The deadline was tomorrow, and I still needed to gather evidence for compliance. My phone buzzed with a text from my younger brother, asking if I could help him with his science project. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, but the pressure at work was mounting. \n\nAs I hurried home, I spotted him across the street, waving at me, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart leapt\u2014my instinct as his older sibling screamed at me to shout, to run, to make sure he was safe. But my phone vibrated again: a reminder from my manager about the compliance documents. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My brother\u2019s safety was in my hands, but so was the integrity of my team\u2019s work.
