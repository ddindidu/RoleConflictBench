Everything okay?\u201d I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, and I could already hear her voice in my head, gentle but insistent, reminding me that family means staying in touch. But right now, I was standing ankle-deep in sawdust and debris, the foreman\u2019s voice echoing across the site: \u201cNobody leaves until your area\u2019s spotless!\u201d The broom felt heavy in my hands, and I could see the other guys already sweeping, their faces set in tired determination. If I stopped to text, I\u2019d fall behind, maybe even get called out for slacking or, worse, leaving a hazard behind. But if I waited, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmom again, maybe make her feel like I didn\u2019t care. My thumb hovered over my phone, heart pounding, torn between the weight of family expectations and the demands of the job."}
