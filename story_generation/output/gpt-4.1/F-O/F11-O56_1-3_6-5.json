My hands trembled as I tried to calm the angry client in my chair, her voice rising with every complaint about her haircut. I could see my sister waiting by the door, her face hopeful. We\u2019d planned this night for weeks, a rare chance to go out together, just us. She\u2019d texted earlier, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m counting on you!\u201d I wanted to be there for her, to show her she mattered, to build the trust we\u2019d been working on. But the client\u2019s demands grew sharper, and I knew I couldn\u2019t just rush her out. My boss expected professionalism, and I prided myself on making every client feel heard, even the difficult ones. My sister\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading, while the client\u2019s voice filled the room. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
