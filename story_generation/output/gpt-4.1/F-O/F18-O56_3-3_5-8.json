My sister sent a message: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised to help with the decorations this year!\u201d I could almost hear Mom\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was for everyone to be together, especially since we hadn\u2019t all gathered in so long. But as I set my phone down, I glanced at the appointment book on my salon station. My next client, Mrs. Patel, was already waiting, her hair thick with product buildup from weeks of styling. I knew it would take extra time to wash and condition her hair properly before I could even think about cutting it. The salon was short-staffed, and my boss had made it clear that every client needed the full treatment, no shortcuts. My hands trembled as I filled the sink, torn between the warmth of family expectations and the professional standards I was expected to uphold. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give."}
