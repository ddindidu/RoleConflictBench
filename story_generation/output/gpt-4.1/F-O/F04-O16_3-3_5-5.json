Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and as the eldest brother, I was expected to set the example, to be present, to laugh and share stories, to make Mom\u2019s day special.\n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I caught sight of the anxious family waiting outside my office. Their son\u2019s test results had just come in, and the news was not good. As their doctor, I owed them honesty, clarity, and compassion. I knew I couldn\u2019t rush this conversation; they deserved my full attention, my empathy, my time.\n\nMy heart twisted as I weighed the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My family needed me to be a brother, to show up and celebrate. My patient\u2019s family needed me to be a doctor, to guide them through heartbreak. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which door I would walk through next."}
