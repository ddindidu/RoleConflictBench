Every detail mattered\u2014emergency routes, the flow between operating rooms, the placement of every door and window. My phone buzzed, and I saw my mother\u2019s message: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re leading the family ceremony this weekend. It means so much to your grandparents.\u201d My heart tightened. I knew how important it was to them, to all of us, to keep our traditions alive. They expected me to guide the rituals, to honor our ancestors, to be present in every sense. But the hospital project deadline loomed, and my team depended on me to finalize the plans. Patients\u2019 lives could hinge on my decisions. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by the weight of family legacy, the other by the responsibility to create a space that could save lives. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unable to see how I could possibly meet them all."}
