As I paid for my coffee, I caught a glimpse of him slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart sank. I knew, as his step-parent, I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with discipline and honesty. I knelt down, ready to talk to him about stealing, about trust, about making things right. But just then, my phone buzzed\u2014an emergency alert from the site. The evacuation alarm had sounded. Protocol was clear: drop everything, get to the muster point, no exceptions. My team was counting on me to be there, to be safe, to follow the rules. I looked at my stepson, his eyes wide with fear and guilt, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I was torn\u2014between the urgent responsibility to my crew and the immediate need to teach my stepson a lesson he\u2019d never forget."}
