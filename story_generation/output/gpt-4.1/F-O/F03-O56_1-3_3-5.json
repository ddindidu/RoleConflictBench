My family was waiting for me at home, the annual holiday dinner already underway. My mother had called twice, reminding me not to be late\u2014this was the one night a year everyone gathered, and I was expected to help lead the traditional toast. Just as I reached for my coat, a client stormed back into the salon, her voice sharp and accusing. She hated her haircut, she said, and demanded it be fixed immediately. My manager\u2019s eyes met mine, silently urging me to handle it with care. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the duty to my family, who would be disappointed if I missed the tradition, and the responsibility to my client, who deserved my professionalism and attention. My heart pounded as I stood between the ringing phone in my pocket and the angry woman in my chair, torn by the impossible expectations of being both a good son and a dedicated hairdresser."}
