An emergency diversion\u2014one I\u2019d never seen cut across so many boundaries\u2014demanded my full attention. My fingers hovered over the console, ready to coordinate with my colleagues, every second critical to the safety of hundreds of lives. But in the back of my mind, the numbers from this morning\u2019s bills gnawed at me. Rent was due, groceries were running low, and my son\u2019s shoes had holes in them. I needed this overtime shift; my family depended on it. Yet, the exhaustion from sleepless nights and the weight of responsibility as a mother pressed down on me. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice asking if I\u2019d be home for dinner, and I felt the ache of missing another bedtime. The demands of the tower and my family collided inside me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen for a moment, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose which role to answer first."}
