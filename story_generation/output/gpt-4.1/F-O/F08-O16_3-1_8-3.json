It was a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew Sam had been struggling lately, and as a grandmother, I felt the urge to drop everything and call immediately, to be the comforting presence my family expected. But on the other side of the door, Mrs. Patel waited for her check-up. She always came with a list of questions, and as her doctor, I owed her my full attention and clear, compassionate answers. I could already picture her anxious face, hoping for reassurance. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family needed me, but so did my patient. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the demands of my heart and my duty."}
