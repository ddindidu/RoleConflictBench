I nodded, trying to be present, but my mind was already drifting to the trial scheduled for the next morning. As a spouse, I knew I should ask questions, show I cared, and share about my own day. But I was distracted, thinking about the jury instructions I\u2019d prepared, double-checking every word in my head.\n\nThe next day, in court, I was in the middle of delivering those very instructions when my clerk slipped me a note. The Supreme Court had just issued a ruling\u2014one that completely overturned the precedent I was relying on. My heart pounded. I had to stop, reassess, and ensure I was upholding the law. But I also remembered my partner\u2019s face last night, the way they\u2019d looked at me, hoping for a real conversation. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to be fully present at home, and the demand to be vigilant and responsive as a judge. I stood there, caught between the two worlds, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
