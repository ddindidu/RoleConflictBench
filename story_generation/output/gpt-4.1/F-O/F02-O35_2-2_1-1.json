My daughter\u2019s open class was starting in twenty minutes, and she\u2019d asked me this morning, eyes wide with hope, \u201cWill you be there, Dad?\u201d I\u2019d promised I\u2019d try. But now, a signal delay flashed on my monitor\u2014just a minor one, but enough to throw off the schedule if I wasn\u2019t careful. The passengers behind me depended on me to get them to work safely and on time. I could feel the weight of their silent expectations, the trust they placed in me every day. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my wife\u2019s reminder, a photo of our daughter\u2019s smile attached. My heart twisted. If I slowed down too much, I\u2019d be late for the open class. If I pushed the train, I\u2019d risk the safety and comfort of everyone on board. I stared at the tracks ahead, torn between the world waiting at the school and the one riding behind me, both needing me in different ways, both unwilling to let go."}
