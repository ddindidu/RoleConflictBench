My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and understanding. I wanted to kneel down, look him in the eye, and talk about honesty and consequences. But before I could, my radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling all nearby officers. A protest outside was turning ugly, and they needed help. \n\nAs a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to enforce the law and keep the peace. But as a father, my son needed me right now, in this moment, to show him what integrity means. I felt torn in two, the weight of my badge pressing against the ache in my chest. My son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes met mine, and the shouts from outside grew louder. I stood there, caught between the duty to my family and the duty to my community, unsure which uniform I should wear first."}
