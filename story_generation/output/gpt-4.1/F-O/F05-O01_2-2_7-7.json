The contractor needed my input on a structural issue\u2014if I didn\u2019t respond soon, the whole project could fall behind schedule. But across from me, my wife stirred her tea in silence, her eyes distant. I\u2019d noticed her quietness all week, the way she lingered in the hallway before leaving for work, the sighs she tried to hide. I knew I should ask her what was wrong, open up the conversation like we promised we always would. But the pressure from the project was relentless; every minute I spent away from the plans felt like a risk. My mind raced between the demands of the job and the unspoken worry in her eyes. I wanted to be the husband who listened, who was present, but I also needed to be the architect who kept everything running smoothly. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
