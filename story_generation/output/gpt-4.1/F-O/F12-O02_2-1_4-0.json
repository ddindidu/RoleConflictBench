My husband had mentioned this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for their activities tomorrow. I knew he expected me to help out, to share the load, especially since he\u2019d been working late all week. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a message from my project manager: \u201cCan you join a quick call to brainstorm some new approaches?\u201d The project was still in its early stages, nothing urgent yet, but I also knew how much my input was valued in these initial discussions. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me\u2014wanting to be a reliable partner at home, but also not wanting to miss the chance to shape the direction of our work. My mind raced, weighing the expectations on both sides, feeling the pressure build as I stood between the laundry room and my laptop, uncertain which role to step into first."}
