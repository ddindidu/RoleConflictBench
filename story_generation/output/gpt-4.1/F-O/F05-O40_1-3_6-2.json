She wanted me to open up, to share more than just the surface details. I could sense her hope for a real conversation, not just the usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d But my mind kept drifting back to the job site. Tomorrow, I was supposed to start on the new frame, and I hadn\u2019t had time to check the tools. The foreman was clear: safety checks were non-negotiable. One missed inspection could mean an accident, and I couldn\u2019t let that happen. My wife\u2019s voice pulled me back, gentle but insistent, asking how I really felt. I wanted to be present, to give her the honesty she deserved, but the weight of responsibility pressed on me. If I stayed and talked, I\u2019d be late prepping for tomorrow. If I left, I\u2019d be letting her down. I sat there, torn, the expectations of husband and carpenter pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which demand to answer first."}
