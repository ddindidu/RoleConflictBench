Like, really change something?\u201d Her voice was small, uncertain. I felt the familiar tug\u2014this was my moment to offer the kind of wisdom only years could provide. I wanted to give her my full attention, to listen and guide her through the confusion of growing up.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed, insistent and sharp. The lab\u2019s monitoring system flashed a warning: the gas chromatograph was overheating, and if I didn\u2019t intervene soon, there could be a dangerous leak. As the lead scientist, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety and the integrity of our research. My mind raced with protocols and emergency procedures, but my heart ached at the thought of leaving my granddaughter in her moment of need. I could see the hope in her eyes, waiting for my answer, while the weight of my professional duty pressed down on me, demanding immediate action. I sat there, torn, the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
