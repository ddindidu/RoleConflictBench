My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my spouse\u2019s name flashes on the screen. We agreed to talk today, to finally lay everything out about our finances, to be honest about the bills piling up and the doctor\u2019s appointment I\u2019ve been avoiding. I know they expect me to be present, to listen, to share. But right now, a customer steps up, unloading groceries onto the belt, and I can\u2019t ignore them. My manager expects accuracy, no mistakes, no distractions. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be a reliable partner, to not hide anything, and the demand to be a focused cashier, to not let my personal life bleed into my work. My hands tremble as I scan a carton of milk, my mind racing between the conversation I owe my spouse and the transaction I owe my customer. The phone vibrates again. I\u2019m caught, torn, unable to give either role what they truly need from me in this moment."}
