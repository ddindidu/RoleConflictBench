My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a message from the school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in and discuss it immediately. My heart pounded. As a parent, I knew I should be there for my child, to understand what happened and show him the right path. But as a subway operator, I was expected to maintain absolute focus, especially now, with the supervisor watching my every move, ready to mark down any slip in protocol. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my child needed me, but so did the hundreds of passengers relying on me for a safe ride. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
