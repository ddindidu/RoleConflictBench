She sounded worried\u2014my grandson was struggling, and she needed advice. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to call her immediately, to offer comfort and guidance, to be the steady presence my family expects. But just as I reached for the phone, a colleague at the networking event leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re working on that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d he asked, curiosity in his eyes. The urge to share, to connect, was strong\u2014especially since he was an old friend. Yet, as a lawyer, I knew the boundaries: client confidentiality was absolute. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the cold clarity of professional ethics. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, needing me, while my colleague waited for a response. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding loyalty, each expecting me to put them first. I hesitated, caught in the silent struggle between the two worlds I belonged to."}
