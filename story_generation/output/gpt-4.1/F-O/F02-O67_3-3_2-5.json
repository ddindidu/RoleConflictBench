I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be there, especially after the call from his teacher about the bullying incident. As a father, I knew I needed to show up, to listen, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cCode Red, possible heart attack, Main and Fifth.\u201d My hands tightened on the steering wheel. My duty as an ambulance driver was clear\u2014someone\u2019s life depended on me. But my son needed me, too, maybe more than ever. I could picture his anxious face, waiting for me to walk through the school doors, hoping I\u2019d help him make sense of what he\u2019d done.

My heart pounded as I sat at the crossroads, torn between the siren\u2019s call and my son\u2019s silent plea."}
