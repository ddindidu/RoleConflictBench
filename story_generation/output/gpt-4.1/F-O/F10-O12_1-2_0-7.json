Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Sunday afternoon already. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, and guilt prickles at me. I know how much it means to my parents to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to feel connected even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes. I start typing a quick reply, promising to call soon.\n\nBut my laptop pings with another notification\u2014another bug report. The app is throwing intermittent errors, and users are frustrated. My team lead has already messaged twice, asking if I can jump on a call to troubleshoot. I feel the pressure mounting; I know how important it is to fix these issues quickly, to keep our users happy and the project on track.\n\nI stare at my phone, then at my laptop, torn between the warmth of my family and the urgency of my work. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, and I wonder how I can possibly be the daughter my parents need and the developer my team relies on\u2014all at the same time."}
