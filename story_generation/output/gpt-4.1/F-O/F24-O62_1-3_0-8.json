He was on the verge of tears, the pressure of tomorrow\u2019s final exam weighing heavily on him. I knew he needed me\u2014someone to reassure him, to remind him he was more than a grade. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married: to be there, no matter what.\n\nBut my lifeguard shift had just started, and my eyes kept darting to the pool through the glass wall. Suddenly, I spotted a small child flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits. My training screamed at me to act immediately, to enforce the rules and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But my stepbrother\u2019s voice cracked beside me, asking if I could stay just a little longer. My heart twisted, torn between the desperate need to support him and the urgent responsibility to protect someone in danger. I felt frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
