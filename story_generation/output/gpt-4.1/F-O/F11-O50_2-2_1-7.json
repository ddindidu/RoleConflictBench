It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call? I really need to talk.\u201d He never reached out unless it was serious. I stared at the message, heart pounding, but the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed from the workshop, \u201cWe need you at Line 3. The operator\u2019s messing up the settings again.\u201d I knew exactly who it was\u2014Mr. Patel, always convinced he knew better, but his constant adjustments were wasting materials and time. Management expected me to step in, correct him, and explain\u2014again\u2014how to use the machine properly. But my brother\u2019s words tugged at me. As his sister, I was supposed to be there, to listen and support him, especially when he was struggling. Yet, as the machine repairer, I was needed right now to prevent further losses and guide the operator. I stood frozen in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the urgent needs of my family and my responsibility at work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
