Family holidays meant everything to me, and I knew how much everyone expected me to keep us connected, especially now.\n\nBut as I tucked my phone away, the sharp scent of disinfectant reminded me of where I was. The hotel manager had just reminded us\u2014again\u2014about the new safety protocols. Gloves, masks, and a strict checklist for every room. No shortcuts, no exceptions. I could feel the pressure mounting; if I missed a step, I\u2019d be putting myself and others at risk. Yet, if I didn\u2019t respond to my family soon, I\u2019d be letting them down, too.\n\nStanding in the empty hallway, mop in hand, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me present and connected, but my job demanded my full attention and care. I stared at my phone, torn between the two calls on my time and heart."}
