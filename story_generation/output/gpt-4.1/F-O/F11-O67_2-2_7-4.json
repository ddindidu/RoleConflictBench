As his sister, I knew I should have been more patient, more understanding of his stubbornness, but my own temper had flared. Now, as an ambulance driver, I was expected to focus, to provide calm and competent care to whoever needed me next. The dispatcher\u2019s voice came through: a woman had fallen and broken her arm, pain management and stabilization required. I felt the familiar surge of adrenaline, but my thoughts kept drifting back to my brother\u2019s hurt expression. How could I build mutual respect with him if I couldn\u2019t even keep my cool? Yet, as I pulled up to the scene, I had to push those feelings aside. My patient needed me to be present, to be professional. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding empathy and patience at home, the other demanding swift, clinical action here. I hesitated for a moment, torn between the sister I wanted to be and the ambulance driver I was expected to be, unsure which part of me would win out."}
