As a spouse, I knew the laundry had to be done\u2014my partner had an early meeting tomorrow, and the kids needed clean uniforms for school. The pile of clothes seemed to grow by the minute, and I felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I was trained to never touch soiled laundry without gloves and a mask, to always use the right sanitizers, to never cut corners. Today, I\u2019d rushed home from work, and in my hurry, I\u2019d forgotten my gloves and mask in the car. My spouse called from the kitchen, asking if the uniforms would be ready. I stared at the laundry, torn. Should I risk skipping the safety steps to meet my family\u2019s needs, or should I stick to the protocols I knew were important? My heart pounded as I stood there, wrestling with the demands of both roles, unable to move."}
