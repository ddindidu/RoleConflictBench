Mom\u2019s text from earlier lingers in my mind: \u201cDad seems quiet lately. Everything\u2019s okay, but can you call tonight?\u201d I know what she\u2019s really asking\u2014she wants me to check in, to be the one who listens, who reassures. I want to be there for them, to ask if everything is really okay at home, to offer the support they expect from me as their child.\n\nBut my laptop screen is filled with error logs and urgent messages from QA. \u201cUsers are still getting the timeout bug,\u201d one message reads. \u201cAny update?\u201d another pings. The pressure mounts; I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to fix this, to make the app work, to keep the users happy. My team is waiting, the users are frustrated, and I know I can\u2019t let this linger.\n\nMy heart pounds as I sit between the two worlds\u2014my parents\u2019 quiet need for comfort and my team\u2019s urgent demand for solutions. I feel pulled apart, guilty for even hesitating, wishing I could be fully present for both. My finger trembles, caught between dialing home and diving back into code."}
