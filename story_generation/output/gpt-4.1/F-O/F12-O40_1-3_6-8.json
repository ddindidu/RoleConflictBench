He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than just a simple answer. I knew he wanted me to open up, to share the stress that had been building inside me. But my mind kept drifting back to the call I\u2019d received just an hour ago\u2014a client\u2019s house, the beams eaten through by termites, the structure at risk. They needed an urgent repair plan, and I was the only one available. My phone buzzed with another message from the client, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me. My husband\u2019s voice was gentle, encouraging me to talk, but I hesitated. If I told him everything, would he understand why I might have to leave again tonight? I wanted to be present, to communicate openly as a good wife should, but the demands of my work as a carpenter pulled me in the opposite direction. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, torn between the expectations of home and the urgent needs of my craft."}
