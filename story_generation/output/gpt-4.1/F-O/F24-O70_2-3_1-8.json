One particularly impatient customer kept calling, demanding updates and explanations. I tried to keep my tone polite and professional, even as my frustration simmered beneath the surface. As I walked through the door at home, I saw my step-sibling slumped on the couch, eyes red and shoulders shaking. I knew something was wrong\u2014she\u2019d had a rough day at school, and I was supposed to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort. But my phone kept vibrating in my pocket, the customer\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I felt torn in two directions: the expectation to be a supportive sibling, and the pressure to maintain professionalism with my job. My heart ached for my step-sibling, but my mind raced with thoughts of work and the consequences of ignoring the customer. I stood frozen in the hallway, caught between the demands of family and work, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
