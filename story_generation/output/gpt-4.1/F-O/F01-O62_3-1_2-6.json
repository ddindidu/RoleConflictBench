My grandson, Ethan, approached, his face clouded with worry. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important,\u201d he whispered, glancing nervously at the ground. I could see he needed me\u2014not just as a lifeguard, but as his grandfather, someone to listen and offer advice. At the same moment, I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, unsupervised, giggling as they splashed each other. My training kicked in: I needed to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and maintain order. But Ethan\u2019s voice trembled, and I could tell he was struggling with something big. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the duty of protecting all the swimmers, and toward the responsibility of being there for my grandson when he needed me most. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, and I hesitated, torn between the whistle in my hand and the boy at my side."}
