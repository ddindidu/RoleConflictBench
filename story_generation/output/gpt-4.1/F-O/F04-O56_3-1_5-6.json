Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, full of that familiar warmth and expectation. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and as a brother, I was expected to be present, to laugh, to share stories, to help set the table. But right now, I was standing behind my salon chair, scissors in hand, facing a client who smiled apologetically. \u201cI just washed my hair before coming,\u201d she said, running her fingers through her damp, clean strands. As a hairdresser, I was supposed to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before a cut\u2014salon policy, hygiene, the whole routine. My manager expected consistency, and clients expected the full experience. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: my family waiting for me to show up, my professional standards demanding I follow protocol. My heart thudded as I weighed the expectations, torn between being the reliable brother and the diligent hairdresser, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
