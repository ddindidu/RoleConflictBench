The project was behind schedule, and as the lead architect, everyone looked to me to fix it. My mind raced with solutions\u2014reassigning tasks, calling emergency meetings, drafting emails to suppliers. But across from me, my wife sat quietly, her eyes red from crying. She was in the middle of a personal crisis, and I could see how much she needed me\u2014my attention, my comfort, my presence. She reached for my hand, her grip trembling, and I felt the weight of her expectation: to be here, to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. My phone buzzed again, a reminder that my team was waiting, that the project\u2019s success depended on my leadership. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and the work that defined me. The pressure built inside me, a silent battle between being the husband she needed and the architect my team depended on."}
