My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end\u2014something serious had happened, and the family needed me right away. My heart clenched; I knew how much my presence meant to them, especially now. But before I could even stand, my hospital pager blared. The ER nurse\u2019s voice was tense: a patient had just arrived, barely conscious, with symptoms no one could identify. They needed me to diagnose, to act fast, to save a life.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, felt the weight of my family\u2019s need, and at the same time, the responsibility of my profession pressed down on me. Both worlds pulled at me with equal force\u2014my family expecting comfort and guidance, my patient depending on my expertise and swift action. My mind raced, torn between the grandfather my family needed and the doctor my patient depended on. I stood frozen, the demands of both roles crashing over me, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
