It\u2019s my mom, asking if I\u2019ve eaten and how my day is going. Normally, I\u2019d reply right away, maybe even call her to share a funny story from work. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done\u2014my parents expect me to check in every day, to keep them updated and reassure them that I\u2019m okay. But right now, my computer screen is filled with spreadsheets, numbers blurring together as I try to reconcile accounts before the month-end deadline. My manager\u2019s reminder email sits unread in my inbox, the subject line in all caps: \u201cCLOSING BOOKS\u2014NO ERRORS.\u201d I know how important it is to get everything right, to not let distractions pull me away.

My fingers hover over my phone, heart pounding, as I struggle to decide which expectation to meet first."}
