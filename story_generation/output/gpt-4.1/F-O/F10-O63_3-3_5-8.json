My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me that I was supposed to lead the family prayer at the ceremony tonight\u2014a tradition passed down for generations. She expected me to be present, to honor our family and show respect for our heritage. But my shift overlapped with the ceremony, and the new compliance system at work was ruthless. If I missed even a minute outside my scheduled break, I\u2019d be flagged, maybe even written up. My supervisor had warned us: \u201cNo exceptions, not even for family.\u201d I could hear my family setting up in the living room, laughter and the clatter of dishes, while my headset pressed against my ear, tethering me to my job.
