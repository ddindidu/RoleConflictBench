The team was discussing the new timeline, and everyone expected me to give a realistic estimate for the next phase. I could hear the expectation in my manager\u2019s voice\u2014she needed my input to keep things on track. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jamie, earbuds in, about to step outside. Through the window, I noticed he was heading straight for the street, not even glancing up from his phone. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially since our parents trusted me to keep an eye on him after school. But if I left the call now, I\u2019d miss my chance to speak, and the team would have to wait for my estimates, maybe even reschedule. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my attention at the exact same moment."}
