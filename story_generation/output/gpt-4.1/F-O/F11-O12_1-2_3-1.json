My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me for input. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present, to laugh and plan with them. But my mind kept drifting back to my laptop in the other room. The new feature I\u2019d been working on was almost done, but the last code review flagged some performance issues. My team lead\u2019s comments echoed in my head: \u201cWe need this to be clean and efficient before release.\u201d I felt the pressure to fix it, to prove myself as a reliable developer. My sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d be free Saturday. I forced a smile, but inside, I was torn. I wanted to be the supportive sister, to make memories with my family, but the weight of unfinished code and looming deadlines pressed on me. The conversation swirled around me, and I felt myself caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I could give."}
