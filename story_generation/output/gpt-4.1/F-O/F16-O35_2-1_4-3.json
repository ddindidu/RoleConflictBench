My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from my spouse: \u201cCan you please do the laundry tonight? The kids need clean uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I sigh, picturing the overflowing basket at home, the unspoken agreement that we share these chores. But just as I start to reply, the intercom crackles. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop connects to the hospital?\u201d a passenger\u2019s voice asks, tinged with worry. I know I\u2019m expected to help, to keep everyone safe and informed, especially during the evening rush. My mind races, torn between the needs of my family and the responsibility I have to the people on this train. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hover over the controls, my phone still buzzing, as I wrestle with which expectation to meet first."}
