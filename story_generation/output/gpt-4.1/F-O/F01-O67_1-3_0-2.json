She looked up at me, her eyes searching. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to take a big step? Like, when you\u2019re scared but you know you have to move forward?\u201d I could see she needed more than a simple answer\u2014she needed the kind of guidance only someone who\u2019s lived through it could give. I wanted to be present, to share my stories and reassure her that fear is part of growing.\n\nJust then, my radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 4, we have a multi-vehicle collision on Highway 17. Critical injuries reported. Immediate response required.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. Lives depended on me getting there fast. But my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face was right in front of me, waiting for the wisdom only I could offer. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I felt torn, caught between the urgency of the call and the quiet, desperate need of the person I loved most."}
