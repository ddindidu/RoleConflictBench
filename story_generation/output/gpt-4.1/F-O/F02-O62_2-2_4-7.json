He darted away, weaving between carts, laughing as he knocked over a display of apples. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for others. I opened my mouth to call him back, to remind him of the rules, when my phone buzzed. It was a live security feed from the pool where I worked as a lifeguard\u2014my shift was starting soon. On the screen, a group of teenagers was gathered at the pool\u2019s edge, ignoring the no-diving signs, their laughter echoing in my ears. I knew I was responsible for their safety, expected to enforce the rules and prevent accidents. My heart pounded as I stood in the aisle, torn between the duty to correct my son\u2019s behavior and the urgent need to intervene at the pool. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides."}
