It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My family had planned this holiday dinner for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially her. But as I zipped up my uniform, the announcement echoed through the break room: \u201cAll operators, mandatory pre-shift briefing in ten minutes.
