She\u2019d been waiting for this day, asking if I could be there when she shared it with the family. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I poured my coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my morning shift at the care home. Mrs. Lee needed her vitals checked at eight sharp, and the other residents depended on me to keep their routines steady. My supervisor always stressed the importance of punctuality and accuracy; any delay could mean missing a crucial change in someone\u2019s health. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family, the pride in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes, and the quiet responsibility I felt for my patients, who trusted me to care for them. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
