Dust and debris littered my section, and I knew if I left it half-done, I\u2019d hear about it tomorrow. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, vibrating with the familiar alarm I\u2019d set for every Thursday evening. It was time for my weekly call home. My stepmom always waited for it, and Dad would ask if I was eating well, if I was safe. They said it made them feel connected, like I was still part of the family even though I\u2019d moved out. I could already picture my stepmom\u2019s voice, a little anxious if I was late, wondering if something was wrong. I stared at the broom in my hand, then at the phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I called now, I\u2019d have to leave the site messy and risk the foreman\u2019s anger. If I stayed to clean, I\u2019d break the promise I made to my family. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
