Mom says you have to be there this time.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, half teasing, half pleading. I knew how much it meant to them, especially after missing the last few gatherings because of work. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I wanted to be. But as I walked through the pool area for my morning shift, my heart sank. The lane rope was snapped, floating uselessly in the water. Swim lessons started in an hour, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the whole schedule would be thrown off. My supervisor always emphasized how important it was to keep everything in top shape, and I took pride in that responsibility. I could feel the pressure building\u2014my family expecting me to show up, my job demanding I stay and fix the problem. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
