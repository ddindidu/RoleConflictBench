His eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance as he described the impossible choice his boss had given him. He needed me\u2014his wife\u2014to listen, to help him sort through the tangle of options, to remind him he was capable and not alone. I wanted nothing more than to hold his hand, to stay up all night if that\u2019s what it took, to be the partner he needed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders: opening statements for the trial were in less than an hour. My client\u2019s future, their business, their family\u2019s security, all rested on my preparation and presence in that courtroom. There was no one else to step in, no way to postpone. I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would fight for them with everything I had.\n\nTorn between the man I love and the oath I swore, my heart pounded with guilt and anxiety. I could see the hope in my husband\u2019s eyes, and I could feel the pressure of my client\u2019s case pressing in on me. I took a shaky breath, knowing I had to choose."}
