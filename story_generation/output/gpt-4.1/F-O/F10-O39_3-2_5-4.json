It was our family\u2019s tradition, and I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the site supervisor. There was a spill on the walkway, and I was the only one nearby. If I didn\u2019t clean it up right away, someone could get hurt. My hands trembled as I looked at the tray, then at the door. My family needed me to honor our traditions, to be the daughter they expected. But my crew depended on me to keep them safe, to do my job as a responsible laborer.
