It was a simple cold medicine, but I always made sure the label matched the medication exactly. As I was about to hand it over, my phone buzzed with a message from my mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute? Dad seems down today.\u201d I felt a familiar tug in my chest. I knew my parents counted on me to check in, to be the one who noticed when something was off. But right now, I had a line of customers waiting, and my focus needed to be on accuracy\u2014one mistake could have serious consequences. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My parents needed me to be present, to ask if everything was okay at home. My patients needed me to be precise, to keep them safe. I stood there, prescription in hand, torn between the son my parents hoped for and the pharmacist my patients depended on, unsure which demand to answer first."}
