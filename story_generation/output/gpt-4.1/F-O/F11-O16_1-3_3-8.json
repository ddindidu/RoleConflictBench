My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and I felt the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being just a sister for a while. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. A patient had arrived in the ER with a severe, fast-spreading infection. The team needed my expertise to prescribe the right antibiotics, and every minute counted. My mother looked at me expectantly, waiting for my input on the plans, her eyes hopeful that I\u2019d finally have a free weekend. My heart twisted as I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be present, to laugh and plan and be the sister they missed. But I also knew a life might depend on my swift decision as a doctor. The voices around me faded as I sat frozen, torn between the family I loved and the duty I could not ignore."}
