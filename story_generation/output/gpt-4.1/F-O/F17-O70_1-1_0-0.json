As I pulled up to the next house, my phone vibrated again. This time, it was a message from Mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this weekend. Everything okay?\u201d I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially since I\u2019d promised to text her every Saturday. \n\nBut right now, I was supposed to be focused on my job\u2014delivering this package before the customer started calling the office to complain.
