They asked about my day, and I knew they wanted more than just a quick answer\u2014they wanted me to open up, to share. I started to mention a patient who came in with a prescription for a common cold, but my mind drifted back to the pharmacy. I remembered double-checking the medication, making sure the label matched, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing on me. If I made a mistake, it could hurt someone. But here, at home, the expectation was different. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to let them in, to be present. I felt torn, my thoughts pulled back to the pharmacy, replaying every step, every check. I wanted to reassure my partner, to be the spouse who communicates openly, but the pharmacist in me couldn\u2019t let go of the need for accuracy and vigilance. The two roles tugged at me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, caught between the need to connect and the need to be certain."}
