The siren wails, echoing my own racing heart. In the back, a young man fights for breath, his life hanging on every second I shave off this drive. My radio crackles, but my phone buzzes too\u2014my daughter\u2019s name lights up the screen. I know why she\u2019s calling. My granddaughter is in trouble, her world unraveling, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to listen, to help. But now, I\u2019m needed here, every ounce of focus demanded by the storm and the slippery roads. My hands tremble, torn between the duty to my patient and the desperate need to comfort my family.
