I really need you.\u201d I knew they\u2019d been struggling with that big decision at work, and I could almost hear the anxiety in their words. I wanted nothing more than to call, to listen, to reassure them that I was there, that we\u2019d figure it out together. But just as I reached for my phone, the call bell rang from Room 204. Mrs. Jenkins, my patient, had just learned her cancer had returned. When I entered, she was sobbing, clutching a tissue, her eyes searching mine for comfort. She needed me too\u2014needed me to sit with her, to hold her hand, to help her feel less alone in that moment. My heart pulled in two directions, I felt the weight of both their needs pressing down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the person I love at home and the person who needed me right here, right now."}
