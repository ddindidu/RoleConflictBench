Today was the family gathering I\u2019d promised my daughter I wouldn\u2019t miss. My grandkids had been talking about baking cookies together all week, and I could already picture their flour-dusted faces and hear their laughter. But as I slipped on my shoes, my phone buzzed\u2014a last-minute delivery assignment. The address was across town, and the customer had left strict instructions: the package must not be left unattended, and someone had to sign for it. I knew how important it was to do my job right; a missed delivery could mean a complaint or worse, a lost client. My supervisor had reminded me just yesterday how crucial reliability was. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, cookie cutters in the other, torn between the warmth of my family waiting for me and the responsibility of ensuring someone\u2019s much-anticipated package arrived safely. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of wanting to be everywhere I was needed, all at once."}
