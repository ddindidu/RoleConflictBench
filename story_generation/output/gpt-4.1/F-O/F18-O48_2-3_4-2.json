Mom had been planning this family gathering for weeks, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories around the table. But as I tucked my phone away, the call bell rang from Mr. Harris\u2019s room. He was one of my regular patients, and today his arthritis was flaring up badly. When I entered, he was struggling to hold his spoon, his face twisted in pain. \u201cCould you help me, please?\u201d he asked, his voice trembling. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family wanted me home, present and cheerful, but Mr. Harris needed me now, in this moment, to help him with something as simple as eating. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the immediate, pressing needs of my patient."}
