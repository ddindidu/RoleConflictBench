My spouse poured us both tea and slid into the chair across from me, their eyes warm but tired. \u201cToday was rough,\u201d they said, voice soft, \u201cI could really use someone to talk to.\u201d I nodded, trying to listen, but my mind kept drifting back to the urgent email from the auditor. The request for financial statements was marked \u201cimmediate\u201d\u2014a word that echoed in my head like a warning bell. I knew the company depended on my accuracy and timeliness, and any mistake could have serious consequences. But as my spouse continued, their words growing more vulnerable, I felt the weight of their expectation too: to be present, to communicate, to share in the small moments that make up our life together. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the numbers demanding my attention, and toward the person who needed me just as much. I stared at the screen, then at my spouse, caught in the silent struggle between duty and devotion, not yet sure which role would win tonight."}
