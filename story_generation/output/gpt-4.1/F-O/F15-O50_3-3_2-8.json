The school counselor\u2019s voice was tense\u2014my child had been caught bullying a classmate, and they needed me to come in immediately. My heart sank. I knew I had to be there, to listen, to help her understand the gravity of her actions, to show her I cared enough to guide her through this mistake. But as I grabbed my keys, another call came through\u2014this time from the factory floor. The new staff were about to start a hazardous batch, and they hadn\u2019t been briefed on the safety protocols. If I didn\u2019t intervene, someone could get hurt. My team expected me to be the expert, the one who kept everyone safe. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My daughter needed her parent. My team needed their repairer. I could only be in one place."}
