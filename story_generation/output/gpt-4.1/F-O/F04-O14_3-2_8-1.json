It\u2019s important.\u201d We\u2019d argued last week, and I knew he wanted to clear the air. As his brother, I owed him honesty and respect, a chance to talk things through and rebuild trust. But my mind kept drifting to the lab schedule taped above my desk. The specialized spectrometer I needed was only available tonight, and my experiment\u2014months in the making\u2014depended on this narrow window. If I missed it, I\u2019d lose weeks of work and risk falling behind on my research. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the brother who listens and repairs, or the scientist who seizes a rare opportunity. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
