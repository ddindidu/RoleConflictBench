He was upset about something I\u2019d said the night before, and I could hear the hurt in his words. I knew I needed to be patient, to listen and show him respect, even if we didn\u2019t always see eye to eye. As I tried to focus on his feelings, I glanced up and noticed a small puddle of oil glistening on the walkway nearby. My supervisor had drilled it into us: any spill, no matter how minor, had to be cleaned up right away to keep everyone safe. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my brother needed me to be present and understanding, but my job demanded immediate action. My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of someone slipping against the risk of my brother feeling dismissed. I gripped the phone tighter, torn between the expectations of being a good brother and a responsible worker, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
