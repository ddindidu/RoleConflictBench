I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach her about respect and discipline. I knew I should call her back, explain why her behavior wasn\u2019t acceptable, and guide her gently but firmly. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the hospital\u2014one of my patients, Mrs. Carter, was recovering from surgery, and her vital signs were slightly elevated. The nurse on duty needed me to come in and help monitor her, to take her temperature and pulse, to make sure she was safe. My mind raced. I was torn between the responsibility of being a good step-parent, shaping Mia\u2019s values in this small but important moment, and the duty of being a reliable nursing assistant, ensuring my patient\u2019s well-being. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
