Can we talk later?\u201d I knew he needed me to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, to be the supportive step-child I\u2019d promised to be. Just then, two travelers approached, dragging heavy suitcases. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, already opening the trunk. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be professional, efficient, and courteous\u2014no distractions, no delays. My stepdad\u2019s message tugged at me, but the travelers were waiting, watching for any sign of hesitation. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of their expectations pressing against the responsibility I felt toward my family. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, but my hands were full with luggage, my mind torn between the backseat and the living room at home."}
