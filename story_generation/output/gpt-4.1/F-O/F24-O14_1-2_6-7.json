Mom always reminded me to look out for him, especially since he was still getting used to the neighborhood. I kept an eye on him, making sure he didn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the lab safety audit in an hour. I\u2019d left some equipment in less-than-perfect condition, and if I didn\u2019t get there soon, the issues might be flagged again, putting my research at risk.\n\nSam slowed down, distracted by a stray cat darting across the street. I felt the urge to hurry him along, but he looked up at me, expecting patience and care. My mind raced with the lab\u2019s demands: protocols, checklists, the pressure to be thorough and responsible. But here, on this street, my responsibility was different\u2014protective, present, and gentle. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
