It was Sunday afternoon, and I knew it was probably my mom, checking in like she always did. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d text back more often, just a quick message to let her know I was okay. She worried, especially since I started this job. I glanced at the screen\u2014her name lit up, a simple \u201cHow are you today?\u201d blinking at me.\n\nBut the radio crackled, and dispatch\u2019s voice cut through: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall, possible fracture, 5th and Main.\u201d I felt the familiar surge of adrenaline. Someone needed me, needed my hands steady and my mind focused. I pictured my mom waiting for my reply, her worry growing with every minute of silence. At the same time, I pictured the patient, scared and in pain, depending on me to do my job.\n\nI gripped the wheel tighter, torn between the son my parents needed and the ambulance driver my patient expected. The phone buzzed again, and the siren wailed louder, both demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
