The scheduling order was due by Friday, and I knew the attorneys would be waiting for my clear, detailed instructions. My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, I got the job! Can we talk tonight?\u201d Her excitement leapt from the screen, and I felt a surge of pride. I knew how much this meant to her, and I could already imagine the family group chat lighting up with congratulations if I called and shared her news. But the draft order loomed over me, and I could hear the echo of my own voice in chambers, reminding junior judges of the importance of timely, thorough opinions. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate milestones and keep our bonds strong. The court expected precision and punctuality. I stared at the phone, then at the empty document, my heart tugged in two directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
