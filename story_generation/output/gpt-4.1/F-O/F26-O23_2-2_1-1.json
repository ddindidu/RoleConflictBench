The clock ticked louder with every passing minute, reminding me of the looming deadline for the purchase agreement. My mind raced through clauses and contingencies, searching for any hidden pitfalls. Just then, my granddaughter shuffled in, her shoulders slumped, eyes downcast. I recognized that look\u2014something was weighing heavily on her. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to set aside my work, offer her a warm hug, and listen to whatever was troubling her. She needed my guidance, my reassurance, the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over a lifetime. But the contract on the table demanded my full attention; a single oversight could have serious consequences for my client. My heart ached as I glanced between her and the stack of papers, torn between the expectations of my profession and the needs of my family. I could feel the pressure mounting, the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
