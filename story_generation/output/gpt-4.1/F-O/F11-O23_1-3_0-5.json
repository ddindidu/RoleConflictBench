As his sister, I\u2019d promised to be there, to cheer him on, to celebrate the years of hard work that led to this moment. But as I set my phone down, my eyes landed on the thick stack of files on my desk\u2014the trial I\u2019d been preparing for months was set to begin the same morning. The judge had already denied any requests for postponement; my client\u2019s future, and a substantial sum of money, hung in the balance. My firm expected me to be in court, fully present and unflinching. My brother expected me in the audience, camera in hand, sharing his joy. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I felt torn in two, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
