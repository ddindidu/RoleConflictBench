My sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I hesitated. She never called during work hours unless it was serious. I answered, and her voice trembled\u2014she\u2019d just broken up with her partner and needed me. My heart twisted; I wanted nothing more than to rush to her side, to be the supportive sister she\u2019d always been for me.\n\nBut the plans in front of me demanded my attention. I\u2019d just spotted a potential flaw in the stairwell design\u2014if left unaddressed, it could be a safety hazard. The contractor was waiting for my approval to move forward, and any delay could set the whole project back. My team and the community were counting on me to ensure everything was safe and up to code.\n\nI stared at the phone in my hand, torn between the urge to comfort my sister and the responsibility to protect future building occupants. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt utterly paralyzed."}
