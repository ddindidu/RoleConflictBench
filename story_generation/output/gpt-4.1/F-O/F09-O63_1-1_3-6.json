My daughter sits across from me, fidgeting with her spoon, milk dribbling down her chin. She\u2019s supposed to be learning table manners, and I promised myself I\u2019d be patient, guiding her through each meal. \u201cChew with your mouth closed, sweetheart,\u201d I remind her gently, but my eyes flick to the clock. My scheduled break is almost over, and I know my supervisor expects me back on calls, even if the call volume is light today. I could take a few extra minutes\u2014everyone does when it\u2019s slow\u2014but I worry about setting a bad example for my daughter if I rush through this moment. She looks up at me, waiting for my attention, and I feel the tug between being the mother she needs and the employee I\u2019m supposed to be. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: teach her right from wrong, or stick to my work schedule. I hover, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
