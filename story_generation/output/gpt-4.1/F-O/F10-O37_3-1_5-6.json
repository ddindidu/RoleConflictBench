Today was the day of our family\u2019s annual ancestral ceremony, and this year, I was expected to lead the rituals\u2014an honor and a responsibility that meant everything to my parents. They believed it was my turn to uphold our traditions, to show respect and devotion in front of everyone. But as I scrubbed the counters, I glanced at my hands, raw and red from cleaning without gloves. My supervisor at the housekeeping job always reminded me: gloves must be worn for every task, no exceptions, for my own safety and hygiene. Yet, the ceremony required bare hands\u2014no barriers between me and the sacred objects. My mother\u2019s voice grew more insistent, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. I wanted to make my family proud, but I also feared the consequences at work and for my health. My heart pounded as I stared at the gloves, torn between the expectations of my family and the demands of my job, unsure which part of myself I could let down."}
