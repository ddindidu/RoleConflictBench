My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, a gentle reminder that we agreed to share the chores, and it\u2019s my turn to fold. I nod, guilt prickling at my conscience, but my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s a message from work\u2014one of the new staff is about to run a batch on the industrial press, and I know they haven\u2019t been properly trained on the safety protocols. My mind races: if I don\u2019t intervene, someone could get hurt, but if I ignore the laundry again, I\u2019m letting my partner down, breaking the promise we made to support each other at home. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, standing in the living room, laundry in one hand and phone in the other, heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
