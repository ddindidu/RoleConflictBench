I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her, and as her husband, I felt the pull to reach across the table, to ask, to listen, to be present. We\u2019d promised each other to share our worries, to never let silence build walls between us. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the latest batch of research results needed to be logged. The data was fresh in my mind, and though the lab allowed some flexibility, I knew the importance of accuracy and timeliness in my work as a scientist. If I waited, details might blur, and the integrity of my report could suffer. I looked at my wife, her eyes searching mine, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart tugged me toward her, but my mind ticked through the steps of documentation, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
