My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d Guilt prickles at my skin; I know I\u2019ve been absent, buried in lab work, but the chores can\u2019t keep falling on them. I nod, promising I\u2019ll help after dinner.\n\nBut my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the lab. The atmospheric conditions I\u2019ve been waiting months for are finally here. If I don\u2019t run the experiment tonight, I might lose my only chance to gather the data I need before the funding review. My heart pounds. The experiment could make or break my research, but the laundry is a tangible reminder of my promise at home. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stand frozen, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the call of the lab, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
