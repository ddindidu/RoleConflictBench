My mom and dad sat on a bench nearby, their faces drawn and tired, voices low as they spoke. Lately, they\u2019d seemed so worn out, and I knew they needed me\u2014just a smile, a reassuring word, anything to show I cared. But as I glanced over, a sudden splash caught my attention. A swimmer in the middle of the pool was flailing, clearly in trouble. My training screamed at me to focus, to be ready to jump in at any second. Yet, my heart ached to go to my parents, to offer comfort, to be the child they needed right now. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, my mind torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet, desperate need of my family."}
