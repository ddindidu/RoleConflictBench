My wife\u2019s text flashed on my phone: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d been struggling for weeks, and I promised I\u2019d be there whenever she needed to talk. But just as I reached for my phone, my screen lit up with a call\u2014my supervisor\u2019s number. I had to take it. On the other end, a customer\u2019s voice crackled, sharp and angry, demanding to know why our offer was worth their time. My manager expected me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the customer on the line, to not let the company down. But my wife\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more desperate. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to the customer\u2019s accusations, my mind split between the script I was supposed to follow and the words I wanted to say to comfort my wife. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to answer first."}
