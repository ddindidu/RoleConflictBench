My parents look forward to these conversations, and I know how much it means to them to hear about my week, to share their stories, to feel connected. But tonight, my mind is tangled in the technical diagrams spread across my desk. At work, we\u2019re in the early stages of a new project, and my manager just emailed, asking for fresh ideas by tomorrow morning. I know the team is counting on me to propose innovative solutions, and I want to prove myself. I stare at my phone, guilt prickling at the thought of letting my parents down, but the pressure to deliver at work is just as heavy. I can\u2019t focus on both at once, and the weight of these expectations presses in from both sides, leaving me paralyzed, phone in hand, caught between being a good son and a dedicated engineer."}
