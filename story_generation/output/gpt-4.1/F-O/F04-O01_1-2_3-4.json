My family\u2019s voices swirled around me, laughter and suggestions bouncing off the walls as they debated where to go this weekend. My younger sister nudged me, \u201cYou have to come this time. We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I smiled, trying to sound enthusiastic, but my mind kept drifting back to the office floor plan glowing on my screen. The deadline was tight, and I still hadn\u2019t figured out how to fit the break area without sacrificing workspace. My boss expected nothing less than perfection, and I knew every detail mattered. Yet, my family\u2019s hopeful eyes pulled at me, expecting me to be present, to join in the fun and make memories. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my creativity and focus, the other my warmth and presence. My heart raced as I tried to listen to both, feeling the tension build, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either what they truly wanted at the same time."}
