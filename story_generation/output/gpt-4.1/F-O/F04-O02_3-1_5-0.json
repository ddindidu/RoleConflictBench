It means a lot to her.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, reminding me how rarely we\u2019re all together. As a brother, I knew how much my family counted on me to show up, to be present, to laugh and share stories. But my laptop sat open on the table, blueprints and notes scattered around. At work, I was the engineer everyone turned to for new ideas. The project was still in its early stages, but my manager expected me to propose innovative solutions soon. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my team\u2019s trust in my technical insight. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of home and the challenge of creation. I wanted to be the brother who never missed a moment, and the engineer who never let his team down. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which part of me would have to wait."}
