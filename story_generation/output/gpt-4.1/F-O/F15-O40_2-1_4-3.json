My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an email from the client, asking for a quick estimate on materials so they could approve the budget. I knew I needed to sit down, run the numbers, and get the order in before the supplier\u2019s cutoff. But just as I started mentally calculating board feet and hardware, my son darted away from my side, weaving between displays and nearly knocking over a stack of cereal boxes. Other shoppers glanced over, some with disapproving looks. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014wasn\u2019t I supposed to teach him discipline, show him how to behave in public? But the numbers from the order kept swirling in my head, and I knew if I didn\u2019t respond soon, the whole project could be delayed. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between calling my son back and pulling out my phone to reply to the client, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
