My heart skipped. The message was urgent\u2014there was a discrepancy in last quarter\u2019s filing, and they needed clarification by the end of the day. I knew the consequences of missing the deadline: penalties, audits, and a tarnished reputation. My mind raced through possible explanations, but before I could even start drafting a response, I heard the front door creak. Glancing up, I saw my younger brother, headphones in, heading straight for the street, eyes glued to his phone. I could see a car coming fast around the corner. My instincts screamed at me to shout, to run after him, to make sure he was safe. But the tax notice loomed in my mind, demanding my immediate attention. I felt torn, my chest tight with anxiety, caught between the responsibility to protect my brother and the professional duty to respond to the tax authority. I froze, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
