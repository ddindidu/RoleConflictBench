It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew my son had been struggling lately, and the word \u201curgent\u201d sent a chill through me. But just as I reached for my phone, the passenger emergency alarm blared through the train. Instinct took over\u2014I had to focus. The safety of everyone on board depended on me. I could hear the panic in the voices coming from the intercom, someone was having a medical emergency in the next car. My hands trembled as I radioed for help, my mind torn between the crisis unfolding in my family and the one right in front of me. I was expected to be the calm, reliable operator, but also the caring, ever-present grandmother. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and for a moment, I didn\u2019t know which responsibility to answer first."}
