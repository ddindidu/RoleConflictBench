As a grandmother, I knew my family expected me to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. My heart ached to call her back, to reassure her that everything would be alright, to be the steady presence my family needed. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized I was already running late for the job site. As a carpenter, I was expected to be punctual, to set an example by following every safety protocol, never rushing or cutting corners. If I hurried, I might forget my safety gear or miss the morning briefing\u2014putting myself and others at risk. My phone buzzed again, my daughter\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of my family and the demands of my work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which responsibility I should answer first."}
