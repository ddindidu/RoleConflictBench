He\u2019d been caught lying to his teacher about finishing his homework, and I knew I needed to talk to him about honesty and responsibility. As his step-parent, I wanted to guide him, to help him grow into someone who values truth. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the station. I was needed in court tomorrow to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to be present and truthful in court, no matter what. My wife looked at me, concern in her eyes, knowing how important both things were. I felt torn\u2014my stepson needed me here, now, to teach him the right path, but my duty as an officer demanded my presence elsewhere. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility I should answer first."}
