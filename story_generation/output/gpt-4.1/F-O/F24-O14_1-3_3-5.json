My stepbrother nudged me, grinning as he tossed out ideas for our weekend\u2014hiking, a movie marathon, maybe even a family barbecue. My stepmom\u2019s eyes sparkled with hope, silently urging me to join in, to be present, to help knit our patchwork family closer. But my mind kept drifting to the looming journal deadline. The data needed one more check, the discussion section was unfinished, and my advisor\u2019s reminder emails echoed in my head: \u201cAccuracy is everything. No shortcuts.\u201d I tried to laugh along, but my heart pounded with guilt. If I excused myself, I\u2019d disappoint my family, reinforcing the distance they already felt. If I stayed, my research\u2014months of careful work\u2014might fall short of the standards I set for myself. The conversation swirled around me, and I felt split in two, torn between the warmth of belonging and the cold precision of my scientific duty."}
