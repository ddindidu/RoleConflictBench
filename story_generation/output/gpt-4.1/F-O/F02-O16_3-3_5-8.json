The store manager\u2019s stern voice echoed in my ears\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a father, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and firmness. But as I knelt to speak to him, my eyes caught the message on my pager: a patient in the ER, a rapidly spreading infection, time critical. My mind raced. My son needed me to be present, to help him understand right from wrong, but my patient needed me to act fast, to make a life-saving decision. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my heart torn between the duty to my child and the oath I\u2019d taken as a doctor.

I stood there, caught between two lives, unable to move, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
