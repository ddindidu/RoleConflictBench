It was a message from my partner: \u201cI need you. Please call me.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in their voice, the weight of the crisis they\u2019d been struggling with for weeks.

But as I looked up, a nurse rushed over, her face pale. \u201cDoctor, we have a patient in critical condition\u2014unknown illness, severe symptoms. We need you now.\u201d The expectation was clear: I was the doctor, the one who had to make sense of chaos, to diagnose and act quickly, to save a life.
