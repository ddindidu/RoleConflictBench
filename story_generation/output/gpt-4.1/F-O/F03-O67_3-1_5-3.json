It was a tradition my father had passed down, and now, as the eldest son, everyone expected me to honor it. I could see the pride in my mother\u2019s eyes, the anticipation in my younger siblings\u2019 faces. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the station. I was on shift, and it was my responsibility to check the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit before the night began. If I missed something, a patient\u2019s life could be at risk. My supervisor had stressed the importance of diligence, and I knew my team relied on me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the pull of family and the call of duty. My hands trembled as I looked from the family altar to my uniform hanging by the door, torn between the expectations of a devoted son and a vigilant ambulance driver."}
