Lately, I\u2019d noticed the deepening lines on their faces, the way their conversations trailed off into sighs. As their child, I felt a pull to be there for them, to offer comfort, to listen, to remind them they weren\u2019t alone. Yet, as a lawyer, I had a procedural hearing scheduled for the afternoon. It was a minor matter, one that could be postponed without much consequence, but I knew my client expected me to be present, to show commitment and reliability. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the hearing, and I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to sit with my parents, to ask what was wrong, to be the support they needed. But I also felt the tug of professional duty, the unspoken promise to my client. My heart pounded as I sat between the two roles, torn by the demands of family and career, unsure which path to take."}
