The journal\u2019s submission portal was open in another tab, the countdown to the deadline ticking away. My phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner\u2019s at 7. Mom really wants us all together tonight.\u201d I could almost hear the expectation in his words\u2014after all, I was still the \u201cnew\u201d sibling, and these dinners were supposed to help us bond. But the thought of leaving my work unfinished, risking errors in my data or missing the deadline, made my stomach twist. My lab supervisor had reminded me just this morning: \u201cAccuracy and timeliness are everything in science.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the warmth and acceptance of my new family, the other toward the cold, exacting standards of my profession.
