Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I know she worries, especially since I moved out, and I promised I\u2019d check in more often. I start typing a reply, but just then, my work phone rings. The plant manager\u2019s voice is tense\u2014one of the old packaging machines is acting up, and no one else can figure it out. Even though it\u2019s a slow weekend, he wants it fixed before Monday. I glance at the half-written text to Mom, guilt prickling in my chest. She just wants to know I\u2019m okay, to feel connected. But the manager expects me to drop everything and get the machine running, no matter the hour. I stare at both phones, feeling pulled in two directions\u2014one by the quiet, persistent love of my family, the other by the urgent, unspoken demand to keep the factory moving. My fingers hover, uncertain, as I wrestle with which part of me should answer first."}
