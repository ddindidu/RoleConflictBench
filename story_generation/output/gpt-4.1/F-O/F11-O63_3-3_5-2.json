The customer is furious.\u201d My headset felt heavier than usual. At the same time, my sister\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, \u201cCome on, we\u2019re leaving in ten minutes! Don\u2019t make us late for Grandma\u2019s birthday.\u201d I could hear laughter and the clatter of dishes as my family gathered, expecting me to join them for the celebration. But the customer on the line was relentless, questioning every detail of our offer, his tone sharp and impatient. My manager expected me to calm him, to salvage the sale, to prove I could handle tough calls. My family expected me to be present, to help make memories, to show I cared. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to the customer\u2019s complaints, but my mind kept drifting to the family waiting for me. I felt torn, pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which voice I should answer first."}
