He looked up, eyes wide, waiting for my approval or correction. I knew these moments mattered\u2014teaching him respect, discipline, the small habits that shape character. But my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the lab\u2019s quarterly equipment check was due tomorrow. As lead scientist, I was expected to ensure every protocol was followed, every instrument inspected, even if nothing seemed amiss. The team relied on my diligence; a missed step could mean safety risks or lost data. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014should I stay and guide my son through his morning routine, reinforcing the values I want him to carry, or head to the lab early to double-check the maintenance logs and set an example of responsibility for my colleagues? I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect."}
