It was my sister, her voice trembling as she told me about the news\u2014something so heavy, it left me speechless. She needed me, she said, just to sit with her, to listen, to be her brother. I could hear the tears in her words, and my heart ached to drop everything and go to her. But as I hung up, my work phone rang. The client\u2019s order had just come in, and I was expected to estimate materials and place the supply order by noon if I wanted the delivery on time. The shop was already behind schedule, and my boss had made it clear: no more delays. I stared at the unfinished bookshelf, the order forms, and my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands shook, torn between the pull of family and the demands of my craft, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
