My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call tonight? Jamie wants to tell you all about her new job!\u201d I could almost hear the excitement in her voice, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to Jamie\u2014that I was part of these moments. But my laptop screen glared back at me, the unfinished module mocking my inability to focus. The team was waiting on me; the project manager had already sent two emails asking for updates. If I didn\u2019t deliver tonight, the entire build would stall, and the pressure from the client was mounting. I felt torn, my heart pulled toward my family, my mind tethered to my responsibilities as an engineer. I wanted to be present for Jamie, to celebrate her new beginning, but I also knew the weight of my role at work. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, phone in hand, unable to move, caught between the people I love and the work that defines me."}
