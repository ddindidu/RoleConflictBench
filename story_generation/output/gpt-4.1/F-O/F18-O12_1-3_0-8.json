I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear her voice trembling, and I knew how much she depended on me to calm her nerves before big tests. But as I reached for my phone, a Slack notification popped up on my laptop\u2014urgent, all caps: \u201cPRODUCTION DOWN. Users locked out. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart pounded. I recognized the bug; it was in a module I\u2019d written last week. The team was counting on me to fix it, and every minute the service was down, more customers were affected.\n\nI stared at the two screens, feeling pulled in opposite directions. My sister needed me to be her anchor, to listen and reassure her. My team and our users needed me to be the problem-solver, to dive into the code and restore the service. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on my chest, my mind racing with guilt and worry, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
