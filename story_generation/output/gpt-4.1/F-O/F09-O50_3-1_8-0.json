The old packaging machine, silent for months, had started acting up just as production slowed. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need it running perfectly, just in case orders pick up.\u201d I knew what was expected\u2014diagnose the glitch, fix it fast, keep the line ready. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the home loan repayment was looming, and I needed to make sure we had enough saved. Every overtime hour counted, every minute spent troubleshooting meant more money for my family. Yet, my son\u2019s school called earlier, asking if I could attend his parent-teacher meeting. I felt the weight of being a mother, wanting to be present, to reassure him that I cared. The pressure built inside me\u2014should I stay late to fix the machine and secure our finances, or leave on time to be the mother my son needed? The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, the machine\u2019s blinking light matching the anxious thump of my heart."}
