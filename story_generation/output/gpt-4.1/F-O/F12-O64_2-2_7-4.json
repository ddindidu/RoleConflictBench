My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014another message from my husband. He\u2019d seemed distant lately, and I knew I should talk to him, ask what was wrong, like a good wife should. We always promised to share our worries, to be open. But right now, a customer stood in front of me, frustration etched on her face, holding a blender she wanted to return. No receipt. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. She pleaded, explaining her situation, and I felt the weight of her disappointment. My manager watched from across the aisle, expecting me to enforce the rules. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the urge to be compassionate and the need to do my job right. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to my husband, to the conversation I owed him, the support he needed. I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
