My phone buzzed with a new email\u2014my client needed clarification on a confusing line item from their latest invoice, and they sounded frustrated. I knew I had to respond quickly and clearly, or risk damaging our professional relationship. At the same time, the kitchen timer beeped, reminding me that the sheets were still in the dryer and the living room was only half-dusted. My husband called from the hallway, asking if I could help him rearrange the furniture before his cousins arrived in an hour. The house was far from ready, and I could already imagine the judgmental glances from his relatives if everything wasn\u2019t spotless. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the unspoken expectation that I would make our home shine for our guests. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the chaos, laptop open on the counter, cleaning spray in hand, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
