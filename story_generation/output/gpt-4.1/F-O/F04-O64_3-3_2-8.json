My manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cStay positive, no matter what.\u201d I forced a smile as the next customer, red-faced and impatient, slammed her items on the counter. \u201cCan you hurry up? I\u2019m late!\u201d she snapped. I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice calm and friendly, just as I\u2019d been trained.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down and saw a text from my little sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I remembered all the times we\u2019d promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But right now, I was supposed to be the perfect cashier\u2014cheerful, unflappable, focused on the customer in front of me.\n\nMy heart pounded as I rang up the groceries, my mind torn between the angry woman demanding my attention and my sister, who needed me more than ever. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
