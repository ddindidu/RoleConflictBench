He asks, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and I know he wants more than just a one-word answer. He expects me to share, to open up, to let him in. I want to tell him about the tension in my chest, the constant vigilance, but just as I start to speak, my work phone buzzes. An aircraft is about to cross into the neighboring sector, and I need to coordinate with the other controller to ensure everything goes smoothly. My husband looks at me, waiting, his eyes gentle but expectant. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to keep the skies safe, and my promise to be present with him. My mind races, torn between the urgent call of my profession and the quiet, persistent need for connection at home. I grip my phone, my heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between the two."}
