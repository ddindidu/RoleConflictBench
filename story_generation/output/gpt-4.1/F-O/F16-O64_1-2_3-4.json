My partner and I promised to share the chores, but lately, my shifts at the store have been longer, and the laundry just keeps piling up. I know my partner is tired too, and I can almost hear their sigh when they see the mess. I tell myself I\u2019ll fold it tonight, but as I rush out the door, I\u2019m already late for work.\n\nAt the register, a customer approaches, frustration etched on her face. She wants to return a blender, but she doesn\u2019t have a receipt. Store policy is clear\u2014no receipt, no return. She pleads, explaining it was a gift, and I feel the pressure mounting. I want to help her, but I know my manager is watching, expecting me to follow the rules. My mind drifts back to the laundry at home, the promise I made, and the disappointment I\u2019ll see if I don\u2019t keep it. Here, I\u2019m expected to be firm and fair; at home, I\u2019m expected to be supportive and responsible. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I feel torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
