He was chattering about his day, and I was half-listening, half-thinking about my next client at the salon. When we reached the corner, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the receptionist: my 3:30 appointment, a first-time visitor, was upset about her hair color and wanted it fixed immediately. My heart pounded. I knew how important it was to make a good impression, to listen carefully and fix any mistakes. But my brother tugged at my sleeve, reminding me we still had a few blocks to go, and Mom would be furious if I left him alone. I could picture the client\u2019s disappointed face in the mirror, the pressure to make it right, and at the same time, my brother\u2019s small hand in mine, trusting me to get him home safe. I stood at the crosswalk, torn between the urgent call of my job and the silent promise I\u2019d made to my family."}
