My granddaughter sat at the table, her shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on her phone. I could sense her sadness, the way only a grandmother can. I wanted to sit beside her, offer the comfort of my stories, the reassurance that life\u2019s storms do pass. But the checklist from my supervisor echoed in my mind: gloves on, surfaces sanitized, no exceptions. I glanced at my hands, encased in rubber, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. If I took off the gloves to hold her hand, I\u2019d break protocol. If I kept them on, I\u2019d seem distant, cold\u2014hardly the warm, wise grandmother she needed. My heart ached to reach out, but my mind raced with the rules I was expected to follow. I stood there, torn, the mop in my hand and my granddaughter\u2019s silent plea in her eyes, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
