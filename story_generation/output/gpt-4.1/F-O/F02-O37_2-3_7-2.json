As a father, I know my family depends on me. The bills are piling up, groceries are running low, and my wife looks at me with worry in her eyes. I need to bring in enough money to keep us afloat, to make sure my kids have what they need. That\u2019s why I took on extra shifts as a housekeeping cleaner. But today, my supervisor texts me: every room must be deep cleaned, top to bottom, no shortcuts. The hotel is expecting a surprise inspection, and if I don\u2019t deliver, I risk losing hours\u2014or worse, my job.\n\nI scrub and mop, sweat dripping down my back, but my phone buzzes with a message from home: \u201cCan you come back early? We need to talk about the bills.\u201d My hands ache, and my heart pounds. If I leave early, I might not finish the rooms, but if I stay, I can\u2019t help my family with what they need right now. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I stand frozen, mop in hand, torn between being the provider and the worker."}
