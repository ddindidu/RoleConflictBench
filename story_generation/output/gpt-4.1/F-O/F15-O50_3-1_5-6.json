The store manager\u2019s eyes met mine, and I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with firm but loving discipline. My mind raced with the words I should say, the lesson I needed to impart. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a new client, calling for advice on the machine I\u2019d just serviced. I could hear the uncertainty in her voice as she asked for basic operating tips, expecting me to be patient and thorough, to provide the guidance she needed. I glanced at my son, guilt and fear flickering across his face, and then at my phone, the client waiting for my expertise. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my child and the expectations of my work."}
