My wife\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cRelatives will be here in two hours. Please help tidy up and set the table when you get home.\u201d I could picture her, frazzled, trying to make everything perfect for our guests. I knew she was counting on me to share the load, to be the partner she needed, especially today.\n\nBut just then, I heard soft sobs from Room 214. Mrs. Evans, my patient, had just learned her cancer had returned. She looked so small and lost in her hospital bed, tears streaking her cheeks. My heart ached for her. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and a listening ear, to sit with her through the storm of her grief.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My wife needed me at home, my patient needed me here. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of love and duty, not knowing which way to turn."}
