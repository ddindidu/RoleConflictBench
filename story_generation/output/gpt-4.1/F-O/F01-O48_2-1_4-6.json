She wanted the whole family to gather tonight to watch her perform, and I could see how much it meant to her. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my evening shift at the care home. Mrs. Lee, one of my regular patients, had been especially down lately, and I knew she looked forward to my visits. She\u2019d told me yesterday how lonely she felt, and I promised I\u2019d be there to keep her company. My daughter glanced at me, expecting me to say I\u2019d be there for the play, while my mind drifted to Mrs. Lee waiting in her quiet room. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I wanted to be the grandfather my family needed, but I also couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting down someone who depended on me for comfort. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which promise I would have to break."}
