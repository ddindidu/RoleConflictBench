We need to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about the future we\u2019re both anxious to secure. My spouse expects honesty, expects me to lay everything bare, to be present and open. But my phone keeps buzzing with urgent messages from the construction site. The hospital project I\u2019m overseeing is at a critical stage; a last-minute inspection revealed a potential safety issue. As the architect, I\u2019m responsible for every life that will one day depend on that building. I know I should be at the site, double-checking every detail, ensuring compliance, preventing disaster. But here, at home, I\u2019m expected to be fully engaged, to communicate without distraction. My mind is split, torn between the person I love and the duty I owe to hundreds of strangers. I can feel the tension building inside me, the impossible pull of two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
