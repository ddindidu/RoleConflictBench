It\u2019s important to us all.\u201d My family had been talking about this for weeks, reminding me how much it meant to honor our traditions, especially now that my grandfather was gone. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, \u201cWe count on you to keep our customs alive.\u201d \n\nBut as I slipped on my uniform and checked the time, the station manager\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, \u201cAll operators, begin your pre-departure checks.
