My granddaughter slouched across from me, her eyes fixed on the swirling steam of her tea. I could sense her unease, the way she avoided my gaze, and I knew she needed me to say something wise, something comforting\u2014just as my own grandmother once did for me. But my phone buzzed insistently. It was the plant manager, again. The operator on the line had ignored my instructions, fiddling with the machine settings and wasting another batch of material. They needed me to guide him, to be patient and clear, to prevent further loss. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be a steady, understanding presence for my granddaughter, and the demand to be a reliable expert for my clients. My heart tugged toward her, but my mind raced with technical solutions and the urgency of the call. I stared at my phone, then at her, torn between the wisdom she needed and the guidance my client demanded, feeling the impossible pull of both roles at once."}
