My daughter had called, her voice trembling, saying my grandson was in the hospital. They needed me\u2014my family needed me. I promised I\u2019d be there as soon as I could, but the foreman had asked us to finish up the last bit of work before the shift ended. As I gathered my tools, I saw one of the new guys, head down, walking straight toward a crane\u2019s suspended load. My heart pounded. I knew the rules\u2014safety first, always. I was expected to keep the site safe, to look out for my crew. But my phone buzzed again in my pocket, another message from my daughter. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s crisis pulling me one way, the responsibility for my coworker\u2019s life pulling me the other. My throat tightened as I hesitated, caught between the urgent need to be with my family and the immediate danger unfolding before my eyes."}
