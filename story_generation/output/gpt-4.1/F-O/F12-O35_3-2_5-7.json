My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that his parents would arrive in a few hours. The house needed to be spotless, the food prepared, everything just right. I could feel the weight of his expectation\u2014this was our first time hosting his family, and he wanted everything perfect. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mandatory pre-shift briefing at the subway depot was about to begin. Management had stressed the importance of this meeting\u2014new operational procedures, safety updates, attendance required. Missing it could mean disciplinary action. My uniform hung pressed and ready by the door, but the vacuum still sat in the hallway, and the guest towels were yet to be folded. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my home and the responsibility to my job. I could almost hear the subway\u2019s rumble in my bones, the call of the tracks, even as the scent of lemon cleaner clung to my skin. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
