QA flagged a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing critical, but the product manager wanted it fixed before tomorrow\u2019s release. I was already planning how I\u2019d squeeze in a quick patch after dinner when I saw my son, eyes wide, clutching a candy bar he hadn\u2019t paid for. My heart dropped. The store manager was approaching, and I could see the guilt on my son\u2019s face. I knew this was a moment to teach him about honesty and consequences, but my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the team, asking for an update. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be a present, guiding mother, and the expectation to be a reliable developer. My son looked up at me, waiting for my reaction, while my team waited for my response. I stood there, torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
