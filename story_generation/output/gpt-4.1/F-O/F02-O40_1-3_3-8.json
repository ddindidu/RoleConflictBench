He looked up at me, eyes wide, waiting for my approval or correction. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter\u2014her house had serious termite damage, and she needed me to come immediately. The urgency in her words was clear; if I didn\u2019t act fast, the structure could become unsafe.\n\nI glanced at my son, who was now slouching in his chair, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a father, I wanted to be present, to guide him through these everyday lessons. As a carpenter, I knew my skills were needed elsewhere, and quickly. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the responsibility of shaping my child\u2019s character with the duty to protect someone\u2019s home. The clock ticked, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of fatherhood and the call of my craft."}
