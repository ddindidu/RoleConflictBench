My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to finish so we could talk about the medical bill that had just arrived. He wanted honesty, openness\u2014he needed to know exactly what we could afford, what I was feeling, what we should do next. But as the call connected, a customer launched into a barrage of technical questions about the new service I was selling. My script only covered the basics, and my supervisor expected me to keep the call moving, handle objections, and never admit uncertainty. I could feel my husband\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for the conversation that mattered most, while my mind raced to find answers I didn\u2019t have for a stranger. I wanted to be transparent with him, but my job demanded confidence and control, even when I was unsure. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both worlds, feeling the weight of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
