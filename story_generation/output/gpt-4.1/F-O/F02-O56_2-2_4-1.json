He darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls to stay close. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. I knew I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and explain why his behavior wasn\u2019t okay. But just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my next client, a first-timer, would be arriving at the salon in ten minutes. I pictured her, anxious and scanning the unfamiliar space, expecting a warm welcome and reassurance from her hairdresser. My mind raced between the two worlds: the father who must guide his child, and the professional who must greet and comfort a nervous client. My heart pounded as I stood in the cereal aisle, torn between the lesson my son needed and the comfort my client expected, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
