The principal wanted to meet with me as soon as possible. Guilt and worry tangled inside me\u2014how could my child do such a thing? I knew I needed to be there, to talk to him, to show him right from wrong, to support him through this mistake.\n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard Mrs. Evans calling for me from her hospital bed. She\u2019d just come out of surgery, her eyes wide and frightened, her hand trembling as she reached for mine. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave yet,\u201d she whispered, her voice thin. My shift was almost over, but she needed me\u2014someone to sit with her, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My child needed me as a parent, my patient needed me as a nursing assistant. I stood in the hallway, torn, my mind racing, unsure which need should come first."}
