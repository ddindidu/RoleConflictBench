My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with pride\u2014Emma had landed the lead role, and the whole family was gathering to watch her debut. They wanted me there, front row, cheering her on. I could already picture Emma\u2019s hopeful eyes searching for me in the crowd.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the jury trial I\u2019d been preparing for months was set to begin the same morning. My client\u2019s future, their business, their reputation\u2014all rested on my shoulders. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no exceptions. My colleagues expected me to be focused, unflappable, wholly present in the courtroom.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me, my client depended on me.
