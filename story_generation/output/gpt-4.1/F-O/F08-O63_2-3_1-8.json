My granddaughter, Emma, shuffled into the room, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. I recognized that look\u2014something was weighing on her, something she needed to talk about. My heart ached to reach out, to offer the comfort and wisdom she\u2019d always found in me. But the blinking light on my laptop reminded me of the telemarketer\u2019s world I was tethered to. If I didn\u2019t log back in on time, the compliance system would flag me, and another warning could mean losing the job that helped pay our bills. Emma hesitated at the doorway, searching my face for an invitation. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the grandmother she needed, the other shackled by the rigid demands of my job. The seconds slipped away, and I sat frozen, caught between the call of family and the call of duty, not knowing which voice to answer."}
