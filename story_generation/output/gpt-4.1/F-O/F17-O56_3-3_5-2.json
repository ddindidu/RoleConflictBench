Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d My heart pounded. I could almost hear my grandmother\u2019s voice, reminding me how important it was to honor our traditions, to be the one who keeps our family\u2019s values alive. But out front, the bell chimed, and the bride-to-be swept in with her bridesmaids, all nerves and excitement. As their hairdresser, I was expected to greet them with a warm smile, offer reassurance, and make sure everything ran smoothly for their big day. I could see the anxiety in their eyes, and I knew they needed me to be calm and attentive. My mind raced between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the immediate needs of my clients. I felt pulled in two directions, the pressure building in my chest as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both the devoted child my family wanted and the professional hairdresser my clients needed, all at the same time."}
