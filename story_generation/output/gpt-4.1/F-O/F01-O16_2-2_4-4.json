I want to show everyone at dinner tonight!\u201d Her excitement was contagious, and I promised I\u2019d be there, eager to see her share her moment with the family. Just as I was about to help her set the table, my phone buzzed. It was the hospital. One of my patients, Mrs. Lee, had just received a life-changing diagnosis. Her daughter was on the line, her voice trembling, asking if I could come in and explain what this meant for their family. I could hear the fear and confusion, the need for reassurance and clarity. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my family expecting my presence and warmth, my patient needing my guidance and compassion. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me, each demanding something only I could give. I stood there, torn, the sounds of my granddaughter\u2019s laughter mixing with the distant echo of a family in distress, unsure which path to take."}
