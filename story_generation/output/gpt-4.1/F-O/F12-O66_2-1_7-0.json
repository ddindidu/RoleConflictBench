My passenger, a young woman humming softly, had mentioned she was in no rush for her meeting. The streets were calm, the ride easy. But my mind kept drifting to this morning, to the way my husband barely touched his coffee, the worry lines deepening on his forehead. I knew I should have asked him what was wrong, should have sat down and listened, like we promised we always would. But I had a shift to start, and now, as I drove through the city, guilt gnawed at me. I wanted to pull over, call him, be the wife who noticed and cared. But I was also the driver, responsible for getting my passenger safely and on time, even if she didn\u2019t mind a delay. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My heart ached with the urge to turn the car around, but my duty to my passenger kept me moving forward, torn between the person I loved and the job I needed to do."}
