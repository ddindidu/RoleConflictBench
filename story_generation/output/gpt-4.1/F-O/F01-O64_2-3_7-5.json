My shift as a cashier was almost over, but the end-of-day cash deposit loomed\u2014a task that demanded my full attention and strict adherence to store policy. The procedures were clear: count every bill, double-check the totals, fill out the forms, and lock everything away before leaving. Any mistake could mean trouble for the store and for me.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. I knew it was my granddaughter; she\u2019d just started her new job and promised to call with updates. I\u2019d told her I wanted to hear every detail, to be the supportive grandfather she could always count on. She was excited, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down by missing her call. But the store manager had been clear\u2014no distractions during the deposit, no exceptions.\n\nI stood there, torn, the cash drawer open in front of me and my phone vibrating insistently. My family expected me to be present and encouraging, but my job demanded my undivided attention. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
