My granddaughter, Emma, plopped down beside me, her eyes wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandma, how do I know if I\u2019m making the right choice about college?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I wanted to wrap her in reassurance, to share stories of my own winding path, to offer the wisdom she expected from me. But my phone buzzed\u2014another call, another prospect with a barrage of technical questions about the new service. The script in front of me offered only vague answers, and I was expected to keep the call moving, to handle objections smoothly, to never admit uncertainty. My mind spun between Emma\u2019s need for heartfelt guidance and the customer\u2019s demand for expertise I didn\u2019t quite have. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting me to be steady, knowledgeable, and present. My heart ached as I looked from Emma\u2019s hopeful face to the blinking cursor on my screen, caught between the wisdom of a grandmother and the precision of a telemarketer, unsure which voice to answer first."}
