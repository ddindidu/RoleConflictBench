My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it was to lead the family ceremony tonight. \u201cYou\u2019re the eldest now,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes shining with pride and expectation. I knew how much it meant to her, to everyone, that I uphold our traditions and show respect for our heritage. But as I glanced through the salon window, I saw Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walk in. She smiled, expecting the usual warm greeting and friendly banter that made her feel at home here. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Patel always looked for me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family counting on me to honor our legacy, and my client expecting the comfort and attention I always gave. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the pull of my roots and the demands of my craft, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
