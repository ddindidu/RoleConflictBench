It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. My heart tightened. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, but the word \u201cabout\u201d sent a chill through me. As a grandfather, I was expected to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. I wanted nothing more than to call her back immediately, to be the steady presence my family needed.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through my radio: \u201cUnit 12, respond to a possible heart attack, 5th and Main.\u201d Instinct took over. I grabbed my bag and ran to the ambulance. As a driver, I was expected to act fast, to provide care that could mean the difference between life and death. My hands shook as I started the engine, torn between the urgent call of my family and the desperate need of a stranger. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
