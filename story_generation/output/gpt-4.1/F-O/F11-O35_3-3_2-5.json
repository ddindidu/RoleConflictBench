I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, her message urgent: \u201cI need you. Please call.\u201d We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially in moments like this, when she was struggling. My heart twisted with worry, but before I could even think, the passenger emergency alarm blared overhead. The control panel lit up: medical emergency, car three. My training kicked in\u2014passenger safety was my responsibility. I was supposed to respond immediately, coordinate with emergency services, and keep everyone calm. But my mind kept drifting to my sister, alone and reaching out for help. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. My hands hovered over the controls, my thoughts racing between the passengers who needed me now and my sister who needed me just as much."}
