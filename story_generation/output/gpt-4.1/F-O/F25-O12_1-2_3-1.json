My stepmom\u2019s voice echoed from downstairs, calling everyone to the living room for our annual holiday game night. I knew how much it meant to her that I joined in, especially since she\u2019d worked so hard to make me feel part of the family. But my mind was tangled in the code review comments\u2014warnings about performance issues, reminders to refactor, the expectation to deliver something clean and efficient by tomorrow morning. \n\nI glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmom and risk feeling like an outsider again. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my team down and possibly ship buggy code. My heart pounded as I hovered between the warmth of family laughter drifting up the stairs and the cold logic of my IDE, each tugging me in opposite directions."}
