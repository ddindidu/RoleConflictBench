My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight?\u201d I promised I would, knowing she\u2019s been carrying more than her share lately. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the hospital. Mrs. Carter, the patient I\u2019ve been caring for, is struggling after her surgery. The night shift is short-staffed, and they need me to come in early to help her get settled, make sure she\u2019s safe and comfortable. I know how much she depends on me, how anxious she gets when unfamiliar faces try to help her move. My chest tightens. At home, I\u2019m a husband, expected to share the load, to be present. At work, I\u2019m a nursing assistant, expected to put my patients first, to be reliable and compassionate. Both roles matter, both demands are real, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
