She\u2019d been quiet lately, her eyes shadowed with worry at breakfast. I promised myself I\u2019d talk to her tonight, to be the husband she needed\u2014open, attentive, someone she could lean on. But as I swept the last stray hair from my station, the salon door burst open. The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids arrived, flustered and early, their voices a tangle of nerves and excitement. My manager shot me a look: greet them, make them feel at ease, keep the schedule on track. I could see the anxiety in their faces, the expectation that I\u2019d be the calm in their storm. My phone buzzed again in my pocket. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my wife needing my honesty and presence, my clients needing my warmth and focus. My heart pounded as I stood between the mirror and the door, torn by the demands of being the husband she deserved and the hairdresser they expected."}
