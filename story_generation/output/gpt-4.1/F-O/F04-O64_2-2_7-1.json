As a cashier, I was expected to keep things moving, scan each item quickly, and make no mistakes. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over every so often, silently urging me to go faster. Then, my younger brother appeared at the end of my lane, clutching a bag of chips and a soda. He looked nervous, glancing at the people behind him. I remembered our last argument at home\u2014how I\u2019d promised to be more patient, to listen and not judge. Now, he was here, maybe hoping for a smile or a kind word. But the customers behind him were shifting, sighing, and I could feel the pressure to hurry. My brother needed understanding, but my job demanded speed and accuracy. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment, torn between being the brother he needed and the cashier everyone expected."}
