The termite damage was worse than I\u2019d thought\u2014beams sagging, floors unsafe. They needed a repair plan today, and I knew the work would take all my focus and most of my time. But across from me, my husband sat hunched, eyes red, barely touching his coffee. He\u2019d lost his job last week, and every day since, he\u2019d needed me\u2014my words, my arms, my steady presence. He looked at me now, searching for comfort, and I felt the weight of his need. My mind raced with measurements, costs, and safety concerns, but my heart ached to be what he needed: a wife who could listen, reassure, and just be there. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself stretched thin, unsure which role to step into first."}
