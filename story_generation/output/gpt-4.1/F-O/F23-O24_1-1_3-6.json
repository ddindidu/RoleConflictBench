My stepson, Ethan, slouched across from me, poking at his cereal and mumbling a half-hearted \u201cthank you\u201d when I handed him a napkin. I knew I should seize this moment\u2014remind him about eye contact, about speaking clearly, about the importance of gratitude. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does: guides, corrects, teaches. But my mind kept drifting to the journal, to the articles on new legal precedents that I needed to understand before next week\u2019s hearing. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to be sharp, informed, always a step ahead. The pressure to keep up is relentless. Ethan looked up, waiting for me to say something, maybe to praise or correct him. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to him, my duty to the law. My heart tugged one way, my mind the other, and for a moment, I just sat there, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the parent he needed and the judge I was expected to be."}
