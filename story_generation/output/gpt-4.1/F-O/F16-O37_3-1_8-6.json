My shift started in an hour, but my spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to continue our conversation about the medical bills piling up on the counter. \u201cWe need to be honest with each other about what we can afford,\u201d they said, voice gentle but firm. I knew I owed them the truth, but my mind kept drifting to work\u2014if I didn\u2019t follow the new safety protocols, I could get written up, maybe even lose my job. But if I held back now, if I wasn\u2019t completely open about our finances, I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019d built.
