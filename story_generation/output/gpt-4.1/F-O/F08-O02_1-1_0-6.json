I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she wanted the kind of wisdom only a grandmother could give, the kind that comes from years of living and learning. But just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning call was starting. As an engineer, my team counted on me to provide accurate time estimates, even if this session was informal and the deadlines weren\u2019t set in stone. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s searching eyes, my team\u2019s silent expectation. My heart ached to give her my full attention, to share stories and guidance, but my mind raced with calculations and timelines. I hesitated, torn between the comfort I could offer her and the responsibility I owed my colleagues, caught in the silent tug-of-war between wisdom and precision."}
