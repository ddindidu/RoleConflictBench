The deadline for my written judgment loomed, and I knew the attorneys and parties were anxiously awaiting my decision. Every word I wrote had to be precise, every conclusion justified. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cHope you\u2019re well. Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I hadn\u2019t called home in days, and I could almost hear my parents\u2019 voices, wondering if I was okay, wishing for a simple conversation. I wanted to pick up the phone, to reassure them, to be the attentive daughter they deserved. But the weight of my judicial responsibilities pressed down on me. If I paused now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, risk missing a crucial detail. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my presence, and toward my duty, which demanded my focus. I stared at the phone, torn, the cursor blinking on the empty page, caught between the roles that defined me."}
