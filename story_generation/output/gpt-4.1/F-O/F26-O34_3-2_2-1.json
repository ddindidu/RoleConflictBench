Holiday traffic was peaking, and every second demanded my full attention. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo mistakes, not today.\u201d I toggled between frequencies, issuing clearances, calculating holding patterns, my mind a taut wire.

I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She needed me\u2014needed the comfort and wisdom only I could give. But the airspace was a puzzle of moving parts, and hundreds of lives depended on my focus.
