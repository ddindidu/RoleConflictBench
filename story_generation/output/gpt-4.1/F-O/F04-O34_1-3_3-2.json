My mother looked at me expectantly, waiting for my input. I knew how much these outings meant to them, especially after how busy I\u2019d been lately. I wanted to say yes, to promise I\u2019d be there, but my phone buzzed with an urgent alert from the control tower. A major route closure had just been announced\u2014dozens of flights would be circling, waiting for clearance, and I was scheduled for the next shift. My mind raced with the responsibility: hundreds of lives depending on my focus, my decisions. My brother nudged me, grinning, \u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I felt the weight of their hopes and the gravity of my duty pressing in from both sides. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold, relentless demands of the radar screen."}
