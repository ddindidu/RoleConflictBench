My phone buzzed with another email from our major supplier, the subject line in all caps: \u201cFINAL NOTICE.\u201d My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t resolve the overdue invoice today, our company\u2019s production would grind to a halt. I started drafting a response, trying to sound calm and professional, even as my mind raced through possible solutions.\n\nJust then, my spouse sat down across from me, their eyes serious. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d they said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s about the medical bills and our savings. I need to know exactly where we stand.\u201d I could see the worry etched on their face, the expectation that I\u2019d be honest and open, that I\u2019d put our relationship first. But my mind was still tangled in numbers and deadlines, the pressure from work pressing in on me. I wanted to give them my full attention, to be the partner they needed, but the demands of my job wouldn\u2019t let go. I felt torn, caught between the urgent needs of my clients and the equally urgent needs of my marriage, unsure which voice to answer first."}
