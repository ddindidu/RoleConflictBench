The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, but all I could think about was the call from the school. My stepson, caught bullying. The principal wanted me there, now, to discuss what happened. I could hear the disappointment in her voice, and I knew my partner would expect me to show up, to prove I cared, to be the parent my stepson needed.\n\nBut the meter was running, and my passenger in the backseat kept glancing at his watch. The roads were slick, cars weaving in and out, brake lights flaring unpredictably. I was expected to drive safely, to get my fare to his destination without incident, to follow every rule. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the school. I felt torn in two, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. Should I pull over and call the school, risking a complaint from my passenger? Or keep driving, knowing my stepson was waiting for me to show up for him, just this once? The rain blurred the world outside, matching the confusion inside my head."}
