Every detail mattered\u2014lives depended on the efficiency of my design. My phone buzzed. It was my mother, reminding me that I was to lead the family\u2019s annual ancestral ceremony this weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she said, her voice gentle but firm. \u201cYou know how important this is to us.\u201d I could hear the weight of generations in her words, the expectation that I would honor our traditions, guide the rituals, and keep our family\u2019s values alive.\n\nBut the hospital project deadline loomed.
