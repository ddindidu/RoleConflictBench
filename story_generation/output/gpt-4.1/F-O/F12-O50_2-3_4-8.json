My husband called from the kitchen, asking if I could get the laundry started so he\u2019d have clean shirts for work tomorrow. I nodded, feeling the weight of the expectation\u2014keeping the household running smoothly, making sure everyone had what they needed. Just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the factory: the new staff were about to operate the press, but no one had briefed them on the safety protocols. My heart raced. If I didn\u2019t intervene, someone could get hurt. But if I left now, the laundry wouldn\u2019t be done, and I\u2019d be letting my family down. I stared at the phone, then at the laundry, torn between the urgent needs of my clients and the quiet, constant demands of home."}
