My spouse called, voice soft, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d It was a rare moment together, a chance to connect after a long week. I wanted to turn, to look them in the eye, to share honestly about the exhaustion and small victories. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how busy life got.\n\nBut as I started to answer, I caught a flicker of movement in the middle of the pool. A swimmer\u2019s strokes faltered, their head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me: never look away, never let your guard down. Every second counted. My spouse waited, expecting warmth and attention, but my duty demanded unwavering focus. My heart pounded, torn between the person I loved and the lives I was responsible for. I gripped the whistle, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
