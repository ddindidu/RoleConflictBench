I answered her questions with a calm, reassuring tone, making sure she understood her next steps. As I walked her out, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from my stepbrother. He\u2019d just gotten home from school and wrote, \u201cCan you come talk? Had a rough day.\u201d I could picture him slumped on the couch, eyes red, needing someone to listen. \n\nBut in the waiting room, another patient was already filling out forms, expecting my full attention and expertise. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my stepbrother needed me as family, to be present and supportive, while my patient needed me as a doctor, to be attentive and professional. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and responsibility swirling together as I stood frozen between the exam room and the door, unsure which role to step into first."}
