My partner\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, gentle but tired, \u201cCan you help fold these before you go? I\u2019ve got dinner and the kids\u2019 homework.\u201d I nodded, guilt prickling at my skin. Sharing the load at home was important; I\u2019d promised to be more present, to help out, to not let work always come first. \n\nJust as I reached for a shirt, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. The words \u201cmulti-vehicle collision, highway 17, critical\u201d flashed on the screen. My heart pounded. Every second mattered; lives could hang in the balance. I could already picture the chaos, the desperate faces, the urgency.
