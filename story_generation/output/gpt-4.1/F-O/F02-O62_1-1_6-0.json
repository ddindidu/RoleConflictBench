My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that today was the day I\u2019d promised my son I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo he\u2019d been dreaming about. He\u2019d been so excited, telling all his friends, and I could already picture his face lighting up. But as I watched the swimmers, I noticed a few kids drifting toward the deep end, laughing and splashing, not quite in danger but close enough to make me uneasy. I knew I couldn\u2019t leave my post, not even for a few minutes, not with the responsibility of keeping everyone safe. But the store\u2019s sale ended in an hour, and if I missed it, I\u2019d have to pay full price\u2014money we really couldn\u2019t spare. My heart pounded as I weighed my duty to my son against my duty to these strangers in the water, both expecting me to be there for them, both needing me in different ways. I gripped the armrest, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
