Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the weight she carried, the silent plea for comfort and advice. I wanted to reach out, to share a story from my own youth, to offer the gentle wisdom that grandmothers are supposed to give. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling for guidance on the machine I\u2019d serviced last week. He sounded uncertain, asking for basic operating tips, and I knew he expected clear, patient instruction\u2014my professional responsibility. My granddaughter glanced up, hope flickering in her eyes, while the client\u2019s voice crackled through the phone, waiting for reassurance. I felt torn, pulled between the warmth of family and the duty of my work, both expecting my guidance, both needing me in different ways. My heart ached as I hesitated, caught between the roles that defined me."}
