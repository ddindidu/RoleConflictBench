My partner sighs as they pass by, and I know they\u2019re waiting for me to help, just like we agreed. Sharing chores is important to both of us, and I promised I\u2019d fold the laundry tonight. But my laptop sits open on the kitchen table, spreadsheets and tax forms blinking at me. The quarterly tax filing deadline is next week, and I\u2019m behind. My boss expects everything to be perfect\u2014no errors, no late submissions. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I ignore the laundry, I let my partner down. If I ignore the tax forms, I risk my job. My mind races, torn between the comfort of home and the demands of my career, wishing I could split myself in two."}
