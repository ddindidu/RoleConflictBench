My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my brother, reminding me that everyone was waiting for me at home. Mom had made my favorite dish, and Dad had even left work early. I could almost hear their laughter through the text, the warmth of family pulling at me. But as I counted the cash in my drawer, I noticed a small discrepancy. It wasn\u2019t much, just a few dollars off, but store policy was clear: every cent had to be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to fill out a report and stay until it was resolved. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me at the table, my job demanding my attention to detail. My heart raced as I stared at the register, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility of my role behind the counter."}
