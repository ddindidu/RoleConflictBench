They needed me, really needed me, and I could hear the tremor in their voice from our last call. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d hold them and listen, that I\u2019d be the anchor they needed right now. But as I pulled up to the next address, the reality of my other life pressed in. The package in my hands was worth enough that my boss had drilled it into me: \u201cNo signature, no delivery. No exceptions.\u201d I rang the bell, glancing at the clock, feeling the weight of my partner\u2019s pain and the ticking of my delivery schedule. The customer opened the door, distracted, in a hurry, barely glancing at me. I needed their signature, but my mind was with my partner, picturing them alone, waiting. My hands shook as I held out the scanner, torn between the duty in front of me and the promise I\u2019d made at home."}
