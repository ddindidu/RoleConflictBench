They expected to hear about my week, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I\u2019m still trying to prove I care, even if I\u2019m not their \u201creal\u201d kid. But tonight, the office buzzed with tension. It was the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s eyes kept darting to the sales board. We were so close to the target, and if I didn\u2019t keep dialing, I\u2019d let the team down\u2014and lose my own bonus. My headset beeped with another lead, but my phone vibrated with a text from Dad: \u201cReady for our call?\u201d My stomach twisted. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. If I called home, I\u2019d miss precious minutes for sales. If I stayed on the line, I\u2019d break my promise\u2014again. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stared at the two phones, heart pounding, unable to move."}
