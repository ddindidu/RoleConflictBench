My phone buzzed with a reminder: family gathering at my daughter\u2019s house, the one I\u2019d promised not to miss. I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s faces, the way they\u2019d light up when I walked in, the warmth of their hugs. But the city was a mess\u2014cars weaving, brake lights flaring, everyone in a rush to get home before the storm worsened. I knew I should drive carefully, keep my distance, obey every rule. My passengers trusted me to get them home safely, and I took pride in that. But the clock on the dashboard ticked on, and with every minute, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down. I wanted to be the reliable grandmother, present and loving, but I was also a professional behind the wheel, responsible for lives in this rain-soaked chaos. My heart tugged in two directions as I watched the wipers sweep away the blur, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my family and the duty I owed to my passengers."}
