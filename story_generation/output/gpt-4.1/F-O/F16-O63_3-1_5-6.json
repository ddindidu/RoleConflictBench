My phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s my spouse. \u201cCan you help with the cleaning now? My cousins will be here in two hours. We need to vacuum, dust, and tidy the living room.\u201d I look around at the cluttered coffee table and the laundry basket overflowing in the corner. I know what\u2019s expected: as a partner, I should be present, pitching in, making sure our home is spotless for the relatives. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to stick to my scheduled breaks, not just disappear from my desk whenever it\u2019s convenient for my personal life. My supervisor trusts me to be responsible, and I don\u2019t want to let the team down. My heart pounds as I weigh the guilt of leaving my spouse to handle everything alone against the anxiety of bending the rules at work. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
