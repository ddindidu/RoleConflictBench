The numbers on the page pressed on my chest\u2014rent, groceries, the electricity bill. I knew I had to keep us afloat, to make sure there was always food on the table and a roof over our heads. That meant I couldn\u2019t afford to lose my job or let my performance slip. \n\nBut as an architect, my days were already packed. I\u2019d gotten used to glancing over project timelines, making sure things were moving along, but not digging too deep. My manager expected more\u2014detailed oversight, quick responses, and a tighter grip on every deadline. I could feel the pressure mounting, the unspoken demand to step up and take charge. \n\nI wanted to be the mother who provided, who never let her family worry about money. But I also wanted to be the architect who didn\u2019t let her team down. The weight of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart pounding, wondering which expectation I would have to let down."}
