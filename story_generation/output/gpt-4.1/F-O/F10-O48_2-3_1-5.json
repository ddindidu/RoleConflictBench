It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014my weekly call with Mom and Dad. I can almost hear Mom\u2019s gentle voice, asking if I\u2019m eating well, if I\u2019m sleeping enough, if work is too hard. I know how much these calls mean to them, especially since I moved out. They worry if I skip even once. But Mr. Lee\u2019s monitor beeps urgently, and I see his numbers are slipping. My supervisor made it clear: in critical cases, every minute counts. I\u2019m supposed to be right here, focused, recording every change, ready to alert the nurse if things get worse. My hand hovers over my phone, torn. I want to reassure my parents, to hear their voices, but I can\u2019t leave Mr. Lee unattended. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel my chest tighten as I stand frozen between the two worlds that need me."}
