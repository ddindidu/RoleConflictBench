They wait for my voice, eager for stories about my day, and I know how much it means to them. But tonight, a thick file sits open on my desk, its pages bristling with urgent notes. An emergency motion for a restraining order just landed on my docket, and the law demands I review every detail and make a ruling within the hour. My parents\u2019 faces flash in my mind, their voices warm and expectant. At the same time, I feel the weight of the petitioner\u2019s fear, the respondent\u2019s rights, and the responsibility to be thorough and fair. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the comfort of family and the gravity of justice. The minutes tick by, and I feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions."}
