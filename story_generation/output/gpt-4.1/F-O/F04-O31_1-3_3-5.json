My little sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents were excited about a picnic. I felt the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being a brother who was present, who showed up for family moments. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent alert from dispatch. There was a violent assault happening downtown, bystanders at risk, and officers needed on the scene immediately.
