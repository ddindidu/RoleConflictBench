My daughter had just announced her engagement, and the whole family was gathered to celebrate. They wanted me there, to share stories, to give my blessing, to be the grandfather they cherished. Yet, on my desk lay a thick case file, just delivered, for a procedural hearing in two weeks. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. My colleagues and the court trusted my diligence; any oversight could have consequences. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached to join my family, to be present for this milestone, but my mind kept drifting to the unopened file. The expectations of my robe and my role as a grandfather pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unable to move."}
