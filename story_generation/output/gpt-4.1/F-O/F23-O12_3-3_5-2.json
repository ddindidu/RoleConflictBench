He\u2019d slipped a candy bar into his pocket, and I\u2019d been called to the front, forced to apologize and promise to \u201chandle it.\u201d My mind spun with what I should say\u2014how to teach him right from wrong, how to be the adult he could trust and respect. But as soon as we got home, my phone buzzed with Slack notifications. The production service was lagging, and the team had traced the issue to the code I\u2019d merged last night. \u201cCan you jump on a call?\u201d my lead messaged. I knew the expectation: fix it, and fast. But my stepson was watching me, eyes wide, waiting for my words, my guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding I be present, patient, and wise; the other needing me sharp, focused, and responsive. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent ping of my laptop and the silent plea in my stepson\u2019s gaze, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
