I knew I should ask her what was wrong, to open up about my own worries at work, to be the husband who listens and shares. She glanced at me, waiting, maybe hoping I\u2019d start the conversation we both needed. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. The life-support device in the ICU was down, flashing critical fault codes. They needed me now, before a patient\u2019s life was at risk. My heart pounded. I could see the expectation in my wife\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for connection, but the weight of responsibility at the hospital pressed down on me. I felt torn, caught between the need to be present for her and the duty to fix a machine that someone\u2019s life depended on. The seconds stretched, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the husband she needed and the repairer the hospital depended on."}
