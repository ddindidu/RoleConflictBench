I glanced at the security monitor, heart thumping. My job as a subway operator demanded I act fast\u2014passenger safety was everything. But my phone kept vibrating. I knew it was my younger sister, probably upset again after our argument last night. She\u2019d accused me of never listening, of always putting work first. I\u2019d promised to be more patient, to try to understand her side. Now, as I prepared to make the announcement and alert security, my mind raced. If I ignored her call, I\u2019d be breaking my promise, risking the fragile trust we\u2019d just started to rebuild. But if I answered, even for a moment, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the hundreds of people depending on me. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hand hovered between the radio and my phone, torn by the impossible choice."}
