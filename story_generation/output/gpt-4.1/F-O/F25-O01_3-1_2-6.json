She expects me to check in every evening, to share how my day went, to answer her questions about my meals and my mood. I know she worries, and I want to reassure her, but my mind is tangled in the blueprints spread across my desk. As an architect, I\u2019m supposed to keep projects on track, but I\u2019ve always been more relaxed, trusting my team to handle the details. Now, a client is pushing for updates, and I should be reviewing the timeline, making sure nothing slips. My stepmother\u2019s messages pile up, each one more insistent, while my inbox fills with reminders from the project manager. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding warmth and presence, the other efficiency and control. My fingers hover over my phone, my eyes darting between the family group chat and the project schedule, my chest tight with the pressure to be both a devoted step-child and a responsible architect."}
