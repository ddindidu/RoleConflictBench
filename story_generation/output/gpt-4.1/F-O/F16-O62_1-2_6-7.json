They asked about my day, and I knew they expected me to open up, to share more than just the usual \u201cit was fine.\u201d I wanted to be present, to listen and talk honestly, but my mind kept drifting back to the pool. Just before I left, I\u2019d seen a group of teenagers laughing and daring each other to dive right by the no-diving signs. I should have enforced the rules more strictly, but I was already late getting home. Now, as my partner waited for me to share, I felt torn. Part of me wanted to confess my worry, to let them in, but another part of me felt the weight of my responsibility as a lifeguard. Should I call the pool and check in, or stay here and give my partner the attention they deserve? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, caught between the need to communicate openly and the duty to keep others safe."}
