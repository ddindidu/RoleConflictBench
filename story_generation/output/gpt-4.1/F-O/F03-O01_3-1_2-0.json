She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, if I was sleeping enough, if I\u2019d remembered to call my uncle for his birthday. I always answered, always sent her photos of my lunch, always replied to her messages within minutes. It was our routine, and I knew how much it meant to her. But right now, blueprints were spread across my desk, and my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cDouble-check every detail. We can\u2019t afford mistakes.\u201d I\u2019d just spotted a small inconsistency in the fire escape plan\u2014nothing urgent, but it nagged at me.
