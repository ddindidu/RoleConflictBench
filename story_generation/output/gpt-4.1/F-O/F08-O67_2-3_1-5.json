I could see the worry in her eyes, the way she bit her lip, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed the kind of gentle words and stories only a grandmother could give. I reached out to touch her hand, ready to offer comfort and wisdom, when my radio crackled to life. \u201cCode Red, possible cardiac arrest, Maple and Fifth. All available units respond.\u201d My heart lurched. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted for someone in the grip of a heart attack. My uniform hung by the door, my keys already in my pocket. I looked at my granddaughter, her eyes pleading for reassurance, and then at the flashing red light on my pager. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014my family needing my presence, a stranger needing my skill. I stood frozen, torn between the call of duty and the call of love, my mind racing with the impossible choice before me."}
