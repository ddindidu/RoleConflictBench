Our family\u2019s traditions meant everything to her, and I knew how important it was to honor them, to be the daughter who carried our values forward. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my lunch break was almost over. My mind flashed to the construction site, the clatter of machinery, the constant vigilance required to keep everyone safe. \n\nSuddenly, I remembered the morning\u2019s near-miss: a coworker, distracted, about to step under a suspended load. I\u2019d had to shout, breaking the usual quiet, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. Safety demanded it, even if it meant disrupting the flow, even if it meant being seen as harsh. Now, as my family gathered, expecting calm leadership and reverence, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. How could I be the composed daughter upholding tradition, when my instincts screamed to act, to protect, to shout if needed? My heart pounded, torn between the silence of ceremony and the urgency of safety."}
