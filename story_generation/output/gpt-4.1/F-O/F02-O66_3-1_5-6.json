It was the store manager from the corner shop, his voice tense. My son had been caught slipping a pack of cookies into his pocket. My heart dropped. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized my next fare was due in ten minutes\u2014a regular who always complimented my spotless cab and punctuality. If I left now, I\u2019d risk a bad review and maybe even lose a loyal customer. If I stayed, I\u2019d be failing my son at a crucial moment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own consequences. I stood there, keys in hand, torn between the cab and the corner shop, my mind racing with what the right thing to do was."}
