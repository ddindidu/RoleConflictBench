My shift as a nursing assistant was almost over, but Mrs. Evans, my patient, was gripping my hand tightly. She\u2019d just come out of surgery, her eyes wide and searching mine for reassurance. \u201cWill you stay with me a little longer?\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I glanced at the time again. My children would be waiting at the school gate soon, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there today, just like I promised Mrs. Evans I\u2019d help her feel safe. The weight of both promises pressed down on me. My children\u2019s hopeful faces flashed in my mind, but so did Mrs. Evans\u2019 anxious eyes. I felt torn in two, pulled by the love for my children and the duty to my patient. My hands shook as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
