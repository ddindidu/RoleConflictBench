My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school.\u201d I could already picture their faces pressed against the window, searching for me among the other parents. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, after missing last week\u2019s art show. As I started the engine, my police radio crackled to life. \u201cUnit 12, we\u2019ve got a noise complaint on Maple Street. Residents report a loud party, possible underage drinking. Can you respond?\u201d My hand hovered over the radio. I knew the expectation\u2014duty first, always. But my heart ached at the thought of my children waiting, feeling forgotten again. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, \u201cYou said you\u2019d come, Mom.\u201d The weight of my badge pressed against my chest, a constant reminder of my responsibility to the community. But the pull of motherhood was just as strong, tugging me in the opposite direction. I sat there, torn, the demands of both worlds colliding inside me, unsure which call to answer first."}
