It was a message from my granddaughter, Emma: \u201cGrandma, can we talk? I\u2019m nervous about starting high school.\u201d My heart swelled with the urge to comfort her, to share stories of my own awkward beginnings, to offer the gentle wisdom she expected from me. But just then, my next patient entered\u2014a young woman with a runny nose and a cough. She looked anxious, expecting me to listen carefully, to distinguish between a harmless cold and something more serious. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: Emma needed my warmth and guidance, my patient needed my clinical focus and expertise. My mind raced, torn between the desire to be the reassuring grandmother and the attentive doctor. I glanced at my phone, then at my patient, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, knowing I could not give my full self to both at the same time."}
