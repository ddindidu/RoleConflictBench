The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My mind raced\u2014every word I\u2019d just spoken was now obsolete. The courtroom waited, silent and expectant, but my thoughts drifted to the night before, when I\u2019d sat with my granddaughter at the kitchen table. She\u2019d looked so small, her eyes rimmed red, confiding in me about her struggles at school. She needed my wisdom, my comfort, but I\u2019d been distracted, reviewing case law for today\u2019s trial. Now, as a judge, I was expected to be decisive, up-to-date, and impartial, but as a grandmother, I was supposed to be present, nurturing, and wise. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate legal clarity, the other aching for my attention and warmth. I stood at the crossroads of duty and love, my heart torn between the bench and the kitchen table, knowing I could not give both what they deserved at the same time."}
