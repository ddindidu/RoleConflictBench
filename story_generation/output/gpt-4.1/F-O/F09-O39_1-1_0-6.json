My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that school ends in thirty minutes. My kids will be waiting, eyes searching the crowd of parents for me. I promised them I\u2019d be there, just like I promised last time. But as I glance at the notice board, a new flyer catches my eye: an optional training session next week. The foreman said it\u2019s a chance to learn new skills, maybe even move up. He expects us to show commitment, to be part of the team. I know missing the session could mean falling behind, but missing my kids at the school gate means breaking their trust. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014my children\u2019s need for their mother, my team\u2019s need for a reliable worker. The clock ticks, and I stand frozen, torn between two worlds that both need me, unsure which one I\u2019ll let down."}
