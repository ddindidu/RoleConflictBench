Can you vacuum and tidy the living room before they arrive?\u201d I looked around the salon, my hands still damp from rinsing out a client\u2019s hair dye. The morning had been a blur of appointments, but I\u2019d promised to help at home. I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders\u2014my partner counting on me to share the load, to make our home welcoming for family.\n\nJust then, the bell above the salon door chimed. A woman stepped in, her eyes darting nervously from the reception desk to the row of chairs. She clutched her purse, hesitating. I knew that look\u2014first-time jitters. My boss always said, \u201cMake every client feel at home.\u201d I was supposed to greet her warmly, offer tea, and ease her nerves.\n\nBut my mind was split. I could almost see the dust on the living room shelves, hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head. I stood frozen, torn between the comfort I owed this anxious client and the support I owed my spouse, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
