My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales today, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My heart pounded. I had just one more call to make, and I could almost taste the relief of meeting the target. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my son darting between the aisles, giggling as he knocked over a display of cereal boxes. Other shoppers stared, some frowning, and I felt the heat rise in my cheeks. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and teach him about respect and discipline\u2014what kind of mother lets her child run wild in public? But the call timer was ticking, and if I missed this sale, I\u2019d let my whole team down.
