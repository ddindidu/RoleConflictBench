The purchase agreement needed my full attention; the deadline was tomorrow, and any oversight could cost my client dearly. Yet, as I tried to focus, I caught sight of my granddaughter slumped on the couch, her eyes red and distant. She\u2019d barely spoken all afternoon, and I knew something was weighing on her. As a grandmother, I felt the urge to set everything aside, to sit beside her, listen, and offer the comfort and wisdom she needed. But as a lawyer, I was bound by duty and the unyielding pressure of the approaching deadline. My heart ached with the pull of both worlds\u2014my family needing my presence, my profession demanding my expertise. I stared at the screen, torn, the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to answer first."}
