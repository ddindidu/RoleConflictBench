As their step-child, I felt a responsibility to be there for them, to listen and offer comfort, especially since we\u2019d only recently started to feel like a real family. But today, I was scheduled to attend a workshop on the latest prescription guidelines, something my pharmacy manager insisted was crucial for our team. Missing it would mean falling behind, risking my credibility and the trust my patients place in me. As I watched my parents quietly bicker over dinner, I felt torn. Should I stay home, make tea, and let them talk, or head out to the workshop and keep up with my professional duties? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat at the kitchen table, heart pounding, unable to decide which role needed me more tonight."}
