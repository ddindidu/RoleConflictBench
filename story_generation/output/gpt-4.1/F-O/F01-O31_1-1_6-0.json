It\u2019s tradition\u2014every year, I make sure to check in, remind everyone how much I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them, and help smooth over any last-minute details. Just as I was about to dial, my police radio crackled to life. There was a noise complaint on Maple Street\u2014a late-night party, neighbors upset, and I was the closest officer on duty.\n\nI hesitated, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore. As a grandfather, I knew how much my family counted on me to keep us connected, especially during the holidays. But as a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to keep the peace and enforce the law, no matter the hour or my personal plans. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family and the duty I\u2019d sworn to uphold. I stared at the phone, then at my badge, caught in the silent struggle between who I am to my family and who I am to my community."}
