I wanted to ask more, to dig deeper and make sure she was really okay, but my mind kept drifting to the factory floor. The old packaging machine had started acting up again\u2014just a flicker in the control panel, a hesitation in the conveyor. It was nothing urgent, but I knew if I didn\u2019t catch it now, it could become a bigger problem later. My supervisor expected me to be thorough, to catch every glitch before it became a crisis, even during these slow weeks. But here I was, torn between the urge to comfort my mom and the nagging worry about the machine. I could almost feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached with the need to be a good daughter, but my mind raced with possible causes for the machine\u2019s glitch. I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
