She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I promised her I would. But as I slipped my phone back into my scrubs pocket, the call bell rang from Mr. Harris\u2019s room. He was having another bad day, his arthritis flaring so badly he could barely hold a spoon. I could hear his weak voice calling for help, and I knew he\u2019d need me to feed him, to coax him through the pain and make sure he ate enough. My supervisor had already reminded us how short-staffed we were today. My heart twisted, pulled between the classroom where my daughter would scan the crowd for my face, and the bedside where Mr. Harris waited, depending on me for comfort and care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding more than I had to give, and I stood frozen, torn by the impossible choice."}
