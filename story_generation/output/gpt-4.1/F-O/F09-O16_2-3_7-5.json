Can you send some money?\u201d My heart clenches. As a mother, I know my children are counting on me to keep the fridge full, to make sure the bills are paid. I glance at my bank app, calculating what\u2019s left after this month\u2019s rent. There\u2019s barely enough, but I can\u2019t think about that now. A nurse knocks, reminding me that the patient\u2019s family is waiting. I take a deep breath, smoothing my coat, preparing to deliver news that will shatter their world. They expect me to be calm, compassionate, to answer their questions with patience and clarity. But my mind is split\u2014half with my family\u2019s needs, half with the family waiting for me in the next room. The weight of both roles presses down, and I wonder how I can possibly be enough for everyone."}
