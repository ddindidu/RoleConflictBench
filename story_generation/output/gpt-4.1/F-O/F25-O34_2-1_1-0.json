My shift as an air traffic controller was usually a blur of voices and vectors, but this early, the skies were empty, and my mind wandered. I glanced at my phone, remembering it was Sunday\u2014my stepdad would be waiting for our weekly call. He always said it meant a lot, these check-ins, especially since Mom passed. I knew he\u2019d be up, probably making coffee, hoping to hear about my week. But as I reached for my phone, a new flight plan pinged on my screen. A cargo jet was requesting an early approach, and protocol demanded my full attention. My headset felt heavier as I weighed the expectation to keep the airspace safe against the promise I\u2019d made to my family. My stepdad\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, gentle but persistent, while the blinking radar demanded my focus. I stared at the phone, torn, the silence stretching between duty and devotion."}
