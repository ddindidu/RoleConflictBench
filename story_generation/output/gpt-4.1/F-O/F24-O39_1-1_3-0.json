My stepmom smiled at me, her eyes hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to join in, to be part of the family, to show I cared. I nodded along, but my mind kept drifting back to the construction site. Earlier, my supervisor had pulled me aside, his voice low but firm: \u201cI need those materials moved before you leave today. No exceptions.\u201d The pile was heavy, the job tedious, and I\u2019d have to stay late to finish it. If I left work on time, I\u2019d disappoint my supervisor and risk looking unreliable. If I stayed late, I\u2019d miss the family dinner and the chance to bond with my step-siblings\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d try harder at. My stomach twisted as I glanced between my family and the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give."}
