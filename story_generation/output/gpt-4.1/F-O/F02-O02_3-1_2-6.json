He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. As a father, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions mattered and that I cared enough to help him make things right. But just as I was about to call the school, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning session was starting in ten minutes. My team was counting on me to provide accurate time estimates, and even though the session was informal, my input would shape the next few weeks of work. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I missed it, and the frustration of my colleagues if the project timeline slipped because I wasn\u2019t there. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent need to be a present father and the professional responsibility to my team. My mind raced, weighing the consequences of each choice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
