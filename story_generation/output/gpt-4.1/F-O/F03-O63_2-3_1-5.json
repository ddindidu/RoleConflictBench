They look forward to these calls, and so do I\u2014usually. But tonight, my headset is still warm from hours of cold calls. It\u2019s the last day of the quarter, and my manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My team\u2019s counting on me. I glance at the clock\u2014if I call my parents now, I\u2019ll miss the prime hour for closing deals. If I keep dialing prospects, I\u2019ll break my promise to my parents, who wait by the phone every Thursday.
