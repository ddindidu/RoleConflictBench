My phone buzzed with a message: \u201cYour child was involved in a bullying incident. Please come to the office.\u201d My heart sank. As a parent, I knew I had to be there for him, to listen, to guide, to show him right from wrong. But just as I stood up, my radio crackled. \u201cLifeguard, we\u2019ve got a group of teens diving at the deep end. Please respond.\u201d I looked out the window and saw the pool through the glass\u2014kids laughing, splashing, ignoring the big red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My job as a lifeguard demanded I act immediately, enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. But my son needed me, maybe more than ever. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. My hands shook as I tried to decide which responsibility to answer first."}
