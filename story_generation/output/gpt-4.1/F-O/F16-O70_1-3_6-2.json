I knew she wanted more than the usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d She wanted me to open up, to share the little frustrations and victories, to let her in. I started to tell her about a difficult delivery, but my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from dispatch. A medical supply package needed to reach the hospital within the hour. If I left now, I could just make it, but if I stayed, I could finally give my wife the honest conversation she\u2019d been asking for all week. My mind raced. She deserved my attention, my openness. But patients at the hospital were depending on me, too. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my heart torn between the person I loved and the job that demanded my reliability."}
