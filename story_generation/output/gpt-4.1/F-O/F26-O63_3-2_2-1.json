My script, highlighted and dog-eared, only covered the basics, and I could hear the impatience in his voice as I fumbled for answers. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle objections, don\u2019t let them hang up.\u201d I tried to sound confident, but my stomach twisted with every uncertain pause.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart ached. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I wanted to drop everything, to be the wise, steady presence she needed, to listen and guide her through whatever storm she was facing. But the customer was still waiting, and I could almost feel my supervisor\u2019s eyes on the call timer. I stared at the blinking lights on my phone, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family, caught in a moment where both roles pulled me in opposite directions."}
