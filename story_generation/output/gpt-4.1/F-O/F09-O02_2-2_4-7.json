My son darts between displays, giggling, his shoes squeaking on the linoleum. I know I should kneel down, look him in the eye, and calmly explain why running indoors isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014teaches, guides, sets boundaries. But my mind is split. My team\u2019s group chat is lighting up; management is waiting for my time estimates for the new project. They need my input now to finalize the quarterly roadmap. I can almost hear my manager\u2019s voice: \u201cWe need accuracy and commitment, no delays.\u201d I grip the cart, heart pounding, torn between the urge to discipline my son and the pressure to respond to work. Both roles demand my full attention, both expect me to be present and decisive. I feel the weight of their expectations pressing in, and for a moment, I\u2019m paralyzed, caught between the needs of my child and the demands of my career."}
