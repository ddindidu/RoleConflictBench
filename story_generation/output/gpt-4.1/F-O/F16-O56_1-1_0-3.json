My last client, Mrs. Lee, smiled in the mirror and asked if I could trim her fringe just a bit more. She was always pleasant, but I could sense she wanted it perfect this time. As I reached for my scissors, my phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just need to vent later.\u201d I remembered the way they\u2019d sounded this morning\u2014tired, but hopeful I\u2019d be home on time. My mind raced. Mrs. Lee deserved my full attention; she trusted me to get her look just right. But my partner needed me, too, even if they downplayed it. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in\u2014one pair of hands, two hearts to care for. I smiled at Mrs. Lee, steadying my hands, but inside, I was torn, wondering how I could possibly be enough for both of them tonight."}
