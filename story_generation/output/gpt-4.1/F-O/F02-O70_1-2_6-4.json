My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised Jamie the Nintendo today. He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. Money was tight, but I\u2019d scraped together enough for the console, hoping it would make Jamie\u2019s birthday special. As I pulled up to the next house, I saw the package label\u2014moderately valuable electronics, signature required. The customer wasn\u2019t home, and I knew the company expected me to secure every delivery, no exceptions. If I left it, I risked a complaint and maybe even my job. If I waited, I\u2019d be late picking up the Nintendo before the store closed. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I could almost hear Jamie\u2019s excitement, but I also felt the weight of my supervisor\u2019s warnings about missed signatures. The pressure of being a good father and a reliable employee pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, the minutes ticking by."}
