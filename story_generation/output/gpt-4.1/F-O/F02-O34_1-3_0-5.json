My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school.\u201d I pictured their faces, waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for me. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, after missing last week\u2019s recital. But the headset crackled, snapping me back to the control tower. \u201cTower, this is Delta 327, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My hands tightened on the console. The expectation here was clear\u2014lives depended on my calm, precise instructions. I glanced at the school\u2019s address on my phone, then at the radar screen where Delta 327\u2019s blip pulsed urgently. My children needed their father; the pilot needed an air traffic controller. Both roles demanded my full attention, both at the same time. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made to my kids and the responsibility I held in the tower. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, forced to choose which expectation to let down."}
