My husband\u2019s text blinked on my phone: \u201cRelatives will be here in two hours. Can you help with the cleaning?\u201d I knew how much he counted on me to make our home welcoming, especially when family visited. The kitchen still needed scrubbing, and the guest room was a mess. But as I tucked my phone away, I saw Mrs. Lee waiting at the pharmacy counter, her bag of pill bottles trembling in her hands. She was on five different medications, some with serious interaction risks. She looked anxious, and I knew she needed a thorough, careful consultation\u2014something I couldn\u2019t rush. My mind raced between the expectation to be a supportive wife, making our home shine for our guests, and my duty as a pharmacist, ensuring Mrs. Lee\u2019s safety. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose. My hands shook as I reached for Mrs. Lee\u2019s chart, my husband\u2019s message echoing in my mind."}
