It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you call? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there when she needed me. But just then, the attorney in the courtroom had cited a new appellate decision from last week\u2014one I hadn\u2019t yet read. As a judge, I was expected to be fully prepared, to know the latest legal precedents before the next session tomorrow. My mind raced. If I called my sister now, I\u2019d lose precious time to review the case law. If I ignored her, I\u2019d be breaking the unspoken promise we\u2019d always shared. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
