My shift is almost over, but today I had to bring my son, Ethan, with me. He sits quietly at first, coloring, but as the afternoon drags on and the store grows quieter, he grows restless. Suddenly, he darts from his seat, weaving between aisles, giggling as he dodges the displays. I see a customer\u2019s raised eyebrow, and I feel the heat rise in my cheeks. I know I should stop him, teach him to respect public spaces, to listen when I say \u201cstay close.\u201d That\u2019s what a good mother does. But the line is growing, and my manager is watching. If I leave the register, I risk making mistakes or holding up customers. My hands tremble as I scan a carton of milk, my eyes flicking between the register and Ethan\u2019s small, darting figure. I want to call out, to discipline him, but I also need to keep the line moving, to do my job well. The pressure builds inside me, two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I don\u2019t know which to choose."}
