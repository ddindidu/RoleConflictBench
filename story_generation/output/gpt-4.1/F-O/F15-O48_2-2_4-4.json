I know I should call him back, kneel down, and explain why running indoors isn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014teaches discipline, sets boundaries, models calm. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, and I see a message from the hospital: Mrs. Carter\u2019s vitals are up, and I\u2019m the one on shift to check and record them. My mind flashes to her pale face, the trust in her eyes as I promised to keep a close watch after her procedure. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s need for guidance, my patient\u2019s need for care. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give both the attention they deserve. My heart pounds as I watch my son weave through the crowd, and I picture Mrs. Carter waiting, anxious and alone. I stand frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good parent and a responsible nursing assistant, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
