As a lifeguard, I was supposed to make sure everything was in order before my shift ended\u2014equipment checked, pool chairs lined up, nothing out of place. Today, a few chairs were askew, not dangerous, but not up to standard either. I glanced at my phone. My children would be waiting outside their school in fifteen minutes, expecting to see me, their mother, ready to greet them with a smile and a hug. I could picture their faces, scanning the crowd, hoping I wouldn\u2019t be late again. My supervisor always reminded us that attention to detail was part of the job, and I prided myself on being thorough. But the thought of my kids standing alone, watching other parents arrive, made my chest tighten. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between straightening the chairs and rushing out the door, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding more than I could give."}
