She wanted to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about the future. She needed me to be open, to share everything, even the worries I tried to hide. My phone buzzed on the table. It was the Johnsons, desperate for help. Their house had termite damage so severe the beams could give way any day. As a carpenter, I knew I had to get over there, assess the damage, and draw up a repair plan before things got worse. But my wife\u2019s voice pulled me back. \u201cWe need to be honest with each other,\u201d she said softly. I felt the weight of her expectation, the need to be present, to communicate. At the same time, I felt the pull of my responsibility to the Johnsons, the urgency of their situation. My heart pounded as I looked from her to my phone, torn between being the husband she needed and the carpenter others depended on."}
