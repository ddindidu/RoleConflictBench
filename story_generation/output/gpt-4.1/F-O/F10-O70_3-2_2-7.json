I glanced at the screen: a message from my mom, asking if I\u2019d eaten lunch and reminding me to send a photo of my day, as I always did. Before I could reply, another notification popped up\u2014this time from the delivery app. The customer was asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s my order? It\u2019s been 20 minutes.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. My mom expected a warm, detailed reply, maybe even a quick call, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t answer soon. But the customer needed a prompt, professional update, and I couldn\u2019t risk a bad review. My thumbs hovered over the screen, torn between sending a reassuring message to my mom or responding to the customer first. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but insistent, while the customer\u2019s message blinked impatiently on the app. My heart pounded as I tried to decide whose expectations to meet first, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
