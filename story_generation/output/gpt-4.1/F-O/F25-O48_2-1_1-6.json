She\u2019s been quiet all morning, her eyes searching the window for something she can\u2019t name. I know she needs me to be present, to listen, to fill the silence with gentle words and warmth. But the phone keeps vibrating\u2014a reminder that it\u2019s Sunday, the day I call my stepdad and mom. They expect to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to share their week and ask about mine. I can almost hear my mom\u2019s anxious tone if I don\u2019t call, the disappointment in her sigh. I glance at Mrs. Carter, her loneliness palpable, and then at my phone, my family\u2019s needs echoing through the screen. My heart twists, torn between the comfort I owe this woman and the connection my parents crave. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both need me now."}
