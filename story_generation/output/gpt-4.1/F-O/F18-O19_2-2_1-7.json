The pharmacy workshop was starting in half an hour, and I still had to review the new prescription guidelines before heading out. Just as I was gathering my notes, the front door creaked open. My younger brother trudged in, his backpack slumped and eyes red-rimmed. He didn\u2019t say anything, but the way he dropped onto the couch spoke volumes. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school, probably with his friends again. As his sibling, I was supposed to be there, to listen and offer comfort, especially when he needed it most. But as a pharmacist, I was expected to stay sharp and updated, to attend these workshops so I could give my patients the best advice. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cWorkshop starts in 20 minutes.\u201d I stood frozen, torn between sitting beside my brother and heading out the door, my heart pulled in two directions by the expectations that defined me."}
