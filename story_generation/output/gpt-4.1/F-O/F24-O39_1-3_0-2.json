He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014how much he needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay. I wanted to be there, to sit with him and talk through his worries like we always did when things got tough. But my phone buzzed with a message from the site foreman: the crane was in position, and I was needed now. The beam was dangling, swaying slightly, and if I didn\u2019t help guide it, the whole crew would be delayed, maybe even put at risk. My hands shook as I looked from my work boots to the closed door of my stepbrother\u2019s room. I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the supportive sibling he needed, the other bound by the urgent demands of my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the call of family and the pull of responsibility."}
