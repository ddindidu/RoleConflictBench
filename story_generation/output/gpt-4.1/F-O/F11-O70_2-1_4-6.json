My family was already gathered around the dinner table, laughter and the clatter of dishes echoing from the kitchen. Mom had sent another message: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, we\u2019re waiting for you!\u201d I knew how much these dinners meant to her, and to my little brother, who always saved me a seat. But as I pulled on my delivery jacket, my work phone buzzed\u2014a customer was waiting for a package across town, and the app reminded me to be on time and courteous. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice: \u201cAlways greet the customer with a smile, no matter what.\u201d My hands trembled as I weighed the two worlds tugging at me. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the start of dinner, maybe disappoint my family. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk a bad review, maybe even a warning at work. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility of my job, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
