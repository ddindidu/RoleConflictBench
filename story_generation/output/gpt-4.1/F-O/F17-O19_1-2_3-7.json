My family\u2019s annual holiday gathering was this weekend, a tradition that meant everything to my parents. They expected me to be there, to help cook, laugh, and share stories\u2014just like every year. My mother had already called twice, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family values, especially now that my younger cousins looked up to me.\n\nBut on the same weekend, my pharmacy was hosting a crucial workshop on the latest prescription guidelines. Missing it would mean falling behind on important updates, risking my ability to counsel patients properly. My supervisor had emphasized how essential it was for all pharmacists to attend, and I knew my colleagues would be there, ready to discuss what they\u2019d learned.\n\nAs I sat at my desk, the invitation to the workshop open on my laptop and my mother\u2019s voice echoing in my mind, I felt torn. The pressure to honor my family\u2019s expectations clashed painfully with my professional responsibility. My heart pounded as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, feeling the impossible pull of both roles."}
