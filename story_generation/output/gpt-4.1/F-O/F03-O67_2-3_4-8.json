My father\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever forget who you are, or where you come from. Our family always stops to pray before a journey, no matter what.\u201d Just this morning, my mother had pressed my hand, reminding me that tradition keeps us safe. But now, the siren wailed above the roar of thunder, and a patient\u2019s life depended on every second I shaved off the route. My partner in the back called out updates, his voice tense. I knew the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing, and every instinct as an ambulance driver screamed at me to focus, to drive with absolute caution. Yet, guilt gnawed at me for not stopping to honor my family\u2019s ritual, for breaking a promise that felt sacred. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s expectations pulling me one way, my duty to my patient the other. I could feel myself caught in the storm, not just outside, but inside too, torn between the traditions that shaped me and the responsibility that defined me now."}
