She looked tired, her voice softer than usual, and I could sense she needed someone to just be there, to listen. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my weekly call home. Mom and Dad would be waiting, expecting to hear my voice, to know I was okay, to share their own stories. I knew how much those calls meant to them, especially since I moved out. But Mrs. Thompson\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for comfort, and I felt the weight of her loneliness. I wanted to be present for her, to offer the support she needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my parents down. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being a good son and a caring nursing assistant, unsure which need was greater in that moment."}
