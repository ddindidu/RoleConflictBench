As a step-parent, I promised my partner and stepdaughter stability, a roof over our heads, and a future free from the uncertainty they\u2019d known before. I\u2019ve been picking up extra shifts, calculating every dollar, and skipping small luxuries to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. \n\nSuddenly, the radio crackles\u2014dispatch reports a patient with a broken bone, a few miles away, traffic already building. As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to respond instantly, to cut through the city\u2019s chaos and deliver help without delay. Every second counts for the patient, and my team relies on me to keep a clear head and a steady hand.\n\nBut as I grip the steering wheel, my mind races. If I keep taking extra shifts, I\u2019ll be too exhausted to drive safely. If I slow down, I risk failing the patient and my crew. The weight of both worlds presses in, and I can feel myself caught between the urgent demands of the job and the quiet, relentless pressure of home."}
