The project was already behind, and every minute counted. My mind raced with solutions, ways to reassign teams, to push the schedule back on track. Just then, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you?\u201d she asked, voice small. She wanted advice about starting high school, about making friends and facing new challenges. I saw the hope in her face, the trust that I\u2019d have the right words. But my phone kept buzzing, the weight of the project pressing on my shoulders. I felt torn\u2014my team needed decisions now, but my granddaughter needed me, too.
