It\u2019s your turn to honor our ancestors.\u201d The weight of tradition pressed on my shoulders, the expectation to perform every ritual perfectly, to show respect, to make my family proud. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014tomorrow was the lab\u2019s safety audit. I remembered the cracked beaker, the loose wire on the centrifuge, the checklist I hadn\u2019t finished. As a scientist, I was responsible for the lab\u2019s safety, for the trust my colleagues placed in me. If I didn\u2019t fix those issues, the audit could go badly, and everyone would know I\u2019d let things slide. My heart pounded as I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I missed the ceremony, and my supervisor\u2019s stern face if the lab failed inspection. I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation impossible to ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the call of my family\u2019s past and the responsibility of my scientific present, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
