My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another message from my son, asking if I\u2019ve bought the Nintendo yet. I promised him last month, after he brought home his report card, that I\u2019d get it as soon as I could. He\u2019s been counting the days, and I can almost hear the hope in his texts. I want to give him everything, to make up for the things I can\u2019t always be there for.\n\nBut as I turn to head back to my station, I spot a slick, glistening puddle in the walkway. It\u2019s not big, but it\u2019s right where the guys haul heavy loads. If someone slips, it could mean a broken bone\u2014or worse. I know the rules: safety first, always. My supervisor expects me to keep the site clean and safe, no excuses.\n\nMy mind races. If I stop to clean it, I\u2019ll miss the bus to the store, and the Nintendo might be gone by the time I get there. If I leave it, someone could get hurt, and I could lose my job\u2014the job that pays for the Nintendo in the first place. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between being the mother I want to be and the worker I have to be."}
