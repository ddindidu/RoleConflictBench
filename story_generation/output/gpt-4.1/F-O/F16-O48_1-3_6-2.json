They asked, \u201cHow was work?\u201d and I hesitated, feeling the weight of everything I\u2019d seen. I wanted to be honest, to share the ache in my chest from watching Mr. Harris, my patient, grimace in pain as he tried to lift his spoon. I was supposed to help him eat, to ease his discomfort, but the shift was short-staffed and I was pulled away again and again. My spouse looked at me, expecting openness, wanting to connect. But my mind was still in that hospital room, replaying Mr. Harris\u2019s trembling hands and the guilt that I couldn\u2019t do more. I felt torn\u2014my partner needed me present, to talk, to listen, to be real. But my heart was still with my patient, wondering if I\u2019d done enough, if I should have stayed longer. The words caught in my throat, and I sat there, wrestling with the urge to protect my spouse from my worries and the need to honor the trust my patient placed in me."}
