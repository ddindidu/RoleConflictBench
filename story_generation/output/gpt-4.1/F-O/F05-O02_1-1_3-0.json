My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cWe agreed to share the chores, remember?\u201d\u2014and I know she\u2019s right. I promised to help, to be present, to not let work swallow me whole. But my laptop sits open on the table, blueprints and code snippets glowing on the screen. The project at work is still in its early stages, but my mind races with ideas, eager to sketch out new solutions before the next meeting. I feel the pull from both sides: the comfort of home, the warmth of partnership, and the thrill of engineering, the urge to create. My hands hover between the laundry basket and the keyboard, heart pounding with guilt and anticipation. I want to be a good husband, to pull my weight at home, but the engineer in me whispers that inspiration is fleeting, that now is the time to act. I stand frozen, torn between the soft fabric of family life and the hard logic of my profession, unsure which demand to answer first."}
