It was a message from my partner: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you right now.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in their voice, the weight of the crisis they\u2019d been carrying for days. I knew how much they needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But here I was, in my scrubs, with a list of patients waiting for their morning vitals. Mrs. Lee depended on me to check her blood pressure on time\u2014her medication schedule hinged on it. The hospital expected me to be efficient, reliable, and focused. My partner expected me to be emotionally available, to drop everything if they needed me. I stood in the hallway, torn between the beeping monitors and the silent plea on my phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
