My mother poured tea, her eyes lingering on me a little too long. \u201cIs everything okay at work?\u201d she asked, her voice gentle but probing. I knew she worried, especially since I\u2019d started working on this high-stakes case. I wanted to reassure her, to be the supportive child she expected, to let her know I was handling things. But the truth was, I was under immense pressure. Just that morning, opposing counsel had cornered me, demanding information I knew I couldn\u2019t share. The rules of confidentiality were clear, and my client\u2019s trust depended on my silence. Yet, my mother\u2019s concern tugged at me. She wanted honesty, openness\u2014she wanted to help. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to protect my client, and the desire to comfort my parents. My hands trembled slightly as I stirred my tea, caught between the urge to confide and the duty to remain silent, my heart pounding with the strain of being both a good lawyer and a good child."}
