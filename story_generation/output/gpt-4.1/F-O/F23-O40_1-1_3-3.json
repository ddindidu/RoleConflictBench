I gently reminded him, \u201cEthan, remember to eat quietly, please.\u201d He rolled his eyes, and I felt the familiar tension of wanting to guide him without overstepping, knowing how delicate our relationship still was. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a client. They needed a rush estimate for a custom bookshelf, and I had to check my inventory and place an order for oak before the supplier\u2019s noon cutoff. My mind raced: if I left Ethan now, I\u2019d miss a teachable moment, but if I stayed, I\u2019d risk delaying the order and disappointing a client who counted on my reliability. I stood in the doorway, torn between the responsibility of shaping a young boy\u2019s manners and the pressing demands of my craft, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
