My sister wanted to go hiking, my brother suggested a movie marathon, and my parents just wanted us all together. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my input, hoping I\u2019d be part of whatever we decided. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the product team\u2019s brainstorming session was coming up next sprint. Attendance was technically optional, but I knew how much it mattered\u2014being there meant having a say in the new features, showing initiative, and building relationships with other teams. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment if I skipped it, the missed chance to contribute. My family\u2019s laughter pulled me back, and I felt a knot in my stomach. I wanted to be present for them, to join in and not be the sibling who always had \u201cwork stuff.\u201d But I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down or miss out on shaping the project. The two worlds tugged at me, each expecting my presence, each unwilling to let go."}
