The clock ticks past five, and I know dinner needs to be started soon, but I have a quota to meet. My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cHandle every objection, don\u2019t let them off the line.\u201d The phone rings again. Another prospect, another barrage of technical questions about the new service\u2014questions my script only half answers. I try to sound confident, but my mind drifts to the bills stacked on the counter. We need this job. I need to keep this job. My son tugs at my sleeve, asking for help with his math. I gesture for him to wait, my heart twisting. I want to be the mother who\u2019s present, who helps with homework and makes sure there\u2019s food on the table. But right now, I\u2019m the telemarketer who can\u2019t hang up, who can\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The customer\u2019s voice grows impatient. My son\u2019s eyes grow sad. I feel pulled in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and I don\u2019t know which one to answer first."}
