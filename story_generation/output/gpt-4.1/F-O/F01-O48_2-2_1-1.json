Through the window, I saw my grandson sitting on the bench outside, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the ground. He\u2019d been quiet lately, and as his grandfather, I felt the weight of responsibility to reach out, to offer the kind of wisdom only years could teach. I wanted to sit beside him, to listen, to help him find his way.\n\nBut just then, the call bell chimed from Room 204. Mrs. Jenkins, still weak from her surgery, needed help getting dressed. As a nursing assistant, I knew she depended on me for her comfort and dignity. The expectation was clear: patients come first, their needs immediate and pressing.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My grandson needed my presence, my patient needed my care. Both roles demanded all of me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I stood frozen, the hallway stretching before me, the weight of both worlds pressing down as I wrestled with what to do next."}
