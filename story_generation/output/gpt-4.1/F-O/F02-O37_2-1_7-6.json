My daughter\u2019s school fees were due, and the fridge was nearly empty. As a father, I felt the weight of every expectation\u2014my family needed me to keep us afloat, to make sure there was food on the table and a roof over our heads. That\u2019s why I took every extra shift I could get as a housekeeping cleaner at the hotel, even when my body ached from exhaustion.\n\nToday, the supervisor reminded us again: gloves must be worn for all cleaning tasks, no exceptions. But the supply room was running low, and the manager hinted that if we used too many, it might come out of our pay. I hesitated, glancing at the dirty bathroom I was assigned to clean. If I skipped the gloves, I could finish faster, maybe squeeze in another room, earn a little more. But the risk of getting sick\u2014and bringing something home\u2014gnawed at me. My mind spun between the need to provide for my family and the rules I was supposed to follow. I stood there, gloves in hand, torn between what I had to do and what I was supposed to do."}
