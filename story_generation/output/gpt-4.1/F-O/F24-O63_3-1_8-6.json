The office was unusually quiet, and my supervisor had just messaged that we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. I glanced at the clock, thinking I could use a few minutes to clear my head. Just then, I looked out the window and saw my stepbrother, Jamie, on the sidewalk below. He was fiddling with his phone, not paying attention, and started to step off the curb. My heart jumped\u2014he wasn\u2019t looking for cars, and this street was always busy. \n\nAs his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he was safe, especially since our parents always reminded me to keep an eye on him after school. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to stick to my scheduled break, not just run out whenever I wanted, even if things were slow. My supervisor was lenient, but I still worried about being seen as unreliable. I felt torn, my hand hovering over the \u201cbreak\u201d button, my eyes darting between the street and my computer screen, caught between two worlds and unsure which one to choose."}
