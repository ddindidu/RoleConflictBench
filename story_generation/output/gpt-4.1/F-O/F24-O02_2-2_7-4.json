My stepbrother, Jamie, was tightening his helmet, grinning at me as he eyed the steep, uneven ramp. \u201cWatch this, I\u2019ve been practicing all week,\u201d he called out, already rolling his board into position. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But as an engineer, my thoughts kept drifting to the new safety standard at work\u2014how every detail had to be documented, every risk accounted for, or the project could be delayed. \n\nJamie\u2019s ramp was nowhere near compliant with any standard I knew. The cracks, the loose boards, the uneven slope\u2014my professional instincts screamed at me to intervene, to stop him, to insist on a safer setup. But he looked so excited, so sure of himself, and I knew how much this meant to him. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibility to him as family against my ingrained duty to safety and rules. I opened my mouth, torn between warning him and letting him have his moment."}
