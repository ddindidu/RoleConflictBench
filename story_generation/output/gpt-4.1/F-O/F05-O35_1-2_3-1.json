The radio crackles\u2014there\u2019s a minor signal delay ahead. I know I\u2019ll have to adjust my speed, keep the ride smooth, and make up for lost time if I can. The passengers expect punctuality, and safety is always my top priority. But my mind drifts to home, to the laundry basket overflowing in the corner of our bedroom. My wife and I promised to share the chores, and it\u2019s my turn to fold the laundry tonight. She\u2019s had a long week, and I can almost hear her tired sigh as she steps over the pile. I want to be the partner she can rely on, not just the one who brings home a paycheck. The train slows as I approach the signal, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I can\u2019t be late, not with all these people depending on me. But I also can\u2019t keep letting her down. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next."}
