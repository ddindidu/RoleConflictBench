She mentions a tense meeting with her boss, her voice a little shaky, and I know she needs me to be present, to ask questions, to really listen. But my mind keeps drifting back to the error logs flashing on my screen. The critical service I deployed this morning is buckling under load, and the traces point straight to the functions I wrote. My team is pinging me for a fix, and I can almost feel the weight of their expectations\u2014clean, efficient code, no downtime, no excuses. My wife pauses, waiting for a response, and I realize I haven\u2019t heard the last thing she said. I want to close the laptop, to be the supportive husband she deserves, but the pressure from work is relentless. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to dive back into the code and the need to be here, now, for her."}
