It was Sunday evening\u2014our weekly call. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, asking about my week, my father\u2019s quiet questions about my health. I knew they waited for this, that it reassured them I was safe, that I cared. But tonight, the radar screen was a storm of blips and shifting vectors. An emergency diversion had just been declared, a passenger jet with engine trouble, cutting across three sectors. My headset crackled with urgent voices\u2014controllers from neighboring towers, pilots needing instructions, supervisors demanding updates. Every second counted. My hands hovered over the controls, my mind racing to keep the airspace safe. I glanced at my phone, the call still ringing, my parents\u2019 expectations tugging at me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to the skies, my duty to my family\u2014each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
