My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you fold those before dinner?\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, and lately, I\u2019ve been letting things slide. But my phone buzzes\u2014a last-minute client, desperate for a wash and trim before her big date. She\u2019s already on her way, and I know she\u2019ll expect me to work my magic, even though her hair will be a sweaty, greasy mess after her gym session.\n\nI glance between the laundry and my scissors, heart pounding. If I leave the clothes, my partner will be disappointed, maybe even resentful. If I turn down the client, I risk losing her trust\u2014and a good tip. My mind races, torn between the comfort of home and the demands of my chair. The weight of both roles presses down, and I stand frozen, wishing I could split myself in two."}
