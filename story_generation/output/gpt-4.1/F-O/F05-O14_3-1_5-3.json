My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, reminding me that her parents would arrive in two hours. The living room still needed vacuuming, and the guest room sheets had to be changed. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d help, that we\u2019d present a united front, a home that looked as cared for as our marriage. But my phone buzzed on the counter, a reminder from the lab\u2019s database: the latest experiment\u2019s results were ready for logging. I knew the data could wait until tomorrow, but the urge to document everything while it was fresh gnawed at me. I felt the weight of my lab coat even in my t-shirt, the responsibility to be precise, to not let details slip. My wife poked her head in, her eyes hopeful, and I felt the pull between the two worlds\u2014one asking for my presence, the other for my diligence. My hands trembled slightly as I stared at the soapy water, torn between the home I\u2019d built and the work that defined me."}
