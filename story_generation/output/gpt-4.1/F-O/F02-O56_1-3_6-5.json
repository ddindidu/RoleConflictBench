I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo if I could manage it this month, and he\u2019d been counting down the days. But as I swept up the last of the day\u2019s hair, a client stormed back in, her voice sharp and echoing through the emptying shop. She hated her cut, she said, and demanded I fix it right now. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked to me, silently reminding me that client satisfaction was non-negotiable. I felt the weight of my wallet in my pocket\u2014tips from today might just be enough for the Nintendo, but only if I could get to the store before it closed. My son\u2019s trust in my promises pressed on me, but so did the expectation that I\u2019d handle this client with patience and professionalism. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the father my son needed and the hairdresser my client expected."}
