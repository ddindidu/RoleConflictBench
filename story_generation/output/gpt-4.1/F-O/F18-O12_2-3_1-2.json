My younger brother trudged in, his backpack barely hanging on his shoulder, eyes red and puffy. I glanced at the clock\u2014just past four. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew that look; something had gone wrong at school, probably with his friends again. I wanted to go over, sit beside him, and let him talk it out like I always did. That\u2019s what siblings do, right? We\u2019re supposed to be there for each other, especially when things get rough.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with another alert. The service was still lagging, and the logs pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d just merged. My team was counting on me to fix this, and fast. If I didn\u2019t, the whole system could go down during peak hours. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my eyes kept drifting to my brother, silent and hurting. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding more than I could give."}
