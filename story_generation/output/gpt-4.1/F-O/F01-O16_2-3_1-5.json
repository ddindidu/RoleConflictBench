As a doctor, I knew I had to be clear, compassionate, and strong\u2014someone they could lean on, even as I delivered news that would shake their world. My phone buzzed. It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you talk to Sam? He\u2019s been really down lately.\u201d My grandson, usually so bright, had been quiet and withdrawn. As his grandfather, I wanted to offer him comfort, to share stories of my own struggles and reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But the weight of my white coat pressed on me. I couldn\u2019t be late for the family waiting at the hospital, yet the thought of Sam sitting alone with his worries gnawed at me. Both needed me\u2014one for wisdom, the other for strength. My heart pulled in two directions, I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of the grandfather I longed to be and the doctor I was needed to be."}
