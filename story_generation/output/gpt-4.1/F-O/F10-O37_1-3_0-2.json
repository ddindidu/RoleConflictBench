Miss you!\u201d I know she wants me to call, to hear my voice, to feel that I\u2019m still close even though I moved out last year. I glance at the clock\u2014my shift at the hotel started an hour ago, and I\u2019m only halfway through scrubbing the bathrooms. The supervisor just reminded us that every corner needs to be spotless today; there\u2019s a big inspection coming up. My hands ache from the bleach, and my mind races with guilt. I want to send a long reply, maybe even call my parents and tell them about my week, but I can\u2019t risk falling behind. If I don\u2019t finish on time, I\u2019ll let my team down and maybe even lose hours next week. I stare at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the pressure of my job, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
