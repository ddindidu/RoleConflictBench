My mind was half on the conversation, half on the text I\u2019d just received from my stepmother: \u201cCan we talk tonight? Your dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to check in and make sure everything was okay at home. But the project was behind schedule, and the contractor needed answers now. My boss expected me to keep things moving, to be available, to solve problems before they became crises. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I called home, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk another delay. If I stayed focused on work, I\u2019d be letting my family down, ignoring the subtle plea for support. My heart tugged in one direction, my professional pride in another, and I sat there, paralyzed, unable to choose which expectation to meet first."}
