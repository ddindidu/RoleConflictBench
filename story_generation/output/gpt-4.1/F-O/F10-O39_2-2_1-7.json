It\u2019s Mom, right on time for our weekly call. I can almost hear her voice, warm and expectant, waiting to hear about my week, to tell me about Dad\u2019s new hobby or the neighbor\u2019s cat. I know how much these calls mean to her, how she worries if I miss even one. But the foreman\u2019s whistle cuts through the morning air, sharp and urgent. The safety briefing is about to start, and everyone is already gathering by the trailer. Missing it isn\u2019t an option\u2014site rules are strict, and teamwork depends on everyone being present and alert. My fingers hover over the phone, heart thumping. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t be the attentive daughter and the reliable worker at the same time. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
