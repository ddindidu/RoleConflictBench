The lines on the paper were clean and purposeful, every angle considered for maximum usability. As an architect, I knew how important it was to get the details right, to create a space that worked seamlessly. My phone buzzed, breaking my concentration. It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that only a brother would notice. She\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew she expected the same support in return.\n\nBut the deadline for my renovation plan loomed. My client was counting on me to deliver a functional design by tomorrow morning. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family needing my presence, my profession demanding my focus. My heart ached with guilt as I stared at the unfinished sketch, torn between the role of a supportive brother and a dedicated architect. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, unable to choose which part of me to honor first."}
