It was a message from Mom: \u201cHow are you, sweetheart? Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I knew she worried, especially with my job, and I\u2019d promised to check in more often. I started typing a reply, trying to sound cheerful and reassuring, but my mind was half on the radio at my side, waiting for the next emergency call. Every second counted in my line of work; if a call came in, I\u2019d have to drop everything and run. My parents expected me to be present, to share my life with them, but my duty as an ambulance driver demanded my full attention and immediate action. I stared at the unfinished message, torn between the need to be a good daughter and the responsibility to be ready for someone else\u2019s crisis. The radio crackled, and my heart raced, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
