My stepbrother, Jamie, was tightening his helmet, eyes gleaming with excitement as he eyed the steep, cracked ramp. \u201cWatch this, I\u2019m finally going to land it!\u201d he called. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my project manager, reminding me that the final safety inspection for the hospital was in an hour. As the architect, I was responsible for every detail, every regulation, every life that would depend on that building\u2019s safety. I glanced at Jamie, then at the structural notes in my hand. If I left now, I could double-check the fire exits and make sure the stairwells were up to code. But if I left Jamie alone, what if he fell? My mind raced, torn between the brother who trusted me to watch over him and the hundreds of patients who would trust the building I designed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
