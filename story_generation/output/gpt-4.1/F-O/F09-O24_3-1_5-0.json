My heart pounded as I listened\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. I rushed over, my mind racing with the weight of my two worlds. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. I wanted to hold him, to comfort him, but I also needed to be firm, to discipline him so he would learn.\n\nBut as I sat with him in the car, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the new case file had arrived, and I was expected to review it thoroughly before the hearing. The court demanded my attention, my diligence, my impartiality. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my son\u2019s tearful eyes beside me, the unopened file waiting on my desk.
