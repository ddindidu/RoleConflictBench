I knew something was wrong\u2014she\u2019d been quiet all evening. As her husband, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask her what was weighing on her mind, to listen and share my own worries from the day. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my radio crackled to life. Dispatch called: a woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My training kicked in\u2014someone needed me, needed my calm hands and quick thinking. But my wife needed me too, right now, in this moment. I could see the expectation in her eyes, the silent plea for me to stay and talk. My heart pounded as I stood, torn between the duty to my patient and the promise I\u2019d made to always be there for her.
