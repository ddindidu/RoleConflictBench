Mom had sent a picture of the table set for dinner, my brother joked about saving me the last piece of pie, and my sister asked if I\u2019d be there on time. I could almost hear their voices, the laughter, the warmth. As their sister, I knew how much these dinners meant\u2014how much I was expected to be there, to share stories, to be present.\n\nBut on my calendar, circled in red, was the workshop at the pharmacy downtown. The new prescription guidelines were rolling out next week, and as a pharmacist, I was expected to be on top of every detail. My manager had emphasized how crucial it was for patient safety, and I knew my colleagues would be there, taking notes, asking questions. Missing it would mean falling behind, maybe even letting my patients down.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the comfort of my family and the responsibility of my profession. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
