The store was quiet, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014again. My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cMom, please come. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. My family needed me, my grandkids needed me, and I could picture their worried faces. But as I glanced at the register tape, I noticed a small discrepancy. The numbers didn\u2019t quite add up, and store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. I was supposed to report it, fill out the paperwork, and wait for the manager. That could take hours. I felt torn in two. My family expected me to be there, to comfort and support them, but my job demanded my attention and honesty. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
