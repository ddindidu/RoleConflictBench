He wanted us to be completely honest about our finances, to lay everything out on the table. I promised him I would, but as I scanned items and greeted customers, I kept thinking about the small loan I\u2019d taken out last month to cover an unexpected bill. I hadn\u2019t told him yet. \n\nA woman approached the counter, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded with me to make an exception, explaining her situation in hushed, desperate tones. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, no matter what. But as I looked into the customer\u2019s eyes, I felt the same pressure I\u2019d felt at home: the expectation to be honest and fair, but also compassionate and understanding. \n\nMy heart pounded. At home, I was supposed to be open and transparent. Here, I was supposed to be firm and unwavering. Both roles demanded something from me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I could meet without letting someone down."}
