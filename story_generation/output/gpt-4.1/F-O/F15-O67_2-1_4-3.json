Gauze, bandages, epinephrine\u2014everything had to be perfect. My mind was on the checklist, but my ears caught the sound of sneakers squeaking and laughter echoing down the aisle. I looked up to see my son darting between displays, weaving dangerously close to a pyramid of canned soup. Other shoppers glanced over, some with disapproval, some with concern. As a parent, I knew I should stop him, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or polite. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus; a missing or expired item could mean the difference between life and death for a patient. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to my child, my duty to my patients. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between calling out to my son and finishing my critical check."}
