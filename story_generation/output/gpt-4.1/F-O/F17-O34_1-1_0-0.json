Hope you\u2019re well. Love you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20145:12 a.m. The radar is calm, only a few blips moving steadily across the screen. I know I should reply, just a quick text to let her know I\u2019m okay, that I\u2019m thinking of her too. She worries if I don\u2019t check in, especially on weekends when she knows I\u2019m working these early shifts. But my headset crackles with a pilot\u2019s voice, requesting a minor course adjustment. Even though the sky is empty, I can\u2019t let my attention slip. I\u2019m responsible for every aircraft up there, no matter how quiet it seems. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between the comfort of a simple message home and the unspoken rule that nothing\u2014not even family\u2014should distract me from the radar. The silence in the room feels heavy, filled with the weight of both my mother\u2019s gentle expectation and the invisible responsibility of the air above me."}
