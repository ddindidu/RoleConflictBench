The pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cLow fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart pounds. Every second counts. I start to respond, but my phone vibrates\u2014my mom\u2019s name flashes on the screen. She\u2019s been quiet lately, and I promised I\u2019d check in, make sure everything\u2019s okay at home. I remember her tired voice last night, the way she hesitated before saying goodnight. I know she needs me, just as much as this pilot needs clear, calm instructions. My mind races, torn between the urgency in the cockpit and the quiet worry in my mother\u2019s voice. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, expectations colliding, and for a moment, I can\u2019t breathe."}
