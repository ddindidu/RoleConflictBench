My passenger in the back seat kept checking his watch, his voice tense as he reminded me, \u201cMy train leaves in fifteen minutes. Please, can you hurry?\u201d The traffic lights ahead glowed red, and I felt the pressure mounting. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him to the station safely and on time, but the city\u2019s rush hour had other plans.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my husband. He\u2019d seemed distant lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d talk to him tonight, to ask what was wrong and share my own worries. As a wife, I was supposed to be open, to communicate and support him, especially when he needed me. But now, with my passenger\u2019s anxious glances in the rearview mirror and the weight of my husband\u2019s silence on my mind, I felt torn. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet them both."}
