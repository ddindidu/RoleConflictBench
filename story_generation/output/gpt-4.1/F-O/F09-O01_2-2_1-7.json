The school had sent another reminder about the open class tomorrow\u2014my daughter\u2019s first time presenting in front of everyone. She\u2019d been practicing her lines all week, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I could already picture her scanning the crowd, searching for my face.\n\nBut at the same time, my inbox pinged with a message from the contractor. The steel delivery for the new library was delayed, and the only time everyone could meet to resolve it was tomorrow morning. If I missed this meeting, the project could fall behind, and I\u2019d be letting down my team and the client who trusted me to keep everything on track.\n\nMy heart pounded as I imagined both rooms: the classroom filled with eager children and proud parents, and the construction site buzzing with tension and urgency. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
