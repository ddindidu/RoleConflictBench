We were almost at the corner store where I worked part-time as a cashier. My shift was about to start, so I told him to wait inside while I clocked in. Not long after, a woman came in, flustered, holding a blender she wanted to return. She didn\u2019t have a receipt, and I knew the store\u2019s policy was strict\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. As I tried to explain this, she grew upset, her voice rising. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my brother near the door, looking nervous and out of place. I felt torn\u2014my manager expected me to enforce the rules, but my brother needed me to look out for him, especially in a busy store with strangers. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle the customer\u2019s frustration and my brother\u2019s anxious glances, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
