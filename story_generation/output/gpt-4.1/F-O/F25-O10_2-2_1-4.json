The quarterly tax filing was due next week, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I was responsible for making sure every detail was perfect. Any mistake could mean penalties or worse, an audit. My phone buzzed, jolting me from my concentration. It was my stepmother, calling for our weekly check-in. I knew she and Dad looked forward to these calls, expecting me to share updates and ask about their health. They always said it made them feel included in my life, especially since I moved out. But right now, the thought of pausing my work filled me with anxiety. If I took the call, I\u2019d lose my focus and precious time. If I ignored it, I\u2019d disappoint them and feel guilty for days. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, torn between being the dutiful step-child and the diligent accountant, unsure which role to answer first."}
