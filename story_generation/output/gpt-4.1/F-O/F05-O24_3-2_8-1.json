My wife sits across from me at the kitchen table, her eyes searching mine. She wants to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about our finances, about the medical bills piling up, about what we\u2019re going to do next. She expects honesty, openness, the kind of conversation that can\u2019t be rushed or half-hearted. But my mind keeps drifting to the thick stack of case files waiting in my study. Tomorrow, I preside over a trial that could set a precedent, and I haven\u2019t finished reviewing the final briefs. As a judge, I owe it to the court, to justice itself, to be fully prepared. But as a husband, I owe her my attention, my trust, my willingness to face our problems together. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give. My heart aches with the fear of letting someone down, and I sit there, torn, as the clock ticks on."}
