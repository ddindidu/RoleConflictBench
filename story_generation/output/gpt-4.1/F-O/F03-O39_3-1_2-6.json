I knew it was Mom\u2014she always texted around this time, wanting to know how my day was going. Ever since I started working construction, I made it a point to reply quickly, sending her little updates and photos so she wouldn\u2019t worry. But today, the foreman had just posted a notice about an optional training session next week. He said it would help us work safer and maybe even open up new responsibilities. The catch? It was scheduled right during the hour I usually called home. I could already hear my dad\u2019s voice, \u201cWe just want to hear from you, son.\u201d At the same time, I pictured my crew, expecting me to step up and show I was serious about the job.
