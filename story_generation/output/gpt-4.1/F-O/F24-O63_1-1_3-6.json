Mom glanced at me, her eyes hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to join in, to be part of the family, to say yes when they asked if I\u2019d come along. My phone buzzed with a reminder: my scheduled break was almost over. As a telemarketer, I was supposed to stick to my break times, but today the call volume was light, and my supervisor had said we could be flexible. Still, I worried about missing a call or being seen as unreliable. My family\u2019s laughter pulled at me, but so did the quiet pressure of my job. I wanted to be present, to show my step-siblings I cared, but I also didn\u2019t want to risk my reputation at work. My heart thudded as I looked from my family to the clock, torn between the warmth of belonging and the responsibility of my job, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
