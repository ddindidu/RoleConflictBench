Every week, without fail, I\u2019d update them on my life, ask about their health, and listen to my mother\u2019s gentle reminders to eat well and rest. Tonight, though, I was at the ambulance station, kneeling beside the open first-aid kit, checking expiration dates and counting gauze pads. My partner was waiting for my sign-off so we could be ready for the next emergency. I knew how much my parents looked forward to our calls, especially since Dad\u2019s surgery last month. But if I rushed through the kit check, I might miss something crucial\u2014a missing vial, an expired bandage\u2014that could cost a patient dearly. My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cReady to chat when you are!\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be the reliable daughter they counted on, but right now, someone else\u2019s life might depend on my focus as an ambulance driver. I stared at the phone, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
