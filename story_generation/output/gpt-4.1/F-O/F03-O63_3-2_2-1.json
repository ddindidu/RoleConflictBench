I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from Mom, asking if I\u2019d eaten lunch and how my morning was going. Normally, I\u2019d reply right away, maybe send a photo of my sandwich or a quick voice note. But right now, I was on a call with a customer who kept firing off technical questions about our new service, questions my script barely covered. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Handle every objection. Keep them engaged.\u201d I could hear the impatience in the customer\u2019s voice, and I scrambled to sound confident, flipping through the FAQ sheet with one hand while my other thumb hovered over my phone, itching to text Mom back. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my parents expected me to be present, attentive, and open, while my job demanded focus, quick thinking, and undivided attention. My heart pounded as I tried to juggle both, knowing I was about to let someone down, no matter what I chose."}
