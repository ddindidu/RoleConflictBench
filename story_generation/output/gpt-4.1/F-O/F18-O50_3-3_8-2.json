He was fiddling with his phone, oblivious to the busy street just a few steps away. I saw him move toward the curb, not even glancing up. My heart lurched\u2014Mom always said to look out for him, to make sure he was safe. But just then, my pager buzzed urgently: the ICU needed me. A life-support machine was failing, and every second counted. I could already picture the nurses\u2019 anxious faces, the patient\u2019s family waiting for answers. My mind raced\u2014if I ran to my brother, I might save him from a terrible accident. But if I didn\u2019t get to the ICU right now, someone else\u2019s sibling might not make it. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
