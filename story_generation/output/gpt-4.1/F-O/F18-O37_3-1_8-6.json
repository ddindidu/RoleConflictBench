I glanced up just in time to see him darting toward the street, chasing after a runaway soccer ball. My heart leapt into my throat. As his older sibling, I knew I was supposed to keep him safe, to always be watching out for him. But my hands were covered in bleach and grime, and the safety protocols at work drilled into me: never touch your face, never remove gloves in the middle of a task, always wash hands before handling anything else. If I ran out now, I\u2019d risk spreading chemicals everywhere, maybe even onto him. But if I hesitated, even for a second, he might step into traffic. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my job\u2019s rules versus my responsibility as a sister. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect him and the fear of breaking the rules that kept us both safe in different ways."}
