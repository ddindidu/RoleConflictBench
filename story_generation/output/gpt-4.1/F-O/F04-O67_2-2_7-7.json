Dispatch said it was a minor injury, nothing life-threatening, but my heart thudded anyway. As I slid behind the wheel, my partner glanced at me, sensing my tension. I knew I had to drive safely, keep my focus, and follow every protocol. But my mind raced with memories of our last argument, the words we\u2019d thrown at each other, and the silence that followed. I wanted to be patient, to show him I respected his choices, even if I didn\u2019t always understand them. But now, as the siren wailed and traffic thickened, I felt torn. Every instinct screamed at me to hurry, to get to him as fast as possible, to show him I cared. But the city\u2019s chaos demanded caution, and my duty as an ambulance driver pressed down on me. I gripped the wheel, caught between the brother who wanted to rush to his side and the professional who had to keep everyone safe. The intersection ahead glowed red, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding different things, as I tried to steady my breath."}
