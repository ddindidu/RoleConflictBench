My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReturn to desk in 7 min.\u201d I glanced at my son, who was fidgeting beside me, and then I saw it\u2014a crumpled candy wrapper peeking from his pocket. My heart dropped. I knelt down, my voice trembling, \u201cDid you take that without paying?\u201d His eyes filled with guilt. I knew what I was supposed to do as a parent: teach him honesty, make him apologize, and explain why stealing is wrong. But the clock was ticking. If I was late, my supervisor would log it, and I\u2019d get another warning. The phone queue was always full, and management had made it clear: no exceptions, no extra minutes. My son needed me to be a parent right now, but my job demanded I be a punctual telemarketer. I felt torn, my chest tight, as I tried to figure out which role I could afford to let down."}
