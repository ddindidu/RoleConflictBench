My phone buzzes with a reminder: the client meeting is in two hours, and I still haven\u2019t figured out how to fit the extra conference room without sacrificing the open workspace. Suddenly, my son darts past me, weaving between carts, giggling as he nearly knocks over a display of apples. Other shoppers glance over, some with disapproving frowns. I feel the weight of their expectations\u2014be a good parent, teach your child discipline, don\u2019t let him disturb others.\n\nBut my mind is split. I\u2019m also the architect, and the design problem gnaws at me. I need to focus, to mentally rearrange walls and desks, to visualize the flow of people through the office. Yet here I am, expected to kneel down, look my son in the eye, and gently but firmly explain why his behavior isn\u2019t acceptable. My heart pounds with frustration and guilt. I want to be present for him, to guide him, but the demands of my profession tug at me, insistent and unyielding. I stand frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
