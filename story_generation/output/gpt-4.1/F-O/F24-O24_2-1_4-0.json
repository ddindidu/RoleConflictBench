The hearing wasn\u2019t for another two weeks, but as a judge, I knew the expectation: diligence, thoroughness, no matter how routine the case seemed. My mind drifted to the text from my stepbrother\u2014Mom\u2019s making her famous lasagna tonight, don\u2019t be late. Family dinners were still new and fragile, and my absence would be noticed, maybe even resented. I could almost hear my stepmother\u2019s gentle disappointment if I didn\u2019t show, the awkward silence at the table. But the file in front of me demanded my attention, and I felt the weight of my robe even as I sat in my office clothes. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, the one who showed up, but I also couldn\u2019t shake the sense of duty to my courtroom, to the people whose lives would be affected by my decisions. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, torn between the warmth of family and the cold, steady pull of justice."}
