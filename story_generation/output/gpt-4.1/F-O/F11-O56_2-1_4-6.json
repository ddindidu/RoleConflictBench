I knew how much these small gatherings meant to them, especially since we didn\u2019t get together often. But as I looked up, my next client was already in the chair, smiling and chatting about her day. She mentioned she\u2019d just washed her hair before coming, and I could see it was still damp and smelled of her own shampoo.\n\nAs a hairdresser, I was expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before starting, to ensure the best results and maintain salon standards. My manager was strict about this policy, and skipping steps could get me in trouble. But my client seemed eager to get started, and I could feel the minutes ticking by, knowing my family was waiting. I felt torn\u2014should I follow the salon\u2019s rules and risk being late for dinner, or skip the wash and risk my job? The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do."}
