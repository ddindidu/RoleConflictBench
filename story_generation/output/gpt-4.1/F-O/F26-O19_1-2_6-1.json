The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smile, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but my mind is already racing. At the pharmacy, I\u2019m double-checking a complex prescription for Mr. Lee, who has heart failure and diabetes. He depends on me to get every pill right\u2014one mistake could be dangerous. The clock ticks closer to the end of my shift, and I know my family expects me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the grandparent who never misses a holiday.

I stare at the prescription, my phone vibrating again, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which demand I can bear to let down."}
