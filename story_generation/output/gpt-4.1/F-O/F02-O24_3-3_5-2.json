The manager\u2019s voice was stern but not unkind as he explained what he\u2019d seen\u2014my son slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a father, I knew this was a moment to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and firmness. But my phone kept buzzing in my pocket, each vibration a reminder of the urgent email from the courthouse: an emergency motion had just been filed, and as the judge on call, I was expected to review the case and issue a ruling within the hour. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014my son\u2019s wide, frightened eyes pleading for understanding, the public\u2019s trust in my impartiality and diligence as a judge. I felt torn, the expectations of fatherhood and justice pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
