My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight?\u201d\u2014and I know she\u2019s right. We both work, and the chores should be shared. But just as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s an email from a client, marked urgent: \u201cCan you clarify the $1,200 charge on our latest invoice?\u201d I know this client is impatient, and my boss expects prompt, clear communication. If I don\u2019t respond quickly, it could jeopardize our relationship with them. I glance at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My wife is in the next room, probably hoping I\u2019ll finally tackle the laundry. My client is waiting for answers. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure knots in my chest as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
