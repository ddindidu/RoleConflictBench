The call volume is light today, and my supervisor has mentioned we can be flexible with our breaks as long as we stick to our hours. Just as I\u2019m about to log off, my phone buzzes with a message from my wife: \u201cRough day at work, nothing major, just tired.\u201d I know she doesn\u2019t always open up, so when she does, I feel I should be there for her, listen, maybe make her laugh. As a husband, I want to provide the support she needs, especially on days like this.\n\nBut as a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my break now and return on time, not stretch it out. If I call her, I might lose track of time, and I don\u2019t want to risk being late or seeming unprofessional. My mind races, torn between the urge to be the caring partner she deserves and the responsible employee my job demands. I stare at my phone, thumb hovering over the call button, heart pounding as I weigh which role to honor in this moment."}
