It was a slow night, and I greeted each customer with a practiced smile, scanning their items and making small talk. Then, my younger brother walked in, his face tight with frustration. I knew he\u2019d had a rough day\u2014he\u2019d texted me earlier, venting about a fight with our parents. He came to my register, and I could see he wanted to talk, to have me listen and be the patient, understanding brother he needed.\n\nBut as he started to open up, another customer approached, waiting in line. I felt the pressure to keep things moving, to be the friendly, efficient cashier the store expected. My brother\u2019s words faltered as I turned to greet the next customer, my attention split. I could feel his disappointment, the silent plea for me to be there for him, while the customer expected my undivided, cheerful service. My heart pounded as I stood between them, torn by the demands of both roles, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
