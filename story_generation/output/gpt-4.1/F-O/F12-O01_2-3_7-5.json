My mind raced with questions\u2014had I accounted for every emergency route, every critical access point? The deadline loomed, and the pressure to deliver a flawless design pressed on my shoulders. Across from me, my husband stirred his tea, glancing at me with concern. He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I could sense something was weighing on him. I knew I should ask, should open up about my own stress and invite him to share his worries too. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honest, open communication, no matter how busy life became. But as he started to speak, my phone buzzed with a message from the project manager, another urgent question about the operating room layout. My heart twisted. I wanted to be present for him, to listen and share, but the demands of my work screamed for my attention. I felt torn, caught between the expectations of being a supportive wife and a meticulous architect, unsure which voice to answer first."}
