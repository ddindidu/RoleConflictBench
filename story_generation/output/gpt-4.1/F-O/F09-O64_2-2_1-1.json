The line of customers stretched down the aisle, each one impatiently shifting their weight, clutching groceries and glancing at their phones. My manager had already reminded me twice that we couldn\u2019t afford mistakes during the lunch rush. I forced a smile as I scanned items, my mind racing elsewhere.\n\nToday was my daughter\u2019s open class at school\u2014the first one since she started first grade. She\u2019d begged me to come, her eyes shining with hope. \u201cPlease, Mom, I want you to see me read in front of everyone.\u201d I\u2019d promised I\u2019d try, but now, with the store so busy, leaving my post felt impossible. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s disappointment if I asked for a break, and I imagined my daughter\u2019s face falling as she searched the classroom for me.\n\nThe beep of the scanner and the chatter of customers faded into the background as I stood there, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my child, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
