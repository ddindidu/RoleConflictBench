My partner paced nearby, their face drawn with worry. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I should take the offer,\u201d they said, voice trembling. I knew they needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my reassurance, my advice. But my mind kept drifting to the audit scheduled next month. There was plenty of time, but the thought of incomplete documentation gnawed at me. What if I missed something? What if a small oversight led to a bigger problem? My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, hoping for comfort, while my thoughts raced with regulatory codes and compliance deadlines. I wanted to be present, to listen, to hold them and say the right thing. But the engineer in me whispered about checklists and standards, about the responsibility I carried. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people and principles that mattered most."}
