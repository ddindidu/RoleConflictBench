They look forward to these calls, and so do I, usually. But tonight, my laptop screen is filled with error logs. QA just flagged a minor UI glitch that\u2019s been popping up for some users. It\u2019s not critical, and there\u2019s a simple workaround, but my team lead wants it fixed before tomorrow\u2019s release. I can already picture the Slack messages piling up if I don\u2019t jump on it now.\n\nMy parents expect me to be present, to listen, to share. My team expects me to be responsive, to solve problems quickly. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. My finger hovers over the phone, my other hand poised above the keyboard, heart tugged in two directions as I wrestle with which part of me to disappoint tonight."}
