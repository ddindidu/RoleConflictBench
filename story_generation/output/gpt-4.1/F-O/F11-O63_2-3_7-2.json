As a telemarketer, I was trained to stay calm, to answer every objection with patience and clarity, to never let frustration seep into my tone. But my mind kept drifting to the argument I\u2019d had with my younger brother that morning\u2014how I\u2019d snapped at him for borrowing my headphones without asking. I was supposed to be the understanding sister, the one who listened and respected his quirks, even when they grated on me. Now, as the customer\u2019s irritation grew, I felt the same impatience bubbling up. I wanted to cut him off, to defend myself, but I remembered the expectation to be patient, to build respect, both at home and at work. My chest tightened as I struggled to balance the demands: the need to be composed and professional for the customer, and the guilt of not being the supportive sister I promised myself I\u2019d be. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding a different kind of patience, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of me to listen to."}
