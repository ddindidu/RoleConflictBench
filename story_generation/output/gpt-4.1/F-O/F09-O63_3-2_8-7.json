As a mother, I know the home loan repayment is looming\u2014just two months away. Every call I make, every sale, is a step toward keeping our home secure. I need this job, need to meet my targets, need to keep the paychecks coming. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my scheduled breaks, to log off exactly when I\u2019m supposed to, even though the phone queue never empties. Management watches every minute, every click, and I can\u2019t afford to draw attention by breaking the rules. My phone buzzes with a message from my son\u2019s school\u2014he\u2019s sick, and they need me to pick him up. My break isn\u2019t for another hour. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: the mother who must be there for her child, the employee who must not risk her job. I grip the mouse, torn, the pressure mounting as the next call flashes on my screen."}
