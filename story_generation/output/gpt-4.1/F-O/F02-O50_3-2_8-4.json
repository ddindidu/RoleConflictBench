My wife\u2019s gentle reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t miss this payment.\u201d I knew the weight of keeping our family secure rested on my shoulders. But as I sipped my coffee, my phone buzzed with a message from the factory supervisor\u2014several machines were running hotter than normal, and they\u2019d already missed their last service window. If I didn\u2019t get in soon to perform maintenance, a breakdown could halt production, risking my job and the overtime pay I\u2019d been counting on for the loan.\n\nMy son tugged at my sleeve, asking if I\u2019d help him with his homework. I looked at his hopeful face, then back at the bills, and then at the urgent message on my phone. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the father my family needed at home and the reliable machine repairer my job demanded. Both roles pulled at me, each with their own expectations, and I felt the stress knotting in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
