My heart dropped. As his step-parent, I\u2019m supposed to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline. But right now, I\u2019m also the cashier, responsible for following store policies\u2014no tolerance for theft, even if it\u2019s just a kid. Before I could react, a woman approached, holding a blender and no receipt, insisting on a refund. I\u2019m expected to enforce the return policy, no exceptions, but her frustration was mounting. My mind raced between the two crises: Max\u2019s wide, guilty eyes pleading for understanding, and the customer\u2019s growing impatience. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I step away to address Max\u2019s mistake, risking trouble with my manager and upsetting the customer? Or do I handle the return first, leaving Max to stew in fear and confusion? My hands trembled as I tried to steady my voice, caught between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a parent."}
