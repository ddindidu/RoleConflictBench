The living room was already filled with laughter and the clatter of dishes\u2014my grandchildren\u2019s voices echoing through the house. Today was the family gathering I\u2019d promised not to miss. My daughter had reminded me how much the kids looked forward to our time together, and I\u2019d pictured myself reading stories, sharing jokes, being the grandfather they adored.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, and I saw the message from the hospital. A patient\u2019s family was waiting, desperate for answers. The diagnosis was grim, and I knew they needed me to explain, to offer comfort and clarity in the face of fear. As a doctor, I owed them my full attention and empathy, especially now.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My family expected my presence, my warmth. My patient\u2019s family needed my compassion and honesty. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the ache of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
