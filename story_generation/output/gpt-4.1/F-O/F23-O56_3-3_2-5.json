My heart sank. I knew I needed to be there for him, to show up as the parent he needed, especially now. But just as I was about to grab my things, Mrs. Carter stormed in, her voice echoing through the nearly empty salon. She was furious about her haircut, demanding it be fixed immediately. I could see the clock ticking past closing time, my coworkers already packing up. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing down on me\u2014my stepson needed me to respond, to show him I cared and would help him make things right, but Mrs. Carter expected my full attention and professionalism, and the salon expected me to keep clients happy. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of family and the immediate demands of my job, both sides expecting me to be present, to fix things, to make it right."}
