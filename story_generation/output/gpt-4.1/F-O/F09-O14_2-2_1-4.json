The first was a bright, cheerful notification: \u201cOpen Class \u2013 10:00 AM, Lily\u2019s School.\u201d The second, more formal, was a departmental meeting at 10:30, where I was expected to present the preliminary data from my latest experiment. My daughter had been talking about her open class for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she asked if I\u2019d be there. At the same time, my supervisor had emphasized the importance of this meeting, reminding me that our funding renewal depended on the clarity and accuracy of our reports.\n\nI could already picture Lily scanning the classroom for my face, hoping to see me in the crowd of parents. I could also imagine the tense silence in the conference room if I failed to deliver my findings, the subtle disappointment in my colleagues\u2019 eyes. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the familiar ache of wanting to be fully present in two places at once. I closed my eyes, torn between the world of discovery and the world of my daughter, knowing I had to choose."}
