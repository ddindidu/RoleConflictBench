My husband\u2019s been working late, and I know he expects me to help keep the house running smoothly, to share the load. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: Mrs. Lee\u2019s cleaning is in three days, and I remember the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner at her place. If I don\u2019t pick up more before then, I\u2019ll be unprepared, and she\u2019s particular about her floors. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. At home, I\u2019m a wife, expected to keep our space tidy and share chores. At work, I\u2019m the reliable cleaner, expected to anticipate needs and never run out of supplies. My mind races\u2014should I tackle the laundry now, or head out to buy cleaner before the stores close? I can\u2019t do both tonight. The expectations tug at me from both sides, and I sit, paralyzed, wishing I could split myself in two."}
