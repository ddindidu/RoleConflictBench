She was about to start high school and wanted to talk, hoping for some guidance. I could hear the hope in her words, the way she trusted me to help her navigate this new chapter. My heart swelled with love and responsibility\u2014I wanted to be there for her, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But as I glanced at the clock, my chest tightened. I was due at the construction site in twenty minutes. As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late; safety briefings started promptly, and missing them could mean risking not just my own well-being, but that of my coworkers. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014Emma\u2019s need for reassurance, the crew\u2019s reliance on my punctuality and attention to safety. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the granddaughter who needed my words and the job that demanded my presence."}
