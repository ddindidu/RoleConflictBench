He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014how much he needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay. As his step-sibling, I felt that pull, the expectation that I\u2019d be there for him, especially now. But my phone buzzed again: another message from the workshop. A new order had just come in, a rush job for a custom bookshelf, and I was expected to estimate the materials and place the supply order before the hardware store closed. My mind raced, torn between the blueprints on my workbench and the sound of my brother\u2019s stress. I could almost feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over my phone, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
