He\u2019d been rude to his mother last night, and I knew it was my job as his father to teach him respect and discipline. I wanted to sit with him, talk through what happened, and help him understand why kindness matters. Just as I opened my mouth to start the conversation, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the station\u2014urgent: I was needed in court today to testify in a case I\u2019d worked on for months. As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity and fairness, and my testimony could make all the difference. But as a father, I felt the weight of missing this crucial moment to guide my son. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. My heart pounded as I stared at my son, then at my phone, torn between the badge and the family I love."}
