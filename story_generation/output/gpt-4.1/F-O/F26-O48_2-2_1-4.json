I could sense the weight they carried, the silent plea for comfort and advice. As a grandparent, I felt the urge to sit beside them, to share stories of my own struggles and reassure them that feeling lost was only temporary. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the nursing home. One of my patients, Mrs. Carter, had just returned from surgery, and her chart showed her blood pressure was higher than normal. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to check on her immediately, record her vitals, and alert the nurse if anything seemed off. My heart tugged in two directions: the need to be present for my grandchild, to offer the wisdom only a grandparent could, and the professional responsibility to care for a vulnerable patient. I sat frozen, torn between the demands of family and duty, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
