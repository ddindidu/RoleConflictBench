My phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cRough day. Can we talk tonight?\u201d I could sense the heaviness behind his words, and my heart ached to be there for him, to listen and share openly like we promised we always would. But just then, my client rushed in, apologizing for being late, her hair damp and greasy from a workout. She needed a full wash and condition before I could even think about cutting or styling. I could see the exhaustion in her eyes, too\u2014maybe she needed this moment to unwind, to feel cared for. As I led her to the sink, my mind raced. My husband was waiting for me to be present, to communicate and support him, but my client expected my full attention and skill right now. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
