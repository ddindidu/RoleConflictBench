My spouse had asked me, just this morning, to help out more around the house, and I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done before my shift. I could hear the dryer humming, a reminder of the chores still waiting. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized I was running late for my lifeguard duty at the pool. \n\nWhen I arrived, the pool was crowded and noisy. I scanned the water, my mind still on the laundry at home. Suddenly, I spotted a child in the deep end, flailing\u2014right where swimming was off-limits. My training kicked in, but so did the memory of my spouse\u2019s tired voice, asking for help. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to keep my family running smoothly, and the responsibility to keep others safe. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the demands of home and the urgent call of my duty at the pool."}
