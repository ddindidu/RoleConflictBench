It was a message from my sister: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner at 7! Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I glanced at the time\u2014if I left right after my shift, I could just make it. But then, the shrill site alarm blared, echoing off the steel beams. The foreman\u2019s voice crackled over the radio, \u201cEvacuate! Muster point, now!\u201d My heart pounded. I knew the drill\u2014drop everything, follow the team, no exceptions. Safety first, always. But my mind raced to my family, already gathered, waiting for me to walk through the door, expecting me to be there, to laugh and share stories. I felt the weight of my hard hat pressing down, the pull of my family\u2019s expectations on one side, and the unyielding demands of my job on the other. My boots felt heavy as I hesitated, torn between the urgent call of the alarm and the warmth of home, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
