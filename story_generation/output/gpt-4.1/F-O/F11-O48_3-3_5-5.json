It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and as a sister, I was expected to be there, laughing and sharing stories, making memories. But as I tucked my phone away, the beeping of the monitor pulled me back to reality. My patient, Mr. Harris, was in critical condition. The doctor\u2019s orders were clear: I had to check and record his vital signs every few minutes. Missing even one reading could mean missing a sign of deterioration. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, and my duty to care for someone whose life might depend on my vigilance. My hands trembled as I wrapped the blood pressure cuff around Mr. Harris\u2019s arm, my mind torn between the warmth of home and the sterile urgency of the hospital."}
