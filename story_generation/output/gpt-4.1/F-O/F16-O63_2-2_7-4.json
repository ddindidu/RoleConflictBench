My headset feels heavier with every passing minute, the pressure from management echoing in my mind: \u201cNumbers matter. Don\u2019t let us down.\u201d I\u2019m about to dial another number when I notice my spouse standing in the doorway, eyes clouded with worry. They hesitate, then quietly ask if we can talk. I know I should listen, be present, communicate openly like we promised each other. But my mind is split. If I stop now, I might miss my target and face another stern talk from my supervisor.
