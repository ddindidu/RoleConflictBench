She\u2019s really counting on you to help with the preparations this year.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. I knew how much these family gatherings meant, especially to Mom, who always insisted that everyone be there, no excuses. But just as I was about to reply, my work phone buzzed. A homeowner\u2019s voice, urgent and worried, filled my ear. Their deck had splintered badly, and with guests coming over the weekend, they needed it fixed immediately. As a carpenter, I knew the job couldn\u2019t wait\u2014leaving it could be dangerous, and my reputation depended on reliability. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my family expecting my presence and warmth, my client needing my skill and commitment. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of home and the call of my craft, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
