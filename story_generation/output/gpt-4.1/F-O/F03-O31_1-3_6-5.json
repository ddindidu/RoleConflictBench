I had just asked Mom if everything was going well at home\u2014she\u2019d smiled, but I could see the worry lines on her face. Dad was unusually quiet, and I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure them that I cared. But as I glanced at my phone, the police radio crackled: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress, Main and 5th. Bystanders at risk.\u201d My heart pounded. As a son, I wanted to stay, to offer comfort and stability, to be the support my parents needed. But as a police officer, I was expected to protect the public, to rush out and face danger so others could be safe. I could feel my mother\u2019s eyes on me, searching for the son she could lean on, while the city called for the officer who would act. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
