I can already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. I know how much it means to them, especially after missing last week\u2019s art show. But my eyes drift back to the lines of code on my screen. The module I\u2019m working on is a mess, and though the deadline isn\u2019t pressing, I finally have a quiet afternoon to refactor it properly. If I leave now, I\u2019ll lose my momentum, and the code will stay tangled for another day. My team expects clean, maintainable work, and I take pride in delivering it. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the schoolyard where my kids wait, and toward the glowing screen where my professional standards call. I sit frozen, torn between being the father my children need and the developer my team relies on, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in."}
