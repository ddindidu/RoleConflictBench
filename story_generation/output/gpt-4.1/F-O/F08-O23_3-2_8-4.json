As a grandmother, I know how much my presence and words can mean, especially when the family is hurting. I want to call right away, to be the steady voice he needs. But as I glance at the clock, my heart sinks. In less than an hour, I have to be in court for a crucial hearing. My client\u2019s future hinges on my preparation and focus; they trust me to fight for them, to be sharp and unwavering. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s pain on one side, my professional duty on the other. I pace my office, phone in hand, torn between dialing my daughter and reviewing my notes. The expectations are clear, but the path forward is anything but."}
