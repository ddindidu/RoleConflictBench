I know it\u2019s my mom\u2014she always wants to hear how my day is going, and I promised I\u2019d keep her updated, especially since Dad\u2019s been feeling under the weather. I glance at the clock. It\u2019s almost time for my break, but right now, Mrs. Carter is gripping my hand, her eyes wide and watery. She\u2019s just come out of surgery, and the fear in her voice is unmistakable as she asks if I\u2019ll stay with her a little longer. I can feel the weight of her need for comfort, the way she relaxes just a bit when I sit by her side. But my phone keeps buzzing, and I know my parents are waiting, probably worrying if I don\u2019t answer soon. I feel torn\u2014my heart aches for Mrs. Carter, but I also can\u2019t bear the thought of my parents feeling neglected. The pressure builds inside me, and I find myself frozen, caught between the two people who need me most in this moment."}
