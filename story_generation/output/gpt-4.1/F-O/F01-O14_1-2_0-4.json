The departmental meeting was in an hour, and I still hadn\u2019t finished summarizing the preliminary results. My mind raced with numbers and hypotheses, the pressure to present clear, accurate findings weighing heavily on me. Just then, my granddaughter slipped into the room, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said softly. She was starting high school next week, and I could see the anxiety in her face. She wanted guidance, reassurance\u2014wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share stories and advice, to be the steady presence she needed. But the clock ticked louder, reminding me of my responsibility as a scientist. My department expected thoroughness and professionalism, not last-minute work. I felt torn, my heart pulled toward my granddaughter, my mind tethered to my research. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I sat there, caught between the demands of science and the needs of family, unsure which to answer first."}
