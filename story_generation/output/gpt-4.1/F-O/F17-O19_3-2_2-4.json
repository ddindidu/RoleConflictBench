I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed messages from Mom, each more insistent than the last. She expected me to check in every day, to share how my shift was going, to reassure her that I was eating well and not overworking myself. But right now, Mrs. Lee\u2019s anxious eyes were fixed on me, waiting for reassurance about the pills she was nervous to start. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, worried and disappointed if I didn\u2019t reply soon. At the same time, I felt the weight of my white coat and the trust my patients placed in me. I wanted to be the attentive child my parents needed, but I also needed to be the reliable pharmacist my patients depended on. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the two worlds, my phone vibrating again in my pocket."}
