The radio crackles with urgent voices\u2014flights rerouting, handoffs multiplying, every second demanding my full attention. My heart pounds, knowing that one mistake could mean disaster. Yet, in the back of my mind, I hear my mother\u2019s voice from this morning, reminding me that tonight is the family\u2019s annual holiday dinner. It\u2019s not just a meal; it\u2019s a tradition, a symbol of our unity, and my presence is expected. I remember my father\u2019s disappointment last year when I missed the toast. The weight of my family\u2019s expectations presses on me, clashing with the responsibility I feel for the lives in the sky. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to the pilots and passengers depending on me. My hands tremble as I try to focus, wrestling with the impossible choice looming ahead."}
