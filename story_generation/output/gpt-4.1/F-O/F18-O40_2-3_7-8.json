She needed a repair plan by noon, and I knew the damage was bad enough to make the whole structure unsafe. But my attention kept flicking to my younger brother, helmet askew, eyeing the steep, splintered ramp we\u2019d built years ago. He was determined to land a new trick, but the ramp was warped and uneven\u2014one wrong move and he could break an arm, or worse. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, maybe even talk him out of it. But as a carpenter, I had a responsibility to my client, to assess the damage and get her house safe before someone got hurt. My brother\u2019s hopeful grin clashed with the anxious texts on my phone. I felt pulled in two directions, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
