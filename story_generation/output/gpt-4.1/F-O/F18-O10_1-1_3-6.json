My family was gathered around, laughing and tossing out ideas for our weekend plans\u2014hiking, maybe a movie, or a big dinner at Mom\u2019s favorite restaurant. My younger sister nudged me, \u201cWhat do you think, should we try that new Italian place?\u201d I smiled, trying to stay present, but my mind was already drifting. The email was from a vendor, a standard payment confirmation, but protocol required a formal reply\u2014something I couldn\u2019t just dash off without care. My manager always emphasized prompt, professional communication, and I knew this was expected of me. But my family was waiting, expecting me to join in, to be part of the conversation, to show I cared about our time together. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold professionalism of my job. My fingers hovered over my phone, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
