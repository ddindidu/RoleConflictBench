It means so much to your father.\u201d The weight of tradition pressed on me; I was expected to recite prayers, guide the rituals, and show my younger cousins how it\u2019s done\u2014just as my father had done for me. But as I glanced at the clock, my patient, Mrs. Patel, sat across from me, her eyes anxious. She had a list of questions about her health, and I knew she needed reassurance and clear answers. As a doctor, I owed her my full attention, my empathy, and my time. Yet, every minute I spent with her meant I was running later for the ceremony, risking disappointment and the sense of letting my family down. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient and the responsibility to my family, feeling the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
