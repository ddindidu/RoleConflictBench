As a doctor, I knew how critical it was to review her labs and adjust her medication\u2014her health depended on my attention to detail. Just then, my granddaughter slipped into the room, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I don\u2019t know what to do about my friend. She\u2019s in trouble, and I\u2019m scared for her.\u201d She needed my wisdom, my comfort, the steady presence I\u2019d always promised her. But my mind kept drifting to my patient\u2019s chart, the urgency of her care, the responsibility I carried for her well-being. My granddaughter\u2019s hand found mine, her trust in me clear and fragile. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down\u2014one needing my heart, the other my expertise. I could feel the clock ticking, each second demanding I choose where to give myself, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once."}
