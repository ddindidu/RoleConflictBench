My daughter had called last night, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me. I promised I\u2019d be there early, maybe even bring their favorite cookies. But as I finished wiping down the kitchen counters, I noticed the cleaning supply shelf was nearly empty. The manager at the agency had been clear: keep the inventory up to date, never let the supplies run low. If I didn\u2019t check and restock today, I\u2019d risk a warning\u2014or worse, lose the trust I\u2019d worked so hard to earn.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you, Mom! The kids are so excited.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to be the grandparent who never missed a moment, who showed up with hugs and stories. But I was also the cleaner who needed to be responsible, reliable, and thorough. My heart tugged in two directions as I stood in the middle of the kitchen, torn between the warmth of family and the weight of my job."}
