We were finally talking about the medical bills piling up, the choices we\u2019d have to make about his upcoming surgery. He looked at me, searching for honesty, for the openness we\u2019d promised each other. My phone buzzed, vibrating against the wood. I glanced at the screen\u2014dispatch was calling. A patient with a broken leg, just a few miles away, but city traffic would slow me down. I knew what was expected of me: to be there, fast, to help someone in pain. But my husband\u2019s eyes pleaded for me to stay, to finish this conversation, to be the partner he needed. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the call against the promise I\u2019d made to him. I could feel the seconds slipping away, each one stretching the distance between my two worlds."}
