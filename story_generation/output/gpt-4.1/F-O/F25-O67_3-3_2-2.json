She always expected me to check in, to let her know I was safe, to share how my day was going. It was our routine, a promise I made after Dad passed, to keep her from worrying. But now, every second counted. The paramedic beside me was already strapping in, glancing at me, waiting for me to hit the siren and go. I could almost hear my stepmom\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but anxious, asking if I was okay, if I\u2019d eaten, if I\u2019d made it through another shift. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between the duty to my family and the lives waiting for me on the highway. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just sat there, caught between the two."}
