My family gathered around, laughter echoing through the house as we prepared for our annual tradition of decorating the old oak tree in the yard. My mother handed me the box of ornaments, her eyes shining with the unspoken expectation that I would join them, just as I always had. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the crew was waiting for me at the construction site. As the lead carpenter, it was my responsibility to inspect every tool and piece of equipment before we started the day\u2019s structural work. Skipping the inspection could mean risking someone\u2019s safety, but leaving now would mean missing the family tradition my parents cherished. My heart pounded as I looked from my mother\u2019s hopeful face to the message on my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
