Grandma\u2019s counting on you to bring the candles for the ceremony.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Every year, I was the one who lit the candles, the one who made Grandma smile. But as I glanced up from the locker room, the hum of the pool\u2019s filtration system was off\u2014too quiet. I checked the control panel and my stomach dropped. The system was malfunctioning, and if I didn\u2019t get it fixed, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. My supervisor was out for the day, and I was the only one who knew how to handle the maintenance. I could already hear my family\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, but I also felt the weight of responsibility for everyone who trusted me to keep them safe here. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s tradition or my duty as a lifeguard."}
