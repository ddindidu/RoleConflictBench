The symptoms pointed to a common cold, but I knew I had to be thorough\u2014my patients expected nothing less. Just as I was about to enter the exam room, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mother: \u201cCan you call? I need to talk.\u201d I stepped into the hallway and dialed her number. Her voice trembled as she shared her worries about Dad\u2019s health, her loneliness, and how much she needed me. I felt the weight of her vulnerability, the expectation that I would be her comfort, her support. But in the next room, a patient waited, trusting me to be focused, analytical, and precise. My mind raced between the sterile demands of my profession and the raw, aching need of my family. I could hear my mother\u2019s tears, but I could also hear the patient\u2019s cough through the thin wall. My heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I stood frozen, torn between the child my parents needed and the doctor my patient expected."}
