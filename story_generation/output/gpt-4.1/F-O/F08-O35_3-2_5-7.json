My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, please come. It\u2019s serious. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I was expected to be the steady anchor, the one who dropped everything for family. But as a subway operator, I was expected to be reliable, to never miss a briefing\u2014especially today, when new safety protocols were being introduced. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, putting passengers at risk. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, calling us in. I stared at my phone, torn. My family needed me, but so did my job. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to move."}
