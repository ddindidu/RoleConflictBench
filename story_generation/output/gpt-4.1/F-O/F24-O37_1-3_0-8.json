He was preparing for his final exam, and I knew how much pressure he was under. As his step-sibling, I felt I should be there for him, maybe sit with him, listen, or just offer a reassuring word. But I was also on my shift as the housekeeping cleaner, and the supervisor had just reminded us about the strict safety protocols\u2014gloves, masks, sanitizers, no exceptions. I\u2019d just finished scrubbing the bathroom, my hands still tingling from the disinfectant, and I knew I couldn\u2019t risk contaminating the house or, worse, my stepbrother\u2019s study space. Yet, I could hear the anxiety in his voice as he called out for me. I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to comfort him and the responsibility to keep everything sanitized and safe. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t fully give without betraying the other."}
