I knew I should call him back, remind him about respect for public spaces, about self-control\u2014lessons I promised myself I\u2019d teach him as his step-parent. But my phone buzzed again, the courthouse clerk\u2019s message flashing: \u201cEmergency TRO filed. Judge, you must review the file and rule within the hour.\u201d My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough, impartial, and swift, especially in urgent cases like this. But here I was, in the middle of a supermarket, torn between my duty to the law and my responsibility to guide this boy. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the expectations colliding. Should I pull him aside now, risking a rushed, distracted review of the case? Or do I let his behavior slide, focusing on the legal documents, and fail him as a parent? My heart pounded as I stood frozen, the demands of justice and family pulling me in opposite directions."}
