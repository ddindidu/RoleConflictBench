My spouse\u2019s message flashes on the screen: \u201cWe need to talk tonight. No more putting it off.\u201d I know what it\u2019s about\u2014our mounting bills, the doctor\u2019s appointment I\u2019ve been avoiding. They expect honesty, for me to lay everything out, no matter how hard it is. But right now, the foreman\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, sharp and impatient. \u201cWhere\u2019s that lumber? The carpenter\u2019s waiting!\u201d I see the crew, hands on hips, eyes on me. They need me to keep things moving, to not be the weak link. My heart pounds as I grab the next load, sweat stinging my eyes. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give both what they need from me. The weight of the boards digs into my shoulder, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the pressure inside\u2014torn between being the partner who communicates and the worker who delivers."}
