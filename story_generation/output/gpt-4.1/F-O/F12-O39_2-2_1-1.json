My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my husband\u2019s name lights up the screen. He\u2019s been anxious all week about a decision at his job, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, to listen, to help him sort through his worries. I know he needs me now, probably pacing in our kitchen, waiting for my voice to steady him. But the carpenter\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, sharp and impatient, \u201cHey, I need that lumber now!\u201d The whole crew is waiting on me, and if I slow down, the work falls behind. My hands tremble, torn between the weight of the wood and the weight of my husband\u2019s needs. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t be everything to everyone, and the pressure squeezes my chest as I stand frozen, caught between the demands of the site and the call for comfort at home."}
