He was upset, venting about how I never listen to his side of things when we argue. I could almost hear his frustration in the text, and I knew he expected me to be patient, to show him the respect he deserved as my sibling. But at that moment, my work phone rang\u2014my client, Mrs. Patel, was calling about a confusing line item on her invoice. She expected clear, prompt communication, and I knew she was already frustrated by the delay. I stared at both screens, feeling the pressure build in my chest. If I answered Sam, I\u2019d risk missing Mrs. Patel and looking unprofessional. If I took the call, I\u2019d be letting my brother down again, reinforcing his belief that I didn\u2019t care. The demands of being a good sister and a reliable accountant pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt paralyzed, torn between the people who needed me in completely different ways."}
