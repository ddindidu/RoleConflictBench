As her new stepchild, I was still learning how to fit in, and she always encouraged me to join family events, hoping I\u2019d feel more at home. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from work: \u201cDon\u2019t forget\u2014deep clean at the hotel tonight. Gloves and full protocol required.\u201d I\u2019d been warned before about skipping gloves, but sometimes, in a rush, I just didn\u2019t bother. This time, though, the manager was clear: no exceptions, especially with the flu going around.\n\nI felt the pressure building inside me. If I skipped the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my stepfamily, maybe even set myself further apart. But if I missed work or cut corners, I risked my job\u2014and my paycheck was what helped me contribute to this new household. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, torn between the warmth of belonging and the cold necessity of responsibility. I stood in the hallway, invitation in one hand, work gloves in the other, unable to move."}
