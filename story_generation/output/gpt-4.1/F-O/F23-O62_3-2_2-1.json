My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the school. My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to speak with me immediately. My heart clenched. As his step-parent, I was expected to show up, to address the issue, to support and guide him through this. But right now, I was the only lifeguard on duty, responsible for every person in the water. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle lane, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. I couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t leave my post, not even for a moment. Yet, the school expected me to be present, to handle Ethan\u2019s mistake with care and urgency. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My mind raced, torn between the child who needed me and the swimmer who might need me even more."}
