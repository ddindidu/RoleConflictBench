My job as a lifeguard demanded unwavering focus\u2014one slip, one second of distraction, and someone could be swept away. But then I spotted my grandson, sitting alone on the sand, shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on the ground. I knew that look; he was wrestling with something heavy, and as his grandfather, I felt the pull to go to him, to offer the comfort and wisdom he needed. Yet, every instinct as a lifeguard screamed at me to stay vigilant, to keep my eyes on the water and the hundreds of lives depending on me. My heart ached, torn between the duty to protect strangers and the urge to be there for my own flesh and blood. The whistle felt heavy in my hand as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between the expectations of two worlds that refused to overlap."}
