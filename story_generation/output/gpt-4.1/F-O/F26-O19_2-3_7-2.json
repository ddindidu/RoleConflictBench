My daughter had just texted, \u201cCan you call? Jamie wants to tell you about her new job!\u201d I pictured my granddaughter\u2019s eager face, her first real job, and the pride in her voice as she shared her excitement. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to my daughter\u2014that I stay involved, that I listen and celebrate these milestones.\n\nBut in front of me lay a chemotherapy prescription, the kind that demanded every ounce of my attention. The dosage was precise, the margin for error nonexistent. I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders; a single distraction could have devastating consequences for a patient relying on me to get it right.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, a reminder of the family waiting for my call. I stared at the prescription, then at the phone, torn between the warmth of family connection and the cold, exacting duty of my profession. My heart ached with the pull of both worlds, each expecting my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
