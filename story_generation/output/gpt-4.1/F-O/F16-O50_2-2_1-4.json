It was my partner, voice trembling, asking if I could talk. They\u2019d been offered a new position at work, but the decision was tearing them up inside. I could hear the anxiety in every word, and I knew they needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice, my presence. But as I glanced at the maintenance log, my stomach tightened. Three machines had missed their last service, and now they were running dangerously hot. If I didn\u2019t get to them soon, we could be looking at a costly breakdown, maybe even a halt in production. My supervisor had already warned me about the importance of keeping everything running smoothly. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my partner\u2019s voice in my ear, desperate for comfort, and the machines humming in the background, demanding my immediate attention. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the supportive spouse I wanted to be and the reliable repairer everyone expected."}
