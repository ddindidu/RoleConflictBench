She was elderly, gentle, and anxious, asking about her blood pressure and what foods she should avoid. I knew she needed reassurance, someone to listen and explain things slowly. But my mind kept drifting to the bills waiting at home, the groceries we needed, and the rent due next week. My husband\u2019s hours had been cut, and I was the only steady income. I felt the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing on my chest, urging me to see more patients, work overtime, do whatever it took to keep us afloat. Yet, here I was, expected to give this woman my full attention, to be patient and kind, not rushed or distracted. I could feel my voice tightening, my thoughts split between her questions and the numbers running through my head. I wanted to be the doctor she deserved, but I also needed to be the provider my family depended on. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
