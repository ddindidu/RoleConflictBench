But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Carter, my patient, was waiting for her evening check-in. She\u2019d been especially down lately, and I knew she counted on me to bring a little warmth to her lonely room. My wife\u2019s hand reached for mine, silently asking for connection, while my mind raced with the responsibility I felt toward Mrs. Carter. I wanted to be present for both, to share honestly with my wife and to offer comfort to my patient. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the home I\u2019d built and the care I\u2019d promised to give."}
