At work, the plant was quiet\u2014production had slowed, and most machines sat idle. But today, the supervisor called me over, concern etched on his face. \u201cThat old press is acting up again. It\u2019s not urgent, but we need you to figure it out before it gets worse.\u201d I knew the machine\u2019s glitch was minor, but diagnosing it could take hours, maybe days, and there was talk of cutting hours if things didn\u2019t pick up.
