It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, but my shift as a taxi driver was running late. My last fare was a family trying to make it to the train station before their holiday trip. I wanted to help them, but as I turned a corner, I hit a construction detour. The road narrowed, and suddenly, a school zone sign flashed. Kids clustered near the curb, some darting close to the street. The clock on my dashboard ticked closer to dinnertime. My step-siblings expected me to show up, to be part of the family, to prove I belonged. But behind the wheel, I was responsible for my passengers\u2019 schedule and, more importantly, for the safety of every child on that block. My foot hovered over the brake, my mind torn between the urge to hurry and the duty to slow down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time."}
