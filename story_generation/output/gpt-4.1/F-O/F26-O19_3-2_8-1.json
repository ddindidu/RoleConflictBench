She depended on me to get her medications right\u2014her heart, her diabetes, her blood pressure, all balanced by the pills I counted and labeled. But the message flashing on my screen was from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s urgent about Sam.\u201d My heart clenched. Sam, my grandson, was struggling, and my family needed me to listen, to comfort, to be present. Yet, here I was, white coat on, hands gloved, responsible for someone else\u2019s life in a different way. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, thick with worry, and I imagined Sam\u2019s small hands clutching his favorite toy, waiting for reassurance. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s chart stared back at me, a silent reminder that a single mistake could have dire consequences. My mind raced, torn between the pull of family and the duty of care, both demanding my full attention, both unwilling to wait."}
