My youngest would be waiting at the gate, eyes searching the crowd for me. I promised I\u2019d be there, just like I promised last week when I missed her recital. I wiped sweat from my brow, glancing at the walkway where a slick, oily puddle had appeared. The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cSafety first. No shortcuts.\u201d If someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. But if I stayed to clean it, I\u2019d be late for pickup\u2014again. My heart pounded as I weighed the hard hat in my hand, feeling the pull of both worlds. My daughter\u2019s trust, my crew\u2019s safety\u2014both depended on me, right now, in this moment. I stared at the spill, then at the time, torn between the two lives I was supposed to hold together."}
