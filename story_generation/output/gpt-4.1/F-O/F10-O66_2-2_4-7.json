As a taxi driver, I knew I was expected to help them load their bags and ensure a smooth ride, no matter how tired I felt. They waved, calling out, \u201cCan you help us with these? We\u2019ll split the fare.\u201d I nodded, stepping out, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my mother, reminding me about tonight\u2019s family dinner\u2014a tradition we\u2019d never missed, especially now that my relatives were stressing the importance of keeping our customs alive. I could almost hear her voice, urging me not to be late, not to let work come before family.

I felt torn, the pressure of being a dutiful daughter clashing with my responsibility to my passengers.
