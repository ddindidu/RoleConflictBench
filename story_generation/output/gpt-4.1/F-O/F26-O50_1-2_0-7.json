Operator keeps changing the settings\u2014wasting material. Need your advice ASAP.\u201d I glanced up to see my granddaughter, her eyes wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when you started something new? I feel lost at school.\u201d She waited, hoping for the kind of wisdom I\u2019d always tried to offer. But my mind was split. The factory expected me to be the expert, to guide the operator and stop the waste before the boss noticed. My granddaughter needed me to be present, to listen and share the lessons I\u2019d learned over a lifetime. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding technical clarity, the other emotional support. My heart ached, torn between the hum of machines and the quiet vulnerability of a child seeking reassurance. I looked from the phone to her, caught in the impossible space between two people who needed me, each in their own way."}
