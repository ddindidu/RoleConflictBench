Mom really wants everyone there.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken plea for me to show up, to be part of the family. But just as I was about to reply, my work phone buzzed. A homeowner\u2019s voice, tight with worry, explained that their deck was splintered and unsafe, and they needed it fixed before the weekend. I promised I\u2019d come by this evening, knowing how important it was for them to have a safe space for their kids.\n\nMy toolbox sat by the door, ready. I could picture my stepmom\u2019s disappointed face if I missed dinner again, the awkward silence at the table. But I also imagined the homeowner\u2019s relief if I showed up, tools in hand, to make things right. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014family wanting me present, a client needing my skills. I stood in the hallway, torn, the clock ticking toward six, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which door I\u2019d walk through."}
