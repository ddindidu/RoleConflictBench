My wife\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the rising grocery bills and the unexpected car repair. I could hear my daughter in the background, asking if we could go out for ice cream this weekend. My chest tightened. As a father, I knew I had to keep the family afloat, make sure there was enough for rent, food, and those small joys that made life sweet for my kids.\n\nBut as an architect, I was already stretched thin. The project deadline loomed, and my teams were at odds over design changes. Every hour I spent away from the site meant more delays, more angry calls from the client, and the risk of losing future contracts. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, my project manager, asking for a decision on a costly material change. I stared at the numbers, the mounting expenses at home, the project budget, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I closed my eyes, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the relentless demands of my work."}
