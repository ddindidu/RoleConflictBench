As a mother, I feel the weight of every dollar we need\u2014groceries, rent, my son\u2019s school trip. My husband\u2019s hours were cut again, and I know it\u2019s up to me to keep us afloat. But as a judge, I have a new case file open in front of me, and the scheduling order is due by Friday. The court expects clarity and precision; my orders must be thorough, leaving no room for confusion or delay. I can\u2019t afford to be careless, not with people\u2019s lives and rights at stake. Yet, every minute I spend drafting legal opinions is a minute I\u2019m not searching for ways to stretch our budget or find extra work. My mind races between the demands of the courtroom and the needs of my family, my heart pounding with the fear of letting someone down. I stare at the blinking cursor, torn between the law and my love, knowing I can\u2019t give both all they deserve."}
