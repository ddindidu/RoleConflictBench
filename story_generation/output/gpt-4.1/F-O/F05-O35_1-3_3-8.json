It\u2019s been sitting there for days.\u201d I know she\u2019s tired, and I promised I\u2019d help more around the house. The guilt tugs at me; I want to be the partner she deserves, someone who shares the load, not just in words but in action. But as I tuck my phone away, the cabin door opens and my supervisor steps in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting a spot audit,\u201d he says. My heart rate spikes. I know what\u2019s expected\u2014flawless adherence to every protocol, no distractions, no mistakes. My mind races between the piles of laundry at home and the checklist of procedures I must follow now. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I grip the controls, torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
