The laundry basket was overflowing, shirts and towels spilling onto the floor. My wife shot me a tired look as she juggled a phone call and our toddler\u2019s demands. I knew she expected me to help\u2014she\u2019d mentioned the laundry twice already this week. I promised myself I\u2019d fold it after lunch.\n\nBut as I was about to start, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the head lifeguard: \u201cBroken lane rope\u2014needs fixing before swim lessons at 3.\u201d I pictured the kids arriving, parents watching, the chaos if the rope wasn\u2019t ready. I was the only one on call who knew how to fix it quickly.\n\nI stood in the hallway, laundry at my feet, phone in my hand. My wife\u2019s voice drifted from the kitchen, asking if I could help. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility from the pool. Both needed me, right now. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who I\u2019d let down first."}
