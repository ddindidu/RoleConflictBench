My heart pounded as I read the message again: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. I felt a wave of disappointment and worry\u2014what had gotten into him? I knew I needed to be there, to show him that his actions mattered and that I cared enough to help him make things right.\n\nBut just as I was about to call the school back, my other phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Carter, frantic about her deck. The storm last night had splintered the boards, and she was hosting her daughter\u2019s birthday party tomorrow. She needed me to come right away, to fix it before the guests arrived. I could hear the desperation in her voice; she was counting on me.\n\nI stood in my workshop, torn between two worlds. My son needed his parent. My client needed her carpenter. Both expected me to show up, to fix what was broken. I gripped my tools, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which one I could let down."}
