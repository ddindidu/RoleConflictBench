The whole family was gathered, and my daughter had just announced her engagement, the room bursting with joy. I felt the warmth of being a grandmother, the expectation to be present, to celebrate, to make memories. Then my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. There was a noise complaint from our street, a late-night party disturbing the neighbors. As a police officer, I was expected to respond, to enforce the law, to keep the peace. My heart pounded. If I left, I\u2019d miss this precious family moment, maybe even disappoint my granddaughter who had begged me to stay. But if I ignored the call, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty, letting down my colleagues and the community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in opposite directions. I stood in the hallway, torn, the sounds of celebration behind me and the call of duty in my hand, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
