My son\u2019s voice echoes in my head, his eyes wide with hope as he reminded me this morning, \u201cYou promised, Dad. Today\u2019s the day I get my Nintendo, right?\u201d I nodded, thinking of the overtime I\u2019d picked up, the extra shifts I\u2019d worked to make it possible. I want to give him everything, to keep my promise, to be the father he believes I am.\n\nBut now, a call crackles through my radio: \u201cUnattended bag reported in car three. Possible threat. Operator, please investigate.\u201d My heart pounds. My duty is clear\u2014passenger safety comes first. I\u2019m expected to act quickly, to keep hundreds of people safe, to follow protocol without hesitation. But if I stop the train, investigate, and file the report, I\u2019ll miss the store\u2019s closing time. The Nintendo will have to wait, and I\u2019ll have to break my promise.\n\nI stare at the tunnel ahead, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s trust, my passengers\u2019 safety\u2014both demanding, both urgent. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands tighten on the controls as I wrestle with what to do next."}
