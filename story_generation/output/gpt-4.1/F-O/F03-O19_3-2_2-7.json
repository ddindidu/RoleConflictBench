She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, how my day was going, and if I could call her before dinner. We always talked every day, and she liked to hear every detail, no matter how small. I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. But today, the pharmacy had sent me to a workshop on the latest prescription guidelines\u2014something I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. My manager expected me to absorb every update and bring back knowledge to share with the team. As the speaker began, my phone buzzed again. I felt the weight of my mother\u2019s expectations pressing against the professional responsibility I owed my patients and colleagues. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of my mother\u2019s familiar questions and the urgency of staying sharp in my field. I stared at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
