My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cPlease, I need you. It\u2019s bad.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew he\u2019d just gotten the news about his dad\u2019s health, and I could almost hear his voice cracking through the words. I was supposed to be there for him, to listen, to help him hold it together. But my hands were full of cash, receipts, and the pressure of balancing the register. If I made a mistake now, it could mean hours of paperwork, maybe even a write-up. My manager expected perfection, especially with these high-value transactions.
