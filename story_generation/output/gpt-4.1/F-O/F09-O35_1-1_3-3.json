He looked up at me, uncertain, and I knew this was one of those moments where my guidance mattered. Just then, my work phone buzzed. I was on call as a subway operator, and a passenger was asking for directions over the intercom. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways respond promptly. Passenger safety and assistance come first.\u201d My son\u2019s eyes pleaded for my attention, waiting for me to help him understand why manners matter. At the same time, the responsibility to answer the passenger\u2019s question pressed on me, knowing that delays could cause confusion or even risk. I felt torn, my heart pulled between being the mother my child needed and the operator my passengers depended on."}
