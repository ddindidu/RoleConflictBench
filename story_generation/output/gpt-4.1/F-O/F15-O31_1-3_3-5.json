I took a deep breath, ready to gently remind her about cleaning up after herself, about respect and responsibility\u2014lessons I knew were important for her to learn. Just as I opened my mouth, my police radio crackled to life on the counter. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cAll units, violent assault in progress at Main and Fifth. Bystanders at risk. Immediate response needed.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. I looked at my daughter, her small hands trembling as she waited for my guidance, and then at the radio, the weight of my badge pressing against my chest. I was needed\u2014both here and out there. My duty as a parent was to teach and nurture, to be present in these small but crucial moments. My duty as a police officer was to protect the public, to act swiftly when lives were in danger. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the impossible tension rising, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
