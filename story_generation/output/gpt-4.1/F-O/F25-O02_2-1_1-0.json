They look forward to these calls, and I know it means a lot to them\u2014especially since I\u2019m not their biological child, and I want to show I care. Tonight, though, my mind is tangled in the project at work. We\u2019re in the early stages, and my manager expects me to brainstorm new technical solutions before tomorrow\u2019s meeting. I keep glancing at my phone, torn. If I call home, I\u2019ll have to set aside the time and energy to really listen and share, not just go through the motions. But if I focus on work, I might finally crack the idea that\u2019s been eluding me all weekend. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my parents\u2019 gentle expectation for connection, and my team\u2019s unspoken demand for innovation. My heart aches with guilt and anxiety as I stare at my phone, caught between the family I chose and the career I\u2019m building."}
