My foreman\u2019s voice was drowned out by the siren, but I caught the words \u201cmuster point\u201d and saw my coworkers already dropping their tools, moving quickly. I glanced at my phone\u2014an urgent message from the school: my son had been caught bullying another child. They needed me to come in, now, to discuss what happened and how we\u2019d address it. My heart pounded. As a mother, I was supposed to be there for my child, to show him right from wrong, to face the school and help him make amends. But as a laborer, I was expected to follow safety protocols, to be present and accountable, especially during emergencies. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the guilt of possibly letting down my son and the fear of jeopardizing my job or my team\u2019s safety. My hands trembled as I stood frozen between the site and the phone, torn by the impossible demands of being both a good mother and a responsible worker."}
