My son, Ethan, was across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dripping onto the table. \u201cEthan, remember to use your napkin,\u201d I reminded him, trying to keep my voice gentle. He looked up, eyes searching mine for approval or disappointment. I wanted to be patient, to teach him the right way, to show him that small habits matter.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from the site manager: \u201cWe need your approval on the new support beams. There\u2019s a potential issue with the load calculations.\u201d My mind raced. If I didn\u2019t review the plans now, the crew might proceed, risking safety and compliance. But if I left the table, I\u2019d miss this moment with Ethan, this chance to guide him, to be the father he needed.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s expectant face, the urgent message on my phone. I was torn, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good father and a responsible architect, unsure which role to answer first."}
