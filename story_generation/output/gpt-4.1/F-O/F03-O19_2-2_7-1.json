My shift at the pharmacy was in full swing, and I was carefully double-checking a prescription for Mrs. Lee, a regular patient with a complicated list of medications. Every pill, every dosage mattered\u2014one mistake could have serious consequences. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I saw a message from my mom: \u201cDad\u2019s not feeling well. We\u2019re both so tired. Can you call when you have a moment?\u201d I pictured them at home, worn out and anxious, needing me to be present, to listen, to reassure them.
