Kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. I\u2019d promised to help more at home, and I knew how much she counted on me to share the load. But the line at my register was growing, and the next customer was already glaring, arms crossed, her voice sharp as she complained about a missing discount. I forced a smile, trying to keep my tone calm and friendly, even as my mind raced with the list of chores waiting at home. The store was packed, the holiday rush in full swing, and my manager expected me to keep things moving smoothly, no matter how frazzled I felt. I could almost hear the washing machine humming in my head, the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing against the demands of my job. My heart thudded as I wondered how I could possibly be the husband my wife needed and the cashier my boss expected\u2014all at the same time."}
