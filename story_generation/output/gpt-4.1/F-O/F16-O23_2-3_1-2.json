My phone buzzed with a reminder: the merger documents needed my review by midnight. The clauses were dense, and missing a detail could cost my client millions. I rubbed my temples, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nAcross from me, my partner paced the living room, voice trembling as they recounted the dilemma at work. They needed my advice, my reassurance\u2014someone to listen and help them sort through the mess. I could see the worry in their eyes, the way they looked to me for comfort. But every minute I spent away from the contracts increased the risk for my client. My mind raced, torn between the urgent legal review and the person I loved needing me right now. I wanted to be present, to hold their hand and offer the support they deserved, but the clock was ticking, and the demands of my profession pressed in on me from all sides. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both the spouse they needed and the lawyer my client depended on."}
