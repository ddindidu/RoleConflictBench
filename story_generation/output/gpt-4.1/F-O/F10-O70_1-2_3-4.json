My mother\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner at 6. Grandma expects you to help with the dumplings.\u201d It was Lunar New Year, and I knew how much it meant to my family that I be there, hands dusted with flour, laughing with my cousins. But here I was, in my delivery uniform, waiting for a customer to answer the door. The package was worth enough that I needed a signature, and my supervisor had reminded me\u2014no shortcuts, no missed confirmations. I checked the time. If the customer didn\u2019t come soon, I\u2019d be late for dinner, disappointing my family and missing the tradition I\u2019d grown up with. But if I left the package or skipped the signature, I\u2019d risk my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the warmth of family, the pride in my work. The door remained closed, and I stood on the porch, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
