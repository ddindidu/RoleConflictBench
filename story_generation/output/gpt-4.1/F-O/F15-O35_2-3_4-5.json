My son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for others. I called his name, my voice tight, but he only laughed louder.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the control center: a passenger emergency alarm had been activated on my train. Someone needed help, and as the operator, I was responsible for their safety. I could picture the anxious faces, the urgency in the air, the expectation that I would be there, calm and capable.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the duty to guide my child and the responsibility to my passengers. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my son\u2019s need for guidance, the passengers\u2019 need for safety\u2014knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
