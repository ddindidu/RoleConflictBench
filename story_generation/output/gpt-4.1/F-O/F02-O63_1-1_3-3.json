My numbers glowed green\u2014on track to beat my quota for the week. The manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep pushing, don\u2019t let up, every call counts.\u201d I was about to dial another lead when my son shuffled in, dragging his feet, eyes downcast. He\u2019d just snapped at his little sister, and I knew this was one of those moments\u2014teaching him about kindness, respect, the values I wanted him to carry through life. He looked at me, waiting, maybe dreading a lecture, maybe hoping for understanding. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cAfternoon call blitz\u2014now!\u201d I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my job demanding relentless focus, my son needing my attention and guidance. I could hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, but also my own father\u2019s, reminding me that these moments with my child are fleeting. My heart pounded as I stared at my son, torn between the ringing phone and the silent plea in his eyes."}
