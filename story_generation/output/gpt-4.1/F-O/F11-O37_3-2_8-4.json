He was upset about something I\u2019d said last night, and I knew I needed to call him, to talk things through and clear the air. As his sister, I always tried to be someone he could trust, someone who listened and respected his feelings. But as I glanced at the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner in my cleaning cart, my mind raced with another worry. My client expected the house spotless for their return in three days, and I was responsible for making sure all supplies were stocked. If I didn\u2019t let them know now, there might not be enough time to get more before the next cleaning. I felt torn\u2014should I call my brother and risk forgetting to message my client, or handle the supply issue first and delay the conversation with him? Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the pressure building inside me, the weight of wanting to do right by both my family and my job."}
