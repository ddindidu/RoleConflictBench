She was so excited, and I knew she\u2019d want to talk, to share every detail. My daughter had already called, hinting that a family video chat would mean a lot to her. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014being present, being the grandfather who listens and celebrates these moments. But at the same time, a notice from the site manager flashed in my mind: an optional training session next week, right during the time my family wanted to gather. The foreman had stressed how these sessions help us stay safe and work better as a team. I knew the guys would notice if I skipped it, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down or seem less committed. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s joy and my team\u2019s trust. I stared at the calendar, feeling the pressure build, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
