My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re all counting on you to help organize the family dinner this weekend. The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but my heart tightened. The holiday was always our time to reconnect, to share stories and laughter, and I knew how much it meant to everyone\u2014especially after the year we\u2019d had.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with another notification: a reminder from my project manager. The team was waiting on my core module, and without it, the entire build was at a standstill. The deadline loomed, and I could almost feel the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations pressing down on me. They needed my expertise, my focus, my time\u2014right now.\n\nI stared at the family group chat, then at the lines of code on my screen, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility of my work. My mind raced, caught in the tug-of-war between being the grandparent my family needed and the engineer my team depended on."}
