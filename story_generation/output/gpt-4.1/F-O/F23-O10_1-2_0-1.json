It\u2019s their last week before summer break, and they\u2019ve been talking about it for days, asking if I\u2019ll be waiting outside like the other parents. But my spreadsheet blinks accusingly at me, numbers half-checked, invoices still to reconcile. The month-end close is tomorrow, and my manager has already sent two reminders about the importance of accuracy this cycle. I can almost hear her voice: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford mistakes.\u201d My heart pounds as I picture the kids\u2019 faces, scanning the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019ll be there. At the same time, I imagine the disappointment in my boss\u2019s eyes if I let the team down. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
