The intercom crackled, and I heard my younger brother\u2019s voice\u2014he\u2019d boarded my train, hoping to talk after our argument last night. \u201cCan we talk, just for a minute?\u201d he asked, his tone uncertain. At the same time, a passenger pressed the help button, asking for directions to the hospital stop. My brother expected me to be open, to resolve our misunderstanding and rebuild the trust we\u2019d lost. But as a subway operator, I was responsible for every passenger\u2019s safety and needed to provide clear, prompt assistance. My heart pounded as I weighed the need to be a good brother against my duty to the people on my train. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the voice of family and the call of responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
