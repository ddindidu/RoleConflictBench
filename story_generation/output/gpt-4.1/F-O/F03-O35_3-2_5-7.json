It means so much to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. This ceremony wasn\u2019t just a family gathering\u2014it was a tradition, a thread tying us to our roots. I knew how much it mattered, how proud my parents would be if I stepped up. But as I glanced at the clock, my chest tightened. My shift as a subway operator started soon, and today was the mandatory pre-shift briefing on new safety protocols. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option; the company was strict, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on board with these changes.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family\u2019s expectations weighing on one side, my professional duty on the other. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice, full of hope, and my supervisor\u2019s, full of urgency. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out how to be the son my family needed and the operator my job demanded."}
