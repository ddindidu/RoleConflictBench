Mom expected all of us to sit together, laugh, and share stories\u2014no excuses. But at my telemarketing job, the rules were strict. Every break was logged, every minute accounted for. The automated system would flag me if I left my desk even a minute early or came back late. Last week, a coworker got a warning for missing just five minutes. \n\nMy headset pressed against my ear as I listened to another customer\u2019s voicemail. My heart pounded, torn between the warmth of home and the cold, blinking cursor on my screen. I imagined my family at the table, an empty chair where I should be. But if I left now, I risked a mark on my record, maybe even my job.
