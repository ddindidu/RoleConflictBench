My wife had asked me twice already to help out, reminding me that our daughter needed her uniform clean for tomorrow\u2019s school trip. I promised I\u2019d take care of it tonight, that I\u2019d be the partner she needed, not just the guy who left his badge at the door and forgot the rest. As I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. There was a violent assault happening downtown, bystanders in danger, officers needed immediately. My heart pounded. I could hear my wife in the kitchen, humming softly, trusting I\u2019d keep my word. But the city needed me too, needed me now. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one blue, one invisible\u2014pressing down on my shoulders, each demanding I choose, each refusing to let go."}
