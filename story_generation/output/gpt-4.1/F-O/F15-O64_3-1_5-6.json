He was supposed to be reading in the corner, but instead, I caught a glimpse of him slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is unacceptable. But as the cashier, I was expected to keep the line moving, to be friendly and efficient, not to cause a scene or make customers uncomfortable. My mind raced\u2014should I stop everything and confront him, risking embarrassment for both of us and disrupting the store\u2019s calm? Or should I wait, pretending nothing happened, and address it later at home? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, my hands trembling as I handed change to the next customer, my eyes flicking back to my son, unsure of what to do next."}
