The safety audit was in two days, and I knew the autoclave\u2019s timer was acting up again. If I didn\u2019t fix it tonight, I\u2019d risk a citation, or worse, a shutdown. As I set my bag down, my partner greeted me with a tired smile. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, and they nodded, mentioning a difficult meeting and a snide comment from their boss. I could see the tension in their shoulders, the way they lingered in the kitchen, hoping I\u2019d sit and listen. I wanted to be there, to offer comfort, to let them vent and feel heard. But my mind kept drifting to the lab, to the list of repairs, to the pressure of keeping everyone safe. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pulling me in two directions\u2014one toward the person I love, the other toward the work that defines me. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, caught between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of the lab, unsure which door to walk through next."}
