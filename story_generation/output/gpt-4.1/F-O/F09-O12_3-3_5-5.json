The launch date for our new feature had just been moved up, and architects from three teams were waiting for my input before they could move forward. My phone vibrated again, but before I could check it, I saw my son\u2019s small hand slip a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. The store manager was already walking over, and I felt every eye in the store on us. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences, but my phone kept buzzing\u2014messages piling up, decisions waiting. I could almost hear my team\u2019s frustration, the project\u2019s timeline slipping with every minute I delayed. My son looked up at me, eyes wide and scared, and I felt torn in two\u2014between the mother who needed to guide her child and the developer who couldn\u2019t let her team down. I took a shaky breath, caught between the demands of both worlds, not sure which one needed me more in that moment."}
