My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. I felt a wave of shame and worry\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I needed to be there for him, to understand what happened, to show him right from wrong. But as I looked up, my computer screen was filled with urgent messages from my team. The build was stalled, and everyone was waiting for my core module. The project deadline was looming, and if I didn\u2019t deliver, the whole team would be blocked. My manager\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind: reliability, leadership, technical excellence. I felt torn in two, the weight of my son\u2019s mistake pressing on my chest, the pressure of my team\u2019s dependence tightening around me. I sat frozen, caught between the parent my child needed and the engineer my team expected."}
