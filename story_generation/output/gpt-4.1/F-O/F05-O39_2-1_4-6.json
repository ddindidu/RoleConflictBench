My wife had mentioned, not for the first time, how much easier things would be if I helped more with the chores. She works just as hard as I do, and I know she expects me to pull my weight at home, especially with the kids\u2019 soccer games and school events coming up. But at work, a new notice caught my eye on the break room wall: an optional training session next week. The foreman said it\u2019s not mandatory, but everyone knows those who show up get noticed, maybe even considered for better shifts or a raise. I could use the extra money, and I want to be seen as a team player. The problem is, the training is scheduled for the same evening I promised to tackle the laundry and help get the kids ready for their activities. I feel the pressure building inside me, torn between being the husband my family needs and the worker my team expects."}
