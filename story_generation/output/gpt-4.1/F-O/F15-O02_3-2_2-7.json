My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet today, to discuss what happened and how we could address it. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions mattered and that I would help him make things right. But as I sat at my desk, my laptop pinged with reminders\u2014management was waiting for my project estimates. The quarterly roadmap depended on my input, and the team was already behind schedule. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my child needed me to be present and accountable, but my team needed my expertise and commitment.
