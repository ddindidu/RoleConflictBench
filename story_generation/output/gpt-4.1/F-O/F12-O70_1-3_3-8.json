My husband\u2019s been patient, but I know he\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll finally fold it tonight. Just as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes\u2014work again. A customer\u2019s message pops up, asking about a package that\u2019s now delayed because of a mix-up at the depot. I\u2019m supposed to respond quickly, calmly, and with all the right answers, even though I don\u2019t have them yet. My husband pokes his head in, hopeful, and I see the disappointment flicker when he notices I\u2019m glued to my phone. I want to be the reliable partner he needs, but my job expects me to be available and professional, no matter what\u2019s happening at home. My heart pounds as I juggle the urge to reassure my husband and the pressure to keep my customer satisfied. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the tension coils tighter inside me as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
