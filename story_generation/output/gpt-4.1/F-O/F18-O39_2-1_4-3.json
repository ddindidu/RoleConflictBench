Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food already, and I knew how much it meant to everyone that I\u2019d be there. Family dinners were rare, and missing one always left a hollow feeling in my chest. But as I shoved my phone back into my pocket, my foreman\u2019s voice cut through the clatter of tools. \u201cEnd of shift, everyone. Make sure your area\u2019s spotless before you go.\u201d I looked at the piles of debris and dust around my section, knowing the safety rules were strict\u2014no one left until the place was clean. If I rushed, I might miss something, and that could mean trouble for the morning crew or even an accident. My hands tightened around the broom. I could already picture my family waiting, plates set, my chair empty. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the responsibility of the jobsite."}
