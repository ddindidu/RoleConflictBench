It was Mrs. Lee, her voice tight with worry\u2014her deck had splintered, and she needed it fixed before her family barbecue that evening. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, already picturing the tools and materials I\u2019d need. As I gathered my things, my granddaughter, Emma, wandered in, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said, voice small. She was starting high school next week, and I could see the nerves in her fidgeting hands. She wanted advice, reassurance\u2014something only a grandparent could give. But Mrs. Lee was counting on me, too; her deck was a hazard, and I\u2019d given my word. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to sit with Emma, to share stories and wisdom, and the responsibility to fix what was broken for someone else. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which path to take first."}
