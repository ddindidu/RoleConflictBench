Her eyes were red from crying, her voice barely above a whisper as she told me how lost she felt. She needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to reassure her that I was here, that she wasn\u2019t alone in this storm. But my phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. The clinic. A patient was waiting, someone with a fever and cough, symptoms that could be nothing\u2014or something more. As a doctor, I was expected to listen carefully, to catch the subtle signs that might mean the difference between a simple cold and something serious. My mind raced, torn between the woman I loved and the oath I\u2019d taken. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding all of me, right now. My wife\u2019s grip tightened, her eyes searching mine for comfort. The phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible space between two lives, not knowing which to choose."}
