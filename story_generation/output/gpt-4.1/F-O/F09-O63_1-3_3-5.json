My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My fingers hover over the call button, but my son tugs at my sleeve, his face crumpled in frustration. He\u2019s just snatched a toy from his little sister, and she\u2019s wailing. I know I should step in, teach him about sharing and kindness, but my screen flashes with a new lead\u2014my best chance to close a sale. My heart pounds as I glance between my children and the blinking cursor. I hear my daughter\u2019s sobs, my son\u2019s angry protest, and the faint buzz of my manager\u2019s group chat urging us on. I want to be the mother who guides her children, but I also need to be the employee who delivers results. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I can\u2019t ignore either. My hand trembles as I decide what to do next."}
