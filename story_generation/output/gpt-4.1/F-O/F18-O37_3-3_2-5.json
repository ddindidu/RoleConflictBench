It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. She never used the word \u201curgent\u201d unless it really was. I wiped my hands, anxiety prickling at my skin. As her sibling, I knew she needed me\u2014she\u2019d just gotten some terrible news about her job, and I could almost hear her voice trembling through the text. She\u2019d expect me to listen, to comfort her, to be the steady presence she always counted on.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the cleaning cart. The bottle of specialized tile cleaner was empty, and the next client was particular about their floors. My supervisor had made it clear: no substitutions, no excuses. I was supposed to manage supplies, keep everything running smoothly. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my employer and risking my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my sister when she needed me most. My hands shook as I stood there, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
