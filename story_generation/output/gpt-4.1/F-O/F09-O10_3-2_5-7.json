The store manager\u2019s stern gaze was fixed on me, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing down. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him through this mistake with patience and firmness. My heart pounded as I knelt to his level, searching for the right words to explain why stealing was wrong, how honesty mattered.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent email from a client, asking for clarification on a confusing invoice. As an accountant, I was expected to respond quickly and professionally, to maintain trust and keep business running smoothly. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice reminding me that client satisfaction was everything.\n\nI felt torn, my mind racing between the needs of my child and the demands of my job. My son\u2019s wide, anxious eyes pleaded for my attention, while the blinking notification on my phone reminded me of my professional responsibilities. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to face first."}
