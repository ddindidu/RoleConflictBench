It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s really upset about something and needs your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. Jamie, my grandson, rarely reached out like this. I knew he must be struggling. At that moment, the intercom called me back to the ward. Mrs. Evans, my patient, had just returned from surgery. When I entered her room, she looked at me with wide, frightened eyes, her hands trembling slightly. She needed me to sit with her, to reassure her, to be the calm presence she could lean on. I could see the expectation in her face\u2014she needed comfort, someone to listen, someone to care. But Jamie\u2019s message echoed in my mind, his need for guidance and the trust he placed in me as his grandfather. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who needed me most, each expecting me to be their anchor. My hands shook as I tried to decide where I was needed more, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
