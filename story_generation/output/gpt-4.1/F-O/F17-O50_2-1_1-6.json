It\u2019s a new client, sounding a bit lost, asking if I can walk them through some basic machine operations. I glance at the clock\u2014this is the only window I have before my parents head out for their evening walk. I know how much they look forward to our chats, how my mom always asks about my meals and my dad wants to hear about my week. But the client\u2019s voice is anxious, and I remember how my supervisor emphasized the importance of being available and helpful, especially to new clients. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the warmth and duty of being a good child, the professionalism and reliability expected of a machine repairer. My thumb hovers over the call button for my parents, but my other hand is already opening the client\u2019s file. My heart pounds as I try to decide which call to make first, torn between family and work, both needing me right now."}
