My shift as a nursing assistant was in full swing, and I could hear the distant call bell from Mr. Harris\u2019s room. He\u2019d been having a rough morning, barely able to lift his spoon, grimacing with every bite. I knew he needed me\u2014he depended on me for his meals, for comfort, for a gentle hand. But then I saw the message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart twisted. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I could picture her, anxious and alone, waiting for my words to guide her. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my patient\u2019s pain, my granddaughter\u2019s plea. I wanted to be there for both, to offer wisdom and care, but I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, torn between the call bell and the call for help, not knowing which role to answer first."}
