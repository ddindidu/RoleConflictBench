My headset crackles as I coordinate with the next sector, making sure the aircraft on route 27 is handed over smoothly. My mind, though, keeps drifting to last night\u2014my wife\u2019s quiet sighs, the way she stared at her tea, lost in thought. I know I should talk to her, ask what\u2019s wrong, share how the stress of these endless shifts is wearing me down. That\u2019s what a good husband does: communicates, listens, opens up. But right now, the pilot\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, requesting confirmation. I can\u2019t afford distraction; one mistake could mean disaster. The expectation to be present at home, to be open and supportive, clashes with the unyielding demand for focus and precision here. My heart pounds as I juggle the responsibility of hundreds of lives in the sky and the silent plea for connection waiting at home.
