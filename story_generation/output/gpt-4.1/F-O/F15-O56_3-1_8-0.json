My mind races with numbers\u2014how many more clients I need to book, how many hours I can squeeze in before the deadline. As I sweep up the last of the clippings, the bell above the door jingles. Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walks in, her smile warm and expectant. The receptionist is free, but Mrs. Patel always prefers my greeting, our little ritual of catching up before her appointment. I see her eyes searching for mine, waiting for that familiar welcome. But my thoughts are tangled with worry\u2014should I rush to the back to call the bank about a payment plan, or do I set aside my anxiety and give Mrs. Patel the comfort she expects? My heart pounds, torn between the need to secure my family\u2019s future and the duty to make my client feel at home. I stand frozen, scissors in hand, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
