My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cDad\u2019s not sleeping well. Can you come by tonight?\u201d I could hear her exhaustion in the words, and I knew they needed me. But my eyes drifted back to the plans. There were small inconsistencies\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to nag at my conscience. As an architect, I was expected to catch every detail, to ensure the building would be safe, compliant, flawless. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford mistakes, not even small ones.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents needed comfort, someone to listen, to reassure them. My job demanded focus, precision, and accountability. If I left now, I\u2019d be distracted with worry for them. If I stayed, I\u2019d be haunted by guilt, picturing their tired faces. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding more than I felt able to give. I stared at the plans, my phone in hand, caught between the expectations of a devoted son and a responsible architect, unsure which call to answer first."}
