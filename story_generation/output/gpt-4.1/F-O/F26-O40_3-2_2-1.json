It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked if she could come over\u2014she needed advice about a problem at school, something she said she couldn\u2019t talk to her parents about. My heart ached to be the steady presence she needed, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But as I glanced around, I saw tools scattered across the floor, wood shavings piling up dangerously close to the saw. I knew the safety protocols by heart: never leave a messy workspace, always secure sharp tools, especially with visitors\u2014let alone a child\u2014coming by. The expectation to be a source of comfort and guidance for my granddaughter pulled at me, but so did the responsibility to keep my workshop safe. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
