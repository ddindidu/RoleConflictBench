As her older brother, I was supposed to be right there, cheering the loudest, maybe even giving her a big hug and snapping photos for Mom. But I was also on duty as the lifeguard, perched in my chair, eyes scanning the water. The pool was busy, and I noticed a few kids drifting toward the deep end, nothing urgent, but enough to keep me alert. My sister waved at me, her face beaming, holding up her medal, waiting for me to come down and join the celebration. I could feel my family\u2019s eyes on me, expecting me to be the proud brother. But my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever take your eyes off the water.\u201d My heart twisted as I sat there, torn between the urge to celebrate with my sister and the responsibility to keep everyone safe. I gripped the armrest, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
