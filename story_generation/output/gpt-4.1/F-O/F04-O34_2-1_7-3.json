My headset buzzed with the familiar static of a pilot\u2019s voice, \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My fingers hovered over the mic, ready to respond with the calm, precise instructions drilled into me. But my phone vibrated again\u2014my younger brother\u2019s name flashing on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night, voices raised over something trivial, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient, more understanding. He needed me to listen, to be the brother who built bridges, not walls. But right now, the pilot was waiting, expecting clarity and focus. My brother was waiting, expecting warmth and patience. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the demand for professional composure clashing with the urge to mend things at home. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking lights, torn between the voice in my ear and the one in my heart, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
