As a judge, I was expected to draft a standard scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. The legal language needed to be precise, the timeline fair, and every detail accounted for. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised to help prepare the traditional dishes for the family gathering this weekend. It means a lot to your father.\u201d \n\nMy family expected me to uphold our traditions, to be present and engaged, especially during the holidays. I could almost smell the spices and hear the laughter in the kitchen, but my mind kept drifting back to the unfinished order. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s warmth and expectations on one side, the cold clarity of the law on the other. I felt torn, knowing that whichever I chose to focus on, I would be letting someone down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart heavy, as I wrestled with the impossible choice."}
