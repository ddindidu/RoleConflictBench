I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom again, asking if I\u2019d eaten lunch and reminding me to call her back. I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a short chat about my day. But right now, I was on a call with Mr. Jenkins, a customer who\u2019d been with our company for years. He was furious, his voice sharp as he questioned every detail of the new offer I was supposed to sell. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up angry. Handle every objection.\u201d I tried to focus on Mr. Jenkins\u2019 concerns, but my mind kept drifting to Mom\u2019s messages, picturing her waiting anxiously for my response. My hands trembled as I juggled the headset and my phone, torn between the duty to reassure my parent and the pressure to keep my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to give either side what they needed from me."}
