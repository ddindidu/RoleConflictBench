She reminds me how much the grandkids look forward to our traditions, how important it is for everyone to feel connected, especially this year. I want to be present, to listen to their stories, to laugh and share memories. But my mind keeps drifting to the office, where a case hangs in the balance. Opposing counsel has been relentless, calling even now, pressing for information I cannot ethically share. The pressure is mounting\u2014if I don\u2019t respond, my client could suffer, but if I do, I risk betraying their trust. My family expects warmth and attention, my client expects unwavering loyalty and discretion. I stare at the flour-dusted counter, heart pounding, torn between the voices of those who need me in such different ways, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in as the holiday draws near."}
