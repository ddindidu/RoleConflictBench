We request your presence to discuss this matter.\u201d My mind raced with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have noticed something was wrong? I knew I needed to be there for my child, to listen, to guide, to show that I cared about their actions and feelings. But just as I was about to reply, a Slack notification popped up: \u201cHey, can you look at the UI glitch? QA says it\u2019s confusing users again.\u201d I sighed, glancing at the bug report. It wasn\u2019t critical, but my team expected quick turnarounds, and I prided myself on being reliable. My manager had already nudged me about response times this week. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my child needed me as a parent, my team needed me as a developer. I sat frozen, torn between the urgent call of family and the persistent demands of work, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
