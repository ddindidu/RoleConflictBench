The house is a mess, and your family will be here in a few hours.\u201d I could picture the living room, cluttered with toys and laundry, and felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. We\u2019d promised each other to share the load, especially when guests were coming. But as I tucked my phone away, I heard soft sobs from Room 12. Mrs. Carter, who\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, sat hunched on her bed, tears streaming down her face. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cOur patients need us, especially in moments like this.\u201d I knew she expected me to stay, to offer comfort and a listening ear. My heart twisted, torn between the home that needed me and the patient who needed me more. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, feeling the pull of both worlds and the impossibility of being enough for either."}
