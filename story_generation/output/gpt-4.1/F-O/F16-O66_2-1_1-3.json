My phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you right now.\u201d She was facing a tough decision at work, and I knew she counted on me for advice and encouragement. I wanted to pull over, call her, and be the supportive spouse she needed. But as a taxi driver, I had a passenger in the backseat, quietly checking his watch.
