My phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning meeting was in fifteen minutes. The client was waiting on my estimates, and the whole team was counting on me to get it right. I started calculating hours and resources, my mind racing through dependencies and risks.\n\nThen, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling as she shared something she\u2019d never told me before\u2014a struggle she\u2019d been carrying alone. She needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. I could see how much she needed her child right now, someone to lean on.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. My manager\u2019s last message flashed in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers today.\u201d My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, but I felt myself pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me at once. I wanted to be there for my mom, but I also couldn\u2019t let my team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
