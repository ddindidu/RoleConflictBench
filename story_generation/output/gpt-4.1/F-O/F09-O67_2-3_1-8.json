The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cCritical patient, time is everything.\u201d My heart pounded, not just from the urgency of the sirens, but from the memory of my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes that morning. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there for my open class, right, Mom?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her voice trembling with excitement. I\u2019d promised her, just as I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d always be ready for emergencies.\n\nNow, thunder cracked overhead, and the road shimmered with danger. Every instinct screamed at me to drive faster, to save the life in the back. But I also knew my daughter would be scanning the classroom door, waiting for me to walk in, to prove that she mattered most. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my duty to my patient, my love for my child. I could feel myself splitting in two, torn between the flashing lights of the ambulance and the soft glow of my daughter\u2019s classroom. The clock ticked, and I was forced to choose which promise to keep."}
