My headset feels heavy, and the hum of the call center is relentless. Suddenly, I notice my husband standing in the doorway, his shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. He\u2019s been quiet all week, and I promised myself I\u2019d be a better listener, to communicate openly like we agreed. He hesitates, then asks softly, \u201cCan we talk for a minute?\u201d My heart aches; I want to be there for him, to share and listen, to be the wife he needs. But the compliance system is merciless\u2014if I step away now, even for a few minutes, I risk a warning or worse. The pressure to meet my call quota and stick to my schedule is suffocating. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. I want to reach for him, to show I care, but the fear of disciplinary action holds me back. My mind races, caught between the demands of my job and the needs of my marriage, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
