He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours until my experiment slot, a window I\u2019d waited months for, with equipment that wouldn\u2019t be available again for weeks. My mind raced with the expectations pressing in from both sides. As a mother, I was supposed to be there for my child, to show him right from wrong, to respond immediately when he needed guidance. But as a scientist, I was expected to seize every rare opportunity, to gather the data my research depended on, to not let the team down. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me. If I missed the meeting, would I be failing my son when he needed me most? If I missed the experiment, would I be letting down my colleagues and jeopardizing months of work? I sat frozen at my desk, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
