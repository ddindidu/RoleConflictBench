I knew it was Mom\u2014she always expected me to check in during my lunch break, to tell her how my day was going, what I\u2019d eaten, if I was feeling okay. I usually replied right away, sending her a quick photo or a voice note, but today was different. I was in the middle of scrubbing the bathroom floor at the hotel, thick yellow gloves pulled up to my elbows, bleach stinging my nose. The supervisor had just reminded us that gloves were mandatory, especially after last week\u2019s inspection. I could feel my phone vibrating again, but I couldn\u2019t risk pulling off my gloves, not with the chemicals on my hands and the manager watching. My mind raced\u2014if I didn\u2019t answer, Mom would worry, maybe even call my boss. But if I did, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking a warning or worse. The pressure built in my chest, torn between being the attentive son my parents expected and the responsible cleaner my job demanded."}
