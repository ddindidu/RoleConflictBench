It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen. \u201cCan we talk? I think we misunderstood each other earlier,\u201d his message read. We\u2019d argued that morning, and I knew he expected me, as his sister, to listen and help us work things out. I wanted to call him back right away, to show him I cared and that our relationship mattered.\n\nBut as I glanced in the rearview mirror, my passenger\u2019s anxious eyes met mine. \u201cPlease, can you hurry? My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d she pleaded, clutching her ticket. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get her to the station safely and on time. The city traffic was thick, and every second counted.\n\nMy heart pounded as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my brother\u2019s need for understanding and my passenger\u2019s urgent timetable. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to put them first."}
