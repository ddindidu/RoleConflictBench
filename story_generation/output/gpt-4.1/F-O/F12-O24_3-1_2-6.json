He\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and I know he needs me\u2014my words, my touch, my undivided attention. I want to be present, to reassure him that he\u2019s not alone in this storm. But on the coffee table, the latest law review journal stares back at me, its pages promising insight into new legal theories that could shape my next case. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to stay sharp, to keep up with every shift in the law. My colleagues and the public trust me to be informed, to make decisions that are fair and current. My husband leans into me, searching for comfort, while my mind drifts to the unopened journal. I feel torn, guilty for wanting to retreat into my professional world when he needs me most. The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit there, heart divided, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
