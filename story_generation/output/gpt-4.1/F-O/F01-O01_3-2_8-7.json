Every minute counted; delays meant costs, and my team relied on my decisions to keep the project moving. Just as I was about to finalize a crucial delivery, my daughter\u2019s name flashed on my phone. I hesitated, torn. She rarely called during work hours. I answered, and her voice trembled as she told me about my grandson\u2019s sudden hospitalization. My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew I should be there, offering comfort and support, keeping the family connected in this crisis. But as an architect, I was expected to stay focused, to solve problems and keep the project on track. The contractor\u2019s voice buzzed in my other ear, waiting for my answer. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
