My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me about the family holiday dinner this weekend. She wanted to know if I could help set up early, maybe even bring my famous apple pie. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, see the table crowded with food and stories.
