My son, Ethan, sat across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dribbling down his chin. He was supposed to be practicing saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d but instead, he was whining for more cereal without a word of courtesy. I knew I should stop, look him in the eye, and gently remind him about manners\u2014this was the moment to teach him, to shape his character. But the quarterly financial reports were due in two hours, and I still had to reconcile the last batch of invoices. My boss expected precision and timeliness; mistakes could mean hours of rework or worse, a loss of trust. I felt my chest tighten as Ethan\u2019s voice grew louder, demanding my attention, while the numbers on my screen blurred together. I wanted to be the patient mother he needed, but the accountant in me screamed for focus and accuracy. I stared at the screen, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which role to answer first."}
