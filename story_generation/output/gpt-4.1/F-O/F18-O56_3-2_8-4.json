He was fiddling with his phone, oblivious to the traffic as he stepped off the curb. My heart lurched\u2014every instinct screamed at me to dash outside and yank him back to safety, just like Mom always told me to. But right in front of me, my new client was frowning at her reflection, her voice tight as she pointed out the brassiness in her highlights. She was a first-timer, and I knew how important it was to listen, reassure, and fix things right away if I wanted her to come back. My hands trembled as I clutched the comb, torn between the urge to bolt outside and the duty to stay, smile, and make things right for my client. I could feel my chest tightening, the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
