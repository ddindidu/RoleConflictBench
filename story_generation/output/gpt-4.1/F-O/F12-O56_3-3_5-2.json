The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry scattered, and the living room needed dusting. As a wife, I felt the pressure to make everything perfect, to show his family that I could manage our home with grace. But just as I started scrubbing the kitchen counters, my phone buzzed. My salon client, a nervous bride-to-be, texted that she and her bridesmaids were already outside, an hour early. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to greet them warmly, calm their nerves, and make their special day flawless. But the thought of leaving the house in chaos gnawed at me. My husband\u2019s expectant look, the bride\u2019s anxious messages, and my own sense of responsibility pulled me in opposite directions. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the roles I was supposed to play, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
