They looked up and smiled, but I could sense a heaviness in their eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, setting my things down. They shrugged, \u201cJust a lot of little things at work. Nothing major, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re home.\u201d I sat beside them, feeling the pull to wrap them in comfort, to listen and reassure. But as I reached for their hand, I caught sight of the law review journal on the table\u2014freshly delivered, its pages promising insight into new legal theories I needed to understand for tomorrow\u2019s hearing. My mind raced: I owed it to my partner to be present, to listen, to offer the support they deserved. Yet, as a judge, I was expected to stay sharp, informed, and ready to interpret the law with the latest knowledge. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself torn, heart and mind wrestling with where I was needed most in that moment."}
