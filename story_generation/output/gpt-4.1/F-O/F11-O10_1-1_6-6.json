You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d I knew how much she valued these outings, and I\u2019d promised to make more time for her. She always said it made her feel included, like we were really close. At the same time, an email notification popped up\u2014our vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol required me to send a formal reply before the end of the business day. My manager had reminded me just this morning about the importance of timely communication with vendors. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my sister\u2019s invitation and the professional responsibility demanding my attention. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
