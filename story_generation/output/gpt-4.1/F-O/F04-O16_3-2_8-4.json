As her brother, I knew I needed to listen, to show her respect and try to understand her side, even if I disagreed. I wanted to bridge the gap between us, to talk openly and resolve the misunderstanding before it grew any deeper. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014a message from the hospital. One of my patients, newly diagnosed with diabetes, was waiting for me. His family was anxious, needing clear, compassionate answers about his care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my sister\u2019s expectant eyes searching for a brother who would listen, and a patient relying on his doctor for guidance and reassurance. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and the demands of each role pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and uncertain about what to do next."}
