She reminded me, again, that tonight was the family dinner\u2014an important tradition, especially now that my grandparents were getting older. \u201cDon\u2019t be late,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt means a lot to everyone.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, heavy with the weight of our family\u2019s expectations, echoing the importance of being present, of honoring our customs.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my supervisor called me back to the floor. Mrs. Lee, my post-op patient, needed help getting dressed and moving to her chair. She was anxious and in pain, and I knew she\u2019d need extra time and gentle encouragement. My shift was supposed to end soon, but I couldn\u2019t just rush her care. The responsibility I felt as a nursing assistant pressed on me\u2014my patients depended on me to be patient, attentive, and thorough.\n\nI felt torn, the pull of my family\u2019s traditions on one side and the needs of my patient on the other. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I would have to let down."}
