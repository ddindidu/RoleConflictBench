It was a text from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I hesitated, heart pounding, remembering her voice cracking earlier that morning. She\u2019d just found out she didn\u2019t get the job she desperately needed. As her sibling, I knew she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be present in her pain. But right now, I was standing on a stranger\u2019s porch, package in hand, wearing my delivery uniform. The door swung open and the customer, frowning, asked, \u201cIs my package late? I\u2019ve been waiting all morning.\u201d I could feel my phone vibrating again in my pocket\u2014my sister, reaching out for support. The customer\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting a polite, professional answer. My mind raced, torn between the urge to step aside and call my sister, and the responsibility to stay calm and courteous for my job. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
