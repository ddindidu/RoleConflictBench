I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. The text was simple: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you this weekend.\u201d Guilt pricked at me. I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t check in, especially since Dad\u2019s health had started to decline. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, her bag of pill bottles clutched tightly, her eyes anxious. As a pharmacist, I was expected to give her my full attention, to catch any dangerous interactions and explain everything clearly. But as a child, I was supposed to reassure my parents, to be present even from afar. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my patient and the responsibility to my family. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
