My son bounced into the room, eyes shining with excitement. \u201cIs today the day we get the Nintendo, Dad? You promised!\u201d His words tugged at me, a reminder of the promise I\u2019d made weeks ago, a reward for his good grades. But my mind was tangled in the new safety standard that had just been released. The product launch was in two days, and I was responsible for ensuring every detail met the updated regulations. Missing a single requirement could mean a costly recall, threatening the financial stability I worked so hard to provide. My son\u2019s hopeful face clashed with the urgent emails piling up in my inbox. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to keep my family secure, and my desire to keep my promise as a parent. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be both the reliable engineer and the parent my son needed, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
