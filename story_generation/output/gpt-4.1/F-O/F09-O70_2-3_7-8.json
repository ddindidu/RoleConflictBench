My heart sinks. I need every delivery I can get to keep us afloat. As I pull up to the next address, my phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s a customer asking about their package. I check the app and realize with a jolt that their order is delayed, possibly misplaced at the last stop. My mind races. I know I have to respond quickly and professionally, but my thoughts are clouded by worry about the bills piling up at home. The customer expects a calm, polite explanation, but my hands are shaking. I want to scream in frustration, torn between the need to keep this job\u2014our only steady income\u2014and the pressure to be the reliable, composed worker my company expects.
