Let us know how you\u2019re doing.\u201d I know she wants me to reply, to keep up the connection, especially since Dad worries when I go quiet. But I\u2019m in the middle of my shift at the hotel, scrubbing bathroom tiles with bleach, gloved hands slippery and mask tight on my face. The supervisor just reminded us\u2014no phones out, not even for a second, and never with gloves on. Safety and hygiene come first, always. I glance at my phone, feeling the pressure build. If I don\u2019t answer, my parents will think I\u2019m ignoring them. If I do, I risk breaking the rules and maybe even contaminating my phone. My heart pounds as I stare at the message, torn between being a good step-child and a responsible cleaner, knowing I can\u2019t be both at this moment."}
