He looked tired, his shoulders slumped, and he sat across from me with a heavy sigh. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do anymore,\u201d he said, voice trembling. He started sharing about his worries at work, how he felt like he was failing, and I could see he needed someone to listen, to reassure him. My heart ached for him, but my mind kept drifting to the supply list in front of me. I\u2019d just realized the client\u2019s floor cleaner was almost gone, and if I didn\u2019t get it before the next visit, I\u2019d be letting them down. I felt torn\u2014my stepdad needed my full attention, my empathy, but the responsibility of my job pressed on me. I tried to nod and murmur support, but my thoughts kept flickering to the store\u2019s closing time and whether I could squeeze in a trip. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
