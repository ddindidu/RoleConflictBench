I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed calls and a string of messages from Mom, each more anxious than the last. She expected me to check in, to share how my day was going, to reassure her that I was safe and well. But right now, my attention was pulled to the group of new staff huddled around the old press, their hands hovering uncertainly over the controls. They were about to start a batch, and I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d tried to explain earlier. My supervisor expected me to guide them, to make sure no one got hurt, to be the expert. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mother\u2019s need for connection, my responsibility to keep these workers safe. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between typing a quick reply and stepping in to stop a potential disaster, my heart pounding with the impossibility of being both the attentive daughter and the vigilant repairer at the same time."}
