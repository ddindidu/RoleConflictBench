The open class at Mia\u2019s school was starting in thirty minutes, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. The factory operator was on the line again, his voice tense. He\u2019d adjusted the settings on the new press, and now the material was piling up in the scrap bin\u2014again. My supervisor expected me to guide the operators, to prevent exactly this kind of waste. I could hear the frustration in the background, the clatter of machines, the pressure mounting. I felt torn in two\u2014my daughter\u2019s expectant face, the trust in her eyes, and the urgent responsibility at work, where my absence meant more mistakes and mounting costs. My hands shook as I weighed the disappointment I might cause at home against the chaos I\u2019d leave behind at the factory. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which way to turn."}
