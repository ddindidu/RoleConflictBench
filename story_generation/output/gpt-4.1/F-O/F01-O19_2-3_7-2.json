My granddaughter had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with messages\u2014photos of her at her desk, her first coffee mug, her beaming smile. My daughter had texted, \u201cDad, she\u2019d love to hear from you!\u201d I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I stay involved, that I show I care. \n\nBut in front of me was a chemotherapy prescription, the kind that demanded every ounce of my attention. The dosage was precise, the patient\u2019s life hanging on my accuracy. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the supportive grandfather, the reliable pharmacist. My fingers hovered over my phone, then over the medication bottles, my mind torn between sending a quick message and double-checking the prescription. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice, excited and hopeful, while the pharmacist in me recited protocols and double-checked calculations. The pressure built inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, caught in the middle, unsure which demand to answer first."}
