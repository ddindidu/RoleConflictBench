Did you eat lunch?\u201d I glance at the clock\u20142:15 p.m.\u2014and realize I haven\u2019t replied to her earlier texts. Guilt prickles at me. We always talk during the day, and she worries if I don\u2019t answer quickly. But my laptop screen is filled with lines of code, a half-finished function blinking at me. I know I could just patch it up for now and refactor later, but the clean, efficient solution is right there, just out of reach, and I want to get it right. My team trusts me to deliver quality work, and I take pride in that. Yet, my parents expect me to be present, to share my life with them, and I don\u2019t want to let them down. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between typing a thoughtful reply to my mom or diving back into the code, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
