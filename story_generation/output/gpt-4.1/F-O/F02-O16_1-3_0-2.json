I could picture her face pressed against the window, searching for me among the other parents. But just as I reached for my coat, the ER doors burst open. A nurse rushed in, wheeling a man gasping for breath, his skin pale and clammy. \u201cDoctor, we need you now,\u201d she called. The patient\u2019s chart was a mystery\u2014no clear diagnosis, only a jumble of alarming symptoms. My mind raced with possibilities, knowing every second mattered. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in: my children waiting, hoping for their father to show up, and this stranger\u2019s life hanging in the balance, depending on my expertise. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the promise I made to my family and the oath I swore as a doctor."}
