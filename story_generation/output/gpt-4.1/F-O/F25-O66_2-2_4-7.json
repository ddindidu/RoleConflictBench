We\u2019re counting on you to help with the ceremony.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, heavy with the weight of tradition. My father\u2019s family had always insisted I participate, especially now, as they tried to draw me closer into their circle. But the meter on my taxi was running, and two travelers stood at the curb, waving me down. Their arms were full of suitcases, and they looked exhausted. \u201cCan you help us load these? We need to split the fare, too,\u201d one asked, urgency in her voice. I knew the rules\u2014professionalism meant helping with luggage, being patient, and making sure the ride went smoothly, no matter how complicated the request. My mind raced: if I took this fare, I\u2019d be late for the family dinner, risking disappointment and another lecture about respect and belonging. But if I left the travelers stranded, I\u2019d fail as a driver, letting down people who depended on me for their journey. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
