My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIf that line goes down, we lose hours.\u201d I grabbed my toolbox, heart pounding, but as I turned, I caught sight of my granddaughter sitting quietly on the bench by the window. Her shoulders were hunched, her eyes fixed on the floor, and I recognized the look\u2014lost, discouraged, the way I\u2019d felt at her age when the world seemed too big.\n\nI knew what was expected of me. As a grandmother, I should sit beside her, offer the comfort and wisdom she needed, let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But as the machine repairer, I was the only one on shift who could fix that bearing before it seized. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each urgent in its own way. My hands trembled, torn between the wrench and the gentle touch my granddaughter needed, my mind racing as I stood frozen between the two worlds that needed me."}
