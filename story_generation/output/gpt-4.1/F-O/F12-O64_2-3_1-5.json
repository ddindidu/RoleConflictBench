The manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDouble-check everything, no shortcuts. Auditors are watching.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past my shift. My phone buzzed again. It was my husband, his message pleading: \u201cCan you talk? I need you.\u201d He\u2019d been anxious all week about a decision at work, and tonight he needed my support more than ever. I could picture him at home, waiting for my advice, hoping I\u2019d listen and reassure him. But here I was, surrounded by receipts and cash, knowing one mistake could cost me my job. My heart ached with guilt. I wanted to be the wife he needed, to drop everything and call him. But the weight of the store\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stared at the deposit slip, torn between the rules I had to follow and the love I wanted to give."}
