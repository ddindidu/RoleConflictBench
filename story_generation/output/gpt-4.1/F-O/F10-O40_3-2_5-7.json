It\u2019s important for the family.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew what it meant\u2014standing before everyone, reciting the prayers, guiding the rituals just as my grandmother had. It was an honor, but also a heavy responsibility. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice: \u201cTradition keeps us together.\u201d I wanted to make them proud, to show I valued our roots.\n\nBut then my work phone buzzed. The homeowner\u2019s voice was urgent: \u201cThe deck is unsafe. My kids can\u2019t play outside until it\u2019s fixed. Can you come today?\u201d As a carpenter, I knew the risks of leaving a damaged deck unattended. My clients trusted me to keep their homes safe, and I prided myself on never letting them down.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family counting on me to uphold our traditions, and my client relying on me to restore their home. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
