She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to try something new?\u201d I could see the uncertainty in her eyes, the kind that reminded me of my own younger days. My instinct as a grandmother was to close the laptop, offer her tea, and share stories of my own leaps of faith, to guide her with the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years.\n\nBut the scientist in me tugged at my attention. I was in the middle of reviewing a set of results, and though the logs could technically wait, I knew that delaying documentation often led to missed details and muddled data. My team relied on my accuracy, and I prided myself on never letting personal matters interfere with my work. Yet here was my granddaughter, seeking comfort and advice, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full presence. My heart ached as I sat, torn between the urge to nurture and the call to precision, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
