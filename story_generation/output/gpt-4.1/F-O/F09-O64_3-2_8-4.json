The home loan repayment is looming, and every cent counts. I promised myself I\u2019d do whatever it takes to keep our family afloat, to make sure my kids never feel the weight of our financial struggles. As a mother, I can\u2019t afford to slip up\u2014not now, not with the bank\u2019s deadline so close.\n\nA woman approaches the counter, her face anxious, clutching a blender. \u201cI lost the receipt, but it\u2019s brand new. Can I return it?\u201d she pleads. My training as a cashier is clear: no receipt, no return. The policy is strict, and my manager watches these transactions closely. If I bend the rules, I risk my job\u2014the job that pays our bills and keeps our home.\n\nBut I see the desperation in her eyes, a reflection of my own worries. I know what it\u2019s like to need a break, to hope someone will make an exception. My hands tremble as I weigh the store\u2019s rules against my need to keep this job, and my empathy as a mother against my duty as a cashier. I hesitate, caught between two worlds, unsure which part of me should speak."}
