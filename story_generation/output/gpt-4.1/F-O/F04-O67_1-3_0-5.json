She wanted me there, tonight, to celebrate with the family. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. As I hung up, the radio crackled: \u201cCode Red, possible major heart attack, downtown.\u201d My heart skipped. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, and I knew every second mattered for the patient\u2019s life.\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I took the call, I\u2019d miss my sister\u2019s celebration, the one she\u2019d been waiting for all her life. But if I didn\u2019t, someone\u2019s life could hang in the balance.
