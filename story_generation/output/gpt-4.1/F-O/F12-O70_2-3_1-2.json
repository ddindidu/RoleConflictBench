It was Mark, my husband. His voice trembled as he told me about the ultimatum his boss had given him\u2014accept a transfer or risk losing his job. He needed me, not just as a sounding board, but as his anchor. I could hear the desperation in his words, the way he paused, waiting for my reassurance, my advice. But as I listened, my work phone chimed with a high-priority alert: a medical supply package needed to reach the hospital\u2019s oncology department within the hour. If I was late, patient care could be compromised. My heart pounded. Mark\u2019s pain pulled at me, demanding my presence and comfort, but the responsibility of the delivery pressed just as hard. I stood in the doorway, keys in hand, torn between the person who needed me most and the job that could not wait."}
