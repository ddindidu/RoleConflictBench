My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo delays, especially with medical runs.\u201d But as I started the engine, a message from Mom popped up. \u201cDad\u2019s not feeling well. Can you come home soon?\u201d I pictured them both, faces drawn and tired, needing me to be there, to listen, to help. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014always the steady one, the emotional anchor. But the hospital was counting on me too; a late delivery could mean real consequences for patients. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I wanted to be in two places at once, to be the reliable child my parents needed and the responsible delivery person my job demanded. The pressure built in my chest, my mind racing through possible choices, knowing that whatever I did, someone would be let down."}
