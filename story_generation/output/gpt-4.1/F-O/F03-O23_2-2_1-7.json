It\u2019s a ritual\u2014my mother expects to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m eating well, to share her stories and worries. Tonight, as I dial, my mind is elsewhere. Earlier, an assistant at the firm asked for access to files from a case I\u2019m handling. She said it would help her organize the office, but the documents are confidential. I know the rules: client trust is sacred, and sharing information, even internally, could breach that trust.\n\nMy mother answers, her voice warm and expectant. She asks about my week, and I try to focus, but my thoughts keep drifting. She senses my distraction and presses gently, wanting me to open up. I want to reassure her, to be the attentive son she expects, but I can\u2019t talk about work. I can\u2019t explain the ethical dilemma gnawing at me. I feel torn\u2014between the duty to protect my client and the need to be present for my family. The weight of both roles presses in, and I struggle to find the right words, caught between what I owe my parents and what I owe my profession."}
