My son, Ethan, was across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dripping onto the table. \u201cEthan, remember to use your napkin,\u201d I reminded him, trying to keep my voice gentle. He looked up, eyes searching mine for approval or disappointment. At the same moment, a Slack message popped up: \u201cNeed your input on the API design\u2014can you review now?\u201d My team was waiting, the deadline for the design documents looming. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen.\n\nEthan slurped his cereal, and I caught myself sighing. I wanted to be present, to teach him patience and respect at the table, to model the values I hoped he\u2019d carry into adulthood. But the pressure from work was mounting, and I knew my absence would slow the project, frustrate my colleagues, maybe even jeopardize the release. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to guide my son and the demand to support my team. I stared at Ethan, then at my laptop, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
