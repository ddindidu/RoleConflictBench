As a father, I know I should step in\u2014teach him about respect for public spaces, about discipline and self-control. But as the only cashier on duty, I can\u2019t leave my post. The line grows longer, and a woman approaches, holding a blender and no receipt. She insists she bought it here, that it\u2019s defective, and she needs a refund. Store policy is clear: no returns without proof of purchase. I\u2019m expected to enforce it, no exceptions. My son\u2019s laughter echoes, drawing annoyed glances from customers. I feel the weight of two worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to guide my child, and my responsibility to uphold store rules. My heart pounds as I glance from the pleading customer to my misbehaving son, torn between the expectations of a good father and a reliable employee, knowing I can\u2019t fulfill both at this moment."}
