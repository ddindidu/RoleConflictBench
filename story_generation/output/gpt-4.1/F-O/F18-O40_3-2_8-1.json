The foreman had just reminded us about the importance of keeping the site spotless\u2014one stray nail, one slippery patch, and someone could get hurt. I was almost done when I glanced out the open door and saw my little brother across the street, waving at me. He was grinning, distracted, and I saw him step off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic barreling down the road. My heart leapt into my throat. I knew I should drop everything and run to pull him back, to keep him safe like I always promised Mom I would. But the floor was littered with sharp offcuts and tools\u2014if I left it like this, someone could trip, or worse. I felt torn in two, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My hands shook, broom still in my grip, as I tried to decide which duty I owed more in that split second."}
