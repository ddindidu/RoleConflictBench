She smiles at her reflection, then hesitates, brushing her fringe aside. \u201cCould you just take a little more off here?\u201d she asks, her tone gentle but expectant. I nod, reaching for my scissors, but my mind is already racing. The phone vibrates again\u2014probably Mom, checking in like she does every afternoon. She worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly, and I know she\u2019s waiting for my usual update about work and lunch. I want to reassure her, to keep our daily rhythm going, but Mrs. Lee is watching me, trusting me to get her hair just right. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the need to be a good, attentive child, and the responsibility to be a professional, caring hairdresser. My hands hover, uncertain, as I wrestle with which role to answer first."}
