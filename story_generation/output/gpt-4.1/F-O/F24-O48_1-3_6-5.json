Mom always reminded me to keep an eye on him, especially since he tended to wander off if I wasn\u2019t paying attention. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. My patient, Mr. Lee, was in critical condition, and I was supposed to be monitoring his vitals every few minutes. I could picture the monitors, the beeping, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, focused and attentive. But right now, Sam was skipping ahead, dangerously close to the curb, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me from both sides. Should I rush home with Sam, making sure he\u2019s safe, or call someone to cover my shift and risk letting my patient down? My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the brother who needed me and the patient whose life might depend on me."}
