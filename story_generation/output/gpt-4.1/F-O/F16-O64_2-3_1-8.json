My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014again. I know it\u2019s my partner, waiting for me to reply. This morning, they were so anxious about that big decision at work, their eyes searching mine for reassurance. \u201cI just need to know you\u2019re with me,\u201d they\u2019d whispered before I left. Now, as I try to keep my smile steady for the next impatient customer, my mind is split. The woman in front of me is upset about a price, her voice rising, demanding my full attention. I nod, apologize, try to soothe her, but inside I\u2019m torn. My partner needs me to be present, to offer comfort and advice, but right now, I\u2019m expected to be the calm, friendly cashier everyone relies on. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, each pulling me in a different direction, and I can\u2019t see how to be enough for both at once."}
