As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a professional necessity. My shift started in a few hours, and I needed to be at my best. Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was my sister. Her voice trembled as she told me she\u2019d just lost her job. I could hear her trying not to cry, and my heart twisted. She needed me\u2014needed her big brother to listen, to reassure her, to just be there. But the clock was ticking. If I missed my workout, I\u2019d be letting down my team, risking my own readiness. I felt torn in two, the weight of my badge on one side, the bond of family on the other. My sister\u2019s pain echoed in my mind, but so did the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d show up for my duty, strong and prepared. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between the call of family and the call of duty, not sure which door to walk through."}
