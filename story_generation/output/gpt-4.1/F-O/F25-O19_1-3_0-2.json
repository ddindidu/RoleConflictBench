My hands trembled slightly as I read the label for the third time, knowing that even the smallest mistake could have devastating consequences for the patient waiting anxiously on the other side of the glass. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a text from my stepdad, just a simple \u201cHow are you doing this weekend?\u201d I knew my mom expected me to keep in touch, to show I cared, especially since I wasn\u2019t always around. Guilt pricked at me; I hadn\u2019t replied to their last message, and I could almost hear my mom\u2019s gentle reminder to \u201cjust check in, it means a lot.\u201d But the prescription in front of me demanded my full attention. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing against the professional responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. My thumb hovered over my phone, my mind racing between the need to be a good step-child and the duty to be a vigilant pharmacist."}
