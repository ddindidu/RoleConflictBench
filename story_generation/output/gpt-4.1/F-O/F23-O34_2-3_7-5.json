My stepdaughter\u2019s text from this morning still lingers in my mind: \u201cWe\u2019re out of groceries. Can you pick up something after work?\u201d I know the bills are piling up, and I promised my partner I\u2019d take an extra shift to help cover rent. The weight of being the provider presses on me, every decision at home measured in dollars and cents.\n\nSuddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice crackles through my headset, tense and urgent: \u201cApproach, this is Delta 142, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My training kicks in, but my heart pounds. The expectation is clear\u2014lives depend on my calm, precise instructions. I can\u2019t afford a single mistake, not with a plane in distress. But my mind keeps drifting to my family, to the empty fridge and the anxious faces waiting for me at home. I feel split in two, torn between the cockpit and the kitchen, between the voices in my ear and the ones in my heart. The next words I say will matter, but so will the choices I make when I finally leave this room."}
