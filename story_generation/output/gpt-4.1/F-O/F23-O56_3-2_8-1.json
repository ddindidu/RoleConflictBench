Two months left, and the numbers in my bank account don\u2019t add up the way I need them to. As a step-parent, I promised my partner I\u2019d help keep us afloat, that I\u2019d be the steady one, the provider. The weight of that promise sits heavy on my shoulders as I fold towels behind the salon counter. \n\nJust then, the bell above the door jingles. A new client steps in, her eyes darting nervously around the salon. I know what\u2019s expected of me here too: a warm smile, a gentle welcome, the kind of reassurance that turns a stranger into a regular. But my mind is racing with budgets and bills, and I can feel my own anxiety threatening to spill over. I want to be present for her, to make her feel at ease, but the pressure of my other life\u2014the one waiting at home\u2014clashes with the demands of this moment. I take a breath, caught between the need to be everything for my family and everything for my client, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
