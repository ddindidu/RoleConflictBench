She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the stress I\u2019d been carrying, but I hesitated, not wanting to burden her. As I started to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a text from the pool manager. I was needed for an extra shift. I agreed, knowing the pool was short-staffed and safety was on my shoulders.\n\nLater, at the pool, I scanned the water, my mind still replaying the unfinished conversation with my wife. Suddenly, I spotted a child in the deep end, flailing where swimming was off-limits. My duty as a lifeguard screamed at me to act, to enforce the rules and ensure the child\u2019s safety. But my thoughts flickered back to home, to the promise of being present and communicative. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
