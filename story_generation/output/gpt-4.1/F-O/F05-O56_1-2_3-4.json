Can you fold it tonight?\u201d I know she\u2019s been picking up the slack all week, and I promised I\u2019d help more. Guilt prickles at me. But right now, I\u2019m standing behind a new client, her eyes fixed on her reflection, lips pressed tight. She finally says, \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I pictured. Is it too late to fix the colour?\u201d My heart sinks. I want to make her happy\u2014my reputation depends on it. But my last appointment ran late, and I\u2019m already behind. If I stay to redo her hair, I\u2019ll get home even later, and the laundry will still be there, maybe with a side of disappointment from my wife. I feel pulled in two directions, both important, both demanding. My hands hover over the client\u2019s hair, my mind racing, caught between the salon\u2019s bright lights and the quiet promise I made at home."}
