The school\u2019s open class was circled in red, a bright, insistent mark. My partner had said, \u201cIt would mean a lot to Jamie if you were there. He\u2019s been talking about it all week.\u201d I remembered Jamie\u2019s hopeful eyes, the way he\u2019d asked if I could come. I wanted to be the kind of step-parent who showed up, who made him feel seen.\n\nBut just as I was about to set the reminder, my phone buzzed again. A new order\u2014custom bookshelves for a client who\u2019d been waiting for weeks. The message was clear: \u201cNeed your material list by noon so we can get started.\u201d I pictured the empty workshop, the stacks of unfinished wood, the pressure to keep business moving. If I didn\u2019t get the order in today, the whole project would be delayed.\n\nMy chest tightened. I could almost hear the echo of Jamie\u2019s disappointment if I missed the open class, and the frustration of my crew if I held up the job. Both needed me, both expected me to be there. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
