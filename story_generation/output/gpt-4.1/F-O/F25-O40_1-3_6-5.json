Tomorrow, I\u2019m supposed to start building custom cabinets for a client who\u2019s been waiting for weeks. Every detail matters\u2014one mistake, and the whole project could fall apart. I know I should be focused, double-checking every measurement, making sure I understand the technical drawings. But from the living room, I hear my stepdad\u2019s voice, quieter than usual, and my mom sighing. I remember how they\u2019ve leaned on me since I moved in, how they expect me to check in, to ask if everything\u2019s okay, to be the glue holding us together. I want to be there for them, to show I care, but the pressure of tomorrow\u2019s job weighs on me. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the family that needs my support, and the work that demands my full attention. I stare at the blueprints, heart pounding, torn between the roles I\u2019m supposed to play, unsure which one to choose tonight."}
