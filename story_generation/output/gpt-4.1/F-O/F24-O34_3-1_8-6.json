My stepbrother, always impatient, was already halfway to the curb, earbuds in, oblivious to the rush of cars. I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHe\u2019s your little brother now. Keep him safe.\u201d At the same time, my screen blinked with a warning: Flight 237 was approaching the sector boundary, and I needed to coordinate with the next controller. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, expecting a prompt handoff. My heart pounded. If I shouted to my brother, I might miss the handoff and disrupt the flow of air traffic. If I focused on the aircraft, I might not reach him in time. Both roles demanded my full attention, both lives depended on me. I felt split in two, paralyzed by the weight of responsibility, torn between the sky and the street."}
