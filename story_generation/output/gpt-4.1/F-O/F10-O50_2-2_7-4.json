Their exhaustion was written in the lines on their faces, and I felt the familiar tug of worry. I wanted to sit with them, listen, maybe make tea and let them talk about whatever was weighing them down. But my phone buzzed\u2014another alert from the factory. The machines I was responsible for had missed their last service window, and now a few were running hotter than they should. If I didn\u2019t get there soon, a breakdown was almost certain, and the whole line could be shut down for hours. My parents needed me to be present, to offer comfort and support, but my job demanded my immediate attention. I stood in the hallway, torn, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role I was supposed to fill first."}
