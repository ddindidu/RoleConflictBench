He barely managed a smile before slumping into the chair across from me. As his brother, I wanted to ask what was really bothering him, to talk openly and clear the air about the argument we\u2019d had last night. I knew he expected me to listen, to treat him with respect, not just as another patient but as family. But as his doctor, I had to focus on his symptoms\u2014sore throat, fever, swollen glands\u2014and prescribe the right medication, nothing more or less. The clinic was busy, and I felt the pressure to be efficient and professional. Yet, I could see in his eyes that he wanted more than a prescription; he wanted to talk, to resolve our misunderstanding. My mind raced, torn between my duty to treat his illness and my responsibility to mend our relationship. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
