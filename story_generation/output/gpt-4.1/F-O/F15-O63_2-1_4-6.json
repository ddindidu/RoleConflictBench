My son darts ahead, weaving between displays, his laughter echoing down the aisle. I know I should call him back, remind him about respecting others and staying close\u2014this is one of those moments to teach him discipline, to be the parent he needs. But my break is almost over, and as a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to be back on the phones exactly on time, even if the call volume is light today. My supervisor is lenient, but I can\u2019t risk being late too often. I glance at my watch, feeling the pressure build. If I stop to correct my son, I\u2019ll be late returning to work. If I rush him along without a word, I miss a chance to teach him right from wrong. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility I feel as a parent, unsure which role to answer first."}
