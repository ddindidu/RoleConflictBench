My daughter had just texted the family group chat, sharing her excitement about her new job. I knew how much this meant to her, and as her parent\u2014and now grandparent to her little ones\u2014I felt the pull to respond quickly, to show my support and keep our family\u2019s connection strong. But just as I started typing a warm reply, my work email chimed. A vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol required me to send a formal acknowledgment within the hour. My manager had emphasized the importance of timely, professional communication with our partners. I stared at the two screens, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart wanted to celebrate with my family, to be present in their joy, but my mind reminded me of my professional responsibilities and the expectations that came with them. I hesitated, fingers hovering over the keyboard, torn between the warmth of family and the demands of my career."}
