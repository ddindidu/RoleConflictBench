I\u2019d promised them all week that I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time. But as I guided the subway through the tunnel, the emergency alarm blared, jolting me back to my other world. The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled in my ear: \u201cMedical emergency in car three. Operator, please respond.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew every second counted for the passenger in distress, and the safety of everyone on board depended on my calm, swift action. Yet, in the back of my mind, I pictured my family waiting, the empty chair at the table, the disappointment in my grandson\u2019s eyes. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014my duty to strangers in need, and my promise to those I love most. I gripped the controls, torn between the call of family and the call of responsibility, not knowing which would have to wait."}
