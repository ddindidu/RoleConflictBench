My partner\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to keep our family secure, to make sure we never missed a payment. I wanted to prove I could be counted on, that I could provide stability for my stepchild and partner. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab safety audit was in three days. I knew the centrifuge was acting up, and the fume hood\u2019s filter needed replacing. If I didn\u2019t fix them, the audit could go badly, putting my research\u2014and my job\u2014at risk. My supervisor expected everything to be perfect, and my team relied on me to keep them safe. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, the fear of letting my family down battling with the anxiety of failing my colleagues. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the numbers, but my mind kept drifting to the lab, to the equipment, to the safety checklists. I stared at the clock, torn between staying home to sort out finances and rushing to the lab to fix what needed fixing, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
