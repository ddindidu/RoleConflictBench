Can you fold it tonight?\u201d I sighed, picturing the mountain of clothes waiting at home, the silent expectation that I\u2019d take care of it after my shift. But as the lunch rush hit, I was back behind the register, pasting on a smile for the endless line of customers. \u201cHi there! How\u2019s your day going?\u201d I chirped, even as my mind wandered to the chores piling up at home. Each customer expected warmth and patience, but my thoughts kept drifting\u2014would I have the energy to fold laundry after standing all day? My husband wanted a partner who shared the load, but my manager needed a cashier who never let stress show. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of home and work pressing on my shoulders, wondering how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s needs."}
