He sniffled, rubbing his nose, and I could see the familiar stubbornness in his eyes. As his brother, I wanted to be patient, to listen, to respect his feelings and not dismiss his worries, even if they seemed minor. But as his doctor, I had to focus on the symptoms, to ask clinical questions, to remain objective and not let our relationship cloud my judgment. He insisted his cold was something more serious, and I could sense his anxiety. I wanted to reassure him as a brother, to comfort him, but I also needed to maintain professional boundaries and not jump to conclusions without evidence. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different. I could feel the tension rising inside, torn between being the understanding brother he needed and the objective doctor he expected."}
