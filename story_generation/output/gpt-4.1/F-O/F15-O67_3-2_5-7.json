As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to make him understand the seriousness of stealing, even if it was just a snack. I wanted to sit him down, talk it through, help him face the store manager and apologize. But my radio crackled, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: a call for an ambulance, a woman with a sprained ankle across town. I was the only driver available. I glanced at my son, his eyes wide and scared, and then at the keys in my hand. The city traffic would be a nightmare, and I was expected to drive safely, no matter how urgent the call felt. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads of my two worlds, torn between the lesson my child needed and the duty waiting for me behind the wheel."}
