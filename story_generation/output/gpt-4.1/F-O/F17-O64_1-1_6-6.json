My smile is automatic, my voice polite and warm\u2014\u201cHow are you today?\u201d I ask, even as my mind drifts elsewhere. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I know it\u2019s probably Mom or Dad. Lately, they\u2019ve seemed tired, quieter at home, and I\u2019ve made it a point to check in, to ask if everything\u2019s okay. I want to be there for them, to show I care, but right now, I\u2019m supposed to be the friendly cashier, focused on the customers in front of me. The next person in line looks impatient, and I feel the pressure to keep things moving, to keep smiling. But my phone vibrates again, and I can\u2019t help but worry\u2014what if they need me? I feel torn, pulled between being the attentive child my parents expect and the reliable cashier my manager and customers count on. My heart pounds as I glance at the screen, wrestling with what I should do next."}
