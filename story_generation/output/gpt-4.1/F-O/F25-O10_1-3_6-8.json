My mind raced through numbers and deadlines, trying to find a solution that would keep the company running. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepdad: \u201cCan you talk? Your mom\u2019s been quiet lately. I\u2019m worried.\u201d I stared at the screen, guilt gnawing at me. I knew they expected me to check in, to be the bridge that kept our patchwork family together. But the supplier was waiting for an answer, and my boss would be furious if I let this deal fall through. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the call against the silent plea from home. I wanted to be there for my parents, to ask if everything was okay, but the numbers and deadlines wouldn\u2019t wait. I felt torn, pulled in two directions, each demanding more than I could give."}
