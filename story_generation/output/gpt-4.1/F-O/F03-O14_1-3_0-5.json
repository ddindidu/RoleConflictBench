Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20148:30 p.m.\u2014and my laptop screen, where the research report blinks with unfinished graphs and half-written conclusions. The journal deadline is tomorrow, and my advisor\u2019s last email still echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need the final data and report by midnight.\u201d I know my parents expect me to check in, to share a little about my week, maybe even call. But my mind is tangled in numbers, results, and the pressure to get everything right. I feel the weight of my parents\u2019 quiet worry, their hope for a simple message, and the relentless demand of my work, where accuracy and timeliness are everything. My fingers hover over my phone, torn between sending a quick reply and diving back into the data. The guilt of neglecting my family tugs at me, but so does the fear of letting my team down. I sit there, caught in the space between son and scientist, unsure which world to answer first."}
