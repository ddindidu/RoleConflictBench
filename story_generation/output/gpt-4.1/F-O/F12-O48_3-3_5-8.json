My parents will be here soon, and the house is a mess.\u201d I glanced around the break room, my mind racing through the list of chores waiting for me\u2014vacuuming, setting the table, making sure everything looked perfect for our guests. I knew how much it meant to him, to both of us, to make a good impression.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, I heard soft sobs from down the hall. Mrs. Carter, one of my patients, had just learned her cancer had returned. She sat hunched in her bed, tears streaming down her face, clutching my hand. She needed me\u2014someone to listen, to comfort her, to just be there in that moment of fear and sadness.\n\nI felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My husband\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my mind, but so did Mrs. Carter\u2019s quiet, desperate sobs. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the home that needed me and the patient who needed me more."}
