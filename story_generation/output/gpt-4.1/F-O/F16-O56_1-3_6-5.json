They mentioned a tense moment at work, and I knew they wanted me to ask more, to show I cared. But my mind kept drifting back to the salon, to the angry client who had stormed in just before closing. She\u2019d hated her cut, her voice echoing through the nearly empty shop, demanding a fix. I could still feel the tension in my shoulders, the pressure to make her happy, to not let her leave dissatisfied. Now, at home, I was expected to be open, to share and listen, but all I could think about was whether I\u2019d handled the client well, if my boss would be upset, if the woman would leave a bad review. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine for connection, but I felt split in two, torn between the demands of my job and the need to be present in my marriage."}
