My younger sister nudged me, grinning, \u201cYou have to come this time. No work excuses.\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of their expectation, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d finally be present, not just physically but really there. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the plant: the external inspector had flagged a critical safety issue. If I didn\u2019t address it immediately, operations could be shut down, and the team would be in trouble. My mind raced with the technical details, the urgency, the responsibility. But across the table, my family waited, eyes bright with anticipation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to keep people safe at work, and my longing to be the sibling they could count on. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the demands of my job and the promise of a simple weekend together."}
