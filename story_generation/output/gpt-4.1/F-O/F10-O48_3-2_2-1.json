He winces, and I steady him, careful not to pull too hard on his arm. The phone vibrates again\u2014probably my mom, checking in like she does every morning. She expects me to reply quickly, to tell her how my day is going, to reassure her that I\u2019m okay. I glance at the clock. I haven\u2019t messaged her since last night. Guilt prickles at me; I know she worries if I don\u2019t respond.\n\nBut Mr. Lee needs me now. He\u2019s shivering, and I need both hands to help him into his robe. My mind races: if I stop to text my mom, I\u2019ll leave Mr. Lee exposed and uncomfortable. If I wait, my mom will worry, maybe even call the nurse\u2019s station. I feel torn, pulled between the daughter who never lets her parents down and the nursing assistant who can\u2019t let her patient down either. My heart pounds as I try to decide which role to answer first."}
