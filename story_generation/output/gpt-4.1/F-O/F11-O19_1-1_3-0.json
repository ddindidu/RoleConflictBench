My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and my sister was already texting friends about a picnic. They all looked at me, waiting for my input, expecting me to join in and help make the plans work. I wanted to be there, to laugh and relax with them, but my mind kept drifting back to the pharmacy. Just this morning, I\u2019d double-checked a prescription for a common cold\u2014something routine, but I knew how important it was to get every detail right. The weight of responsibility pressed on me; one mistake could mean real harm. My phone buzzed with a message from my manager, reminding me of the weekend shift and the need for extra vigilance due to a recent uptick in errors. My family\u2019s voices blurred as I tried to focus, torn between the warmth of home and the duty I owed my patients. I felt the tension knotting in my chest, caught between being the sister they needed and the pharmacist I had to be."}
