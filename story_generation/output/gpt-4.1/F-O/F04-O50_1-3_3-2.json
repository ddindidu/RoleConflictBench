My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d join in this time. I could feel my mother\u2019s expectant gaze, silently urging me to be present, to be the brother who laughs and plans and belongs. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a message from the hospital: \u201cICU device failure\u2014critical. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew what that meant\u2014lives depended on my skills, my ability to diagnose and fix the machine before it was too late. But here, at this table, my family needed me too.
