But as I glanced over, I saw my wife curled up, eyes red and distant. She\u2019d barely spoken all day, and I could feel the weight of her crisis pressing down on both of us. She needed me here, to listen, to hold her hand, to just be present. My mind raced\u2014should I run out now and get the supplies, or stay by her side like she needed? The expectations tugged at me from both directions: be the reliable cleaner, be the supportive husband. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both at once, feeling the pressure build with every passing minute."}
