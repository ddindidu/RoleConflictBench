As a software developer, I knew how important it was to show initiative and collaborate with other teams, especially when new features were on the table. The session was technically optional, but I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s input to make this product great.\u201d \n\nBut my family had just gathered in the living room, voices warm and insistent, reminding me that this weekend was the annual family tradition\u2014an event my grandparents cherished and my parents expected me to uphold. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being there,\u201d my mother had said, \u201cit\u2019s about honoring who we are.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I missed the session, would my team see me as less committed? If I skipped the family gathering, would I be letting down generations of expectations? My chest tightened as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, torn between the legacy I was born into and the career I was building for myself."}
