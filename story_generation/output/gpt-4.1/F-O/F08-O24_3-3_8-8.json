She handed me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of this case. My mind raced, trying to recall the details of the new ruling, knowing I had to halt proceedings and review the law immediately. At that moment, another message flashed on my phone\u2019s screen: my daughter, frantic, saying my grandson was in crisis and needed me. My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I was expected to be present, to comfort, to call, to show my family they could rely on me. But as a judge, I was expected to remain impartial, to stay current with the law, to ensure justice was served without delay or distraction. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unforgiving of neglect. I stood frozen, torn between the courtroom\u2019s silent expectation and my family\u2019s desperate need, unsure which duty I could bear to set aside."}
