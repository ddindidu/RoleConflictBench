The house had to be spotless\u2014she was counting on me to help make a good impression. My phone buzzed. It was a customer, texting about a package I was supposed to deliver this morning. \u201cWhere is my order? I need it urgently.\u201d At the same time, a notification popped up: the package was delayed at the depot, and I\u2019d have to call the customer to explain. I could hear my wife sighing, the vacuum still untouched. My mind raced\u2014should I step outside to make the call, risking her frustration, or ignore the customer for now and help at home, risking a complaint at work? Both sides expected me to be present, responsible, and calm. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my job and my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
