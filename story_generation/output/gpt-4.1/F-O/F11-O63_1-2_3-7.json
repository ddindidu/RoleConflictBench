My little brother nudged me, asking if I\u2019d join them for a hike on Saturday. Mom looked at me expectantly, her eyes hopeful that I\u2019d finally say yes and spend some time with them. I wanted to be there, to laugh and share stories, to be the sister they missed during my long work hours.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my break was almost over. Management had sent another email this morning, warning us that every minute away from the phones was being tracked. The queue was always full, and I knew if I was late, it would be noticed. I felt the pressure of my job, the need to be reliable, to not let my team down. Yet, the warmth of my family\u2019s voices pulled at me, making me ache for the simple joy of being present with them. My heart pounded as I glanced between the clock and my family, torn between the demands of my job and the longing to be a good sister."}
