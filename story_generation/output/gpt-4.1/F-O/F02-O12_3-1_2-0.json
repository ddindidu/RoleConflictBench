We request your presence to discuss the matter.\u201d I knew I had to be there for him, to understand what happened and show him that I cared, but as I glanced at my open laptop, the lines of code blurred before my eyes. I was in the middle of a tricky module, one I\u2019d been meaning to refactor for weeks. The deadline was generous, but I\u2019d promised myself\u2014and my team\u2014that I\u2019d finally clean it up today. \n\nMy mind raced with questions. What would I say to my son? How could I help him make things right? At the same time, I felt the weight of my professional standards pressing down on me. If I left now, the code would stay messy, and I\u2019d be letting my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my son down. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat frozen, torn between the father my son needed and the developer I wanted to be."}
