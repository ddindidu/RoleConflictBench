The production outage is my fault\u2014a bug I missed, now locking out thousands of users. My manager\u2019s message is terse: \u201cNeed you on this ASAP.\u201d I know what\u2019s expected. I\u2019m the one who has to fix it, no matter how late it gets. But then I hear my child\u2019s excited footsteps. \u201cDid you get the Nintendo, Dad?\u201d Their eyes are wide with hope. I\u2019d promised, after all. I want to keep that promise, to see their face light up, to be the parent who provides not just stability, but joy. But the outage means I might be working all night, and the money I\u2019d set aside for the Nintendo might have to go toward extra childcare if this keeps happening. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my child\u2019s trust, my team\u2019s reliance, the need to be present at home and indispensable at work. My hands tremble as I hover over the keyboard, torn between two urgent needs, knowing I can\u2019t give both what they deserve."}
