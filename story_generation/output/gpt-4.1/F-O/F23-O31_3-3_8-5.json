As a step-parent, I promised my partner and stepdaughter that I\u2019d keep us afloat, that we\u2019d never lose this house. Every dollar mattered, every overtime shift counted. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014dispatch was calling. There was a violent assault happening downtown, bystanders in danger, and I was the closest unit. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the extra shift at the security job I\u2019d picked up, the one that would help cover the loan. But if I ignored the call, people could get hurt, and I\u2019d be failing as a police officer. The expectations of both worlds crashed together inside me, each demanding everything I had. I stared at the phone, torn between the family I\u2019d sworn to protect and the city that counted on me."}
