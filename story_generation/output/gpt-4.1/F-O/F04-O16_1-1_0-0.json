As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I be there, cheering her on, sharing in her joy. But as I was about to leave the clinic, a patient walked in, coughing and sniffling, complaining of what seemed like a common cold. As a doctor, I couldn\u2019t just brush off his symptoms; I had to be thorough, run the necessary tests, and make sure it wasn\u2019t something more serious. My phone buzzed with messages from my sister, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting my presence, my patient needing my attention. Torn between the duty to my sister and my responsibility as a doctor, I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, unable to ignore the pull of either side."}
