My daughter\u2019s message popped up first: \u201cMom, don\u2019t forget our family call tonight! Everyone\u2019s excited to see you before the holiday.\u201d I could almost hear my grandchildren\u2019s laughter, the warmth of their voices a comfort I cherished. But then, the taxi app chimed in\u2014my next passenger, Mr. Lee, was already waiting, his messages growing more insistent: \u201cPlease hurry, I can\u2019t be late!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family expected me to be present, to keep our tradition alive, to show I cared. But Mr. Lee expected professionalism, punctuality, the reliability that kept my ratings high and my income steady. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart tugged in two directions, wondering how I could possibly be the grandmother my family needed and the driver my passenger demanded\u2014all at the same time."}
