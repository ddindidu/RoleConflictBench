The beach was packed, high tide rolling in, and every instinct told me to stay alert\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I knew it was Jamie. She\u2019d been anxious all morning, wrestling with that big decision at work, and she needed me. She needed my reassurance, my advice, my voice telling her she could do it. I could almost hear her voice trembling, see her pacing our living room, waiting for me to answer. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for her, to give her the support she deserved. But every second I looked away from the water, every moment my attention drifted, I risked failing the people who depended on me here. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I felt torn, caught between the pull of the waves and the call of the person I loved most."}
