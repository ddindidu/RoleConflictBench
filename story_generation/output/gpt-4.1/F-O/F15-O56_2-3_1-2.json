The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in thirty minutes, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for days, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Mom?\u201d But just as I was about to slip out, the door chimed and in swept the bride and her entourage, all nerves and excitement. The bride\u2019s hands trembled as she clutched her bouquet, her mother shooting me a pleading look. \u201cWe\u2019re early, but we\u2019re so worried about the timing,\u201d she whispered. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me\u2014make them feel special, calm their nerves, help their day go perfectly. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the school. I stood frozen, torn between the little girl waiting for me in her classroom and the anxious bride in my chair, both needing me in different ways, both expecting me to be fully present. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once."}
