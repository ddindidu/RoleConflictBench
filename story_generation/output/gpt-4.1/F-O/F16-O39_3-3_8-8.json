We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about whether we could afford the treatment the doctor recommended. I knew I owed them honesty, that we had to lay everything out on the table\u2014no secrets, no half-truths. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a message from the site foreman. I was needed at work, and as soon as I arrived, the evacuation alarm blared through the air. Protocol was clear\u2014drop everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. But my spouse was still waiting for answers, for reassurance, for the open conversation we promised each other. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of the job and the equally urgent need to be present at home. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
