The house was a mess, and she expected me to help scrub the floors, dust the shelves, and make everything spotless. I could hear the urgency in her voice, and I knew how much it meant to her that everything be perfect. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. I was already running late for the job site, where my boss had stressed the importance of punctuality and following every safety protocol. If I rushed, I might skip steps and put myself or others at risk. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my spouse down and risk a tense, uncomfortable visit. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family at home and the responsibility to my crew at work. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, mop in the other, not knowing which role to answer first."}
