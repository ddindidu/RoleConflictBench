It was the school, again. My heart sank as I listened to the message: my son had been caught bullying another kid, and they needed me to come in right away. I could almost hear the disappointment in the principal\u2019s voice, and I pictured my son sitting in the office, waiting for me to show up and make things right. But here, at the site, the foreman had just reminded us how one slip could send someone to the hospital. If I left the spill, someone could get hurt. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the parent who didn\u2019t show up when my kid needed me most. My hands shook as I weighed the hard hat in one hand and my car keys in the other, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart."}
