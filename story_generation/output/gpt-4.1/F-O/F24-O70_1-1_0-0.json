The address was just a few blocks away, but the package had arrived at the depot later than usual. My supervisor\u2019s message was clear: \u201cCustomer expects it ASAP. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d I grabbed the box and headed out, but as I passed the living room, I saw my stepbrother hunched over his textbooks, his hands shaking. He looked up, eyes rimmed red. \u201cCan you sit with me for a bit? I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d My heart twisted. I knew how much he needed someone right now\u2014Mom always said we had to look out for each other, especially during tough times. But the clock was ticking, and I could already imagine the customer\u2019s complaint if I didn\u2019t deliver soon. I hovered in the doorway, torn between the weight of my uniform and the silent plea in my brother\u2019s eyes, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
