I really need you.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was in ten minutes, but the call queue was empty, and the supervisor had said we could be flexible today. As a brother, I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my scheduled breaks, even if things were slow. If I took my break early, I\u2019d be bending the rules, risking a warning, maybe more. My heart pounded as I stared at her message, torn between the urge to support my sister and the responsibility to follow work protocol. I could almost hear her voice, shaky and needing comfort, but I could also picture my supervisor\u2019s disappointed look if I left my station early. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, phone in hand, caught between being the brother she needed and the employee I was supposed to be."}
