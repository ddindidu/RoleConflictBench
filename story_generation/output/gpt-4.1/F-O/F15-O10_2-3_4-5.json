It\u2019s an email from the tax authority\u2014urgent, flagged, and ominous. My heart sinks as I read the subject line: \u201cImmediate Response Required: Tax Discrepancy.\u201d As an accountant, I know the gravity of this. I\u2019m expected to respond quickly, to ensure everything is in order, to protect my client and my own reputation. But before I can even open the email, I hear laughter and the slap of sneakers on linoleum. My son is darting between displays, weaving dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. Other shoppers are starting to stare. As a parent, I\u2019m supposed to teach him discipline, to correct him now, to show him right from wrong. My mind races\u2014do I pull him aside and risk the tax issue escalating, or do I answer the email and let his wildness go unchecked? The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I feel myself torn in two."}
