Miss you.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014already past noon on Saturday. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, just sent a quick text last Sunday. Guilt prickles at me, but my laptop screen is filled with the floor plan for the new office project. The deadline is Monday, and I\u2019m still struggling to fit in enough collaborative spaces without sacrificing private work areas. My mind races with measurements and circulation paths, but Mom\u2019s message tugs at me. I know she wants to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to feel like I\u2019m still her daughter even as I chase my career. I want to call her, to reassure her, but every minute away from my design feels like a risk. My heart aches with the pull in both directions\u2014between the family that raised me and the work that defines me. I stare at my phone, torn, the cursor blinking on my screen and my mother\u2019s words echoing in my mind."}
