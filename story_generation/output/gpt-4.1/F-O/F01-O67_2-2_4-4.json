My daughter had baked a cake, and everyone was gathered, waiting for me to say a few words. I felt the warmth of their expectation, the pride in their faces. Just as I opened my mouth, my radio crackled to life\u2014dispatch calling. There was a woman nearby who had fallen and broken her arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on duty. I could hear the urgency in the dispatcher\u2019s voice, the expectation that I would respond immediately, provide care, and get her safely to the hospital. My granddaughter\u2019s smile faltered as she saw my face change. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family needed me here, to celebrate and be present. But someone out there needed my skills, my calm hands, and my care. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the love in my home and the duty on the streets, not knowing which way to turn."}
