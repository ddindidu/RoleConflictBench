He needed me, really needed me, and I could hear the tremor in his voice when he called. He was unraveling, and I was supposed to be his anchor, the one person he could count on to be there, to listen, to reassure him that things would be okay. But as I sat in the van, the high-value package on the seat beside me, my work phone buzzed with reminders: \u201cPackage must be delivered in person. Recipient\u2019s ID required. No exceptions.\u201d My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014this delivery was non-negotiable, and any mistake could cost me my job. I felt the weight of the package and the weight of my husband\u2019s pain pressing down on me at the same time. My heart ached to rush home, to hold him, to be the wife he needed. But my hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my job and the promise I made to the person I love most."}
