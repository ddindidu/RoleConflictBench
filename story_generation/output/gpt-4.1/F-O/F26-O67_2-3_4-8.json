The whole family was gathered, waiting for me to say something, to share in the joy. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down\u2014an emergency call.

My daughter squeezed my hand, silently pleading for me to stay, just this once, to be the grandparent they needed. But I could already picture the patient, fighting for every breath, depending on me to navigate the storm safely. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations against the cold urgency of my duty. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me."}
