The workshop on the new prescription guidelines was in full swing, and the speaker\u2019s words about patient safety and updated protocols echoed in my mind. I knew how important it was to stay current, to be the pharmacist my patients and colleagues relied on. But as I scribbled notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids from school\u2014early dismissal today.\u201d My mind flashed to their eager faces, waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for me. I could almost hear their voices, feel their disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there. The expectation to be a present, dependable mother pressed against the professional demand to keep learning, to not fall behind. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions. My pen hovered over my notepad, my thoughts tangled between duty and love, as I tried to decide which part of me should take the lead this time."}
