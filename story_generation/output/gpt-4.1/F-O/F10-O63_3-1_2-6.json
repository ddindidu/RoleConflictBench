Did you eat lunch?\u201d she wrote, expecting the usual quick reply and a rundown of my morning. As a daughter, I knew how much these daily updates meant to her\u2014our little ritual of staying close, even when I was busy. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break at the scheduled time, not whenever I felt like it, even if the call volume was light and supervisors were lenient today. I stared at the screen, torn. If I replied now, I\u2019d be late logging my break, risking a gentle reminder from my supervisor about following protocol. If I waited, Mom would worry, maybe even call, thinking something was wrong. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart tugged in two directions, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
