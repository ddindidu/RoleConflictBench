The procedure was strict\u2014every cent had to be accounted for, every form filled out, no shortcuts. My manager had drilled it into me: mistakes could cost me my job. Just as I was about to start the final count, my phone buzzed. It was a text from my sister: \u201cCan you come? I really need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week, and we\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. My heart twisted. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking store policy and risking my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my sister down when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I stared at the cash, then at my phone, feeling the impossible pull from both sides, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
