It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart squeezed. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t ask unless she truly needed me. I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours until the safety audit. The memory of last month\u2019s warning about our equipment flashed through my mind. If I didn\u2019t fix the issues now, the lab could face serious consequences, and my team was counting on me to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nBut the thought of my granddaughter, possibly alone and worried, tugged at me. She needed my guidance, the kind only a grandmother could give, shaped by years of experience and love. Yet, the scientist in me felt the weight of responsibility, the expectation to ensure everyone\u2019s safety and uphold the standards I\u2019d worked so hard to maintain. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent needs of my family and my professional duty, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
