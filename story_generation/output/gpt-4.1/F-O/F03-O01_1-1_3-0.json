It was a tradition passed down for generations, and I knew how much it meant to her. But my mind kept drifting back to the blueprints spread out in front of me. As an architect, I\u2019d noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the new community center\u2019s design\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to nag at my conscience. My supervisor had brushed them off, urging me to sign off so the project could stay on schedule. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s trust on one side and my professional responsibility on the other. If I delayed the project to address the issues, I\u2019d miss the family gathering and disappoint everyone. But if I ignored the flaws, I\u2019d be betraying the standards I\u2019d sworn to uphold. My heart pounded as I stared at the plans, caught between the pull of tradition and the demands of my profession."}
