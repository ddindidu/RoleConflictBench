My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, when my cell buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But the sales dashboard glared at me, the numbers still short of the target. If I stopped now, I\u2019d let my team down\u2014and maybe cost us all. If I ignored my sister, I\u2019d break the trust we\u2019d built over years. My headset pressed against my ear, the office noise faded, and I stared at my phone, torn between the voice of my family and the demands of my job, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
