My stepdaughter darts between displays, giggling, her sneakers squeaking on the linoleum. I\u2019m supposed to be on my scheduled break, but the call center\u2019s automated system is ruthless\u2014if I\u2019m late clocking back in, even by a minute, I\u2019ll get flagged. Still, I can\u2019t ignore her wild energy. I\u2019m her step-parent, and I promised her mom I\u2019d teach her right from wrong, that I\u2019d help her grow into a kind, respectful person. But if I stop to correct her now, I\u2019ll risk my job. My supervisor\u2019s already warned me about my \u201cunreliable\u201d break times. I watch her weave dangerously close to a pyramid of apples, my heart pounding. I know I should call her over, kneel down, explain why we walk in stores, not run. But my phone buzzes\u2014thirty seconds left. I\u2019m torn, caught between the voice in my ear demanding punctuality and the little girl who needs my guidance. My hand hovers over the \u201cclock in\u201d button, my eyes on her, my mind racing."}
