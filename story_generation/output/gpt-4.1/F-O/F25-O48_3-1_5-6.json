It would mean so much to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important these traditions were to them, how much they wanted me to be part of the family, to show I belonged. But as I tucked my phone away, Mrs. Carter, my patient, looked up at me with watery eyes. \u201cCould you stay a little longer?\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d been so quiet all morning, and I knew she needed someone to talk to, someone to just be there. My supervisor expected me to give each patient the time and care they deserved, especially those who felt alone. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family needing me to step up, to prove I was one of them, and Mrs. Carter needing me to simply sit and listen. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be enough for both."}
