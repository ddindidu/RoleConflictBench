My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me for input. As their sister, I knew how much it meant to them that I joined in, especially since I\u2019d missed the last few gatherings. I tried to focus, but my phone buzzed with a new email. Glancing at the screen, my heart sank\u2014a notice from the tax authority. There was a discrepancy in a client\u2019s file, and they required an immediate response. As an accountant, I knew the importance of addressing this right away; ignoring it could mean penalties for my client and trouble for the firm. My family\u2019s laughter and chatter faded into the background as I stared at the email, torn between the warmth of being present with them and the cold urgency of my professional responsibility. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move in either direction."}
