My daughter had called earlier, her voice warm and expectant, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to baking cookies together. I could almost hear their laughter echoing through the kitchen already. But as I closed the call, my work email pinged\u2014again. The subject line read: \u201cURGENT: Users Experiencing Critical Errors.\u201d My heart sank. The QA team had flagged several bugs, and users were growing frustrated. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need you on this, ASAP.\u201d\n\nI stared at my laptop, the code editor open, error logs scrolling endlessly. My mind raced with possible fixes, but my thoughts kept drifting to the family photos on my desk. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my stories. My team expected my expertise, my focus, my solutions. I could feel the tension building inside me, a silent tug-of-war between the grandmother my family needed and the developer my team depended on."}
