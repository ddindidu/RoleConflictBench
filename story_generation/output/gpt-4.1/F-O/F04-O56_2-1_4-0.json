Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, expecting me to show up, to be present, to laugh and share stories with everyone. I wanted to be there, to be the brother who never misses a family moment.\n\nBut as I swept up hair from my last client, the bell above the salon door jingled. Mrs. Lee walked in, her familiar smile brightening the room. She always asked for me, always said I made her feel at home. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes searched for me, expecting the usual warm greeting and our little chat before her appointment. I felt the weight of her expectation, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d make her feel special, just like always.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between the back room and the front desk, torn by the pull of family and the loyalty of a client. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, and I could feel the pressure mounting as I tried to decide where I belonged most in that moment."}
