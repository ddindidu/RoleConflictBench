My phone buzzed in the cup holder\u2014right on time, as always. It was Sunday, the day I called my parents to check in, to hear about their week, to reassure them I was doing fine. I could already imagine my mother\u2019s gentle voice, my father\u2019s questions about my work. They counted on these calls, and so did I, in a way.\n\nBut I was on the job, and even though my passenger wasn\u2019t in a rush, I knew the rules: no distractions, keep my eyes on the road, make sure every ride was safe and professional. The company expected it, and so did my passengers. My hand hovered over the phone, torn between the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices and the responsibility of the steering wheel. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart thudded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
