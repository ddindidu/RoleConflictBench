It was nearly noon, the time I always called my parents. Every week, without fail, I updated them on my life, listened to their stories, and made sure they were doing well. They looked forward to these calls, and so did I. But today, the foreman had just reminded us that a safety inspection was about to start, and everyone needed to be present and on time in the work area. Missing it could mean a warning or worse, and I knew how important it was to follow every protocol to keep the site safe. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the call. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my parents waiting for my voice, the team counting on my presence. I felt torn, the pressure building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
