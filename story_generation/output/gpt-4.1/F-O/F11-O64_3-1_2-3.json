That\u2019s when she called, her voice shaky, asking if I could come over\u2014she needed to talk, really talk, about something that had been weighing on her. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, but as I finished the count, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register. It wasn\u2019t much, just a few dollars off, and it didn\u2019t affect the total sales. Still, store policy was clear: every discrepancy had to be reported and investigated, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to be thorough and honest, to follow every procedure to the letter. But my sister was waiting, needing me, and I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d drop everything to support her. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between being the reliable sister she counted on and the responsible cashier my boss trusted. My hands hovered over the register, my phone buzzing again in my pocket, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
