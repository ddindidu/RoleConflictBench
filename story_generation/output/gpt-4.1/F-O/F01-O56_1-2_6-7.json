The holiday was just a few days away, and everyone was making plans\u2014my daughter wanted to know if I\u2019d bring my famous pie, my grandson was asking if I\u2019d help him with his model train. I felt a pang of guilt; I hadn\u2019t replied in hours, and I knew how much it meant to them that I stay involved, especially around the holidays.\n\nBut right now, I had a client in my chair, her hair damp and sticking to her forehead after a workout. She looked at me expectantly, waiting for the usual wash and condition before her cut. I could see she was in a hurry, glancing at her watch, probably squeezing this appointment in before her next meeting. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, but my mind was with my family, torn between the warm pull of their expectations and the immediate needs of my client. The pressure built inside me, the weight of being needed in two places at once, and I stood there, caught between the roles that defined me."}
