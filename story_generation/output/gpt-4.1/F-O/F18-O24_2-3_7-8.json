My heart pounded\u2014he trusted me to look out for him, to keep him safe, and I wanted to shout for him to stop. But my phone buzzed insistently. In the courtroom, I was Judge Carter, and my clerk\u2019s urgent message flashed: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent I was using in my jury instructions.
