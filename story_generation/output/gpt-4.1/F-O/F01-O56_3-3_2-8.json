The buildup was worse than usual, and I knew I\u2019d need extra time to wash and condition before I could even think about cutting. My client glanced at her watch, clearly in a hurry, and I felt the pressure to work quickly and efficiently, as any good hairdresser should. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be struggling. As a grandfather, I was expected to be her rock, to listen and offer the wisdom she needed. But right now, my client expected my full attention and skill. I stared at the phone, torn between the chair and the child, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which role to answer first."}
