He grinned at me, his helmet askew, and shouted, \u201cWatch this!\u201d My heart thudded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But I was also on the clock, sweat already soaking my shirt from hauling bricks all morning. My supervisor had just told me to move a heavy stack of unused tiles to the far side of the site before the end of the day. If I didn\u2019t get started now, I\u2019d be behind, and I couldn\u2019t afford another warning. Jamie\u2019s foot hovered over the board, ready to launch down the steep, uneven ramp. I could see the loose gravel, the jagged edge. If I left him alone, he could get hurt. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be shirking my job. My hands clenched, torn between the weight of responsibility for my brother and the pressure to keep my job. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, as Jamie called my name again."}
