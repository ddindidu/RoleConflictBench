The school had sent a reminder: open class was tomorrow at 2 p.m. My stepson, Ethan, had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I knew how much it meant to him, especially after everything he\u2019d been through. But on my desk, a thick stack of trial notes waited, the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded still fresh in my mind. The parties were anxious for a decision, and the law required my written judgment\u2014clear, detailed, and timely. Thirty days was the deadline, but everyone expected it sooner. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: Ethan\u2019s need for my presence, the court\u2019s demand for my diligence. I wanted to be the parent he could count on, but I was also the judge who couldn\u2019t let justice wait. My hands trembled as I tried to plan, torn between the classroom and the courtroom, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
