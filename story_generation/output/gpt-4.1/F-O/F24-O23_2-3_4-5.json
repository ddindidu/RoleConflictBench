It was my stepmom\u2019s birthday, and everyone expected me to be there, to laugh, to share stories, to show that I was part of this family. I could almost hear my dad\u2019s voice: \u201cIt means a lot to your stepmom. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d But my mind kept drifting back to the thick file on my desk\u2014the jury trial starting tomorrow. My client\u2019s future was on the line, and I was their only hope. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. I needed to spend every spare moment preparing, reviewing evidence, anticipating the other side\u2019s moves. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations. If I missed the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe widen the gap I\u2019d worked so hard to close. But if I went, I\u2019d risk being unprepared for court, letting down a client who trusted me. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, unsure which demand I could afford to ignore."}
