He darted between aisles, giggling and weaving dangerously close to other shoppers. As his step-parent, I knew I should step in\u2014teach him about respect, boundaries, and behaving in public. But just as I reached for his shoulder, my phone buzzed. A ride request. I glanced at the screen: the passenger was already waiting outside, sending impatient messages about being late for an important meeting. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be prompt and professional, never keeping a customer waiting. My heart pounded. Should I stop and discipline Liam, risking a bad review and losing a fare? Or should I rush him out, ignoring the teachable moment, just to keep my job secure? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of a good parent and a reliable driver, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
