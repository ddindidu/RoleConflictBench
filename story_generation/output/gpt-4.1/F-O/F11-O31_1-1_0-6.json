My heart skipped when I recognized the license plate\u2014it was my sister\u2019s. She\u2019d texted me earlier, bubbling with excitement about her big promotion and inviting me to celebrate after my shift. I knew she\u2019d rushed here, probably not even noticing the sign in her excitement. As a sister, I wanted nothing more than to support her, to let this slide and join her in her joy. But as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, treating everyone equally, even family. My radio crackled, reminding me of my duty. I felt the weight of the ticket book in my hand, the pressure of my badge on my chest, and the ache in my heart as I wrestled with what was right\u2014for my job, and for my sister."}
