My mother\u2019s voice trembled as she recounted her worries about Dad\u2019s health, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I nodded, trying to listen, but my mind kept drifting to the articles I needed to read\u2014new legal theories that could impact my next case. As a judge, I was expected to stay sharp, always current, never behind. But as a daughter, I was supposed to be present, to offer comfort and strength. My mother\u2019s hand reached for mine, her grip warm and pleading. I felt the weight of her need, but also the pressure of my professional duty. The clock ticked, each second a reminder that I was failing someone, no matter what I chose. My heart ached with the impossibility of being both the daughter she needed and the judge I was expected to be."}
