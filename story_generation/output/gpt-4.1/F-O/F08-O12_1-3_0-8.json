Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when you started something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see she needed reassurance, a story, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. My heart ached to give her all the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years.\n\nBut just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed urgently. Slack messages piled up: \u201cProduction is down. Users can\u2019t log in. Can you look at the code?\u201d My chest tightened. I knew the outage was traced to a bug I\u2019d pushed earlier. The team was waiting for me to fix it\u2014customers were locked out, and every minute counted.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter, her hopefulness, her need for guidance. I looked at my screen, the frantic messages, the responsibility pressing down. Both worlds tugged at me, each expecting me to be fully present, to solve, to comfort. I felt split in two, caught between the wisdom she needed and the crisis only I could resolve."}
