He\u2019d just snapped at his younger sister, and I knew I needed to step in, to teach him about respect and kindness\u2014values I promised myself I\u2019d instill as his step-parent. But my phone buzzed insistently. The courthouse clerk\u2019s message flashed on the screen: the bail hearing had ended, and the defendant was waiting in a holding cell. I was expected to draft and sign the release order immediately, outlining every condition with precision. The law demanded clarity and thoroughness, and any delay could mean hours more in custody for someone who might not deserve it. My stepson\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for guidance, while the weight of the court\u2019s expectation pressed on my shoulders. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the child who needed my attention and the justice system that demanded my focus. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which role to answer first."}
