Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014my break is in three minutes, but the call queue is still packed. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to take my break exactly on schedule, not a minute before or after. Management watches everything, and I can\u2019t risk another warning. But as a child, I know Mom worries if I don\u2019t reply. She expects me to check in, especially on weekends. I stare at my phone, feeling the pressure build. If I text her now, I\u2019ll be breaking the rules and risking my job. If I wait, I\u2019ll disappoint her again. My thumb hovers over the screen, torn between the demands of my family and the strict expectations at work, my heart pounding as I try to decide what to do."}
