He asked about my day, his eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I knew he wanted me to open up, to share the stress that had been building inside me. As a wife, I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014to communicate honestly, to let him in. But my mind kept drifting to the looming deadline at work. The company\u2019s quarterly tax filing was due next week, and as the lead accountant, I was responsible for ensuring every detail was perfect, every regulation followed. The pressure was immense; mistakes weren\u2019t an option. I wanted to tell him everything, to lean on him, but I worried that voicing my anxiety would only add to the tension at home. My roles pulled me in opposite directions\u2014one demanding openness, the other requiring unwavering focus and composure. I hesitated, caught between the urge to confide and the need to maintain control, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
