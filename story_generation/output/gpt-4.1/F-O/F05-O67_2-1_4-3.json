Just as I loaded the washer, my phone buzzed. It was dispatch, reminding me that I was scheduled for a routine check of the ambulance\u2019s first-aid kit. Supplies had to be accounted for, nothing missing or expired\u2014lives could depend on it. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. If I left now, the laundry wouldn\u2019t be done in time, and I\u2019d be letting my family down. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as an ambulance driver, risking the safety of future patients. My mind raced, torn between the expectations at home and the responsibility I carried at work, both demanding my immediate attention. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that needed me, unsure which to choose."}
