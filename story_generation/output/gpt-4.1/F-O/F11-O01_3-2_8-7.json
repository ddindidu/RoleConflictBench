We\u2019d argued last night\u2014something about her feeling I never listened, that I was always too busy. I knew I should call her back, talk it through, show her I cared enough to resolve things. But my laptop pinged with another email from the contractor. The site was behind schedule, and if I didn\u2019t respond now, the whole project could slip further. My team expected me to be on top of every detail, to keep things moving smoothly. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my sister\u2019s voice in my head, asking for respect and understanding, and the relentless demands of the job, where every minute counted. My heart pounded as I hovered between the call and the email, torn by the fear of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
