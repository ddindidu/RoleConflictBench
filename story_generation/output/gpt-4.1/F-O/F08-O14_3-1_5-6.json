My grandson had a fever that wouldn\u2019t break, and they needed me to come over. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be there, to comfort and help, to be the steady presence my family expected. But as I glanced at my calendar, a knot formed in my stomach. The lab\u2019s quarterly maintenance was due tomorrow. I was the only one certified to check the autoclave and recalibrate the fume hood. The equipment was running smoothly, but protocol demanded my attention\u2014safety couldn\u2019t be compromised, not even for a day. My lab manager had already reminded me twice this week.
