My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that his parents and siblings would arrive in a few hours. The house needed to be spotless, the food prepared, and every detail perfect. I could feel the weight of his expectation\u2014this was my role as a wife, to make our home welcoming and to share the load of hosting.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the contested motion was scheduled for the afternoon. My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I was their last hope. As their lawyer, I was expected to be fully prepared, sharp, and present in court. There was no room for distraction or delay.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds\u2014should I be scrubbing the bathroom or reviewing case law? The pressure built in my chest, a tightness that made it hard to breathe. I wanted to be everything for everyone, but the demands were pulling me apart. I stood frozen, torn between the kitchen and my briefcase, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both roles what they deserved."}
