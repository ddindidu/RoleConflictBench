It was a message from my stepbrother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re leaving for the family trip in an hour. Mom says you can\u2019t miss it this time.\u201d I looked up just as the site-wide evacuation alarm blared, echoing off the steel beams. My foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d My heart pounded. I knew the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays, everyone\u2019s safety depended on it. But my family had been planning this holiday for weeks, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to finally show I was part of them. I could already imagine my stepmom\u2019s disappointed face if I didn\u2019t show up, the awkward silence at dinner. But if I left the site now, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, letting my team down, maybe even risking my job. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. I stood frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the buzzing phone, not sure which direction to run."}
