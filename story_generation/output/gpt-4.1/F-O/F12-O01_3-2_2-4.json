My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my husband. He was in the bedroom, struggling with the weight of his father\u2019s illness, needing me close, needing to talk. I could hear the muffled sound of him pacing, the heaviness in his footsteps. My heart ached to go to him, to hold his hand and listen, to be the anchor he needed right now. But the deadline for the office project loomed. My team was waiting for my revisions, and the client expected a layout that would transform their workspace. Every line I drew, every decision about light and flow, felt like a test of my skill and dedication. I wanted to be the architect who delivered, who didn\u2019t let her team down. But I also wanted to be the wife who was present, who didn\u2019t turn away when her partner was hurting. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the plans on my screen and the person I loved just a room away."}
