The buildup is worse than I expected, and I know I\u2019ll need extra time to wash and condition before I can even think about cutting. My mind drifts to the home loan repayment looming in two months. Every client, every tip, every minute counts right now. I promised myself I\u2019d pick up extra shifts, maybe squeeze in a few more appointments each week, just to make sure we\u2019re covered. But here I am, running behind schedule, knowing that if I take the time this client\u2019s hair really needs, I\u2019ll fall behind for the rest of the day\u2014and maybe lose out on another walk-in. Yet, if I rush, I risk doing a poor job, losing her trust, and maybe her future business. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: be the reliable provider my family needs, or the attentive professional my clients expect. I can feel the pressure building, my hands pausing for a moment in her hair, caught between what I owe my family and what I owe my client."}
