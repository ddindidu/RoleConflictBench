Shouts echoed through the air, and I scanned the crowd, searching for signs of trouble. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my sister: \u201cI\u2019m here. I need you.\u201d My heart clenched. She\u2019d confided in me last night about her struggles, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, no matter what. But now, she was somewhere in this crowd, vulnerable and scared, while my duty demanded I remain impartial, focused on keeping order. My sergeant\u2019s voice barked orders through my earpiece, reminding me of the responsibility I carried as an officer. Yet, the thought of my sister alone and frightened pulled at me with equal force. I felt torn, the expectations of my badge and my family colliding inside me, each demanding loyalty, each impossible to ignore."}
