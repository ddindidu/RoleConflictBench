My hands moved automatically, but my thoughts were elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my son: \u201cCan we get the Nintendo today, Mom? You promised.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up, but the price tag echoed in my mind. Rent was due soon, and groceries were running low. As a mother, I wanted to give him everything, to make him happy and feel secure. As a pharmacist, I needed to stay focused, to ensure every pill I dispensed was correct\u2014one mistake could cost someone dearly.
