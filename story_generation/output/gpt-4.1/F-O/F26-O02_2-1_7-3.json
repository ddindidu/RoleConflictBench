My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call tonight? Jamie started her new job and wants to tell you all about it!\u201d I smiled, picturing my granddaughter\u2019s eager face, but my eyes drifted back to the audit schedule pinned to my monitor. The audit was months away, but the new safety regulations were dense, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get ahead on the documentation this week. My team relied on me to set the standard, to catch every detail before the auditors did. Yet, my family expected me to be present, to celebrate milestones and nurture those bonds.
