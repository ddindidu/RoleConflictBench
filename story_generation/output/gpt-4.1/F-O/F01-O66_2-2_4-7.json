She wanted the whole family there tonight, and I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. My daughter smiled, grateful I was making the effort to be present. Just as I was about to leave for the living room, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent ride request. Two travelers at the train station needed a taxi, and they had a mountain of luggage. They sounded desperate, and I knew the station was short on cabs tonight. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being reliable, never turning down a fare, especially when people were counting on me. But as a grandfather, I could see the hope in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes, waiting for me to say I\u2019d be there. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the duty to my passengers and the promise to my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
