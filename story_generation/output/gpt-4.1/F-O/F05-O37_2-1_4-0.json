But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my supervisor at the cleaning agency. \u201cClient inspection today. Make sure the lobby and lounge are spotless.\u201d My shift started in an hour, and I knew they expected every surface to gleam, every cushion to be perfectly fluffed. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I focused on the laundry, I\u2019d be late for work and risk a warning. If I left the laundry, my wife would have to scramble, and I\u2019d feel like I was letting her down. My mind raced, torn between the expectations at home and the demands of my job. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, the hum of the washing machine and the distant vacuum cleaner both calling for my attention."}
