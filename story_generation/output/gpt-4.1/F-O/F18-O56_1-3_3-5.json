My sister wanted to go hiking, my brother suggested a movie night, and my mom was already planning a big dinner. I felt the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being included in these simple moments. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the time\u2014just a few minutes before my shift at the salon ended. I was already thinking about how I\u2019d rush home to join everyone.\n\nBut then, as I was sweeping up hair clippings, a client stormed up to my station, her voice sharp and loud. She hated her haircut, she said, and demanded I fix it immediately. The other stylists were packing up, the lights were dimming, and I could feel the weight of her anger pressing on me. I knew I was expected to stay calm, listen, and make things right, no matter how late it got. My family was waiting, expecting me to be there, but my client needed me too. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, torn by the demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
