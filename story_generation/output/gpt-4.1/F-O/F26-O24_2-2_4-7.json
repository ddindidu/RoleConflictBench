I want you in the front row.\u201d My heart swelled; I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, and the whole family was gathering to celebrate her big moment. But as I tucked the invitation into my pocket, my phone buzzed with an urgent email from my clerk. An attorney in tomorrow\u2019s case had just cited a brand-new appellate decision\u2014one that could change the entire direction of the trial. I was expected to review it thoroughly before court resumed in the morning. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the eager anticipation of my family, the professional duty to uphold justice. I could feel the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, knowing that both roles demanded my full presence, and tonight, I could not give it to both."}
