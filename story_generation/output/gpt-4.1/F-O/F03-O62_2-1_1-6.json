It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mom waits for my update, my dad asks about my week, and I ask about theirs. Tonight, I\u2019m on lifeguard duty, perched on my chair, phone pressed to my ear, trying to sound present while scanning the pool. My mom\u2019s voice is warm, but I can hear the hope in her tone, wanting me to linger, to share more. I want to give her that comfort, to be the attentive son she expects.\n\nBut as I listen, I spot a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, no adult in sight. My training kicks in: I\u2019m responsible for their safety, and I know I should intervene immediately. My supervisor expects vigilance, not distraction. My heart pounds as I juggle the phone, torn between reassuring my mom and enforcing the rules. I can\u2019t do both at once. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility to let down."}
