Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food already, and I knew how much it meant to everyone that I\u2019d be there. Family dinners were rare these days, and missing one always left me feeling guilty, like I was letting them down. But as I glanced at the delivery app, a new order popped up\u2014an urgent package, the kind that required a photo confirmation at the doorstep. The address was across town, and the customer had left strict instructions: \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave the package unattended for long.\u201d My boss had been clear\u2014no mistakes, no missed deliveries, or I\u2019d risk losing my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable sibling at the dinner table, or the dependable delivery person who never lets a package go astray. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which one I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
