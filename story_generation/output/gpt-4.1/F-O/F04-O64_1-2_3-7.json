The line stretched past the bakery, and I could feel the impatience growing. My phone buzzed in my pocket for the third time in ten minutes. I knew it was my sister\u2014our family group chat had been blowing up all morning about weekend plans. Mom wanted everyone\u2019s input, and Dad was already suggesting a hike. I was expected to chime in, to be present, to show I cared about our time together. But here I was, stuck at work, expected to be cheerful and attentive to every shopper, no matter how rushed or tired I felt. My mind tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family\u2019s laughter and the pressing need to keep the line moving, to not let my personal life seep into my professional smile. I glanced at my phone again, heart pounding, torn between typing a quick reply and focusing on the next customer\u2019s order."}
