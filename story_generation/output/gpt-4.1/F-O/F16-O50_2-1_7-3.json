I knew I should ask what was wrong, listen, and share my own worries too\u2014after all, we promised to be open with each other. But my mind kept drifting to the upcoming shutdown at work. Next week, every machine in the plant would be silent, and I was responsible for their maintenance and cleaning. It was the only window to get everything running perfectly again, and any mistake could mean costly delays. My supervisor had already reminded me twice how critical this was.\n\nMy spouse glanced up, catching my distracted look. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d they asked softly. I wanted to reach out, to be present, but the weight of both roles pressed on me. I felt torn\u2014my partner needed me to listen and share, but my thoughts were tangled with checklists and repair schedules. The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words and the ticking clock counting down to next week\u2019s shutdown."}
