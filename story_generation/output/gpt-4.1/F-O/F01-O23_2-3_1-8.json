They\u2019d pressed hard, trying to coax out details I was bound by oath to protect. My mind spun with the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the rules of confidentiality etched deep into my conscience.

I could see he needed guidance, the kind only a grandfather could give\u2014gentle wisdom, a listening ear, reassurance that things would be okay. But my mind was still tangled in legal knots, the pressure of the case gnawing at me. I wanted to be fully present for him, to offer the comfort he sought, but the demands of my profession clung to me, refusing to let go. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my undivided loyalty. My heart ached as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
