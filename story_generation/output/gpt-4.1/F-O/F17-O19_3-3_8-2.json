She looked at me, her eyes searching for reassurance, for the kind of comfort only a child could give. I wanted to hold her hand, to tell her everything would be okay, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the high-risk chemotherapy prescription was waiting at the pharmacy. I knew the patient\u2019s life depended on my focus and precision\u2014one slip, one distraction, and the consequences could be devastating. My heart ached as I listened to my mother, feeling the weight of her vulnerability, but my mind raced with calculations and protocols.
