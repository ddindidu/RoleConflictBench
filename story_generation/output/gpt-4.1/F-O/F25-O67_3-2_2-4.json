I knew it was my stepdad\u2014he always texted around this time, wanting to know how my day was going, expecting a quick reply and maybe a photo of my lunch. It was our routine, a way to keep close, especially since Mom passed. But as I stepped out, the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled in my earpiece: \u201cPatient is conscious but in severe pain. Suspected fracture.\u201d I grabbed the medical kit, my mind split in two. My stepdad\u2019s message blinked insistently, but the woman on the porch was pale and clutching her arm, her face twisted in agony. I was supposed to be present for both\u2014reassuring my family with words, and this stranger with care. My hands shook as I knelt beside her, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to text back, to keep that fragile connection alive, but I couldn\u2019t look away from the pain in front of me.
