The hearing was minor, just a procedural matter, and I knew I could ask for a postponement if I had to. But I\u2019d promised my client I\u2019d be there, and as their lawyer, I was expected to show up, prepared and professional, no matter how small the issue. \n\nThen my phone buzzed with a text from my stepbrother: \u201cHeading home, see you soon!\u201d I glanced up and saw him across the street, earbuds in, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart lurched. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, especially since our parents trusted me to watch over him after school. \n\nI was torn, rooted to the spot, my mind racing. Should I dash across the street and shout his name, risking missing the hearing and letting down my client? Or should I stay, trusting he\u2019d be okay, and fulfill my professional duty? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
