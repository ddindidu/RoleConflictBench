They\u2019d just come home, voice trembling, describing the impossible choice their boss had handed them. \u201cI just need to know you\u2019re here for me,\u201d they whispered, reaching for my hand. I squeezed it, but my mind was already drifting. Earlier that day, a thick case file had landed on my desk\u2014routine, but the hearing was in two weeks, and I prided myself on being thorough. I knew I should start reviewing it tonight, get ahead before the docket filled up. But now, my partner needed me, needed my undivided attention, my comfort, my advice. I felt the weight of the robe I\u2019d left hanging in my office, the silent expectation that I\u2019d always be prepared, always diligent. My heart ached as I tried to focus on their words, but the file\u2019s presence loomed in my thoughts. I wanted to be the spouse they deserved, but the judge in me whispered about duty and discipline. I sat there, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
