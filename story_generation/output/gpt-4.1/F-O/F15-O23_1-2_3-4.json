My daughter sits at the kitchen table, her face crumpled in frustration over a spilled glass of milk. She\u2019s waiting for me to guide her, to help her clean up and remind her gently about being careful and responsible. I know this is one of those moments\u2014teaching her patience, honesty, and how to handle mistakes. But my phone buzzes again. The courthouse is twenty minutes away, and my client\u2019s hearing is in less than an hour. They\u2019re counting on me to be sharp, prepared, and fully present to argue a motion that could change the course of their case. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My daughter\u2019s eyes search mine for reassurance, while my mind races through legal arguments and case law. I want to be the parent she needs, but I can\u2019t ignore the professional duty that demands my focus. My hands tremble as I reach for a towel, torn between comforting my child and the urgent need to leave."}
