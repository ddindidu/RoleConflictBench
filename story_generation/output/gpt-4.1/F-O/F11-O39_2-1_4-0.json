She\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family dinners were rare these days, and I knew how much it meant to Mom for all of us to be together, especially since Dad passed. I promised I\u2019d be there, but as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my supervisor called out, \u201cHey, can you move those bricks to the back lot before you clock out? We need the space clear for tomorrow.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight settle on my shoulders. The pile was bigger than I expected, and I knew it would take at least an hour, maybe more, after my shift ended. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for dinner, maybe miss it entirely. If I left on time, I\u2019d let my team down and risk my supervisor\u2019s trust. My hands tightened around the handle of the wheelbarrow, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility of my job, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
