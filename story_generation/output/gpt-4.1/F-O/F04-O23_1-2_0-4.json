I can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and our family planned a surprise party. As her brother, I knew how much this meant to her\u2014she\u2019d always been there for me, and I wanted to show her the same support.\n\nBut as I glanced at my calendar, my heart sank. The court had just scheduled a crucial hearing for my client at the same time. The case was hanging by a thread, and my client was counting on me to argue a contested motion that could make or break their future. As their lawyer, I was expected to be fully prepared and present, ready to fight for their interests.\n\nI felt torn in two. My family expected me to be the supportive brother, celebrating my sister\u2019s milestone. My client needed me to be the dedicated advocate, standing by them in court. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself paralyzed, unable to choose without letting someone down."}
