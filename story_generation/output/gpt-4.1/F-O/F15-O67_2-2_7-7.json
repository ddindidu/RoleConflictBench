The dispatcher\u2019s voice still echoed in my ears: \u201cNon-life-threatening injury, but get there as soon as you can.\u201d I glanced at the clock on the dashboard, calculating the overtime pay I\u2019d earn if I finished this shift quickly. My family needed that money\u2014groceries, rent, the kids\u2019 school fees. Every extra hour counted, and I felt the weight of their needs pressing on my chest.\n\nBut as horns blared and impatient drivers cut in front of me, I remembered the training drilled into me: safety first, always. The expectation was clear\u2014no matter the urgency, I couldn\u2019t risk an accident, not with the ambulance, not with my own life, not with the lives of others on the road. My foot hovered over the gas pedal, torn between the urge to speed up and the responsibility to drive carefully. The city lights blurred past, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, caught between the demands of my family and the duty of my job."}
