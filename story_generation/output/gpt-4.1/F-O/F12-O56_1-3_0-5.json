My husband\u2019s text buzzed on my phone: \u201cRough day. Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I knew he\u2019d want to talk, to unwind, and I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like a good wife should. But just as I was about to close up the salon, a client stormed in, her voice sharp and accusing. \u201cThis cut is nothing like what I asked for!\u201d she snapped, drawing the attention of everyone left in the shop. My heart pounded. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and I knew I had to fix it, to make her feel heard and valued\u2014my reputation depended on it. But every minute I spent here was a minute I wasn\u2019t with my husband, offering the comfort he needed. Torn between soothing a client and supporting my partner, I felt the tension knotting in my chest, unsure which role to answer first."}
