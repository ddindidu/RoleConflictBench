She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt caring for my father after his recent surgery. She needed me\u2014her son\u2014to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But my phone buzzed with an urgent notification: an emergency motion had just been filed, and as the presiding judge, I was required to review the documents and make a ruling within the hour. My mind raced. My mother\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, and I could see how much she needed comfort. Yet the law demanded my focus, my impartiality, my undivided attention. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. I wanted to reach out and hold her hand, but my eyes kept darting to the files, knowing that lives could be affected by my ruling. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the expectations of a devoted son and the duties of a responsible judge."}
