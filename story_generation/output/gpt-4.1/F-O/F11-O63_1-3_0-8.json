Can you come to the celebration lunch at noon?\u201d My heart swelled with pride. As his sister, I knew how hard he\u2019d worked, and I wanted nothing more than to be there, cheering him on, just like he\u2019d done for me so many times before. But as I glanced at the clock, my stomach tightened. My lunch break as a telemarketer wasn\u2019t until 1:30, and the automated compliance system at work was ruthless. Even a minute off schedule could mean a warning or worse. I stared at my headset, the blinking light signaling another call, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected me to show up, to celebrate, to be the supportive sister I always promised I\u2019d be. My job demanded strict adherence to the schedule, no exceptions, no flexibility. I sat frozen, torn between the joy of my brother\u2019s achievement and the fear of risking my job, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do."}
