My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. I could already picture my son\u2019s anxious face, the disappointment in his teacher\u2019s eyes, and the unspoken expectation that I would show up, listen, and help make things right. But as I reached for my bag, my laptop chimed\u2014a reminder about the merger contract. My client\u2019s future hinged on my review; if I didn\u2019t catch the risky clauses before the deadline, they could lose millions. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My child needed his mother, present and understanding. My client needed their lawyer, sharp and vigilant. I could almost hear both voices calling for me, each certain that their need was the most urgent. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which door to walk through first."}
