I knew I should call him back, remind him about respecting others and behaving properly in public. That\u2019s what a good parent\u2014step or not\u2014should do. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, the special alert tone from the control center. I glanced at the screen: a message about an aircraft approaching the sector boundary, routine but requiring my immediate coordination. My mind split in two. The expectation to guide my stepson, to teach him right from wrong, pressed on me. At the same time, the responsibility to keep airspace safe, to respond quickly and communicate with my colleagues, weighed just as heavily. I could see the disapproving glances from other shoppers, feel the urgency in the message on my phone. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of the supermarket aisle and the invisible highways above."}
