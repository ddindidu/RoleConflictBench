My phone buzzed with messages from my project manager, each one more urgent than the last. The client was waiting for my time estimates\u2014without them, the contract couldn\u2019t move forward, and the whole team was stalled. I knew I had to focus, analyze every detail, and give an answer I could stand by. But across from me, my spouse waited, eyes searching mine. We\u2019d agreed to talk tonight\u2014about our finances, about the health scare that had shaken us both. They needed me to be present, to share honestly, to listen and be heard. I felt the weight of their expectation, the need for trust and openness. My mind raced between the numbers on my screen and the words I needed to find for this conversation. I could feel the tension building inside me, pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
