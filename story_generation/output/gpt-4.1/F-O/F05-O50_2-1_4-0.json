My wife had mentioned, more than once, that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, and I\u2019d promised to help out tonight. As I loaded the washing machine, my phone buzzed with a message from the plant manager: \u201cThe old press is acting up again. Can you come in? We can\u2019t afford downtime, even if it\u2019s slow.\u201d I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I was expected to be a reliable partner, sharing the load so our family ran smoothly. At work, I was the go-to problem solver, the one who could coax stubborn machines back to life. Both needed me now, and I could already sense the disappointment that would follow whichever path I chose. My hands hovered over the laundry basket, my mind racing, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the urgent call of the factory floor."}
