Today was the open class at my daughter\u2019s school, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. But here I was, perched on my lifeguard chair, scanning the pool. A few swimmers drifted toward the deep end, nothing alarming yet, but I knew my job demanded constant vigilance. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning: \u201cNo distractions, not even for a minute.\u201d I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, asking if I\u2019d see her read her poem. My heart twisted. The school was only ten minutes away. If I left now, I could make it in time. But what if something happened while I was gone? The weight of both uniforms\u2014parent and lifeguard\u2014pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the armrest, torn between the pool and the classroom, my mind racing with the consequences of either choice."}
