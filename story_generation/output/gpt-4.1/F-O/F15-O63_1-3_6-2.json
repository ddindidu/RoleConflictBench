My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flicker in my mind\u2014he\u2019s been counting down the days until I buy him the Nintendo I promised. I know how much it means to him, and I want to keep my word, but the bills on the counter remind me that every sale matters. Suddenly, my screen flashes: a call connects. The customer\u2019s voice is sharp, accusing, demanding to know why our offer is legitimate. My training kicks in\u2014I need to stay calm, answer every question, and not lose this sale. But my thoughts keep drifting: if I don\u2019t close enough deals, there\u2019s no Nintendo, maybe not even enough for groceries. My son\u2019s trust, my job\u2019s demands\u2014they pull me in opposite directions. My heart pounds as the customer\u2019s voice rises, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose which expectation to meet first."}
