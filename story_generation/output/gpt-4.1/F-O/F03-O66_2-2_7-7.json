As soon as I walked in, I noticed how tired my mom looked, her eyes rimmed with worry, and my dad barely managed a smile. They tried to hide it, but I could feel the heaviness in the room. I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer comfort\u2014be the son they needed right now. But my phone buzzed: a ride request. Two travelers, standing at the curb with a mountain of suitcases, waved me over. They needed help loading their bags and wanted to split the fare, expecting patience and professionalism. I glanced back at my parents, torn. They needed me, but so did my job. My heart ached as I stood in the doorway, wrestling with the impossible choice between being a good son and a reliable taxi driver."}
