My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the relatives would arrive in just a few hours and the house still looked like a whirlwind had passed through. I could hear the vacuum running, the clatter of dishes, the expectation in every word: we had to get this right, together. Then the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts\u2014an elderly woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on call. My uniform hung by the door, ready for moments like this. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the duty to my patients, who needed me calm and competent, and the promise I\u2019d made to my spouse to share the load at home.
