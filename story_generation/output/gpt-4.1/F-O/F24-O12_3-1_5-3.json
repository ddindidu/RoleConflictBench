Product had scheduled it for next Friday, right in the middle of the day. Attendance was \u201coptional,\u201d but I knew how these things went\u2014if you weren\u2019t there, your ideas didn\u2019t get heard, and you risked being left out of the loop for the next sprint. My manager had already nudged me, saying my input was valuable for the new feature set.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom wants everyone at the cabin for the holiday weekend. She\u2019s really hoping you\u2019ll come this year.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his voice, the unspoken plea to be part of the family, to not be the one who always had a reason to stay away. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in\u2014my family wanting me present, my team wanting my expertise. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
