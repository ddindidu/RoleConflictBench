It was our usual route home, and I always kept an eye out for him, especially since he tended to get lost in his own world. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my project manager, reminding me about the informal planning session happening in ten minutes. They needed my input on the timeline, and I knew my estimates would shape the next few weeks of work. I glanced at my brother, who was chattering about his day, and then at the phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I stopped to join the call, I\u2019d have to let him walk the last few blocks alone, something our parents had always warned against. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my team down, possibly throwing off the whole project schedule. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility of keeping my brother safe and the expectation to be a reliable engineer. I slowed my steps, heart pounding, caught in the middle of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
