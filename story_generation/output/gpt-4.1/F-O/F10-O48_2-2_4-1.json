It\u2019s tradition.\u201d Lately, my family has been insistent that I help keep our customs alive, especially after my grandmother\u2019s passing. I promised I\u2019d be there, knowing how much it means to them. But as I entered Mrs. Lee\u2019s room, I saw her struggling to sit up, her face pale from the pain of her recent surgery. She needed extra time and gentle care to get dressed and ready for breakfast. My supervisor reminded me that Mrs. Lee\u2019s recovery depended on careful, unhurried assistance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectation to honor our traditions, and my duty to my patient, who needed me now more than ever. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the pull of home and the responsibility in front of me, unsure how I could possibly meet both demands."}
