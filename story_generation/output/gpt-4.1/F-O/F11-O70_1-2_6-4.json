He\u2019d been looking forward to this outing all week, and I\u2019d promised him we\u2019d spend more time together. As his sister, I knew how much it meant to him to be included, especially since he often felt left out when I got busy with work. But the delivery was for a moderately valuable item, and company policy required me to get a signature upon delivery\u2014no exceptions. If I delayed, I risked missing the recipient and failing my job\u2019s expectation to secure the package and confirm delivery. If I left Sam behind, I\u2019d be breaking my promise and possibly hurting the trust we\u2019d been working to build. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility I owed my brother and the duty I owed my job. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
