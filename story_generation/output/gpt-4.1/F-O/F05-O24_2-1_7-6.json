As her husband, I felt the urge to sit beside her, to ask what was wrong, to listen and share my own worries from the day. We\u2019d promised each other to always communicate openly, especially when life felt heavy. But just as I was about to speak, I caught sight of the thick law review journal on the counter. The latest issue had just arrived, and as a judge, I was expected to stay current with every new legal development. The articles inside could shape my next ruling, and I knew I needed to read them before tomorrow\u2019s session. I stood there, torn between the duty to my marriage and the demands of my profession, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me. My heart ached to be present for her, but my mind raced with the urgency of my judicial responsibilities. I hesitated, caught in the silent struggle between the roles I was expected to fulfill."}
