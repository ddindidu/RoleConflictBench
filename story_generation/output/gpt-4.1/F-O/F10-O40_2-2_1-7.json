I knew it was Sunday\u2014my day to call Mom and Dad, to tell them about my week and listen to Dad\u2019s stories about his garden. I could already hear Mom\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, sweetheart.\u201d But Mrs. Lee hovered nearby, her voice tight with worry. \u201cDo you think you can finish today? We\u2019re having guests tomorrow.\u201d The deck was worse than I thought; it would take hours to fix, maybe all afternoon. I glanced at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I called my parents now, I\u2019d lose precious daylight and risk disappointing a client. If I waited, I\u2019d break the promise I made to my family, the one that kept us close despite the miles. My hands tightened around the hammer, my heart caught between the pull of home and the demands of my craft, wishing I could split myself in two."}
