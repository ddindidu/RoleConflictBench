This was the window I\u2019d been waiting for, the one chance to run my experiment and gather the data that could make or break my research\u2014and my funding. I was already mentally preparing the equipment checklist when my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt, how Dad\u2019s health was getting worse, and how she didn\u2019t know what to do. She reached for my hand, searching my face for comfort, for the kind of support I\u2019d always tried to give her as her child. I felt her need pulling at me, but my mind kept drifting to the lab, to the experiment that couldn\u2019t wait. I wanted to be the child she needed, but I also needed to be the scientist my work demanded. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me right now."}
