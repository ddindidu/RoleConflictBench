I wanted to reach out, to ask if they were okay, to offer the comfort I knew they needed. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message from the hospital\u2014my patient, Mrs. Lee, had just received her diagnosis and was waiting for me to explain what it meant for her life. I could picture her anxious face, the way she clung to every word I said, desperate for reassurance and clarity. My parents needed me to be present, to listen and support them, but my patient needed me to be calm, clear, and empathetic, to answer her questions and guide her through uncertainty. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart aching with the weight of both responsibilities, unsure how to be the child my parents needed and the doctor my patient deserved."}
