She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than just a routine answer. I wanted to tell her about the notice at work\u2014the optional training session next week that could help me move up, maybe even get off the site and into a supervisory role someday. But the training was after hours, and I knew she\u2019d been hoping we could finally spend an evening together, just the two of us, after weeks of missed dinners and late nights. At work, the guys expected me to show up, to be part of the team, to prove I was serious about my job. At home, my wife expected honesty, openness, and time\u2014things I was running short on. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my words caught somewhere between wanting to be a better husband and needing to be a better worker. I hesitated, unsure which expectation to meet, as she waited for me to speak."}
