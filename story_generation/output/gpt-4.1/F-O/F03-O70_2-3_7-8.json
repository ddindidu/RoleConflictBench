Can you come home early?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. My parents had been looking more worn out lately, and I knew they needed me\u2014not just to help around the house, but to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But just as I was about to reply, my work phone buzzed. A customer was calling, her voice tense: \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? It was supposed to arrive an hour ago.\u201d I checked the tracking system and felt my stomach drop\u2014the package was delayed, maybe even misplaced. I tried to keep my tone calm and professional, but my mind was racing. My parents needed me to be present, to show I cared. My job demanded I stay composed, solve the problem, and keep the customer satisfied.

My heart pounded as I stared at both phones, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more at that moment."}
