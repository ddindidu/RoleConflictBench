My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and they needed me at the hospital. As a grandmother, I knew my place was by their side, offering comfort and support, holding my daughter\u2019s hand, and soothing my grandson\u2019s fears. But as I glanced at the weather data streaming across my laptop, my heart pounded for a different reason. The atmospheric conditions I\u2019d been waiting for all year had finally arrived\u2014just as predicted, but so rarely realized. My team was ready at the lab, waiting for my signal to begin the experiment that could make or break our research. The funding review was next week, and without this data, years of work might be dismissed. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s need pressing against the urgency of my scientific responsibility. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which call to answer first, feeling the impossible pull of love and duty."}
