My son sits across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dribbling down his chin. I know I should pause and remind him gently about wiping his mouth, about sitting up straight, about saying \u201cplease\u201d when he asks for more cereal. These are the moments I\u2019m supposed to shape him, to teach him the little things that add up to good character. But my mind is tangled in the code I\u2019m writing\u2014there\u2019s a function that could be cleaner, a module that needs refactoring. The deadline isn\u2019t pressing, but I want to do it right, to leave something tidy for my team. I feel the pull from both sides: the urge to close the laptop and focus on my son, and the itch to keep typing, to make the code as perfect as I can. My son looks up, waiting for my attention, and I hover between two worlds, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
