My partner\u2019s son, Jamie, was in the next room, humming as he built a model rocket. The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow. I knew I had to ensure we didn\u2019t miss it\u2014my partner trusted me to keep us afloat, to be the reliable adult Jamie could count on. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the journal submission deadline was tomorrow. My team was counting on me to finalize the report and datasets, to uphold the integrity of our research. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I focused on the loan, I\u2019d risk submitting sloppy work and letting my colleagues down. If I poured myself into the report, I might miss a crucial step in our financial planning. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the family I was building and the career I\u2019d worked so hard for."}
