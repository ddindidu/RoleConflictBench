My shift as a delivery driver is almost over, but I still have one last package in the back\u2014an expensive-looking box that needs to be left at a customer\u2019s doorstep. The address is across town, and the sun is already dipping low. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a message from my son: \u201cAre you getting the Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I remember his hopeful eyes this morning, and the guilt tugs at me. I want to keep my promise, to see his face light up, but the store closes soon, and I can\u2019t risk leaving this package unattended or late. My job is what keeps our bills paid, but my son\u2019s happiness feels just as urgent. I grip the steering wheel, torn between the responsibility to my employer and the promise I made to my child, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I try to decide which expectation I can afford to let down."}
