The family gathering was something I\u2019d promised not to miss\u2014my daughter\u2019s gentle reminders echoing in my mind, \u201cDad, the kids miss you. They want you there.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter, feel the warmth of little arms around my neck. But my phone buzzed again, the project manager\u2019s name flashing on the screen. The hospital\u2019s final inspection was tomorrow, and I was the lead architect. If I didn\u2019t double-check the fire escape plans and sprinkler systems tonight, I\u2019d risk overlooking something critical. Lives could depend on my diligence. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the present, loving grandparent my family needed, or the responsible architect whose attention to detail could save strangers\u2019 lives. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself pulled apart, unable to silence the guilt no matter which way I turned."}
