A message from my sister popped up: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week, and as her brother, I always tried to be there for her. Supporting each other was something we\u2019d promised after our parents passed away. But tonight was also the only chance to attend the workshop on the new prescription guidelines\u2014something my manager had stressed was crucial for our team. Missing it would mean falling behind, maybe even letting my patients down if I wasn\u2019t up to date. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the duty to my family and my responsibility as a pharmacist. I could hear my sister\u2019s voice in my head, shaky and vulnerable, but I also pictured my patients, trusting me to give them the best advice. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, unable to move."}
