He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d I could picture my son\u2019s hopeful face, the way he\u2019d hugged me last night, asking if I\u2019d really remember. I wanted to keep that promise, to see his eyes light up, to be the dad he could count on. But just as I was about to leave, the plant manager\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, urgent and sharp: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bearing screeching on Line 3. If it goes, we\u2019re down for hours. We need you now.\u201d \n\nMy toolbox felt heavier than usual as I hesitated, torn between the shop floor and the toy store. The company was counting on me to keep production running, to avoid costly downtime. My family was counting on me to keep my word, to bring home a little joy. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart racing as I stood frozen, caught between the promise I\u2019d made to my son and the responsibility I owed to my job."}
