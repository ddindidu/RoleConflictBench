I really need you right now.\u201d I could hear the strain in his words, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. As his sister, I always promised to be there, to listen and help him through anything. But just as I was about to call him, my work phone rang. It was a customer, her voice sharp and impatient, asking about the status of her delivery. As a delivery person, I was expected to be calm, polite, and professional, no matter what. I could feel my brother\u2019s need tugging at me, but the customer\u2019s demand pressed just as hard. My heart pounded as I stared at both phones, torn between comforting my brother and fulfilling my job\u2019s expectations. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt trapped, knowing that whichever choice I made, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
