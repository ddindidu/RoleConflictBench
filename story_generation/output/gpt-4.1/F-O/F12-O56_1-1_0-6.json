My husband\u2019s voice lingered in my mind\u2014he\u2019d just called, mentioning a rough day at work. He didn\u2019t sound upset, but I could tell he needed me to listen, maybe offer a few comforting words. I wanted to be there for him, to show I cared, but my client was already at the door, smiling and chatting as she sat in my chair. She told me she\u2019d just washed her hair, and it looked and smelled fresh. Still, the salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. I could feel her expectation that I\u2019d skip the wash, just this once. My phone buzzed with a message from my husband, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. I was torn\u2014between the rules of my job and the comfort my client wanted, between the support my husband needed and the professionalism my work demanded. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind racing, caught between being a good wife and a good hairdresser."}
