She needed me to be present, to share everything\u2014no holding back, no half-truths. My phone buzzed on the table, a reminder that my break was almost over. Back in the control tower, pilots depended on me for clear, immediate instructions. As I returned to my headset, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My mind was still tangled in the conversation with my wife, the weight of her expectations pressing on me. I knew I had to respond to the pilot, but my thoughts were split. My wife needed my full attention and honesty, but so did the pilots in the sky. The demands of both roles pulled at me, each expecting my undivided focus, and I felt the tension rising as I hovered between two worlds, unable to give either what they truly needed."}
