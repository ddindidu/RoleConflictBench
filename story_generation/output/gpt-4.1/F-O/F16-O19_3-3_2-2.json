Their words were heavy with fear and sadness, and I knew they needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my reassurance. I wanted nothing more than to rush home, hold them, and promise that everything would be okay.

My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my partner\u2019s trembling voice on the phone, the sterile vials and syringes in front of me. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on my chest. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both needed me now, in ways that felt impossible to reconcile."}
