My stepmom chimed in, reminding me how important it was for the whole family to be together, especially since I\u2019d missed the last gathering. I could almost hear the disappointment in her words, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d finally fit in.\n\nBut at the same time, my work phone vibrated. The operator at the factory was calling again\u2014third time today. He kept adjusting the machine settings, ignoring my previous instructions, and now the material waste was piling up. My supervisor expected me to guide him, to prevent further losses, and to be available for urgent troubleshooting.
