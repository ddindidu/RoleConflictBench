The team was still in the early stages, tossing around ideas, and I knew my input could shape the direction we\u2019d take. My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. I remembered the promise I\u2019d made to my daughter\u2014to stay connected, to be present, to show interest in the lives of those I love. Yet, the engineer in me felt the pull of innovation, the urge to sketch out a new approach before the inspiration faded. My heart ached with the weight of both roles: the grandfather who should call and share in her joy, and the engineer who should seize this creative moment. I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of family and the thrill of invention, feeling the tension rise as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor first."}
