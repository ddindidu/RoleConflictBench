As an architect, I knew the layout for my new studio had to be practical\u2014every inch mattered, and I was determined to get it right. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder from my sister about her graduation dinner tonight. She\u2019d worked so hard, and as her brother, I was expected to be there, to celebrate her achievement and show her how proud I was. \n\nYet, the deadline for the renovation plan loomed, and my client was counting on me to deliver a functional design by tomorrow morning. My mind raced between the two worlds: the warmth of family, the pride in my sister\u2019s eyes, and the cold, logical lines of the studio layout demanding my attention.
