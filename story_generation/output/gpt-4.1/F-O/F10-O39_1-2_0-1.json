I know it\u2019s probably Mom or Dad, just checking in like they always do on weekends. I haven\u2019t replied to their last message yet, and I can almost hear Mom\u2019s gentle voice in my head, \u201cJust let us know you\u2019re okay, sweetheart.\u201d But the carpenter is waving at me, impatience clear on his face. He needs the next load of lumber now, and if I slow down, the whole crew will be waiting. My hands are rough and splintered, and I can\u2019t just drop everything to text. But if I don\u2019t answer soon, my parents will worry, maybe even call. I feel torn, the weight of the lumber matched only by the guilt pressing on my chest. I want to be a good daughter, to reassure them, but right now, I\u2019m needed here, and the work won\u2019t wait. My phone buzzes again, and I freeze, caught between two worlds, not sure which one to let down."}
