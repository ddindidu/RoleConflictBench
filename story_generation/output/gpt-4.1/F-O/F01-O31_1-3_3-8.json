My daughter had called twice already, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to seeing me. I could almost hear their laughter, feel their small hands tugging at my sleeve, begging me to play. But as I poured my morning coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the station. The court needed my testimony tomorrow, the same day as the gathering. I knew how important my statement was; justice depended on it, and as a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity, to be there when called. Yet, the thought of disappointing my family, especially my grandkids, gnawed at me. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms\u2014one blue, one invisible\u2014pressing down on my shoulders. I sat at the table, coffee cooling, heart heavy, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty and love."}
