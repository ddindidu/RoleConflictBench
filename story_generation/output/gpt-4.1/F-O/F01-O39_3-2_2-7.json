It was my grandson, his voice trembling, asking if I had a moment. He needed advice\u2014something about a fight with his best friend, and he sounded lost, desperate for the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give. My heart ached to be there for him, to offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to reassure him that things would be okay. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the safety briefing was about to start. Missing it would mean breaking site protocol, letting my team down, and possibly risking my job. The foreman had made it clear: everyone must be present, no exceptions. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my coworkers. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
