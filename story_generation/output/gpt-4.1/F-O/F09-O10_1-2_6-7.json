My inbox pings\u2014a client wants clarification on a line item from their latest invoice, and I know I need to respond quickly and professionally. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a message from my son: \u201cMom, are we getting the Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I remember the look of excitement on his face when I said yes, but I also know our budget is tight this month. As an accountant, I\u2019m expected to be precise and responsive, keeping our clients satisfied and our business running smoothly. As a mother, I want to keep my promises and see my child happy, but I also have to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability. The pressure builds inside me, torn between the urgent email and the hopeful eyes of my son, both demanding my attention and care. I stare at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which role to answer first."}
