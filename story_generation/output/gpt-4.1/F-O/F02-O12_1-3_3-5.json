My son, Ethan, was across from me, fidgeting with his spoon, milk dripping onto the table. \u201cEthan, remember, we keep our place tidy,\u201d I reminded him, trying to sound patient. He looked up, eyes searching mine for approval or disappointment. At the same moment, my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the product architect: \u201cWe need your input on the API structure ASAP. Teams are waiting.\u201d\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. Ethan needed me to be present, to gently guide him, to show him how to clean up and why it mattered. But the team needed me, too\u2014my decisions were holding up the entire project, and the new launch date loomed over us all. My mind raced, torn between the urge to close the laptop and focus on my son, and the responsibility to my colleagues who were counting on me. I could see Ethan\u2019s small hands hesitating, unsure, while my own hands hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed by the weight of both worlds pressing in at once."}
