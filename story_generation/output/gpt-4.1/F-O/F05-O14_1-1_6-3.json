She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than the usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the small frustrations and victories, to let her in. But my mind kept drifting back to the lab, to the stack of data waiting to be logged. The results weren\u2019t urgent, but accuracy mattered, and I prided myself on never letting details slip. I could update the logs later, but the thought nagged at me\u2014what if I forgot something important? Still, my wife\u2019s expectant gaze pulled at me. I felt the weight of her hope for connection, the unspoken plea for honesty and presence. I wanted to be the husband who listened and shared, but the scientist in me itched to document every finding while it was fresh. The two roles tugged at me, each demanding my attention, and I sat there, caught between the need to be present at home and the urge to fulfill my professional standards."}
