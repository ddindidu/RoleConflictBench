They mention a tense moment with a coworker, their voice soft, searching for my attention. I nod, but my mind is tangled in the design documents due tomorrow. Slack notifications ping relentlessly\u2014other teams are waiting for my technical input, and the project manager just sent another reminder. I know I should close the laptop, look up, and really listen. That\u2019s what we promised each other: open communication, no matter how busy life gets. But the pressure from work is crushing. If I don\u2019t respond soon, the whole project could stall, and I\u2019ll let my team down. My spouse\u2019s eyes linger on me, hopeful and a little hurt. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give."}
