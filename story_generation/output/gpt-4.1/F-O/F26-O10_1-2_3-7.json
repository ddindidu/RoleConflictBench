My grandkids were waiting for me to join the board game, their eyes bright with anticipation. This was the family gathering I\u2019d promised not to miss, a rare chance to be present, to listen, to be the grandparent they remembered from their childhood stories. \n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently on the counter. A client\u2019s name flashed on the screen, followed by a terse email: \u201cUrgent\u2014need clarification on invoice line 17.\u201d I knew the expectation\u2014timely, clear communication, especially at month\u2019s end.
