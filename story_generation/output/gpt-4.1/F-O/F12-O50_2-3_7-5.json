The maintenance log flashed in my memory\u2014overdue, and now the machine was threatening to seize up at any moment. I knew if I didn\u2019t get back soon, production would grind to a halt, and the blame would land squarely on my shoulders. But as I turned to leave, I caught sight of my husband at the table, his brow furrowed, eyes distant. He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I remembered my promise to be more open, to share and listen when either of us was troubled. He looked up, as if about to speak, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My phone buzzed with a message from work\u2014urgent, come now. My heart pounded, torn between the screeching machine and the silent plea in my husband\u2019s eyes, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
