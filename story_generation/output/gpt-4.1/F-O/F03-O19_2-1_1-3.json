It was Sunday evening\u2014my usual time to call Mom and Dad. I could already imagine Mom\u2019s gentle reminder if I missed it: \u201cWe just want to hear your voice, dear.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The store was busier than usual, and a line was forming. A woman stepped up, her face pinched with discomfort, and asked about the best over-the-counter pain relief for her headache. I knew I should take a moment to counsel her properly, explain the options, check for allergies, but my phone kept vibrating. I felt torn\u2014my parents expected our weekly call, a ritual that reassured them I was okay, but my patient needed my full attention. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed the importance of being a good son against my responsibility as a pharmacist. I could feel both roles pulling at me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
