My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I promised I would, but now my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from the site foreman: \u201cCarpenter\u2019s waiting. Bring the lumber, now.\u201d I picture the carpenter, arms crossed, tapping his foot, the whole crew\u2019s progress hinging on me. My boots are still caked with dust from today\u2019s shift, and my back aches, but the laundry can\u2019t wait either. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014at home, I\u2019m supposed to share the load, be a partner, not just a guest passing through. At work, I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, not be the guy who slows everyone down. My hands hover over the laundry basket, but my mind is already at the job site, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
