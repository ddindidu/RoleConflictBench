The kids need their uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d handle it, wanting to share the load at home. But just as I sorted the clothes, my phone buzzed. It was a customer, her message sharp and impatient: \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? It\u2019s already late.\u201d At the same time, my delivery app pinged with a notification\u2014one of my packages had been misplaced, and I needed to resolve it immediately.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting from both sides. At home, I was expected to be a reliable partner, someone who didn\u2019t let chores pile up. At work, I was supposed to be calm, courteous, and quick-thinking, even when things went wrong. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: should I drop everything to fix the delivery issue and respond to the customer, or should I finish the laundry so my family wouldn\u2019t be let down? The expectations tugged at me from both directions, and I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds I was supposed to manage."}
