My stepmother\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me again how important it was to keep the family home just as it had always been. \u201cYour father would want you to respect our traditions,\u201d she said, her eyes lingering on the carved banister, worn smooth by generations. But as a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t ignore the deep grooves and hollow sounds beneath my knuckles\u2014termites had eaten away at the very bones of the house. The staircase, the window frames, even the beloved old mantelpiece were all at risk.
