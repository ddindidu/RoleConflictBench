She\u2019s barely touched her dinner, her eyes distant. I know I should ask her what\u2019s wrong, listen, and share my own worries\u2014she expects honesty and openness from me, and I want to be there for her. But the clock ticks relentlessly. The final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial are dense, and as a judge, I must be meticulous; the parties expect me to be prepared, impartial, and thorough. My mind races between the legal arguments in front of me and the concern gnawing at my heart for my wife. I want to close the files and reach out to her, but the weight of my judicial responsibility presses down. I feel torn, guilt rising as I try to balance the demands of justice and the needs of the person I love most."}
