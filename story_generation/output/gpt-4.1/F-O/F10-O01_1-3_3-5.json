My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family holiday dinner. Grandma expects everyone at the table by six.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already four-thirty. The hospital project deadline loomed, and I still hadn\u2019t resolved the operating room access issue. My team depended on me to finalize the design so construction could begin on schedule. Yet, my family expected me to be present, to honor our tradition of sharing stories and laughter over a meal, just as we always had. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s warmth and expectations on one side, my professional responsibility and the lives that might depend on my work on the other. My heart raced as I stared at the plans, torn between the call of home and the demands of my calling, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved tonight."}
