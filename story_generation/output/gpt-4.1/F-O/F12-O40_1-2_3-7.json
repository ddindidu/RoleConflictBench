My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cDid you get a chance to fold the clothes?\u201d I nod, but my mind is already elsewhere. My phone buzzes\u2014a message from a client. Their deck is splintered and unsafe, and they need it fixed before the weekend. I promised I\u2019d come by today.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a wife, I\u2019m expected to help keep our home running smoothly, to share the chores, to be present. But as a carpenter, people rely on my skills, my hands, my time. The laundry can\u2019t wait, but neither can the deck. I picture the client\u2019s anxious face, the children who play on that deck, the satisfaction of a job well done. Then I see my husband, tired after work, hoping for a little help at home.\n\nMy heart pounds as I stand between the laundry and the door, torn by the demands of both roles, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
