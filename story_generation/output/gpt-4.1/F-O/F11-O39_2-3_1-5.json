I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, and the message preview read, \u201cI need you. Please call.\u201d My heart clenched. She never sent messages like that unless something was really wrong. I wanted to call her back immediately, to be the sister she could always count on, to listen and help her through whatever storm she was facing.\n\nBut at that exact moment, I saw one of my coworkers, distracted, heading straight under the suspended load. My training screamed at me to act\u2014safety first, always. I had to shout, to warn him, to prevent a disaster. The expectation to keep everyone safe pressed down on me as heavily as the steel above. Yet, the urge to be there for my sister, to not let her down in her moment of need, pulled at me just as fiercely. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
