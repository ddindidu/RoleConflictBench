The patient, an elderly woman, looked anxious as I explained the medication\u2019s side effects and the importance of taking it with food. I could see her confusion, so I slowed down, repeating myself, making sure she understood. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my partner\u2019s message: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised Jamie the Nintendo today. He\u2019s been waiting all week.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Jamie had been so excited, and I knew how much keeping promises mattered, especially as his step-parent. But the Nintendo was expensive, and I\u2019d been trying to save, to make sure we had enough for bills and groceries. My mind raced between the patient in front of me, needing my full attention, and Jamie at home, waiting for a promise to be kept. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing down, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
