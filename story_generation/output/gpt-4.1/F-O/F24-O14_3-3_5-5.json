The journal\u2019s submission deadline was tomorrow, and my advisor had made it clear: this paper could define my career. My phone buzzed again\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s name flashed on the screen. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re leaving for the family trip in an hour! Mom says it\u2019s important we\u2019re all together this year.\u201d I could hear laughter and clinking dishes in the background, the sounds of everyone gathering downstairs. My stepmom had been planning this holiday for months, hoping to bring us closer as a blended family. I knew how much it meant to her, and to my stepbrother, who\u2019d been trying so hard to make me feel included. But the weight of my unfinished research pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d risk missing the deadline. If I stayed, I\u2019d let my family down\u2014again. My chest tightened as I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good step-sibling and a dedicated scientist, unable to move in either direction."}
