My daughter\u2019s message blinked: \u201cDad, we\u2019re waiting for you!\u201d I\u2019d promised them this day, a rare chance to be more than just the grandpa who\u2019s always working. But as I looked up from the lifeguard chair, the beach was a sea of bobbing heads and bright umbrellas, the tide higher than usual, the waves rougher. Every instinct told me to keep my eyes glued to the water\u2014one slip, one missed signal, and someone could be in real danger. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family\u2019s smiles, the weight of responsibility for every stranger in the surf. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s voice, \u201cGrandpa, come play!\u201d while the whistle around my neck reminded me of the trust placed in me here. The sun beat down, sweat prickling my brow, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between being the grandfather my family needed and the lifeguard these swimmers depended on."}
