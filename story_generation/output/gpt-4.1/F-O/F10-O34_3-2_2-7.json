I know she\u2019s waiting for my daily update\u2014she worries if I don\u2019t check in, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But right now, the radar screen is a blur of shifting blips, each one a plane needing guidance through the chaos of the thunderstorm. My headset crackles with voices: \u201cSector Delta, request reroute,\u201d \u201cHeavy traffic, need handoff clearance.\u201d I\u2019m supposed to coordinate with the next controller, keep the airspace safe, and not miss a single detail. My supervisor expects total focus\u2014lives depend on it. But my mom\u2019s messages keep coming, each one more anxious. I can almost hear her voice: \u201cAre you okay? Did you eat? Text me, please.\u201d My hands hover over the console, torn between the urgent demands of the sky and the gentle, persistent pull of home. The pressure builds in my chest, and I wonder how I can possibly be both the attentive daughter and the vigilant controller they need me to be, right now, at the same time."}
