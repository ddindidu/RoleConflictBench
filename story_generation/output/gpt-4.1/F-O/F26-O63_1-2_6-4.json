My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to the family group chat buzzing on my phone. My daughter had sent a reminder about the upcoming holiday dinner, a tradition I\u2019d never missed. \u201cCan you call us tonight, Grandpa?\u201d my grandson had messaged, his words tugging at my heart. I knew how much these calls meant, especially before our big gatherings. But every minute spent talking to them was a minute not spent making sales, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall short again. My headset pressed against my ear, the office noise faded, and I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold pressure of my quota. My finger hovered over the call button, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
