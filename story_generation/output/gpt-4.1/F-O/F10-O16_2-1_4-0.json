The symptoms pointed to a common cold, but my mind wandered to the conversation I\u2019d had with my mother that morning. She\u2019d reminded me, as she often did, that our family believed in using traditional remedies first\u2014herbs, rest, and warm teas\u2014before turning to modern medicine. Lately, my family had become even more insistent, urging me to honor our customs, especially now that I was both a doctor and their daughter.\n\nAs the patient described their symptoms, I felt the weight of my white coat and my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. Should I recommend the evidence-based treatment I\u2019d been trained to provide, or suggest the traditional remedies my family valued so deeply? My patient looked at me, waiting for my advice, while my mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between my duty as a doctor to diagnose and treat based on science, and my role as a daughter expected to uphold our family\u2019s cherished traditions."}
