My daughter\u2019s text buzzed on my phone, a photo of my grandson grinning in his new work uniform. He\u2019d just started his first job, and the family group chat was alive with messages\u2014everyone sharing in his excitement, asking questions, sending encouragement. I knew they expected me to chime in, to be the supportive grandmother who never misses a moment, who always replies with warmth and pride.\n\nBut just then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through my headset, requesting the routine altimeter setting. My training kicked in\u2014precision, focus, no distractions. The airspace was busy, and even a simple request demanded my full attention. I felt the tug between two worlds: the loving grandmother who should be present for her family, and the vigilant air traffic controller responsible for countless lives in the sky. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing a quick message to my family and responding to the pilot. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and for a moment, I was suspended between them, unsure which role to answer first."}
