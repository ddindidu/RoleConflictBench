As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a professional expectation. My captain always says, \u201cA strong body means a sharp mind on the streets.\u201d Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, his voice shaky. He\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend and needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I\u2019ve always been the one he turns to in moments like this. He asked if I could come over, just for a little while. I glanced at the clock, knowing I\u2019d miss my gym slot if I went. The department had been strict lately about fitness standards, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. But my brother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, raw and vulnerable. I stood in the hallway, torn between the duty to my badge and the bond with my family, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
