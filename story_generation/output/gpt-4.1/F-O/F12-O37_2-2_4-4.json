My husband had mentioned he needed his work shirts clean for tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform was somewhere in the heap, stained from last weekend\u2019s game. As a wife, I felt the weight of making sure everyone had what they needed, that the house ran smoothly, and that no one was left scrambling for clean clothes in the morning.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Johnsons\u2019 house was scheduled for cleaning in three days, and I remembered, with a jolt, that their floor cleaner was almost gone. As their housekeeping cleaner, it was my job to keep track of supplies, to make sure I never showed up unprepared. If I didn\u2019t pick up more cleaner soon, I\u2019d risk disappointing a client who trusted me to keep their home spotless.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. There wasn\u2019t enough time to do both before dinner. My mind raced, torn between my family\u2019s needs and my professional responsibilities, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
