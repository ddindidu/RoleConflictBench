I knew it was Mom\u2014she always texted around noon, wanting to know how my day was going. She worried if I didn\u2019t answer quickly, and I could already imagine her anxious face, waiting for my reply. But the line at the register stretched past the bakery display, and every customer expected a smile, a greeting, and a little small talk. My manager had reminded us just this morning: \u201cNo phones at the register. Focus on the customers.\u201d I tried to keep my voice cheerful as I rang up groceries, but my mind kept drifting to my phone. I felt torn\u2014if I didn\u2019t answer Mom soon, she\u2019d worry and maybe even call the store. But if I pulled out my phone now, I\u2019d risk a reprimand and let down the people waiting in line. My hands shook a little as I handed change to the next customer, caught between being the attentive daughter my parents expected and the friendly cashier my job demanded."}
