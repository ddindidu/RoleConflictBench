My mother looks at me, her eyes hopeful, expecting me to chime in and help make plans. I want to be there, to laugh and share in the warmth of my family, but my phone buzzes with a reminder: the pre-work safety briefing at the construction site starts in two minutes. Missing it means letting my team down and possibly facing a warning from my supervisor. My hard hat and vest are already by the door, but my heart is still at the table. I feel the weight of my mother\u2019s expectation, the unspoken wish that I\u2019ll choose family this time. At the same time, I know my crew is counting on me to be present and focused. My mind races, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility of work, as the seconds tick by and both worlds pull at me, demanding I choose."}
