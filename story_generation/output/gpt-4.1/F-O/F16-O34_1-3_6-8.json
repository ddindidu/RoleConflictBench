I wanted to be present, to listen and share, to keep our connection strong. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or distracted we felt. I started to mention a funny moment from work, but my phone buzzed urgently. The message was clear: an emergency diversion, a flight cutting across three sectors, and I was needed on the line immediately. My mind snapped to the radar screens, the voices of other controllers, the pressure to coordinate every move perfectly. But my partner was still looking at me, waiting for me to finish my story, to be there in that moment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to keep the skies safe and the need to keep my marriage strong. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which voice to answer first."}
