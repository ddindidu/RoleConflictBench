Call us when you can!\u201d I know she and Dad expect me to check in, especially on weekends. I glance at the clock\u2014my shift as a housekeeping cleaner just started, and today\u2019s schedule is packed. The supervisor handed me a list: every room needs a deep clean, top to bottom, no shortcuts. I can already feel the pressure mounting as I scrub the bathroom tiles, my phone vibrating in my pocket with another message. I want to step outside, call my parents, and reassure them I\u2019m okay, but I also know if I fall behind, the supervisor will notice, and the rooms won\u2019t be up to standard. My mind races between the guilt of not being the attentive son my parents hope for and the anxiety of not meeting the expectations at work. I stare at my phone, torn, the mop heavy in my hand, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
