She needed an urgent repair plan\u2014today, if possible. My mind raced through measurements, materials, and the logistics of squeezing another job into my already packed schedule. Just then, I caught a glimpse of my younger brother, distracted by his phone, stepping off the curb and into the street without looking. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was always supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe. But the homeowner\u2019s voice grew more desperate, reminding me of my responsibility as a carpenter to act quickly and prevent further damage to her home. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I drop the call and rush to grab my brother, or stay focused on the urgent repair plan that couldn\u2019t wait? My hands trembled, caught between the demands of family and work, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
