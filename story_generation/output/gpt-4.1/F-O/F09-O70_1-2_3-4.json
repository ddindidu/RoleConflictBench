He was supposed to be practicing saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d before getting his dessert, and I was determined to teach him the importance of good manners. But the notification on my phone reminded me that a moderately valuable package was waiting in my car, and the customer was expecting a signature within the next fifteen minutes. I glanced at my son, who looked up at me, waiting for my guidance, and then at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning a teachable moment, but if I stayed, I risked a failed delivery and a disappointed customer. My mind raced with the expectations on both sides\u2014my son\u2019s need for patient guidance, and my job\u2019s demand for punctuality and security. I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
