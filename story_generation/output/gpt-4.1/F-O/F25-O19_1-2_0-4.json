She looks anxious, so I slow down, making sure she understands the side effects and what to do if she feels dizzy. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014probably my stepdad. He\u2019s been texting more lately, ever since Mom\u2019s surgery. I promised I\u2019d check in with them every weekend, but I haven\u2019t replied since last Sunday. Guilt gnaws at me. I know they expect me to be present, to show I care, especially now. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes are fixed on me, waiting for reassurance. I can\u2019t rush this; my patients rely on me to be thorough and attentive. My phone buzzes again. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. I want to be a good step-child, to show my parents they matter, but right now, I\u2019m the only pharmacist on duty. My heart pounds as I finish counseling Mrs. Lee, my mind already racing with what I should do next."}
