As an accountant, I knew how important it was to stay ahead of regulatory changes\u2014missing this seminar could mean falling behind, and my clients depended on me to be up-to-date. But across from me, my husband waited, his brow furrowed. We\u2019d agreed to talk tonight about our finances and some recent health concerns. He wanted honesty, openness\u2014he needed me to be fully present, to listen and share, not distracted by work.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cLast chance to register for seminar.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. If I left for the seminar, I\u2019d be putting my professional duty first, but I\u2019d be breaking the trust we\u2019d built in our marriage. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the wife he needed, but I\u2019d risk missing crucial information for my job. My heart pounded as I looked between the glowing screen and my husband\u2019s anxious eyes, torn between the expectations of the two worlds I tried so hard to balance."}
