It was a message from my husband: \u201cRough day at work. Just want to talk when you\u2019re free.\u201d I could picture him at home, slumped on the couch, waiting for me to listen and reassure him. As a wife, I knew he expected me to be there, to offer comfort and a listening ear, even if his day wasn\u2019t a disaster\u2014just a little harder than usual. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t ignore my duty. Every item in this kit could mean the difference between life and death for someone later tonight. My supervisor expected perfection, and so did I. I felt the tug in my chest\u2014my husband needed me, but so did my job. I stared at the half-finished checklist, my phone still glowing with his message, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
