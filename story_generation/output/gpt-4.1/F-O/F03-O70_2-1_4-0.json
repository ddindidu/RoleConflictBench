As a delivery person, I knew the customer expected their parcel before dinner, and my supervisor had reminded me that timeliness was everything. But today was different. My family had gathered at home, waiting for me to join the annual dinner that marked the start of our traditional festival. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis is how we honor our ancestors. We must all be present.\u201d The pressure to uphold our family\u2019s values felt heavier than ever, especially after their recent reminders about tradition. Yet, the package in my hands was a promise to a stranger, a commitment I\u2019d made as part of my job. My phone buzzed with a message from my father, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I felt torn, standing at the crossroads of duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
