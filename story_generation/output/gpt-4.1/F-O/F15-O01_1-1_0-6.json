It\u2019s almost three, and my kids will be waiting at the school gate, eyes searching for me among the crowd of parents. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, not just to pick them up, but to hear about their art projects and see the proud smiles on their faces. But as I reach for my keys, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the project manager. There\u2019s a sudden issue with the site delivery, and they need my input now to keep the project on track. I know the team relies on me to keep things moving, to catch these problems before they become disasters. My mind races, torn between the expectation to be a present, reliable parent and the responsibility to manage my team and deadlines. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands tremble as I try to decide which world I\u2019ll let down today."}
