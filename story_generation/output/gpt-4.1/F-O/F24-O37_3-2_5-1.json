My stepbrother had already asked if I\u2019d join them for the games and the big dinner. I could see how much it meant to them, and I wanted to fit in, to be part of this family.\n\nBut as I walked through the hallway, I noticed the dust gathering on the baseboards and the kitchen counters sticky from last night\u2019s dinner. As the housekeeper, I was expected to keep everything spotless, especially before guests arrived. My boss had left a list of extra chores for the weekend, and I knew she\u2019d be checking every corner.
