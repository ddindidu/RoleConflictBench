I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d He had his final exam in the morning, and I knew how much he\u2019d been struggling. As his sibling, I wanted nothing more than to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d get through it. But just as I started to reply, my police radio crackled to life\u2014there was a protest downtown, and all available officers were being called in. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent; the situation was getting out of hand.\n\nMy uniform hung on the chair, a stark reminder of my duty. I could hear the expectation in my sergeant\u2019s voice: \u201cWe need you here. Now.\u201d My brother needed me too, but in a different way. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding my presence to keep the peace, the other needing my support to keep his own peace of mind. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the law and my family, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
