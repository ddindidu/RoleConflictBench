She rarely called during my shift, so I knew something was wrong. My heart pounded as I read her words: \u201cMom, it\u2019s urgent. Please call me.\u201d I felt the weight of my role as a grandmother, the expectation to be there, to support my family, especially in times of crisis. But as I looked up from my phone, I saw a child flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits. My training as a lifeguard screamed at me to act immediately, to enforce the rules and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. I gripped the armrest, torn between the desperate need to reach out to my family and the immediate danger unfolding before my eyes. The pool echoed with laughter and splashes, but all I could hear was my daughter\u2019s plea and the silent struggle of the child in the water. My heart raced as I wrestled with the impossible choice between being the grandmother my family needed and the lifeguard these children depended on."}
