He looked up at me, wide-eyed, and I softened, knowing how much patience it takes for a child to learn. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was the hospital. A patient\u2019s family was waiting for me; I had to explain a diagnosis that would change their lives. I could already imagine their faces\u2014confused, desperate for hope, needing me to be calm and compassionate. My son tugged at my sleeve, asking if I\u2019d help him with his homework. My heart twisted. At home, I was supposed to be the steady guide, shaping my child\u2019s values. At work, I was the pillar for families in crisis. Both needed me, both expected my full presence. I stared at the phone, torn between the world that needed my empathy and the little boy who needed my guidance, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
