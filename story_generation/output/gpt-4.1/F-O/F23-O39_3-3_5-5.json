My heart sank. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to be the parent he needed, even if it meant being the bad guy for a moment. I opened my mouth to speak, to gently but firmly guide him through this mistake, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a call from the site\u2014urgent. I answered, and through the static, I heard the foreman\u2019s frantic voice: \u201cSomeone\u2019s about to walk under the crane!\u201d My mind split in two. On one side, my stepson\u2019s wide, guilty eyes, waiting for my judgment. On the other, the image of my coworker, oblivious to the danger above. Both needed me, right now. My chest tightened as I tried to weigh the demands\u2014be the responsible parent, or the vigilant laborer. I could feel the seconds slipping away, each one demanding a different part of me, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to answer first."}
