The line stretched past the candy racks, and I could feel the impatience simmering in the air. My manager always reminded me: \u201cFriendly service, no matter how busy.\u201d I nodded and greeted each customer, scanning items quickly, making small talk, doing my best to keep things moving.\n\nThen I saw my son, Ben, out of the corner of my eye. He was supposed to be waiting by the magazine stand, but instead, he was slipping a chocolate bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is never okay. But I was also the cashier, expected to keep the line moving, to stay cheerful and professional. I could feel my face flush as I tried to focus on the next customer, but my mind was racing. Should I stop everything and confront Ben, risking a scene and slowing down the line? Or should I wait, hoping no one else noticed, and talk to him later? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt completely torn."}
