The crane was already holding it midair, swaying slightly, and everyone was waiting for me. I could feel the pressure\u2014if I didn\u2019t move fast, the whole crew would be delayed, and safety was on the line. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from my little sister: \u201cI won the scholarship! They\u2019re announcing it now\u2014can you video call?\u201d My heart twisted. She\u2019d always been there for me, cheering me on, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d celebrate this moment with her. But right now, the team needed me, and the beam couldn\u2019t wait. My hands trembled as I stood frozen, torn between the pride and love I felt for my sister and the urgent responsibility of my job. The voices around me blurred as I wrestled with what to do next."}
