She explained it was a gift from her mother, but she\u2019d lost the receipt. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. As a cashier, I was expected to enforce this rule, no exceptions. But as she spoke, I saw my own mother in her, recalling how my family always taught me to be compassionate and understanding, especially during the holidays. Our family traditions were built on kindness and helping others, values I was expected to uphold. Yet here I was, torn between the rigid expectations of my job and the softer, more forgiving values of my upbringing. My manager watched from across the floor, waiting to see if I\u2019d follow procedure. The woman\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something different from me."}
