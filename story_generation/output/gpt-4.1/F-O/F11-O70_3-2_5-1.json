My mom\u2019s voice echoed in my head, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant to her, and to my little brother, who always looked for me at the table. But as I glanced at my delivery app, a new order popped up\u2014groceries, marked urgent, with a note: \u201cPlease, I need these for my family\u2019s dinner tonight.\u201d The address was across town, and the delivery window overlapped exactly with the start of our celebration. My boss\u2019s reminder from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cNo late deliveries, especially today.\u201d I felt the pressure building, torn between being the reliable sister my family expected and the dependable delivery person my job demanded.
