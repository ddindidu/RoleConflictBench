Mom\u2019s excited texts, my sister\u2019s reminders about bringing dessert, and Dad\u2019s usual jokes all made it clear: they wanted me there. I could almost hear the laughter and smell the food already. But as I glanced at my work laptop, a new email popped up\u2014an invite to a cross-team brainstorming session for the next sprint. Attendance was technically optional, but I knew how these things went. If I missed it, I\u2019d be out of the loop on new features, and my input mattered. My manager always said collaboration was key, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. The pressure built in my chest. I wanted to be a good brother, to show up for my family, but I also wanted to be a reliable teammate. I felt torn, caught between the warmth of home and the pull of my responsibilities at work, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
