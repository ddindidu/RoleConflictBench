I was double-checking a chemotherapy prescription, my hands steady but my mind alert\u2014one decimal point off, and the consequences could be dire. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I pictured her, anxious and alone, waiting for the kind of guidance only a grandfather could give. But the prescription in front of me demanded my full attention; there was no room for distraction. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My granddaughter needed my wisdom, my patient needed my precision. I stared at the phone, then at the prescription, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give less than my best to either."}
