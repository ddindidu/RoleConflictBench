I\u2019m freaking out,\u201d he\u2019d written, his final exam looming in the morning. As his step-sibling, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents married: to be there, especially when things got hard.\n\nBut the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, urgent and clear: \u201cPossible heart attack, male, 58, unresponsive.\u201d My training kicked in.
