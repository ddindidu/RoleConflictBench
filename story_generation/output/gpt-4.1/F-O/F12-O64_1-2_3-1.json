Can you fold it tonight?\u201d I could picture the growing pile in the corner of our bedroom, the shirts wrinkling more with every hour. I knew he\u2019d had a long day too, but so had I. The line at my register snaked past the candy display, customers shifting impatiently, their arms full of groceries. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cAccuracy is everything, especially when it\u2019s busy.\u201d I forced a smile as I scanned items, double-checking prices, my mind split between the beep of the scanner and the laundry waiting at home. I wanted to be the partner who shared the load, who didn\u2019t let chores pile up. But right now, I was the cashier everyone was counting on to keep things moving. My chest tightened as I wondered how I could possibly be both at once, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I had to give."}
