They barely slept last night, and I promised I\u2019d call during my break, to check in, to be there. But now, behind the register, the lunch rush is in full swing. The line snakes past the bakery display, and every customer expects a smile, a cheerful greeting, quick hands. My manager glances over, reminding me with a look that we\u2019re short-staffed and every second counts. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my partner, needing reassurance, maybe just my voice. I feel the weight of their need, the silent plea for comfort, but the next customer is already unloading groceries, waiting for my attention. My heart aches, torn between the person I love and the job that pays our bills. I force a smile, but inside, I\u2019m wrestling with the impossible choice: step away and risk my job, or stay and let my partner down when they need me most."}
