She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear the pride in her words. I knew how important it was to be present for her, to show her that her achievements mattered to me. Just as she started describing her new coworkers, my police radio crackled to life. There was a report of a violent assault happening just a few blocks away\u2014bystanders were in danger, and backup was needed immediately. My heart pounded. I glanced at the family photos on the wall, feeling the weight of my granddaughter\u2019s trust and the city\u2019s safety pressing down on me at the same time. I could hear her laughter through the phone, but the urgency in the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind. I was torn, caught between the promise of being a supportive grandfather and the duty to protect the people outside. My hand hovered over the radio, my granddaughter\u2019s words fading as the sirens in my mind grew louder."}
