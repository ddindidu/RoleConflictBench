As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014my clients depended on me to interpret every change, and missing this seminar could mean falling behind. I glanced at my brother, who was distractedly scrolling through his phone, and realized we were approaching a busy intersection. Suddenly, he stepped off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart leapt into my throat. I was torn\u2014should I grab his arm and risk missing the seminar, or trust he\u2019d be okay and dash to my office to log in on time? The weight of both roles pressed on me: my brother\u2019s safety, my professional responsibility. I stood frozen, caught between the urgent need to protect him and the equally pressing demand to fulfill my duty as an accountant."}
