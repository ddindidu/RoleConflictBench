It was my daughter, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had just won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile and hear him talk about his painting. I promised I\u2019d try, but as I hung up, my work phone rang. A new order had come in, a big one: a restaurant needed a set of tables and benches, and they needed my estimate by tomorrow morning. I glanced at the scattered sketches and half-finished projects in my workshop. The client was counting on my expertise, and I knew delays could cost me future business. My heart tugged toward my family, but my mind raced with measurements, wood types, and supply lists. I stood in the sawdust-scented quiet, torn between the warmth of my grandson\u2019s celebration and the pressing demands of my craft, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
