We both had long days, but I knew they wanted to hear about mine, to feel connected. I started to share a story about a difficult call from last week, trying to be open, just as we promised each other we would. My phone, always within reach, buzzed sharply\u2014a new dispatch coming in. My heart jumped. I was on standby, and every second counted. I saw the hope in my partner\u2019s eyes, waiting for me to finish, to let them in. But the weight of my duty pressed down on me. I was torn between the promise to be present at home and the urgent call to save a life. The silence stretched, heavy with expectation, as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
