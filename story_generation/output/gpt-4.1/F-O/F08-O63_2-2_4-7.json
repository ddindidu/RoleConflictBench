Lily\u2019s about to blow out her birthday candles!\u201d The living room was filled with laughter and the sweet scent of cake. My heart ached to be there, to see Lily\u2019s wish and clap with the rest of the family. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my break was nearly over. Management had sent another memo this morning: no extra minutes, every second counted, the queue was never-ending. I could already picture the supervisor\u2019s frown if I logged back in late. My family expected me to be present, to make memories, but my job demanded strict adherence to the clock. I stood in the doorway, torn, the sounds of celebration pulling me one way, the weight of responsibility the other, my mind racing as I tried to decide which world needed me more in that moment."}
