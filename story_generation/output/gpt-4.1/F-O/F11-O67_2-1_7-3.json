It was my younger brother, texting in all caps about how our parents never listen to him. He wanted to talk, to vent, and I knew he expected me to be patient, to listen without judgment, to be the understanding sister I always tried to be. But the ambulance radio crackled with a reminder: every second I spent distracted could mean missing a crucial detail, and my team relied on me to make sure everything was ready for the next emergency. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my brother needed my empathy, my team needed my focus. I stared at the unopened box of gauze in my hand, my phone vibrating again in my pocket, torn between the urge to comfort my brother and the responsibility to ensure my patients\u2019 safety. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I could afford to let down."}
