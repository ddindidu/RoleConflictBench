My brother, who had always been stubborn about his health, was waiting at the counter, arms crossed and eyes darting with impatience. As his sister, I knew he hated being questioned, but as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t ignore the potential drug interaction I\u2019d just noticed. The expectation to build mutual respect with him meant I should approach him gently, communicate openly, and avoid making him feel judged. But the professional demand to dispense medications accurately pressed on me like a weight\u2014I had to ensure his safety, even if it meant risking another argument. My heart pounded as I rehearsed what to say, torn between protecting our fragile sibling bond and fulfilling my duty to his health.
