My grandson, Jamie, slouched across from me, eyes fixed on the table, shoulders heavy with something unsaid. I could sense his struggle\u2014he\u2019d always come to me for advice, and I knew he needed my guidance now more than ever. I wanted to reach out, to share some of the hard-earned wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to help him find his way through whatever was weighing him down.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently.
