My heart dropped as I noticed a crumpled chocolate wrapper peeking from his pocket. The store manager\u2019s eyes met mine, and I knew he\u2019d seen it too. As a mother, I wanted to kneel beside Ben, talk to him gently about honesty and consequences, and guide him through making things right. But as the cashier, I was expected to follow the store\u2019s strict procedures\u2014report the theft, fill out paperwork, and ensure the deposit was completed without error. The clock was ticking, and the manager was waiting for me to act. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations: to be the mother who teaches her child right from wrong, or the employee who upholds company policy without favoritism. My heart pounded, torn between comforting my son and fulfilling my duty as a cashier, knowing whatever I chose would leave a mark."}
