The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and my supervisor\u2019s reminder email echoed in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is critical\u2014no mistakes.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build in my chest. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call when you have a minute?\u201d Lately, I\u2019d noticed the tension in her voice, the way Dad seemed quieter at dinner. I knew I should check in, ask if everything was okay at home, be the supportive child they expected. But the numbers on my screen blurred as I thought about the consequences of missing a detail in the financial records. My parents needed me to be present, to listen, but my job demanded my full attention and precision. I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to dial home and the responsibility to finish my work, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
