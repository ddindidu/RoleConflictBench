It\u2019s our routine, a way to bridge the distance and the awkwardness that sometimes lingers between step-parent and step-child. I glance at my laptop, where a Slack message from QA flashes: \u201cUI glitch on the dashboard again. Users are confused. Can you look into it?\u201d I sigh. The bug isn\u2019t critical\u2014there\u2019s a simple workaround\u2014but I know the team expects me to be responsive, to jump in and fix things quickly. My parents want to feel included in my life, to know I care enough to call. My team wants reliability, someone who doesn\u2019t let small issues slide. I stare at my phone, then at my laptop, feeling the pressure build in my chest. I can\u2019t do both at once, and whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
