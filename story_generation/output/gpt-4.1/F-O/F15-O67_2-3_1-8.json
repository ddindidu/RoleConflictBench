The siren wailed, echoing the urgency in my chest. In the back, a paramedic worked frantically over a patient whose life hung by a thread. Every second mattered, but the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing. I had to drive fast, but safe\u2014lives depended on it.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. I knew what it was: a reminder for my daughter\u2019s open class. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines, asking if I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. The guilt gnawed at me. I imagined her scanning the classroom, searching for my face, her smile fading when she didn\u2019t see me.\n\nThe weight of both worlds pressed down on me. My child needed me to be present, to show her she mattered. But right now, a stranger\u2019s life was literally in my hands. I felt torn in two, the expectations of parent and ambulance driver pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
