It was Mom, her voice soft and tired. \u201cJust checking in, sweetheart,\u201d she said, but I could hear the strain beneath her words. I asked if everything was okay at home, and she hesitated before assuring me it was. Still, I sensed she needed to talk, maybe about Dad\u2019s health or the bills piling up. I wanted to press, to be the daughter who listens and comforts, but just then, a customer walked in, holding out a broken wooden train. \u201cCan you fix this? My son\u2019s birthday is tomorrow,\u201d she pleaded, her little boy clutching the toy with hopeful eyes. I glanced at the clock\u2014my lunch break was almost over, and I needed to inspect the toy, calculate the cost, and give a quote. My mind tugged in two directions: the daughter who should be there for her parents, and the carpenter who must meet her customer\u2019s needs. My heart pounded as I stood between the ringing phone and the waiting child, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
