It\u2019s the holiday rush\u2014planes circling, pilots requesting updates, my headset crackling with urgency. I\u2019m calculating separation, issuing clearances, when I see the text: \u201cCan you call? Need to talk.\u201d It\u2019s Mom. I know that tone. Dad\u2019s been struggling lately, and she\u2019s been holding it together for both of them. My parents expect me to be their anchor, the one who listens, reassures, reminds them they\u2019re not alone. But right now, the airspace is a puzzle of moving parts, and every second counts. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s need for comfort, my duty to keep hundreds of strangers safe in the sky. My heart aches to be the son they need, but my mind is tethered to the radar, the voices, the responsibility. I stare at the blinking screen, torn, as the next pilot calls for instructions."}
