My son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my calls to stay close. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. I opened my mouth to call him back, but my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. I was needed for a non-life-threatening injury, but the city traffic was thick, and I\u2019d have to drive carefully to get there safely. My mind raced: as a mother, I should kneel down, look my son in the eye, and explain why his behavior wasn\u2019t okay. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to drop everything and respond immediately, to focus on the road and the patient waiting for me. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of shaping my child\u2019s character against the duty to my job and the person needing help. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
