My husband poured us both tea, settling across from me. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked, his eyes searching for more than just a one-word answer. I knew he wanted me to share, to open up about the stress I\u2019d been carrying. But my mind was tangled in the technical snarl of the core module I was supposed to finish today. The whole project team was waiting on me; their messages pinged in the background, each one a reminder that progress had ground to a halt because of my delay.\n\nI wanted to tell him everything, to be the partner who communicates, who doesn\u2019t shut down when things get hard. But I also felt the weight of my responsibility as an engineer\u2014if I didn\u2019t solve this, the project would slip, and everyone would know it was my fault. My husband reached for my hand, patient, but I could feel the words bottling up inside me, torn between being the open, honest wife he needed and the focused, reliable engineer my team depended on."}
