My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in immediately to discuss what happened. My heart pounded with worry and guilt\u2014Ethan needed me to show up, to prove I cared, to help him through this. But just as I was grabbing my keys, my work phone buzzed. The main production unit was down again, sensor errors halting everything. My supervisor\u2019s message was blunt: \u201cWe need you on the floor now. Every minute counts.\u201d I could almost hear the hum of the machines, the pressure of the team waiting for my diagnosis.
