They\u2019re about to announce the award.\u201d She\u2019d worked so hard for this, and I promised I\u2019d be there to celebrate her big moment. But the rain was coming down in sheets, and the wipers barely kept up. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to keep my focus, drive defensively, and obey every traffic law\u2014especially in weather like this. But every minute I lost to caution was a minute closer to missing my sister\u2019s milestone. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the urge to speed up for her and the responsibility to keep my passenger, and everyone else, safe. The pressure from both sides pressed in, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
