Today, I was to lead the family\u2019s annual remembrance ceremony, a role my father once held, a tradition passed down for generations. My relatives gathered, waiting for me to begin, their expectations heavy on my shoulders. My phone buzzed urgently at my side. Dispatch\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cArmed robbery in progress, all available units respond immediately.\u201d My heart pounded. As a police officer, I knew every second counted\u2014lives could be lost if I didn\u2019t act. But as a child, I saw my family\u2019s faith in me, their need for me to honor our ancestors and keep our traditions alive. I felt torn, the weight of duty and love pulling me in opposite directions. My uniform felt tighter, my breath shorter, as I stood between the altar and the door, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
