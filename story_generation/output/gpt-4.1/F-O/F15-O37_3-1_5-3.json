It was the store manager, his voice tense: \u201cYour son was caught taking snacks without paying.\u201d My heart dropped. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing is unacceptable. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to finish the supply check and report any shortages before the end of my shift. The supervisor had already warned me about falling behind. I stared at the half-checked list, my mind racing. If I left now, I\u2019d risk my job and the trust my employer placed in me. If I stayed, I\u2019d be failing my child at a crucial moment, missing the chance to guide him when he needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility I could afford to let down."}
