My daughter\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom, you promised to help with the pie this year!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s eager faces, but the radio crackled, snapping me back to the present. \u201cUnit 12, respond to a fall injury, possible fracture.\u201d I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding. As an ambulance driver, I knew someone was waiting for me, in pain and afraid, counting on my steady hands and calm voice.
