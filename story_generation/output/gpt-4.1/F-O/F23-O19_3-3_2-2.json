My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted me to come in immediately. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to be present and guide him through this, especially since I\u2019d promised to attend his school events and support him no matter what. But as I hung up, I glanced at the prescription in my hand\u2014a high-risk chemotherapy order, the kind that demanded my full attention and absolute precision. One slip, one distraction, and someone\u2019s life could be at risk. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to be a responsible parent and the critical duty I owed my patient. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of mistakes. I felt the anxiety knotting in my stomach, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
