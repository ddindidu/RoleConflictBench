The clinic was busy, and I knew I needed to be thorough\u2014prescribe the right antibiotics, explain the treatment, reassure the worried parent waiting outside. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: my son\u2019s school. The words stung\u2014my child had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, to talk, to help my son understand the gravity of his actions. As a father, I felt a surge of responsibility and shame. I should be there, guiding him, showing him right from wrong. But as a doctor, I couldn\u2019t just abandon my patient, not when they needed my care and expertise. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. My mind raced, torn between the exam room and the principal\u2019s office, between my duty to heal and my duty to parent."}
