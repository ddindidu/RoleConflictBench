Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at my chest. I haven\u2019t called home in two weeks, and my mom always says it means a lot to hear from me, especially since I moved out. But right now, the radar screen is a mess of blinking tags\u2014holiday traffic is peaking, and every approach fix is stacked with holding patterns. Pilots are calling in, anxious for updates, and I\u2019m juggling clearances, reroutes, and weather advisories. My supervisor expects me to keep the airspace safe and efficient, no mistakes, no distractions. I want to step away for just a minute, send a quick reply, but I can\u2019t risk losing focus. The pressure from both sides squeezes me\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection, my duty to hundreds of lives in the sky. My phone buzzes again, and I stare at it, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in as I try to decide what to do next."}
