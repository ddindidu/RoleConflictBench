My younger brother trudged in, eyes red, backpack dragging. I could tell something was wrong\u2014he barely mumbled a hello before heading to his room. As his sibling, I knew I should go after him, sit on his bed, and listen. He needed me to be there, to help him sort through whatever had happened at school. But my phone buzzed urgently: a message from the factory floor. The new staff were about to start the old press, and I knew they hadn\u2019t been trained on the safety lockouts. If I didn\u2019t get down there now, someone could get hurt. My mind raced, torn between the brother who needed my comfort and the workers who needed my expertise. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
