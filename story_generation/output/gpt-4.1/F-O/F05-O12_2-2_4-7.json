My wife\u2019s voice echoes from the hallway, reminding me that the kids need clean clothes for their soccer game tomorrow. I nod, feeling the weight of her expectation\u2014she\u2019s been handling most of the chores lately, and I promised to help more. Just as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes. Slack notifications light up the screen: \u201cUrgent\u2014users can\u2019t log in again.
