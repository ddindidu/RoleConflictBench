My son\u2019s birthday was tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days, his excitement infectious. But the price tag gnawed at me; money was tight, and I needed to be careful, to keep our family secure. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the lab: the atmospheric conditions were perfect, a rare window to run the experiment I\u2019d been planning for months. If I missed it, I might not get another chance before the funding review. My team was counting on me, and so was my research. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my son\u2019s hopeful eyes, the weight of my promise, and the pressure of my career, the need to prove my hypothesis and secure our future. My mind raced, torn between the lab and the toy store, between being the parent my child needed and the scientist my work demanded."}
