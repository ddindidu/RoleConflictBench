Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you.\u201d I smiled, proud of her, but my eyes darted back to the spreadsheet on my screen. My sales numbers were soaring this week\u2014if I kept up the pace, I\u2019d finally hit the bonus tier. But that meant staying late, making just a few more calls, pushing through the evening when most people were home and likely to answer. Management\u2019s emails echoed in my mind: \u201cPush hard, don\u2019t let up, every call counts.\u201d I wanted to be there for my sister, to cheer her on and show her she mattered. But the pressure to keep dialing, to not let this rare momentum slip, gnawed at me. I stared at the clock, torn between the ringing phone and the promise I\u2019d made. My heart thudded with guilt and anxiety, caught between being the brother she deserved and the employee my boss expected."}
