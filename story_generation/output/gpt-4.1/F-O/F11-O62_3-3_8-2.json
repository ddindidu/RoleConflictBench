As a lifeguard, my eyes swept the water, counting heads, scanning for raised hands or sudden splashes. Every second mattered. But then, my phone buzzed. It was my younger brother, standing at the edge of the sand, his face tight with frustration. We\u2019d argued that morning, and he wanted to talk, to clear the air. As his sister, I knew I should go to him, listen, and work things out\u2014he needed to feel heard, to know I respected him. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t look away from the water, not even for a minute. The expectation to be present for my brother clashed with the demand to keep strangers safe. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
