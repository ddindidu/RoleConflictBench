My shift as a telemarketer had just started, and the calls were coming in steadily\u2014mostly friendly voices, a few simple questions, nothing I couldn\u2019t handle with the script. Between calls, my partner sighed and mentioned, almost offhand, that work had been a bit rough today. I caught the hint of fatigue in their voice, the way their shoulders slumped. I knew they wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just a hug or a few kind words. But the phone rang again, and I had to answer, launching into my cheerful pitch, ready to handle any objections. My partner\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for connection, but I was split\u2014torn between the expectation to be present and supportive, and the demand to stay professional and focused on my job. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to juggle both, feeling the weight of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
