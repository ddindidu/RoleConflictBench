The project manager\u2019s messages pile up, each one more urgent than the last. I know the whole team is waiting for me\u2014nothing can move forward until I finish this piece. My mind races with algorithms and deadlines, but then my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cCan we talk for a bit?\u201d I remember how I promised myself to check in more, to be there for them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. I know they rely on me, not just for updates, but for comfort, for reassurance that everything will be okay. I feel the weight of their expectations pressing against the demands of my job. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between the code that everyone needs and the call that my parents are waiting for. My chest tightens as I try to decide which role I can let down less."}
