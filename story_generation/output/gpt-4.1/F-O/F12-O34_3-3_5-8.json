The living room needed dusting, the guest towels were still in the dryer, and the food had to be set out just right. He sounded stressed, and I knew he expected me to help pull everything together, to be present and supportive, to make our home shine for his relatives. But as I reached for the vacuum, my work phone buzzed urgently. \n\n\u201cSector three, we have an emergency diversion\u2014possible engine failure, crossing into your airspace,\u201d the supervisor\u2019s voice crackled. My heart pounded. I was needed at the radar, to coordinate with two other controllers, to keep the skies safe and prevent chaos. I could hear my husband in the background, calling for help with the table settings. My headset beeped again\u2014another update from the tower. \n\nI felt split in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down. My family needed me here, but so did the pilots and passengers above. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of home and the urgency of the skies, not knowing which call to answer first."}
