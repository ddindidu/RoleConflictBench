He asked about my day, and I hesitated, feeling the weight of everything I\u2019d seen and done. I knew he wanted me to open up, to share more than just the surface details. But my mind kept drifting back to Mrs. Carter, the patient who\u2019d just had surgery. She\u2019d needed so much help\u2014gentle hands to guide her, patience as she struggled to dress, reassurance when she winced in pain. I could still feel the tension in my shoulders from holding her steady, the worry that I might hurt her if I wasn\u2019t careful enough. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for me to talk, but I felt torn. Part of me wanted to be present, to connect with him, but another part was still at the hospital, replaying every moment with Mrs. Carter, wondering if I\u2019d done enough. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, caught between the need to be a supportive wife and a diligent nursing assistant, unsure which part of me to give voice to first."}
