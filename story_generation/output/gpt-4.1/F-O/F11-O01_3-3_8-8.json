It was my younger brother, his name flashing on the screen with a message: \u201cCan we talk? It\u2019s important.\u201d I knew we\u2019d argued last night\u2014words thrown in frustration, misunderstandings piling up. As his sister, I felt the weight of our relationship, the need to reach out, to listen, to rebuild the trust that had cracked. But as an architect, I was already drowning in demands. The project was behind schedule, and my team was waiting for my decision on a critical design change. Every minute counted; the client was breathing down my neck, and my phone was already lighting up with urgent emails from the site manager.
