She\u2019s counting on me to get the laundry done today so our daughter has clean clothes for her field trip tomorrow. I feel the weight of that expectation, the unspoken agreement that we\u2019re in this together, sharing the load.\n\nBut my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s the nurse manager\u2014one of my patients, Mr. Harris, is showing slightly elevated vital signs after his procedure. I\u2019m needed on the floor to monitor him, to take and record his temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, to make sure he\u2019s safe. The hospital expects me to be vigilant, attentive, and present.\n\nI stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, laundry basket in the other, my mind pulled in two directions. My family needs me at home, but my patient needs me at work. The pressure builds in my chest as I wrestle with the impossible choice, feeling like I\u2019m letting someone down no matter what I do."}
