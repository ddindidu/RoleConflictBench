He needed me\u2014needed my arms around him, my words to anchor him. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. I glanced at the screen: a new client, calling right on schedule. I knew she was anxious, having just received her first machine, and she\u2019d been promised my guidance. If I didn\u2019t answer, she might feel abandoned, confused, or even make a costly mistake. But if I left my husband now, I\u2019d be breaking the silent promise I\u2019d made to always be there when he was hurting. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, torn between the desperate need in my husband\u2019s eyes and the professional responsibility waiting on the other end of the line."}
