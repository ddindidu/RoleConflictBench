The bench trial had been complex, and I knew the attorneys and parties were anxiously awaiting my written decision. Every word needed to be precise, every finding supported. The pressure to be thorough and clear weighed heavily on me. My spouse poured us both a cup of tea and sat across from me, asking, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I wanted to answer honestly, to share the stress and the burden, but confidentiality and the need to protect the integrity of the case held me back. I offered a vague, \u201cIt was long,\u201d hoping it would suffice. I could see the disappointment flicker in their eyes\u2014they wanted more, expected more openness from me.
