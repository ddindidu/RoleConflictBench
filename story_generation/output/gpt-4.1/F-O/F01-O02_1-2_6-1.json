My daughter had already texted, \u201cDad, can you join the video call? The kids miss you.\u201d I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, and I pictured my family gathered around the screen, waiting for me to share stories and jokes.\n\nBut as an engineer, my mind was tangled in circuit diagrams and code. The stakeholders were pressing for a working prototype\u2014without it, the project might lose funding. My manager\u2019s email was blunt: \u201cWe need your expertise. Can you finalize the design by tomorrow?\u201d I knew the team was counting on me, and any delay could set us back weeks.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold urgency of my work.
