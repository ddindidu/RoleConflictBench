They\u2019ll be here in two hours.\u201d I could almost hear the urgency in her words. As a husband, I knew how much it meant to her that our home looked perfect for her family. I wanted to be there, to share the load, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in this.\n\nBut at the same moment, I was standing behind the pharmacy counter, listening to Mrs. Patel list her medications. She was on a complicated regimen\u2014blood thinners, diabetes meds, a new antibiotic. She looked anxious, and I knew how critical it was to give her my full attention, to make sure she understood every risk and interaction. My professional responsibility weighed heavily on me; a mistake here could be dangerous.\n\nI felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. My wife needed me at home, my patient needed me here. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my focus. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of the man I am at home and the professional I am behind this counter."}
