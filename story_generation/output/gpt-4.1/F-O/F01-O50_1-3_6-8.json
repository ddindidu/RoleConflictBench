The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smile, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but my mind is already racing. At the same time, my work phone lights up with a call from the factory. The new staff are about to start a batch on the old press, and I know they haven\u2019t been properly trained on the safety protocols. If I don\u2019t walk them through it, someone could get hurt. My family expects me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be the steady presence I\u2019ve always been. But my clients rely on me to keep their operations safe, to prevent accidents before they happen. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the warmth of family tradition on one side and the cold urgency of responsibility on the other. My heart aches as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the voices calling me home and the ones pleading for my guidance."}
