Dad\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I knew she wanted me to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, to be the supportive son she could lean on. I started dialing her number, but just then, my work phone rang. It was a customer, her voice tense, asking about her package that was supposed to arrive an hour ago. I remembered the mix-up at the warehouse\u2014her delivery was delayed, and I needed to explain the situation calmly and professionally, even though I could sense her frustration building. My mom\u2019s call was still waiting. I felt torn, my chest tight. My parents needed me to be present, to show I cared. My job demanded I be courteous and focused, even when things went wrong. Both voices\u2014my mother\u2019s worried, the customer\u2019s impatient\u2014pulled at me, and I sat there, phone in each hand, not sure which role to answer first."}
