My stepchildren\u2019s school was letting out early today, and I\u2019d promised my partner I\u2019d be there to pick them up. It was important to show up, to be present, especially since I was still earning their trust as their step-parent. But just as I was about to shut down my computer, an email popped up: a last-minute seminar on upcoming tax law changes, hosted by a renowned expert. As an accountant, staying ahead of these changes was crucial\u2014not just for my clients, but for my own credibility at work. My boss had sent a note, too: \u201cWould be great if you could attend and share insights with the team.\u201d I stared at the screen, torn. If I missed the seminar, I\u2019d fall behind professionally. If I missed the school pickup, I\u2019d let down the kids and my partner. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, keys in one hand, seminar link open in the other, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
