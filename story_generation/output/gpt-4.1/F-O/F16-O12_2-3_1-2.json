She\u2019s pacing, phone in hand, eyes red. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she says, voice cracking. She needs me\u2014really needs me\u2014to listen, to help her untangle the mess her boss just dropped on her. But my mind is split. The production service is crawling, and the traces point straight to the code I merged yesterday. My team is pinging me, waiting for a fix, and I know every minute counts. I want to close the laptop, walk over, and hold her, tell her I\u2019m here. But the weight of the team\u2019s expectations presses on my chest. If I don\u2019t act now, customers will be furious, and my reputation is on the line. My partner\u2019s eyes meet mine, searching for comfort, while Slack notifications pile up, demanding my attention. I feel torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the spouse she needs and the developer my team expects."}
