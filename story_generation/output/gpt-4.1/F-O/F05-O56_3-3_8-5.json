It\u2019s important.\u201d My stomach tightened. We\u2019d been dancing around the subject of our mounting bills for weeks, and I knew she expected honesty\u2014no more dodging, no more half-truths. I promised her I\u2019d be home early, ready to talk openly, just as she needed.\n\nBut as I swept up the last of the day\u2019s hair clippings, a client stormed to the mirror, voice rising. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for! I can\u2019t go out like this!\u201d The clock on the wall glared at me\u2014ten minutes to closing. My coworkers were already packing up, eager to leave. I felt the weight of my scissors in my hand, the expectation to fix this, to listen, to make her feel heard and satisfied. My mind raced: if I stayed, I\u2019d be late, breaking my promise to my wife. If I left, I\u2019d fail my client and my professional standards. My heart pounded as I stood between the angry client and the door, torn by the demands of both worlds, unable to move."}
