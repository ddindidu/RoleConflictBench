As a father, I knew the bills were piling up at home\u2014my wife had called earlier, her voice tight with worry about groceries and the rent due next week. My children needed new shoes, and I could feel the weight of their needs pressing on my chest. But as a doctor, I was staring at a patient chart that made no sense. The man in room 214 had symptoms that didn\u2019t fit any textbook diagnosis\u2014fever, joint pain, a strange rash. The tests were inconclusive, and I knew I needed to spend more time, order more labs, consult with colleagues. Yet, every minute I spent here meant another hour of overtime, another deduction from my paycheck, less time to pick up extra shifts elsewhere. My family needed me to provide, but my patient needed me to solve this medical puzzle. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, heart pounding, unable to move."}
