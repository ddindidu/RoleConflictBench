My phone buzzes with a message from my wife: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just tired.\u201d I know her well enough to hear the fatigue behind her words, the unspoken need for comfort. I want to call her, to listen, to be the husband she deserves\u2014someone who notices the small cracks before they widen. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, reminding me it\u2019s time for the pre-departure check. The train waits, passengers depending on me to keep them safe and on schedule. I can\u2019t ignore the checklist, even if the systems aren\u2019t critical.

My heart pounds as I stand between the platform and my phone, torn by the silent demands of both worlds, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
