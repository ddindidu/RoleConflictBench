My phone buzzed with Slack messages from the product team, each one more urgent than the last. They needed my input to finalize the new feature, and I could feel the pressure mounting. Just then, the front door slammed. My stepbrother trudged in, backpack slung low, eyes red and puffy. He didn\u2019t say anything, just dropped onto the couch and stared at the floor. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could see the pain etched on his face. I remembered the promise I\u2019d made to be there for him, especially after everything we\u2019d been through blending our families. But the clock was ticking, and my team was counting on me. My heart twisted as I glanced between my screen and my stepbrother, torn between the demands of my job and the silent plea for support from someone I cared about."}
