Can\u2019t wait to see you in the front row.\u201d I smiled, picturing his proud face, but my work phone chimed almost at the same time. Dispatch: \u201cUrgent medical delivery\u2014hospital, 2:45 p.m. sharp. Patient care depends on it.\u201d My heart thudded. As a sister, I was expected to be there, cheering, supporting, making his big day unforgettable. But as a delivery person, I was trusted to get life-saving supplies to the hospital, no excuses, no delays. I stared at the clock, calculating routes and times, feeling the pressure build. If I missed the delivery, someone\u2019s health could be at risk. If I missed the ceremony, I\u2019d let down my brother on one of the most important days of his life. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I gripped my steering wheel, torn between duty and love, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
