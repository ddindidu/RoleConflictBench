The open class at Lily\u2019s school was starting in less than an hour. She\u2019d been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, just like the other moms. But the shop was a mess\u2014wood shavings everywhere, tools scattered, and the supervisor\u2019s warning from last week echoed in my mind: \u201cA cluttered site is an accident waiting to happen.\u201d I knew I couldn\u2019t leave things as they were, not if I wanted to keep my job and keep everyone safe. But the thought of Lily searching the crowd for my face, only to find an empty seat, twisted my stomach. I could almost hear her disappointed sigh. My heart pounded as I weighed the safety of my coworkers against the promise I\u2019d made to my daughter. The clock ticked on, and I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
