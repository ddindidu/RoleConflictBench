Today was the annual family picnic\u2014my stepmom\u2019s favorite tradition. She\u2019d texted me three times already, asking when I\u2019d join the group for the big family photo and the blessing before lunch. I could see them gathered by the dunes, waving me over, my little stepsister bouncing with excitement. But the beach was packed, the tide higher than usual, and every instinct screamed at me to keep watching the water. I knew what my stepmom expected: to show I cared about the family, to be present, to honor the rituals that made us feel like one. But as a lifeguard, I was responsible for every life in the surf. If I left, even for a minute, something could happen. My heart pounded as I watched a group of kids edge too far out, while my family\u2019s laughter drifted on the wind, pulling me in two directions at once."}
