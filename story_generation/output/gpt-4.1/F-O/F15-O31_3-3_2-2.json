I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, front row, cheering her on. But the call wasn\u2019t from the school\u2014it was dispatch. An armed robbery, downtown, shots fired. My heart pounded. At that moment, another call came in: the school principal. My daughter had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, now, to address her behavior and support the school\u2019s response.\n\nI stood frozen, keys in hand, uniform half-buttoned. As a parent, I was expected to be present, to guide my child, to show her that her actions had consequences and that I cared enough to be there. As a police officer, I was expected to protect the public, to respond without hesitation when lives were at risk. Both roles demanded my immediate presence, both equally urgent in their own way. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my child and the duty to my badge, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
