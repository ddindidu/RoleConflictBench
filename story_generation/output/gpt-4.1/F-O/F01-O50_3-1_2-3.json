The hum of machines echoed in my mind, a constant reminder of the upcoming shutdown and the long list of maintenance tasks waiting for me. I knew how crucial it was\u2014if I missed this window, the machines could break down, costing the company dearly and putting my reputation on the line.\n\nJust then, my grandson shuffled in, his eyes downcast.
