My little brother waved, calling me over as Mom spread out a blanket and Dad unpacked sandwiches. They were laughing, tossing out ideas for our weekend\u2014hiking, a movie night, maybe a trip to Grandma\u2019s. I could hear my name, their voices expectant, wanting me to join in, to be part of the planning, to be a sister.\n\nBut my eyes kept darting back to the water. A group of teenagers floated lazily, sometimes drifting toward the deeper end. No one seemed in trouble, but I knew how quickly things could change. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever take your eyes off the swimmers.\u201d I felt the weight of the red cross on my shirt, the responsibility to keep everyone safe.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the warmth of my family, the easy laughter, the sense of belonging, and toward the cool, watchful duty of the lifeguard stand. I gripped the armrest, torn between the sister they wanted and the lifeguard I needed to be."}
