I know it\u2019s my mom\u2014she always texts around this time, wanting to know how my day is going, if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m okay. She expects a quick reply, a little update, and I\u2019ve always tried to give her that, even if it\u2019s just a few words. But right now, Mr. Lee\u2019s hands are trembling, and he looks at me with pleading eyes. He needs me to help him eat, to be present and gentle, not distracted. My phone vibrates again, more insistent this time. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my mom will worry if I don\u2019t answer, maybe even call, but I can\u2019t just leave Mr. Lee struggling. My heart pounds as I stand between them, torn by the demands of being a good daughter and a responsible nursing assistant, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
