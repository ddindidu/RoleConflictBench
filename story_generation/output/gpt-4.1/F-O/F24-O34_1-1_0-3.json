The pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My hand hovered over the mic, ready to respond, but my phone buzzed on the desk. It was a text from my stepbrother: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about the exam.\u201d I knew how much this final meant to him\u2014he\u2019d been up all night, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there if he needed support. But right now, I was the only controller on this sector, responsible for every aircraft in my airspace. The expectation was clear: keep communication crisp, keep the skies safe. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me. I could almost hear my stepbrother\u2019s shaky voice, needing reassurance, while the pilot waited for my response.
