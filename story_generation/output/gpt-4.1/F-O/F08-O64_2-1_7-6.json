My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014another message from my granddaughter, who just started her new job. She\u2019d been so excited, and I promised I\u2019d be there to listen, to celebrate every little victory with her. I could almost hear her voice, eager to share her first impressions, wanting her grandmother\u2019s encouragement. But as I glanced at the line forming, I forced a smile and greeted the next customer, making sure to ask about their day, as my manager always reminded us to do. My mind kept drifting to my family, to the expectation that I\u2019d be present and supportive, but here I was, expected to be cheerful and attentive to strangers. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my heart tugged toward my granddaughter, but my hands kept moving, scanning, bagging, smiling. I felt torn, caught between the warmth of family and the demands of my job, unsure which expectation I could meet in this moment."}
