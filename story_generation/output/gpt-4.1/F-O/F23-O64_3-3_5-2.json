The end-of-shift tally had to be perfect\u2014any mistake would mean hours of paperwork and a stern talk from my manager. The line was long, and I could feel the impatience of customers behind the glass. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my stepson, Jamie, slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to be the adult he could trust and learn from. But I was also the cashier, responsible for every cent in the drawer, and the store\u2019s policy was strict about theft. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014do I call him out in front of everyone, risking his trust and our fragile relationship, or do I ignore it and risk my job and the example I set? My hands trembled as I tried to finish the transaction, my mind torn between the expectations of a step-parent and the demands of my job."}
