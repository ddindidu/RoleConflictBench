My son darts away from my side, weaving between displays, giggling as he narrowly avoids bumping into a stack of cereal boxes. I know I should call him back, remind him about respect for public spaces, about discipline and self-control\u2014lessons I promised myself I\u2019d teach him. But my phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder about the research logs I meant to update. The results are fresh in my mind, and I know from experience that if I don\u2019t record them soon, the details might blur. The logs can technically wait, but accuracy is a cornerstone of my work, and I pride myself on never letting things slip. I glance at my son, now drawing the attention of a few annoyed shoppers, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My heart pounds as I stand there, torn between the father my son needs and the scientist I\u2019ve always been."}
