My younger sister trudged in, her shoulders hunched, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something at school had gone wrong. She dropped her bag and disappeared into her room without a word. I hesitated, torn. As her sibling, I felt the pull to go after her, to sit on her bed and listen, to be the person she could lean on. But the email from Product was still open on my screen, reminding me about the upcoming brainstorming session. Attendance was optional, but I knew how much my input mattered for the new feature set. If I skipped, I\u2019d miss the chance to shape the project and show my commitment to the team. My mind raced, guilt and responsibility tangling together. Should I close my laptop and be the supportive sibling she needed, or stay and prepare, proving myself as a dedicated developer? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
