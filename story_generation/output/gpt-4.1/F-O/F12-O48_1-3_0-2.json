He didn\u2019t seem upset, but I could hear the fatigue in his voice, the way he paused before each sentence. I knew he needed me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just a gentle touch on his hand. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the nurse on the evening shift. One of my patients, Mrs. Carter, was in severe pain and refusing to eat. They needed me to come in early, to help her with her meal and try to ease her discomfort. I looked at my husband, wanting to be present for him, to show him he mattered. But I also pictured Mrs. Carter, frail and alone, waiting for someone to help her through the pain. My heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
