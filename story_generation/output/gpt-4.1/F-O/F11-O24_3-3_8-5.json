It was my younger brother, his name flashing insistently on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night\u2014harsh words, old wounds reopened. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew how much it meant to him, to us. As his sister, I owed him honesty and patience, a chance to rebuild the trust we\u2019d chipped away. But the bail hearing had just ended, and as the presiding judge, I was required to draft and sign the release order immediately. The defendant\u2019s freedom, the clarity of my legal reasoning, and the integrity of the process all depended on my prompt, undivided attention. My brother\u2019s call kept vibrating in my hand, a reminder of the person I was outside the courtroom. I stared at the blank order on my screen, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
