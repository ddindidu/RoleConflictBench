My son darted away from my side, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him right from wrong, to show discipline. I called his name, my voice tight, but he only laughed louder. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my supervisor about the new hygiene protocols. I remembered how, just yesterday, I\u2019d been scolded for not wearing gloves while cleaning the restroom. The expectation was clear: follow every rule, no exceptions, or risk my job. \n\nI felt torn, standing in the aisle, my son\u2019s laughter echoing and my supervisor\u2019s words ringing in my ears. Should I chase after my son and correct him, risking being late for work and another warning? Or should I hurry through the shopping, focus on my job, and hope he\u2019d calm down on his own? My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
