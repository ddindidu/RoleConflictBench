My phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past eight. The hospital project deadline loomed, and I still hadn\u2019t resolved the emergency route layout. Every detail mattered; a single oversight could cost lives. Yet, the thought of Dad sitting silently in the living room, Mom worrying, tugged at me. I was supposed to be there for them, to check in, to listen. But the hospital needed me, too\u2014my team depended on my expertise to make the design work. My mind raced between the sterile lines of the blueprint and the warmth of my parents\u2019 living room. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call to answer first."}
