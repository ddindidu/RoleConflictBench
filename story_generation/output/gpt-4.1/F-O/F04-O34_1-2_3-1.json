My mother\u2019s eyes sparkled with hope\u2014she wanted all of us together, just once, without someone missing. I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my phone buzzed with a work alert. The holiday rush had started early; the approach fixes were already stacking up with holding patterns, and the supervisor\u2019s message was clear: all hands on deck, no exceptions. My family\u2019s laughter faded into the background as I scrolled through the updates, picturing the crowded skies and the responsibility waiting for me. My brother nudged me, asking if I\u2019d be there this time. I wanted to say yes, to promise I\u2019d join them, but the weight of my other world pressed down. I could feel both sides pulling at me\u2014my family\u2019s longing for togetherness, and the silent, urgent expectation that I\u2019d help keep the skies safe. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed."}
