They always waited for my call, eager to hear about my week, to share their stories, to know I was safe and well. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take care of yourself, dear.\u201d But today, I was at work, scrubbing the bathroom tiles in a client\u2019s house. My supervisor had just walked by, reminding everyone to wear gloves at all times, especially now with stricter hygiene rules. I glanced at my bare hands, already raw from the chemicals, and at the gloves I\u2019d left in the supply closet. My phone buzzed again. If I called my parents now, I\u2019d have to step outside, risking a reprimand for leaving my post and not following safety protocols. But if I waited, I\u2019d miss our call, and I knew how much it meant to them. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be a good child, be a responsible worker. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
