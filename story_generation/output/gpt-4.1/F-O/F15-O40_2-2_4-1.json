As I scanned the shelves for cereal, I noticed him darting between aisles, giggling and weaving dangerously close to other shoppers. Instinctively, the parent in me wanted to call him over, kneel down, and explain why running indoors was wrong\u2014how it could hurt him or someone else, and how we must respect shared spaces. But my phone buzzed with a message from my apprentice: a warning that the site manager was coming by for a surprise inspection. My mind flashed to the cluttered workbench I\u2019d left behind, tools scattered, sawdust everywhere\u2014a clear violation of safety protocols. As a carpenter, I knew the risks of a messy site: accidents, injuries, and the possibility of losing my job if I didn\u2019t set the right example. I felt torn, standing in the cereal aisle, heart pounding. My son needed guidance right now, but so did my team. Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
