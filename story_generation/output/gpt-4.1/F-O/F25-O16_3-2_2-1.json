Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call, just like every evening. It was our routine, a way to keep the fragile threads of our relationship strong. But right now, I was staring at a patient\u2019s chart, my mind racing through possible diagnoses. The symptoms didn\u2019t fit neatly into any box\u2014fever, joint pain, a strange rash. I needed to focus, to piece together the puzzle, to be the doctor my patient needed. But the guilt gnawed at me. If I ignored my stepmother, would she feel pushed aside again? If I answered, would I miss a crucial detail in the case? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My phone buzzed again. I closed my eyes, torn between the family I was trying to hold onto and the patient who depended on me."}
