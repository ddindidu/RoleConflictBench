He was distracted, headphones in, about to step off the curb without checking for traffic. My heart leapt\u2014our parents always said I should look out for him, especially since he\u2019s still getting used to the city. At the same moment, my phone buzzed with an email from work: a professional development seminar, optional but highly recommended, and the sign-up window was short. I knew my supervisor expected quick responses to these opportunities, a mark of commitment and professionalism. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I dash across the street to stop my brother, risking being late or missing the email response, or should I stay put and handle my work responsibilities, hoping he\u2019d be okay? My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect my family and the expectation to be a model employee. I could feel my pulse in my ears, caught in the split-second tension of two worlds colliding."}
