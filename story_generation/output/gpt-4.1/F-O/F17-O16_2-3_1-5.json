It\u2019s Sunday evening\u2014my weekly call home. I can already picture my mother waiting by the phone, eager for stories about my week, her voice warm and expectant. I know how much these calls mean to her, especially since Dad\u2019s health started to decline. She needs reassurance, a reminder that I\u2019m still her child, still connected.\n\nBut inside the room, a family waits for me, their faces drawn with worry. I have to tell them that their loved one\u2019s prognosis is not good. They need me to be present, to explain things gently, to answer their questions with patience and empathy. My pager vibrates again\u2014my mother, calling for the third time. I feel torn, my heart pulled in two directions. I want to be the attentive child my parents need, but right now, I am also the doctor this family desperately needs. The hallway feels smaller, the air heavier, as I stand frozen, caught between two worlds, unable to move forward in either."}
