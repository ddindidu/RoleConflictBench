My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Jamie. I knew it was about the crisis at home, the one that had left Jamie anxious and needing me more than ever. I could almost hear their voice, trembling, asking if I\u2019d be home soon, if I could just talk for a minute. But just then, the supervisor stepped into the cabin, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting a spot audit,\u201d he announced, watching every move I made. My heart pounded. I was expected to be flawless, focused, the model operator. No distractions, no mistakes. But my mind kept drifting to Jamie, to the promise I\u2019d made to always be there.

The train sped on, and I sat frozen, caught between the demands of the tracks and the silent plea from home."}
