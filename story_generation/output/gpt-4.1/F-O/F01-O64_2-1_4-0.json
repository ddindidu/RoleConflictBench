It was a slow afternoon, just a handful of customers waiting patiently. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter. \u201cDad, can you come home early? Lily wants to tell everyone her big news.\u201d My granddaughter\u2019s excitement leapt from the screen, and I pictured her bright eyes, waiting for me to be there, to listen, to celebrate. But as I glanced at the line, I saw Mrs. Patel, who always double-checks her receipts, and a young couple with a full cart. My manager expected every transaction to be perfect, no mistakes, no delays. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the need to be the reliable cashier, the anchor of the store, and the loving grandfather, present for the moments that matter. My hands trembled slightly as I scanned a can of soup, my mind torn between the beep of the register and the laughter I could almost hear at home."}
