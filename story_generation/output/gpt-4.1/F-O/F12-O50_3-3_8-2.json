He needed me to be present, to share my fears and hopes, to be his partner in this moment. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. The life-support device in the ICU was failing, and I was the only one who could diagnose the fault before it endangered a patient\u2019s life. My husband\u2019s voice trembled as he asked, \u201cAre you really here with me?\u201d I felt the weight of his need for openness, for reassurance, but the hospital\u2019s call pressed on my conscience. I was torn between the promise I made to him\u2014to be fully present, to communicate without holding back\u2014and the unspoken oath I carried as a repairer, to never let a machine\u2019s failure cost a life. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
