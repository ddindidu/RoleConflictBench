The defendant\u2019s fate hung in the balance, waiting for my signature and the detailed conditions I needed to draft with precision and clarity. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s name lighting up the screen. He was in the middle of finals, his anxiety peaking, and he\u2019d always counted on me to be there, especially since our parents married and we promised to support each other through anything. I could hear his voice trembling in the voicemail, asking if I could talk, just for a few minutes. My mind raced: the court expected my immediate attention, a clear and thorough order, no mistakes. But my heart ached for my brother, knowing how much he needed me right now. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
