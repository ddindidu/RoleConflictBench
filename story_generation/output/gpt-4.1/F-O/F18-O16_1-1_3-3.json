My parents chimed in, asking if I could finally join them after so many missed outings. I smiled, feeling the warmth of belonging, and promised I\u2019d try to keep my Saturday free. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about Mrs. Lee\u2019s appointment tomorrow. She\u2019s been anxious lately, needing extra reassurance and time during her check-ups. As a doctor, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, and to answer every question with patience and clarity. My family expects me to be there, to laugh and share memories, but my patients rely on me for comfort and guidance. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, wishing I could be fully present in both worlds. My heart aches as I realize I can\u2019t give all of myself to both at once."}
