She\u2019d asked if I could call her during my lunch break, wanting to share every detail. As a grandparent, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014she needed my encouragement, my presence, my listening ear. But just as I was about to dial her number, my pager shrieked.

As a doctor, I was expected to act fast, assess the situation, and prescribe the right treatment without delay. My heart twisted as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of family and the urgency of my duty.

The demands of both worlds collided, and for a moment, I sat frozen, caught between the call of love and the call to heal."}
