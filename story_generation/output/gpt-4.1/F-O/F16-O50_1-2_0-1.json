I could see the fatigue in their eyes, the way they lingered in the doorway, waiting for me to ask, to listen, to care. I wanted to be there, to offer a hug, to let them vent and feel heard.

They needed me to diagnose the problem, fast, before the delay spiraled into a costly shutdown. My mind raced with possible causes, but my heart tugged toward my partner, who needed comfort, not a distracted nod. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, knowing I couldn\u2019t give it to both at once."}
