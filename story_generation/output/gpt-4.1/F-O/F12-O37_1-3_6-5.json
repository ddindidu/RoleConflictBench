He asked, \u201cHow was work?\u201d and I knew he wanted more than just a one-word answer. He always says open communication is important, that we should share the details of our days, not just the headlines. I started to tell him about a funny moment with a client, but my mind kept drifting back to the supply closet at my last cleaning job. I\u2019d discovered we were out of the specialized cleaner Mrs. Lee insists on for her marble counters, and I was supposed to manage the supplies. If I didn\u2019t fix it before tomorrow, I\u2019d be letting her down\u2014and possibly risking my job.\n\nMy husband leaned in, waiting for me to open up, but all I could think about was whether I could find the cleaner tonight or if I\u2019d have to call Mrs. Lee and admit my mistake. I wanted to be present, to share my thoughts and feelings with him, but the pressure of my other role pressed in, making it hard to focus on anything else."}
