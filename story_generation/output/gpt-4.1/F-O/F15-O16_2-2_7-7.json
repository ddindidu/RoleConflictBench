As a parent, I knew the bills were piling up at home\u2014rent, groceries, my daughter\u2019s school fees. My paycheck barely stretched far enough, and every day I felt the weight of providing for my family. Today, a pharmaceutical rep had just left my office, offering a generous incentive for prescribing their new medication. The money could help cover our living expenses, maybe even give my kids something extra. But as a doctor, I stared at my patient\u2019s chart, knowing she needed a very specific treatment for her autoimmune disease\u2014one that wasn\u2019t the drug being pushed. My oath demanded I put her health first, to prescribe only what was best for her. The pressure from home gnawed at me, while my professional integrity pulled in the opposite direction. My hands trembled as I reached for my prescription pad, caught between the needs of my family and the trust my patient placed in me."}
