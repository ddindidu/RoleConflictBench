My stepmom\u2019s voice echoed from the picnic tables behind me, calling everyone for the family holiday toast. It was one of those traditions she insisted I join, a way to show I was really part of the family. I could see her watching, waiting for me to come over and raise my glass with everyone else. But my job as a lifeguard demanded I stay alert, eyes on the swimmers. A couple of kids were drifting toward the deep end, nothing urgent, but I knew how quickly things could change. My stepmom\u2019s expectation pressed on me\u2014I could almost feel her disappointment if I didn\u2019t join. At the same time, the weight of responsibility as a lifeguard kept me rooted to my chair. I felt torn, heart pounding, caught between being the stepchild who wanted to belong and the lifeguard who couldn\u2019t look away."}
