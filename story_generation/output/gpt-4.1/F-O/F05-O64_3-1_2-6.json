My mind, though, is far from the beeping of the scanner and the polite exchanges. My wife texted me just before my shift started\u2014her father\u2019s health has taken a turn for the worse. She needs me, she said, her words heavy with fear and sadness. I want nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her hand and reassure her that we\u2019ll get through this together. But here I am, forced to keep my voice cheerful and my face pleasant for the steady trickle of customers. Each time I say, \u201cHave a nice day,\u201d I feel a pang of guilt, knowing my wife is alone, waiting for my comfort. The expectation to be present and supportive at home clashes with the demand to be friendly and attentive at work. My heart aches with the pull in both directions, and I can\u2019t help but wonder how I can possibly be the husband she needs and the cashier my job requires\u2014all at the same time."}
