It was my younger sister, inviting me to join her and our cousins for a weekend hike. She sounded excited, reminding me how we\u2019d promised to spend more time together and not drift apart. I could hear the hope in her voice, the expectation that I\u2019d say yes, that I\u2019d be there as her brother, not just a name on her contact list. But as I looked at the half-finished plans on my workbench, anxiety crept in. The client needed the bookshelf by next week, and I still had to estimate the wood, order supplies, and start the assembly. If I delayed, I\u2019d risk my reputation as a reliable carpenter. My mind raced between the warmth of family and the weight of professional responsibility. I wanted to be the brother who showed up, but I also needed to be the craftsman who delivered on time. The pressure of both roles pressed in, and I stood there, torn, unable to move forward in either direction."}
