He asked, \u201cRough day?\u201d and I hesitated, feeling the weight of expectation. As his wife, I knew he wanted me to open up, to share the stress that had been gnawing at me since my shift ended. But my mind was still circling the chaos from earlier\u2014dozens of flights stacked in holding patterns, pilots\u2019 voices tense in my headset, the airspace a puzzle I had to solve in real time. I was supposed to be present now, to communicate honestly, but my thoughts kept looping back to the radar screen, the pressure of keeping everyone safe. I wanted to tell him everything, but I also wanted to shield him from the anxiety, to keep my professional worries from invading our home. The silence stretched, and I felt torn\u2014between the need to be a supportive partner and the responsibility that still lingered from the tower."}
