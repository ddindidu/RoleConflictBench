He wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, and if I\u2019d remembered to call my mom. I knew they expected me to keep in touch, to share the little details of my life, to reassure them that I was okay. But I was sitting in a conference room, surrounded by whiteboards covered in diagrams and half-formed ideas. As the team\u2019s engineer, I was supposed to be fully present, brainstorming technical solutions for a project that was still in its infancy. My manager expected me to focus, to contribute new ideas, to help shape the direction of our work. I felt my attention split, my mind tugged between the warmth of family connection and the cool logic of engineering design. I wanted to be the attentive step-child, but I also needed to be the dedicated engineer. My phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
