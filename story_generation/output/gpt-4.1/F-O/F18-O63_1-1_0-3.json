My sales numbers flashed on the screen\u2014already ahead of quota, but the manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep pushing, don\u2019t let up.\u201d I was about to dial the next number when my phone vibrated. It was a text from my sister: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about my exam.\u201d I knew how much this test meant to her, how she\u2019d been losing sleep, her confidence unraveling. I was supposed to be there for her, to listen, to reassure her that she could do it. But the clock was ticking, and every minute I spent away from the phones was a minute I wasn\u2019t selling, a minute I risked losing my edge. My heart twisted as I stared at her message, torn between the pressure to keep my numbers up and the need to be the supportive sibling she counted on. I hovered over the call button, my sister\u2019s anxious words blurring with the relentless demands of my job, caught in the space between duty and love."}
