It means a lot to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how much this tradition mattered, how much they wanted me to step up and show I belonged. But as I glanced at the clock, I saw the hands creeping toward closing time, and Mrs. Patel\u2019s voice rose above the hum of hairdryers. \u201cThis is not what I asked for! I can\u2019t go to my event like this!\u201d Her eyes flashed in the mirror, and I could feel the other stylists watching, waiting to see how I\u2019d handle it. I wanted to fix her hair, to make her happy, to prove I was a professional who cared. But my family was waiting, expecting me to be there, to honor them. My hands shook as I held the scissors, torn between the salon\u2019s fluorescent lights and the warm glow of home, between being the dutiful step-child and the dedicated hairdresser.
