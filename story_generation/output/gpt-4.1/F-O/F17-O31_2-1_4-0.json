My heart sank as I recognized it\u2014my own family\u2019s house. Tonight was our annual celebration, a tradition passed down for generations, and my parents had reminded me all week how important it was to keep our customs alive. As I pulled up, I could see the lights, hear the laughter, and smell the familiar food drifting through the air. My badge felt heavy on my chest. As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to be impartial and fair, even if it meant shutting down my own family\u2019s party. But as a child, I was expected to honor my family, to protect our traditions, and not bring shame or disappointment. I could already imagine the looks on their faces if I walked in as an officer instead of a son. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
