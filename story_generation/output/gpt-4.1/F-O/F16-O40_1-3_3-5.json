My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I know it\u2019s my turn. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, and I see the fatigue in their eyes after work. But my own hands are rough and aching from a long day at the workshop, and tomorrow looms large\u2014a new project, the biggest I\u2019ve had in months. The blueprints are spread across the kitchen table, lines and measurements blurring together. I need to study them, to make sure I don\u2019t miss a single detail. If I mess this up, it could cost me the job. My mind tugs in two directions: the warmth of our home, the promise I made, and the weight of my tools, the responsibility to get it right. I stand in the hallway, caught between the laundry and the blueprints, heart pounding, wishing I could split myself in two."}
