My mind was half on the article, half on the clock, knowing I had only a few minutes before my shift resumed. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just gotten some terrible news about our dad\u2019s health, and I could almost hear the panic in his words. As a step-sibling, I knew he expected me to be there, to listen, to help him process the shock. But as a pharmacist, I was expected to stay sharp, keep up with the latest medications, and return to the counter ready to answer questions from patients and doctors alike. My heart twisted as I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to call him immediately and the professional responsibility pressing on me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which expectation I would have to let down."}
