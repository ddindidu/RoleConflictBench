I start to tell her about a difficult passenger earlier, but my phone buzzes. My shift starts soon. I kiss her goodbye, promising we\u2019ll talk more later.\n\nOn the subway, I slip into my operator\u2019s seat, headset on. The intercom crackles: \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me how to get to the hospital?\u201d My job is to keep everyone safe, to answer questions calmly and clearly, even when I\u2019m distracted. But my mind drifts back to my wife, to the conversation left hanging, to her disappointed face. I want to be present for her, to communicate like she needs, but right now, a train full of passengers depends on me. The intercom blinks again, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
