My younger brother\u2019s eyes lit up as he suggested a hiking trip, and my mother looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d join in for once. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who showed up, who laughed and made memories. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the workshop. I\u2019d left in a rush, sawdust everywhere, tools scattered. The safety protocols were clear: always leave the site clean and organized to prevent accidents. If I didn\u2019t go back and tidy up, someone could get hurt. My boss trusted me to set an example. My family wanted me present, but my responsibility as a carpenter tugged at me, reminding me of what could go wrong if I ignored it. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my heart torn between being the reliable sister and the responsible carpenter, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
