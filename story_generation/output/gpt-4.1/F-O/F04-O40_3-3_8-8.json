She wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the argument we\u2019d had last week. She said we needed to clear the air, to rebuild the trust between us. I knew she was right. As her brother, I owed her honesty and patience, a willingness to listen and work through our misunderstandings. But as she spoke, my eyes kept drifting to the jagged, splintered beams in the living room. The homeowner had called me in a panic that morning; termites had eaten through the support posts, and the whole structure was at risk. They needed an urgent repair plan, and I was the only carpenter available on such short notice. My mind raced with calculations and possible solutions, but my heart ached with the weight of my sister\u2019s words. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my craft. Both needed me now, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
