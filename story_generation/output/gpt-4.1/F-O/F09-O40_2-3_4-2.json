I knew I should call him back, teach him about respect and discipline, remind him that running in public places isn\u2019t safe or polite. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014guides her child, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from the site manager: \u201cTool inspection due before noon. Safety first.\u201d As a carpenter, I can\u2019t afford to skip checks\u2014one missed detail could mean an accident, or worse. My mind raced between the two worlds. If I stop now to discipline my son, I\u2019ll be late for the inspection, risking not just my job but everyone\u2019s safety. If I rush out, I\u2019ll miss a crucial moment to teach him right from wrong. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, heart pounding, torn between the mother my son needs and the carpenter my crew depends on."}
