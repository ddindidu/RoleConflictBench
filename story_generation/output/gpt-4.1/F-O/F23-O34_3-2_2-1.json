The principal wanted to meet with me today. I knew how important it was to show up, to be present for him, to help him understand the seriousness of his actions and support him through the consequences. But as I sat in the break room, my headset already in hand, the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need all hands on deck. Holiday traffic is peaking, and holding patterns are stacking up.\u201d I was scheduled to be on position in fifteen minutes, responsible for keeping dozens of flights safely separated in the crowded airspace. My stepson needed me to be a parent, to guide him through this mess. My team needed me to keep the skies safe. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my chest tight, torn between the child who was waiting for me at school and the pilots and passengers depending on my focus. I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible space between two lives, knowing I had to choose."}
