It was a text from my mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Call us when you can.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014Sunday evening. I hadn\u2019t spoken to my parents all week, and guilt pricked at me. I knew they worried when I went silent, and I could almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, hoping for a few minutes of my time.\n\nBut in front of me, a patient was deteriorating fast. The infection was spreading, and I needed to decide on a course of powerful antibiotics, balancing risks and benefits, double-checking allergies, and coordinating with the pharmacy. Every second counted. My mind raced with medical protocols, but my heart tugged toward my family, the expectation to be present, to reassure them I was okay.\n\nI stood in the harsh hospital light, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the quiet, persistent love of my parents, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
