My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you please help with the folding tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes again, a reminder from the office: the purchase agreement needs my review before tomorrow\u2019s filing deadline. If I miss it, the client could lose the deal, and my reputation is on the line. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in. My laptop sits open on the table, legal documents waiting for my attention, while the laundry waits for my hands. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me\u2014am I letting down my wife, or my client? My mind races, weighing the expectations, the promises, the consequences. I take a deep breath, paralyzed by the impossible choice, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
