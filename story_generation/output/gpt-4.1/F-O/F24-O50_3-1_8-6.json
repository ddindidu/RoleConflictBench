It was a new client, calling right on schedule for their first check-in. I answered, trying to keep my voice steady as I watched my stepbrother fidget impatiently beside me. The client\u2019s questions were simple\u2014just basic operating tips for the new machine I\u2019d installed last week\u2014but I could hear the uncertainty in their voice, and I knew they expected clear, reassuring guidance. \n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw my stepbrother step forward, glancing at his phone instead of the traffic. My heart jumped. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially after everything we\u2019d been through together. But the client was still talking, waiting for my answer, and I could feel the pressure to be professional, to not let them down. My mind raced, torn between shouting a warning to my stepbrother and giving the client the attention they deserved. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
