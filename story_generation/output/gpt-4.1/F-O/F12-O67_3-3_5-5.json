My husband was bustling around, setting the table, and I could hear the hum of the vacuum in the living room. Relatives would arrive in less than an hour, and the house still felt chaotic. I knew he was counting on me to help make everything perfect, to share the load and present a united, welcoming front. My phone buzzed, and I saw the dispatcher\u2019s number flash on the screen. A man nearby was having severe chest pain\u2014possible heart attack. My hands trembled as I wiped them on a towel, my mind racing. I was the closest ambulance driver on shift, and every second mattered for the patient\u2019s life. But if I left now, my husband would be left alone to finish everything, and our guests would walk into a mess. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my heart pounding as I stood frozen between the kitchen and the door, torn by the demands of duty and home."}
