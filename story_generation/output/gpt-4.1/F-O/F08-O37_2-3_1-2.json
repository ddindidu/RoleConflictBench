Glancing up, I saw my granddaughter curled up on the couch, her eyes red and distant. My heart ached to go to her, to sit beside her and offer the comfort and wisdom she always sought from me. I knew she needed me\u2014needed the gentle words only a grandmother could give, the reassurance that things would get better. But the checklist from my supervisor echoed in my mind: every room must be spotless, every surface sanitized, no exceptions. I was already behind schedule, and the thought of leaving a job half-done filled me with dread. My hands trembled as I gripped the mop, torn between the urge to drop everything for my granddaughter and the pressure to meet the standards expected of me as a cleaner. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my work."}
