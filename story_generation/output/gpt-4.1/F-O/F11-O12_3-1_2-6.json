I really need you.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20144:45 p.m. I was deep in the middle of debugging a UI glitch that QA had flagged again. It wasn\u2019t a showstopper, but my manager had made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s get this fixed before tomorrow\u2019s release.\u201d I could hear the stress in my sister\u2019s text, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But my screen was filled with lines of code, and I was so close to finding the root cause. If I stopped now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, and the bug might slip into production. My heart pounded as I stared at her message, torn between the urge to call her immediately and the pressure to deliver at work. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the sister she needed and the developer my team relied on."}
