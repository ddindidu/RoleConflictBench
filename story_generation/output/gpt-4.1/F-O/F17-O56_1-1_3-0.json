It was almost time for the family holiday dinner, the one my parents insisted I never miss. They always said, \u201cFamily comes first, no matter what.\u201d I could already hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me to be on time, to help set the table, to honor our traditions. But just as I was about to finish up for the day, Mrs. Lee, one of my regulars, walked in. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly greeting and chat that made her feel at home here. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee always preferred me. I could see the anticipation in her eyes, the comfort she found in our little rituals. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the warmth of my family waiting at home and the trust my client placed in me. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
