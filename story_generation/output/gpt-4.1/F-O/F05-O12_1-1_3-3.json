My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve got a late call.\u201d I promised I would, but now, as I open my laptop, a new message pops up\u2014Product has scheduled a brainstorming session for tomorrow. Attendance is \u201coptional,\u201d but I know what that really means. If I skip it, I\u2019ll miss out on shaping the new features, maybe even lose some credibility with the other teams. If I go, I\u2019ll be home late, and the laundry will still be there, untouched, a quiet sign that I\u2019m not pulling my weight at home. My chest tightens as I picture my wife\u2019s tired face, the unspoken disappointment. I want to be a good partner, but I also want to be seen as a team player at work. I sit on the edge of the couch, laptop on my knees, laundry at my side, torn between two worlds that both expect more than I feel I can give."}
