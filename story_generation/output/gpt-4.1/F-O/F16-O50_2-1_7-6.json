I knew I should ask what was wrong, open up the conversation like we promised we would. But just as I reached for their hand, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling for the first time. I answered, and they immediately started asking about the machine\u2019s basic functions, clearly nervous and needing reassurance. I could hear the expectation in their voice\u2014they wanted clear, patient guidance, and I was the expert. But as I tried to explain the start-up process, I saw my spouse\u2019s shoulders slump, their eyes fixed on the table. My heart twisted. I wanted to be present, to listen and support them, but I also couldn\u2019t let the client down. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I felt torn, my words to the client growing mechanical as my mind raced, caught between the demands of being a good partner and a reliable professional."}
