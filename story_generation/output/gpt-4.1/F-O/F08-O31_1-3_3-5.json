My daughter and her family were coming over, and I\u2019d promised my grandkids we\u2019d bake cookies together. The kitchen was already filled with the scent of cinnamon, and I could hear their laughter from the living room. Just as I was about to join them, my phone buzzed\u2014dispatch calling. There was a violent assault happening downtown, and officers were needed immediately. I could hear the urgency in the dispatcher\u2019s voice, the fear in the background. My badge felt heavy in my pocket. I glanced at the clock, then at the flour-dusted faces waiting for me. My family expected me to be present, to be the warm, loving grandmother I wanted to be. But my duty as a police officer demanded I protect those in danger, to respond without hesitation. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the safety of strangers and the warmth of my family, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
