It was my stepdad, his voice trembling. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now.\u201d He never called me at work unless it was serious. I could hear the weight in his words, the kind that made me want to drop everything and just listen, be the support he rarely asked for. But the factory floor was tense\u2014every minute the line was down cost us more, and the supervisor\u2019s eyes kept darting to the clock, silently urging me to hurry. I could almost feel the pressure of both worlds squeezing me. My stepdad needed me to be present, to care, to listen. My team needed me to fix the machine, to keep production moving. I stared at the blinking error code, my phone warm in my hand, torn between the family I was still learning to belong to and the job that demanded my focus. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which call to answer first."}
