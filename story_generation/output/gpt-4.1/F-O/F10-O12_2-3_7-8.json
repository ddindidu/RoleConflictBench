The outage is traced to my code, and users are locked out. My manager\u2019s messages are urgent, and the QA team is waiting for my fix. I know I need to focus, but from the kitchen, I hear my parents\u2019 voices\u2014tired, tense, and quieter than usual. Lately, they\u2019ve seemed weighed down, and I promised myself I\u2019d be there for them, especially now. My mom calls my name, her voice softer than usual, and I can hear the worry in it. I want to close my laptop and sit with them, to listen and offer comfort, but the pressure from work is crushing. I feel pulled in two directions, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turn. My hands hover over the keyboard, mind racing, as I try to decide who needs me more right now."}
