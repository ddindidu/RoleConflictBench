My phone buzzed quietly in my lap\u2014a new pharmacy newsletter notification. I knew I should be present, laughing at my stepbrother\u2019s jokes, asking about my stepmom\u2019s new job, but my mind kept drifting to the headline: \u201cCritical New Drug Approvals This Month.\u201d As a pharmacist, I was expected to stay sharp, always up-to-date, and I felt the weight of that responsibility. But here, as a step-sibling, I was supposed to be part of this family, to show I cared, to help us all feel a little less like strangers. My stepmom caught my eye, smiling, and I felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to be both\u2014engaged family member and diligent professional\u2014but the demands pulled me in opposite directions. My thumb hovered over the newsletter link, heart pounding, as laughter echoed around me."}
