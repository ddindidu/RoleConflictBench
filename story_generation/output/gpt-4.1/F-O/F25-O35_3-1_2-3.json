I know it\u2019s my stepmom\u2014she expects me to check in every day, to share how my shift is going, to answer her questions about dinner plans and my mood. I can almost hear her voice in my head, worried if I don\u2019t reply quickly. But right now, I\u2019m gripping the controls of the subway train, eyes flicking between the tracks and the blinking lights on my panel. The intercom crackles, and a passenger\u2019s voice comes through, asking for directions to the hospital stop. I\u2019m supposed to answer promptly, keep everyone calm, make sure the ride is safe. My phone vibrates again, more insistent this time. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014if I ignore my stepmom, she\u2019ll worry, maybe even call my dad. But if I take my attention off the train, even for a second, I could miss something important. My hands sweat on the controls as I stare at the intercom, torn between the two worlds that both need me right now."}
