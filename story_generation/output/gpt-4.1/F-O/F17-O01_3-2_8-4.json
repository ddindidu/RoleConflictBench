Every square foot mattered\u2014each workspace needed to be just right, every corridor wide enough, every window placed for light. My phone buzzed, and I saw a message from Mom: \u201cCan you talk?\u201d I called her, and her voice trembled as she shared her worries about Dad\u2019s health, her loneliness, her fear. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she could lean on. I heard the pain in her words, felt the weight of her expectation\u2014her child, her comfort. But as she spoke, my mind kept drifting back to the unfinished floor plan, the looming deadline, the team waiting for my design. I wanted to be fully present for her, to offer the support she needed, but the demands of my work pressed in, urgent and unyielding. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being the child my parents needed and the architect my team depended on."}
