My hands gripped the steering wheel of the ambulance, knuckles white, as the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through the radio: \u201cMale, 58, chest pain, possible heart attack. Urgent response needed.\u201d My mind raced. I glanced at the photo of my kids taped to the dash\u2014today was the last day of school, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up, to be there when they ran out with their backpacks and summer dreams. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids at 3:00.\u201d I could almost hear their voices, see their faces searching the crowd for me. But the siren wailed, and the city blurred past, every second precious for the man waiting for help. My heart pounded with the weight of two worlds\u2014my children\u2019s expectant smiles, the desperate hope of a stranger\u2019s family. I felt torn, the demands of fatherhood and duty pulling me in opposite directions, each impossible to ignore."}
