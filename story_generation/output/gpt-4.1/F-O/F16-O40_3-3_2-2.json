She barely touched her toast, her eyes distant, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my steady presence. She\u2019d been unraveling for days, and I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d listen, that I\u2019d help her hold it together. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the big job, the one with the new crew and the old, finicky saws. As lead carpenter, it was on me to check every tool, every cord, every bolt before anyone lifted a hammer. If I rushed, skipped a step, or let my mind wander, someone could get hurt. My partner\u2019s hand found mine, squeezing tight, silently pleading for me to stay a little longer. My chest tightened. I was needed in two places at once, both demands urgent, both unforgiving. I stood in the kitchen, torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, unsure which role to answer first."}
