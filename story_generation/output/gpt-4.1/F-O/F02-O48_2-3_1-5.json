The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in half an hour, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But here I was, standing outside Mr. Lee\u2019s room, my uniform crisp, clipboard in hand. He was in critical condition, and the doctor had just emphasized how important it was to monitor his vital signs every few minutes. My supervisor trusted me to be thorough, to not let anything slip. I could almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice in my head, asking if I\u2019d be in the front row, watching her read her story. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility for Mr. Lee\u2019s fragile life. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the open class, and I felt torn in two, caught between the expectations of being a good father and a reliable nursing assistant. My hands trembled as I stared at the clock, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to make the call."}
