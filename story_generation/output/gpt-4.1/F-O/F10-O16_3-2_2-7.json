I could almost hear her gentle voice, asking if I\u2019d eaten, if I was sleeping enough, if I\u2019d remembered to water my plants. We talked every day, and she expected me to share everything\u2014my worries, my triumphs, even the mundane details. But right now, I was sitting across from Mr. Lee, a patient whose autoimmune disease had flared up again. He needed me to focus, to review his complex chart, to adjust his medications with precision. My pager beeped, and my mother\u2019s message popped up: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d Guilt twisted in my chest.

I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
