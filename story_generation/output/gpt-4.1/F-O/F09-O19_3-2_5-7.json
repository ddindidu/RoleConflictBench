My phone buzzed in my bag, and I saw the school\u2019s number flash on the screen. My heart skipped. I slipped out quietly and answered. The principal\u2019s voice was stern: my son had been caught stealing snacks at the corner store. My mind raced. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and discipline. But as a pharmacist, I was expected to stay in this workshop, to absorb every update so I could counsel patients safely and competently. Both roles demanded my full attention at this very moment. I felt torn\u2014my son needed me to be present, to help him learn from his mistake, but my professional responsibility pressed on me, too. I stood in the hallway, clutching my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
