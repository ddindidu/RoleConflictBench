Lately, my husband had seemed distant, and I knew I should talk to him, share my own worries, and listen to his. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or busy we were. As I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expected me to report even the smallest error, and I\u2019d seen coworkers get in trouble for less. But if I stayed late to sort it out, I\u2019d be late getting home, and I\u2019d miss the quiet moment when my husband finally opened up. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, torn between the rules of my job and the promise I made to my marriage."}
