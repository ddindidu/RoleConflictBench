He held up a half-opened candy bar, explaining that my son had been caught slipping it into his pocket. My heart pounded as I knelt down, trying to find the right words to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him as a father should. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed insistently. It was an urgent email from the tax authority\u2014there was a discrepancy in a client\u2019s file, and they needed an immediate response or we\u2019d face penalties. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my son, who needed my full attention and guidance in this crucial moment, and my responsibility as an accountant, where a single mistake could cost my firm dearly. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding I act now, each unwilling to wait."}
