My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cCan you help fold these tonight?\u201d\u2014and I know she\u2019s right. We both work, and sharing the load is only fair. But my laptop screen glows from the dining table, code review comments blinking like warning lights. \u201cPerformance issues in the new feature,\u201d my team lead wrote. The deadline is tomorrow, and I\u2019m the only one who understands this part of the code well enough to fix it quickly.\n\nMy mind races, torn between the expectation to be a reliable partner at home and a responsible developer at work. If I ignore the laundry, I\u2019ll let my wife down, adding to her stress. If I ignore the code, I risk the team\u2019s trust and the project\u2019s success. My hands hover between the laundry basket and the keyboard, heart pounding as I weigh the demands pulling me in opposite directions."}
