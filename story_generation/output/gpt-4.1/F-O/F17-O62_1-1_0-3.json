As a lifeguard, I\u2019m supposed to keep everything in order, not just the water but the whole area. I notice a few pool chairs are out of line, not dangerous, but not how they should be. My supervisor always says, \u201cA tidy pool is a safe pool.\u201d I know I should fix them right away. But then my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from Mom. She\u2019s checking in, like she always does on weekends, and I remember I haven\u2019t texted her all day. She worries if I don\u2019t reply, and I promised I\u2019d keep in touch. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the responsible lifeguard who keeps the pool perfect, and the caring child who reassures their parents. My heart pounds as I stand there, torn between picking up my phone to text Mom and straightening the chairs before my supervisor notices."}
