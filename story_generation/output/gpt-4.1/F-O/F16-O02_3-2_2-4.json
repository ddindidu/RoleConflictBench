My phone buzzed again\u2014a message from my partner, who was upstairs, struggling through another wave of anxiety after the news about their parent\u2019s health. They needed me, not just in the room, but present, attentive, a steady anchor in the storm. I wanted to go to them, to hold their hand and listen, to reassure them that we\u2019d get through this together.\n\nBut the clock on my screen glared at me. The new safety standard was going into effect tomorrow, and I was the lead engineer responsible for ensuring our product met every requirement. The compliance report was due by midnight, and any oversight could mean a costly delay or, worse, a safety risk. My team was counting on me to catch every detail, to be thorough and unyielding.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled upstairs, my mind tethered to the technical demands in front of me. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I could feel the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides."}
