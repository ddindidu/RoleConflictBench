The principal wanted me to come in immediately. My mind raced with worry and disappointment\u2014what had gotten into him? I knew I needed to be there, to talk to him, to show him that I cared and that his actions had consequences. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I heard soft sobs from Room 204.
