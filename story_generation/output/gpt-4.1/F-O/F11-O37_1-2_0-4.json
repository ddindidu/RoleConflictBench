Can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you.\u201d I felt a surge of pride\u2014she\u2019d worked so hard, and I wanted nothing more than to be there, cheering her on, just like she\u2019d done for me so many times before. But as I set down my phone, my eyes landed on the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner in my cleaning cart. My client\u2019s apartment was spotless, but the next cleaning was in three days, and I knew there wouldn\u2019t be enough cleaner left. My supervisor had made it clear: supplies must be managed, and running out was unacceptable. I was expected to pick up more before my shift ended, but the store was across town, and I\u2019d barely have time to make it to my sister\u2019s dinner if I went.
