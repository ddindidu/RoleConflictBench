As a son, I try to check in with my parents regularly, especially since Dad\u2019s health has been shaky lately. I know they count on me to ask how things are at home, to listen, to reassure them. But right now, I\u2019m in the middle of a detailed counseling session with Mr. Lee, a patient juggling a complicated regimen of high-risk medications. He\u2019s anxious, and I need to be thorough\u2014one missed detail could have serious consequences. My mind keeps drifting to my parents, wondering if something\u2019s wrong, but I can\u2019t rush this consultation.

I feel torn, guilt creeping in as I try to focus on Mr. Lee\u2019s questions, my phone buzzing quietly in my pocket, each vibration a reminder of the expectations I\u2019m struggling to meet."}
