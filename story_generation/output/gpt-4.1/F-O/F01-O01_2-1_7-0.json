My daughter had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with messages\u2014everyone sharing in her excitement, asking questions, sending encouragement. I knew I should join in, offer my support, keep the connection strong. That\u2019s what a good grandfather does, especially now, when she\u2019s looking for reassurance and pride from her family.\n\nBut my eyes kept drifting back to the plans in front of me. There were small inconsistencies in the drawings\u2014nothing catastrophic, but enough to nag at me. As an architect, I\u2019m expected to catch these things, to ensure every detail is safe and compliant. If I let it slide, even if it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems, I\u2019d be betraying the trust placed in me by my colleagues and the people who will use this building.\n\nMy phone buzzed again, a photo of my granddaughter beaming at her mother\u2019s new office. I felt the pull from both sides\u2014my family waiting for my words, my professional duty demanding my focus. I stared at the screen, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in."}
