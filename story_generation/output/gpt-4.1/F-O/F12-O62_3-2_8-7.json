We needed to talk about the medical bills piling up, about how we\u2019d manage if his condition worsened. He looked at me, waiting for honesty, for the open communication we\u2019d promised each other. My phone buzzed on the table\u2014my shift at the pool had started ten minutes ago. I rushed out, promising we\u2019d finish the talk tonight.\n\nAt the pool, I scanned the water, my mind still tangled in our unfinished conversation. Suddenly, I spotted a group of teenagers laughing and running dangerously close to the edge, ignoring the bold NO DIVING signs. My duty as a lifeguard screamed at me to intervene, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. But my thoughts kept drifting back to my husband, to the words I hadn\u2019t said, to the trust I might be breaking by not being fully present with him. I stood at the pool\u2019s edge, torn between the whistle in my hand and the promise in my heart, feeling the pull of both worlds and not knowing which to answer first."}
