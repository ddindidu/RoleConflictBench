He sounded tired, his words trailing off as he described a difficult meeting. I could see he needed me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe even just a hug. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014dispatch. I was needed for a call: a patient with a sprained ankle, nothing life-threatening, but the address was across town, and traffic was already building up. I felt the familiar tug inside me. My husband looked at me, waiting for a response, his eyes searching for reassurance. At the same time, I knew the city expected me to be behind the wheel, alert and focused, getting to the patient as quickly and safely as possible. My heart raced as I stood between these two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
