My son shuffled into the room, dragging his feet, mumbling a half-hearted \u201cgood morning\u201d without looking up. I knew I should remind him to greet people properly, to look them in the eye, to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d That\u2019s what a good father does\u2014teaches his child respect and discipline, especially in these small, everyday moments. But the numbers on my screen blurred together, the deadline for closing the books looming over me like a storm cloud. My manager had already sent two reminder emails this morning, and I could almost feel the weight of the company\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders. I wanted to close the laptop, to focus on my son, to be present and guide him. But the thought of missing the deadline, of letting my team down, made my stomach twist. I sat there, torn, the demands of fatherhood and my job pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
