The delivery app pinged, reminding me that a signature was required\u2014no exceptions. My phone buzzed again, this time with a message from my partner: \u201cCan you pick up the kids? School\u2019s almost out.\u201d I pictured their faces, waiting at the curb, scanning every car that passed. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially after missing the last school event.\n\nBut the customer for this delivery was running late, and company policy was clear: I couldn\u2019t just leave the package. If I skipped the signature, I\u2019d risk a complaint or even my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the two roles\u2014step-parent and delivery person\u2014each demanding my presence, each with its own consequences. I stared at the house, then at the clock, feeling the pressure build as the minutes ticked by, torn between the expectations of my family and my work."}
