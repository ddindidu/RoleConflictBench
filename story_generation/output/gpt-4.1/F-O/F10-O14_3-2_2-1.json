The specialized microscope I reserved is finally free, but only for the next two hours. Months of planning have led to this moment, and every minute counts.

I picture her waiting, phone in hand, growing anxious with each unanswered ring. My mind races: if I answer, I risk contaminating the samples or missing a critical step. If I ignore her, I\u2019ll break our unspoken promise and worry her.
