The case was complex, and I knew the attorneys would expect me to be fully prepared. My phone buzzed. It was my younger sister, inviting me to join her and our friends for dinner\u2014a rare chance to reconnect, something I\u2019d promised I\u2019d do more often. She sounded hopeful, reminding me how much it meant to her when I showed up, how it made her feel included. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the unopened files. As a brother, I wanted to be there, to show her she mattered. As a judge, I owed it to the parties to be thorough and fair, to give their case the attention it deserved. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt the familiar knot of guilt and responsibility tighten in my chest. I stared at my phone, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
