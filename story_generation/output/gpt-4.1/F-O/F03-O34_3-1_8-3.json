My shift had just started when my phone buzzed\u2014Dad\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I hesitated, but answered, expecting a quick hello. Instead, his voice trembled as he confided in me about Mom\u2019s recent health scare, his words heavy with worry. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the steady son he could lean on. My heart clenched; I wanted nothing more than to comfort him, to tell him everything would be okay.\n\nBut in my other ear, the radio crackled. \u201cCenter, this is Delta 452, requesting altimeter setting.\u201d The pilot\u2019s voice was calm, routine, but I knew the importance of every instruction.
