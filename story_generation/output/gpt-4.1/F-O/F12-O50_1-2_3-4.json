My husband had mentioned, not unkindly, that he was out of clean work shirts. I knew he expected me to help keep the house running smoothly, and I wanted to do my part. But my phone buzzed with a message from the plant manager: \u201cA few machines are running hot\u2014can you check them ASAP?\u201d I pictured the whirring gears, the smell of oil, the risk of a costly breakdown if I didn\u2019t get there soon. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014at home, the quiet expectation to fold and sort, to be present and supportive; at work, the urgent demand to prevent disaster, to be the reliable fixer. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each one needing me now, each one silently accusing me of neglect. My hands hovered over the laundry, but my thoughts were already with the machines, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
