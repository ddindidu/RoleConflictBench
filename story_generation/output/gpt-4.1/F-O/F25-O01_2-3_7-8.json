They\u2019d been so tired lately, their voices softer, their smiles forced. I knew they needed me, needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But every time I thought about leaving work early or even just calling home, guilt gnawed at me. My team depended on me to keep everything running smoothly. My family needed me to be present, to care. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both worlds pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
