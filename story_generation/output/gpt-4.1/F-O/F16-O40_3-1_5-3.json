My spouse was bustling around, her voice echoing from the hallway, \u201cCan you vacuum the living room next? My cousins will be here in three hours!\u201d I nodded, but my mind was already drifting to the workshop. The text on my phone was from a client: a rush order for a custom bookshelf, needed by the end of the week. I had to estimate the wood, hardware, and finish, and place the order today if I wanted the materials in time. My hands itched to grab my notepad and start sketching, but the vacuum waited, and so did the dust on the shelves. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my partner counting on me to help make our home shine, my client expecting my craftsmanship and reliability. My heart thudded with anxiety as I stared at the vacuum, the phone still buzzing, torn between the demands of home and the call of my craft."}
