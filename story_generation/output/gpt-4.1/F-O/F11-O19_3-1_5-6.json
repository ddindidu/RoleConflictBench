My sister was excitedly planning our annual holiday trip, and everyone expected me to help organize the details and be present for every moment. I could hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to be together.\u201d But as I tried to focus on the conversation, my mind kept drifting back to the pharmacy newsletter I\u2019d skimmed during my lunch break. There was a new drug release, and my manager had stressed the importance of staying updated for patient safety. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family needed me to be the supportive, involved sister, while my profession demanded I keep learning, even if it meant sacrificing personal time. My heart ached with guilt as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my all to both. I stared at the screen, torn between replying to my family and diving deeper into the newsletter, feeling the tension build inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
