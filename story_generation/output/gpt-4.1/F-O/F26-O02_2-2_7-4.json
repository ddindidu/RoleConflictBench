My daughter had just called, her voice bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present. But as she spoke, my eyes kept darting to the email notification flashing on my screen\u2014a reminder from my manager about the updated safety standard. The deadline for submitting evidence of compliance was tomorrow, and the documentation was far from complete. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the supportive grandparent, fully engaged in my family\u2019s joys, and the responsibility as an engineer to ensure every regulation was met, every box checked. My heart tugged toward the living room, but my mind raced with technical checklists and looming consequences. I gripped the phone tighter, torn between the warmth of family and the cold precision of my profession, unsure which demand to answer first."}
