It was a message from my granddaughter, Emma: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be struggling. I glanced at the clock\u2014only two hours left before the electricians arrived, and I still had to finish assembling the frames and coordinate with the plumber. The foreman had made it clear: any delay would set the whole project back, and I\u2019d be letting the team down. But Emma\u2019s words echoed in my mind. As her grandmother, I was supposed to be her safe place, the one who listened and offered wisdom when life got hard. Yet as a carpenter, I was expected to be reliable, focused, and present on the job. My hands trembled, torn between the sawdust and the soft voice of my granddaughter needing me. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could bear to let down."}
