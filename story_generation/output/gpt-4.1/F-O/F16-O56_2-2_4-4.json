My last client of the day, a first-time visitor, sat in my chair, frowning at her reflection. She twisted a strand of her newly colored hair, her lips pressed tight. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit warmer than I expected,\u201d she said quietly. I could feel her disappointment, and I knew I needed to listen, reassure her, and maybe even redo the color if she asked. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my spouse\u2019s name flashed on the screen. The laundry. I\u2019d promised to get it done tonight so everyone would have clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s activities. I pictured the overflowing basket at home, the kids\u2019 uniforms buried somewhere in the pile. My heart thudded with guilt. I wanted to be the reliable partner, the one who shared the load, not the one who forgot. But right now, my client needed me to be present, attentive, and professional. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which role to answer first."}
