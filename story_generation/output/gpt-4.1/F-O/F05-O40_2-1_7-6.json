I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her. As her husband, I felt the urge to sit down, ask her what was wrong, and really listen. We\u2019d promised to share our worries, to be open with each other, especially when life got heavy. But just as I was about to speak, the bell above my workshop door jingled. A customer stood there, holding a small, splintered wooden train. His little boy clung to his leg, eyes wide with hope. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d the man asked, setting the toy on my workbench. I knew I needed to examine it, give a fair quote, and maybe even reassure the child. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014toward my wife\u2019s silent plea for comfort, and the customer\u2019s expectation for my skill and attention. I stood in the doorway, heart pounding, torn between the roles I was supposed to fill, unsure which voice to answer first."}
