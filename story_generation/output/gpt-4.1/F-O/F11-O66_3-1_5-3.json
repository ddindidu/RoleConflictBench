Mom\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you!\u201d As the eldest sister, I was expected to help set up, keep the younger cousins entertained, and be there for the family photos. But as I pulled up to the curb, my next passenger slid into the back seat, giving me an address across town. I checked the time\u2014if I drove carefully, obeying every speed limit and stop sign like a good taxi driver should, I\u2019d be late for the family gathering. But if I rushed, I\u2019d be risking my passenger\u2019s safety and breaking the rules I\u2019d promised to uphold. My hands tightened on the wheel. The weight of my sisterly duty pressed against the responsibility I felt as a professional driver. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s disappointed sigh, but I also pictured the trust my passengers placed in me. The city lights blurred outside as I wrestled with the impossible choice, my heart pounding with the pressure of being both a good sister and a responsible driver."}
