It was a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you come? I really need to talk.\u201d I could almost hear the strain in his words, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. As his sister, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when he was struggling. But the lab was tense\u2014our safety audit was in two hours, and I\u2019d already found a loose wire on the spectrometer. If I left now, even for half an hour, I risked missing the chance to fix it and possibly failing the audit. My supervisor had made it clear: every detail mattered, and the team was counting on me. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent pull of family and the heavy responsibility of my work. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible stretch between being a good sister and a reliable scientist."}
