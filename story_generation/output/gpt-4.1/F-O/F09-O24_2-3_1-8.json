My mind, however, kept drifting to the open class at my daughter\u2019s school\u2014her first time reading a poem in front of everyone. I had promised her I\u2019d be there, and her hopeful eyes this morning haunted me. Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of this case. My instructions were now wrong. The courtroom buzzed with anticipation, but my heart pounded for a different reason. I was expected to be the steady hand of justice, to immediately absorb and apply this new ruling. Yet, if I paused to review the decision, I\u2019d miss my daughter\u2019s moment. If I left, I\u2019d fail my duty to the law and the people in this room. The weight of both roles pressed in, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I stared at the note, torn between the courtroom and the classroom, between the law and my child."}
