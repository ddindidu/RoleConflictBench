My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, feeling the tension in my shoulders. Every minute we crawled through traffic, I thought about the bills waiting at home, the groceries we needed, and my daughter\u2019s school fees. I needed this fare\u2014needed every fare\u2014to keep us afloat. But the roads were slick, visibility was terrible, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on me from both sides. As a father, I couldn\u2019t risk an accident that might take me away from my family or leave them without support. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get my passenger to the airport on time, no matter the weather. The man\u2019s anxious voice cut through my thoughts, urging me to go faster, but my heart pounded with fear of what could happen if I did. I stared at the red taillights ahead, torn between the desperate need to provide and the duty to keep everyone safe."}
