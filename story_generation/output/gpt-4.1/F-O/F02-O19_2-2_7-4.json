As a father, I felt the weight of providing for my family pressing down on me, especially now when every cent mattered. Just then, a patient approached the counter, clutching a new prescription. She looked anxious, her hands trembling as she handed it over. As a pharmacist, I knew I needed to take time to explain the medication, answer her questions, and ensure she understood the side effects. But the overtime hours I\u2019d been counting on to make ends meet were slipping away with every minute I spent counseling. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to rush through the explanation so I could fill more prescriptions and earn more, and the professional responsibility to give this patient the care she deserved. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between my duty to my family and my duty to my patient, unsure which path to take."}
