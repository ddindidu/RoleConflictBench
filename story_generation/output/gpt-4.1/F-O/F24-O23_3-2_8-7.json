Instinctively, I reached out, my heart pounding with the responsibility I felt as his step-sibling\u2014I was supposed to keep him safe, to look out for him, especially since our parents trusted me. At that exact moment, my phone buzzed with a message from the office: an assistant needed urgent access to a client\u2019s confidential files, files I was ethically bound to protect as a lawyer. The request was framed as a matter of convenience, but I knew the rules\u2014confidentiality was non-negotiable. I felt torn, my mind racing between the immediate danger Ethan faced and the professional standards I was sworn to uphold. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I failed. I hesitated, caught between shouting Ethan\u2019s name and composing a careful response to the assistant, my heart thudding with the impossible choice."}
