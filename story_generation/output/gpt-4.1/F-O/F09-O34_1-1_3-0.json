In ten minutes, I\u2019ll be in the spare room, eyes on radar, responsible for every blip in the sky. Pre-dawn is usually calm, but I know that even one mistake could mean disaster. My son slurps his milk, and I remind him to use his spoon, to be mindful. He frowns, frustrated, and I want to soothe him, to sit and explain why manners matter. But the clock ticks closer to my shift. My supervisor expects me alert, focused, ready to manage any sudden change in the airspace. My son\u2019s eyes plead for attention, for patience, but my mind is already half in the control room, scanning for potential conflicts. I feel the pull\u2014my child\u2019s need for guidance, my duty to keep the skies safe. Both expect my full presence, but I can\u2019t give it to both at once. My heart pounds as I glance between my son and the waiting headset, torn."}
