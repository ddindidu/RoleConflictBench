The case was complex, and the parties deserved a thorough, well-reasoned judgment. I glanced at the stack of notes and the blinking cursor on my computer screen, aware that the court expected my written decision soon. Yet, as I tried to focus, I heard a soft knock. My grandson lingered in the doorway, his shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. I knew that look\u2014he needed me, not as a judge, but as his grandfather, someone to listen and offer comfort. My heart ached to set aside my work, to sit with him and share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over a lifetime. But the demands of the court loomed large; justice delayed is justice denied, and my duty was clear. I felt torn, caught between the expectations of my profession and the needs of my family, each pulling at me with equal force."}
