I was already calculating vectors, my mind racing, when the school\u2019s number flashed on my cell. I knew I shouldn\u2019t answer, but the principal\u2019s message was urgent: my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, now, to discuss consequences and show support for the school\u2019s anti-bullying policy.
