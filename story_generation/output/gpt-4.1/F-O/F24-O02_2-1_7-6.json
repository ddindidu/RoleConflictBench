He was determined to land a new skateboard trick, but the ramp looked more dangerous than usual after last night\u2019s rain. As his step-sibling, I felt a knot of worry tighten in my stomach\u2014he trusted me to look out for him, to speak up if something seemed unsafe. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project planning call was starting in five minutes. As the team\u2019s engineer, I was expected to join, offer my input, and give a realistic estimate for our next phase. They were counting on me to be present and focused, even if the session was informal and the timeline flexible. I stood there, torn, watching my brother adjust his pads, my mind racing between the responsibility to protect him and the professional expectation to show up for my team. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the ramp and the call, unable to ignore either demand."}
