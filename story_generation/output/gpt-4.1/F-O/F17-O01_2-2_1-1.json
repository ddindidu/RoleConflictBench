The contractor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, demanding immediate feedback on the safety concerns I\u2019d flagged. If I didn\u2019t respond now, the crew might move forward, risking not just the project\u2019s compliance but people\u2019s safety. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the clock\u20147:00 p.m. sharp. Every Sunday, I called my parents, listened to my mother\u2019s stories, and reassured my father that I was eating well and sleeping enough. They waited for this call all week, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I moved out of state. My mother\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I felt the familiar tug: the need to be a good child, to show I cared, to keep our connection strong. But the blueprints demanded my attention, the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest, as I hovered between answering the call and returning to the urgent safety report, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
