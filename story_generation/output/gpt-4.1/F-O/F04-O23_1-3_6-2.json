Haven\u2019t seen you in weeks!\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20147:15 p.m. The stack of merger documents on my desk seemed to grow heavier. My client\u2019s email, marked urgent, replayed in my mind: \u201cPlease review the contract tonight. We need your analysis before tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d I knew the clauses on page 47 could cost them millions if I missed something. But my sister\u2019s words tugged at me. We\u2019d promised to include each other in our lives, to not let work or distance chip away at our bond. She\u2019d been reaching out more lately, and I could sense her disappointment each time I declined. I wanted to be the brother she could count on, not just the one who sent apologies and rain checks. Yet, as a lawyer, I owed my client my diligence and expertise\u2014especially now. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of family and the weight of professional duty, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
