Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d My heart thudded. This ceremony wasn\u2019t just a family gathering\u2014it was a tradition passed down for generations, and my father had made it clear how important it was for me to step up this year. But as I tucked my phone away, my work app pinged. An urgent delivery had come in: a high-value package, signature required, recipient must be present. No exceptions. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cThis is your responsibility. Don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d \n\nI glanced at the clock. The delivery window overlapped exactly with the ceremony. If I missed the delivery, I\u2019d risk my job. If I missed the ceremony, I\u2019d let my family down and break a tradition that meant everything to them. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s pride and trust, my job\u2019s demands and my own sense of duty. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, ceremonial script in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
