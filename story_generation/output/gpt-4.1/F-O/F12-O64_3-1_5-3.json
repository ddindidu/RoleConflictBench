My husband had called twice already, reminding me that his parents would arrive in a few hours. The living room needed dusting, the guest room sheets had to be changed, and dinner wasn\u2019t even started. As a wife, I was expected to make sure everything was perfect, to share the load and make our home welcoming.\n\nBut here, behind the counter, I was a cashier. I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the day\u2019s total. Still, store policy was clear: every difference, no matter how minor, had to be reported and investigated. My manager expected me to follow procedures to the letter, no shortcuts.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, torn between the urge to rush home and help prepare for our guests, and the responsibility to do my job right. My hands hovered over the register, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to honor first."}
