It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s urgent. Something\u2019s happened with Sam.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew I should be there for my family, especially now, when they needed me most. I wanted to call her immediately, to hear her voice and offer comfort, but I was standing on a stranger\u2019s porch, package in hand, wearing my delivery uniform.\n\nThe door opened, and the customer greeted me with a polite smile. \u201cHi, do you know when the rest of my order will arrive?\u201d she asked. I could see the expectation in her eyes\u2014she wanted clear, professional communication. But my mind was racing, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my job. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my attention at the same moment. My hand tightened around my phone as I struggled to decide which voice to answer first."}
