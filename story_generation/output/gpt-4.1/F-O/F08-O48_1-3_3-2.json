My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement about the grandkids\u2019 new games and the special cake they\u2019d baked just for me. I could almost hear their laughter, feel their little arms around my neck. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, the call bell rang from down the hall. Mrs. Thompson, my patient, was struggling again\u2014her arthritis flaring so badly she could barely lift her spoon. She looked at me with pleading eyes, her meal untouched, her pain etched deep in her face. I knew she depended on me, not just for food, but for comfort and dignity.
