My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen: a message from the school. My heart sank as I read that my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to speak with me as soon as possible. Guilt and worry twisted in my stomach\u2014my child needed me, needed guidance, and I was expected to be there, to show him right from wrong.\n\nJust then, a customer approached, frustration etched on her face. She placed a blender on the counter and explained she wanted to return it, but she\u2019d lost the receipt. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager watched from across the floor, expecting me to enforce the rules. The customer pleaded, her voice rising, and I felt the pressure mounting.

The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of being a good parent and a responsible employee."}
