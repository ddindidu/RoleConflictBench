As a telemarketer, I was supposed to sound cheerful and confident, ready to answer any question with the script in front of me. Most days, the calls were easy\u2014just a few objections, a handful of questions I could answer without thinking. But today, my mind kept drifting home. My parents had been quiet lately, their voices softer, their smiles thinner. I knew I should check in, ask if everything was okay, be the supportive child they expected. But every time I reached for my phone, another call would come through, and I\u2019d have to switch gears, push my worries aside, and become the upbeat voice on the line. The pressure to be present for my parents tugged at me, but the demands of my job wouldn\u2019t let go. I felt split in two, caught between the need to care for my family and the obligation to perform at work, unsure which role I should answer first."}
