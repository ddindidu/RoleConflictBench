I glanced at the screen and saw a message from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. She never used the word \u201curgent\u201d unless something was really wrong. As her brother, I knew she needed me\u2014maybe to talk, maybe to help her through another rough patch. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, her frail hands already reaching for mine, trusting me to help her start her day with dignity. I could hear the expectation in her voice, \u201cYou\u2019re always so gentle, thank you.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My sister needed my support, but so did Mrs. Lee. I stood there, phone in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the brother my sister could rely on and the nursing assistant my patient depended on."}
