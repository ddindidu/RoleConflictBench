I was already nearby, so I sped toward the scene, heart pounding. As I pulled up, I saw my brother crouched behind a dumpster, his face pale and eyes wide with fear. He\u2019d called me just minutes before, his voice trembling, asking for help with something he couldn\u2019t explain over the phone. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for him, no matter what. Now, as I stepped out of the cruiser, I realized he was a witness\u2014or maybe even involved. My duty as a police officer screamed at me to secure the scene, protect the public, and apprehend the suspects. But as a brother, all I wanted was to shield him from harm, to listen and help him through whatever trouble he\u2019d found. The weight of my badge pressed against my chest, but so did the memory of every time we\u2019d leaned on each other. Sirens wailed in the distance, backup on the way, and I stood frozen, torn between the law I\u2019d sworn to uphold and the brother I\u2019d sworn never to abandon."}
