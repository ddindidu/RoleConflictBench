My phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder of the home loan repayment looming in two months. I need every hour of overtime I can get, every paycheck to keep my family secure. My supervisor shouts my name\u2014there\u2019s a crane holding a heavy steel beam, swaying slightly in the wind. I\u2019m needed now, to help guide it into place, to keep the project moving and everyone safe. My hands tremble, not just from exhaustion but from the weight of responsibility. If I don\u2019t step up, I risk my job, and with it, the roof over my children\u2019s heads. But if I rush, if I\u2019m not careful, one wrong move could mean disaster. My mind races with images of my kids at home, counting on me, and the men around me, counting on my steady hands. The demands pull at me from both sides, and for a moment, I stand frozen, caught between the urgent call of the site and the silent plea of my family\u2019s future."}
