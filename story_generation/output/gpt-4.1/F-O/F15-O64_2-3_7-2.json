The store is quiet, but my mind is anything but. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another message from my partner, reminding me that the rent is due tomorrow and the fridge is nearly empty. As a parent, I feel the weight of every dollar, knowing my family depends on me to keep us afloat. But as a cashier, I know I have to be precise, especially now, handling a large sum of money. One mistake could mean a shortage I can\u2019t explain, maybe even losing my job. My manager expects perfection, no errors, no excuses. My heart pounds as I double-check the bills, my thoughts torn between the fear of making a costly mistake and the desperate need to bring home enough money. I can\u2019t let my family down, but I can\u2019t afford to slip up here either. The pressure builds, my hands trembling slightly as I prepare to close out the register, caught between two worlds that both demand everything from me."}
