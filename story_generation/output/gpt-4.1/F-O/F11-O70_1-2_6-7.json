She\u2019d been looking forward to this night for weeks, and I promised I\u2019d be there early to help set up. As I grabbed my keys, another notification popped up\u2014an urgent message from a customer. They wanted an update on their package, and my company expected quick, polite responses at all times. I could already hear my sister\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how much it meant to her that I included her in my life, that I showed up for her. But the customer was waiting, and I knew my boss would be checking the response times. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between sending a professional reply and rushing out the door to be the supportive sister I wanted to be. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
