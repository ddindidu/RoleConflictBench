The manager\u2019s voice was low but firm: \u201cHe was caught taking snacks without paying.\u201d My heart pounded. As a step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable. He looked at me, eyes wide, waiting for my reaction\u2014was I angry, disappointed, or would I defend him? I wanted to kneel down, talk to him, guide him through this mistake.\n\nBut my phone buzzed. The depot supervisor\u2019s message flashed: \u201cPre-departure check in 10 minutes. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d As a subway operator, I was expected to be precise, responsible, and never delay the train. Hundreds of commuters depended on me to get them home safely and on time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my stepson\u2019s need for guidance, the city\u2019s need for punctuality. My mind raced, torn between staying to handle the situation as a parent or leaving to fulfill my duty as an operator. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
