She wants to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up and the choices we need to make. She expects me to be honest, to lay everything out so we can face it together. I want to give her that, to be the partner she needs. But my phone buzzes with an email from a client, a routine contract that isn\u2019t urgent but still tugs at my mind. As a lawyer, I\u2019m expected to be thorough, to review every detail, even if the deadline is weeks away. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. My wife\u2019s voice is gentle but insistent, asking for my attention, my openness. At the same time, my professional instincts urge me to check the contract, to stay ahead. I sit there, torn, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
