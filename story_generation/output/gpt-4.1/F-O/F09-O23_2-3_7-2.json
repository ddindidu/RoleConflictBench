My son\u2019s voice drifted in from the living room, asking if we could go to the park after dinner. I glanced at the clock\u2014bills were due next week, and my paycheck from this case would cover groceries and rent. As a mother, I felt the weight of making sure there was enough food in the fridge and that my children never sensed the anxiety behind my smile. But as a lawyer, I knew the merger contract in front of me was urgent; if I didn\u2019t review the liability clauses tonight, my client could face a financial disaster, and my reputation would be on the line.

I wanted to be present for my family, to reassure them that everything would be okay, but the demands of my job pressed in, relentless and unforgiving. I stared at the screen, torn between the needs of my family and the responsibilities of my career, feeling the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
