The store manager\u2019s stern gaze was fixed on us, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a father. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, but his wide, frightened eyes made my heart ache. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my radio crackled to life\u2014an emergency call. A woman had fallen nearby, her arm likely broken, and I was the closest ambulance driver. My training kicked in; I knew every second counted for her pain and safety. But my son needed me, right now, to guide him, to discipline him with love and firmness. The store manager expected me to address the theft, my son needed reassurance and correction, and the patient needed urgent care. I stood frozen, torn between my duty as a father and my responsibility as an ambulance driver, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
