I knew it was my mother\u2014she always texted around this time, expecting a quick reply and a rundown of my day. We\u2019d promised to keep in close touch after Dad\u2019s health scare last year, and I could already imagine her worry growing with every minute I didn\u2019t answer. But in the back, my partner was prepping the stretcher for a man whose wife had screamed \u201cheart attack\u201d into the phone. My mind raced with the protocols: oxygen, aspirin, rapid transport. I could almost feel my mother\u2019s anxious eyes on her phone, waiting for those three dots to appear, while my hands gripped the wheel tighter, focused on the life depending on me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s need for reassurance, and a stranger\u2019s desperate need for my undivided attention. The phone buzzed again. I glanced at it, heart pounding, torn between the daughter my parents needed and the ambulance driver this patient depended on."}
