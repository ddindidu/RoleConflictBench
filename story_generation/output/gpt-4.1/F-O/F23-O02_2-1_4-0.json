My phone buzzed with a message from my team, asking for my thoughts on a new design approach. At the same moment, my stepson darted down the cereal aisle, weaving between shoppers, his laughter echoing. I felt the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. As a step-parent, I knew I should set boundaries, guide him, show him right from wrong. But my mind was tangled in engineering possibilities\u2014should we use the new algorithm or stick with the tried-and-true method? My team was waiting for my input, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. Yet here I was, torn between the responsibility to shape a child\u2019s character and the pressure to contribute to a technical solution. My heart pounded as I gripped the cart, caught between two worlds, both demanding my attention, both unwilling to wait."}
