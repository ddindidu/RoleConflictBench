My smile is fixed, my voice cheerful, as I greet each customer and scan their items. I know the store expects me to be quick and friendly, to make every shopper feel welcome, even when I\u2019m tired or distracted. But my phone buzzes in my apron pocket\u2014my partner\u2019s message: \u201cCan you talk to Jamie? He was rude to his teacher again.\u201d I picture Jamie at home, slouched at the kitchen table, waiting for me to come home and explain why respect matters, why kindness is important. I\u2019m supposed to be the adult who guides him, who helps him grow into a good person, even though I\u2019m still learning how to be his parent. The customers keep coming, their faces blurring together, each expecting a smile, a thank you, a little warmth. My mind is split\u2014half here, half at home\u2014torn between the child who needs my guidance and the job that demands my attention. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which part of me should come first."}
