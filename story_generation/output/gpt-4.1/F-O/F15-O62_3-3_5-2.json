My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty as a lifeguard. The beach was packed, high tide pulling at the edges of safety, and I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could mean disaster. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my son, cheeks flushed, hands stuffed with candy bars he hadn\u2019t paid for. The store manager was approaching, frowning, and I felt the weight of my other role settle on my shoulders. As a parent, I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to discipline him and guide him. But if I left my post, even for a moment, I\u2019d be abandoning my responsibility to the swimmers. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urgent need to correct my child with the equally urgent need to keep watch over the water. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
