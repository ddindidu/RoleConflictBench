My stepbrother\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I knew what it meant\u2014he\u2019d just gotten the news about his mother\u2019s diagnosis. My heart twisted; I could almost hear his voice cracking, needing me to be there, to listen, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together. But as I reached for my coat, my clerk hurried over, reminding me that the bail order needed to be drafted and signed immediately. The defendant was waiting in a holding cell, his release hinging on my words. The law demanded clarity, precision, and timeliness\u2014no room for distraction or delay. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the steady, supportive sibling, and the duty to uphold justice without compromise. My hands trembled as I stared at the blank order, my mind torn between the desperate call for family and the unyielding demands of the bench."}
