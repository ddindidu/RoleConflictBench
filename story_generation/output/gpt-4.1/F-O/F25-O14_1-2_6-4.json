The departmental meeting was in two hours, and I still hadn\u2019t finished summarizing the preliminary data. My advisor\u2019s email echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need clear, accurate findings for the meeting.\u201d I knew how important it was to get this right\u2014my reputation as a scientist depended on it. Just as I started typing, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my stepmom: \u201cCan we talk? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately, and I\u2019m worried.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. I hadn\u2019t checked in with them all week. As their step-child, I was supposed to be the one who noticed when things weren\u2019t right, the one who asked if everything was okay at home. But now, the weight of both roles pressed down on me. I stared at the phone, then at my half-finished report, feeling the tension build inside me. I wanted to be there for my family, but I also couldn\u2019t let my team down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more right now."}
