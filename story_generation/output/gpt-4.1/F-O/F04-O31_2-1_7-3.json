As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My captain always says, \u201cYou can\u2019t protect others if you can\u2019t protect yourself.\u201d I was about to head out when my younger brother barged into my room, his face flushed with frustration. He wanted to talk, to vent about a fight he\u2019d had with our parents. I could see he needed me to listen, to be patient and understanding, to show him the respect he deserved as he tried to sort through his feelings.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. If I missed my gym slot, I\u2019d be letting down my team and myself. Yet, if I brushed my brother off, I\u2019d be failing him as a sibling, undermining the trust and respect we\u2019d built. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other at the same time. I stood frozen in the doorway, torn between the badge on my chest and the bond of blood, my heart pounding with indecision."}
