I need to clear the air.\u201d We\u2019d argued last night, voices raised over something trivial that had somehow grown into a chasm. As his older brother, I knew I should call him back, listen, and work through it\u2014he deserved that respect, and so did our relationship. But outside, the sky was shifting. The rare atmospheric conditions I\u2019d been waiting months for were finally here. My team was already prepping the equipment, and this experiment was crucial\u2014without the data, our project might lose funding, and years of work could unravel. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to my family, the duty to my research. My heart pounded as I stood between the lab and my phone, torn by the impossible timing, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
