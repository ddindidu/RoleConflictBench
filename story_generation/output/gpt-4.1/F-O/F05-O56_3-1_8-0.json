She needed me to be honest, to share my worries and plans, to be the partner she could rely on. My phone buzzed\u2014reminding me of my next appointment at the salon. I kissed her forehead, promising we\u2019d talk more tonight, and hurried out the door, my mind still tangled in our unfinished conversation.\n\nAt the salon, the bell chimed and Mrs. Carter, my regular, walked in. She smiled, expecting the warm welcome and easy banter I always offered. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Carter looked straight at me, waiting for that personal touch. My heart raced. I wanted to be present, to make her feel at home, but my thoughts kept drifting back to my wife, to the conversation we\u2019d left hanging. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me needing to be the attentive husband, the other the friendly hairdresser. I stood there, caught between the expectations of home and work, unsure which role to step into first."}
