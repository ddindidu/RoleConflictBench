My sister had just sent the itinerary for our family\u2019s holiday trip, and Mom chimed in, \u201cWe really want you there this year.\u201d I could almost hear her hopeful voice, and guilt pricked at me. I hadn\u2019t made it to the last two celebrations, always blaming work. This time, I promised myself, I\u2019d show up.\n\nBut my laptop screen glared back at me, lines of code taunting me with their complexity. The production service was buckling under load, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged yesterday. My team was counting on me to fix it\u2014fast. If I didn\u2019t, users would suffer, and my reputation as a reliable developer would take a hit. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: my family\u2019s longing for togetherness, my team\u2019s need for my expertise. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
