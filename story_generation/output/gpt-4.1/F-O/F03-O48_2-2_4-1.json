She wants me home early to help prepare for the evening ritual, something we\u2019ve done for generations. But at the care facility, Mrs. Patel, who just had surgery, needs extra help today. She\u2019s anxious and in pain, and I know she relies on me to help her bathe and get dressed with dignity. My supervisor expects me to give her the time and attention she needs, no matter how long it takes. As I look at the clock, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s pride in our customs, and my responsibility to my patient\u2019s well-being. My phone buzzes with a message from home, asking when I\u2019ll arrive. I glance at Mrs. Patel, waiting for me to help her. My heart pounds as I stand between these two lives, torn by the demands of both."}
