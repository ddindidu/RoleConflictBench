My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me about the family dinner tonight. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Dad. Everyone\u2019s counting on you to be there.\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandkids, but my attention snapped back to the pool. A group of teenagers clustered near the deep end, daring each other to dive despite the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cZero tolerance. Safety first, always.\u201d I felt the weight of the whistle around my neck, the responsibility to keep everyone safe. But my heart tugged in another direction\u2014my family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to be the grandfather they could rely on. I stood at the pool\u2019s edge, torn between blowing the whistle and enforcing the rules, or slipping away to answer my family\u2019s call, both roles demanding all of me at once."}
