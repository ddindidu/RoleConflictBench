You coming?\u201d He\u2019d been reaching out more lately, trying to rebuild the closeness we\u2019d lost over the years. I knew how much it meant to him that I showed up, that I made time for family, for us. But as I looked up from my phone, I saw the chart in front of me\u2014Mrs. Patel, a patient with a baffling mix of symptoms: fever, joint pain, a strange rash. The tests so far were inconclusive, and I could feel the weight of expectation from my colleagues and from her anxious family. They needed answers, and I was the one expected to find them. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my brother\u2019s hope for connection, my patient\u2019s need for clarity. I felt the pressure building, the tug-of-war between being the brother my family wanted and the doctor my patient needed. I closed my eyes, caught in the middle, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at once."}
