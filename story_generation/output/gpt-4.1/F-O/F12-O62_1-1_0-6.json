He didn\u2019t seem upset, but I could tell he needed me to be present, to offer a listening ear and maybe a reassuring touch. I wanted to give him my full attention, to be the supportive wife he deserved. But my phone buzzed with a message from the pool\u2014apparently, swimmers were slipping into the shallow end without a lifeguard watching. My mind raced. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce safety rules at all times, even off-shift if I was nearby. The thought of someone getting hurt because I wasn\u2019t there gnawed at me.
