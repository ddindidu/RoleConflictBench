My headset buzzed with the endless drone of the call queue, and I knew management was watching every second I logged out. But my phone vibrated again, this time with a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan we talk? I think you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d My heart twisted. We\u2019d argued last night, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d clear things up, show him I respected his feelings. But if I called him now, I\u2019d risk going over my break and getting flagged by my supervisor. If I waited, he might think I didn\u2019t care, that I was ignoring him. I stared at the break button on my screen, torn between the need to be a good sister and the pressure to be a reliable employee. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
