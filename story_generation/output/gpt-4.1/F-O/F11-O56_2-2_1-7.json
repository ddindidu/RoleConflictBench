It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan I come by? Had a rough day.\u201d I could hear the heaviness in her words, and as her sister, I knew she needed me. I texted back, \u201cOf course, I\u2019m here.\u201d Minutes later, she walked in, her hair pulled back and damp with sweat from her gym session. She gave me a tired smile and asked, \u201cCan you just trim my ends? I don\u2019t have the energy for anything else.\u201d\n\nAs a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before I cut it, especially when it\u2019s greasy. Hygiene and professionalism are non-negotiable in my salon. But as her sister, I wanted to make things easy for her, to just let her sit and relax without fuss. I could see she was on the verge of tears, and I wanted to be the comforting presence she needed. But the rules of my job echoed in my mind, and I felt torn between being the supportive sister she counted on and the professional hairdresser my clients expected. My hands trembled as I reached for the scissors, caught between two worlds."}
