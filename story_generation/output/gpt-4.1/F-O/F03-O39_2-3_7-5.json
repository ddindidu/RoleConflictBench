Dad sat silently at the table, barely touching his tea. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to offer a few words of comfort. My heart ached, wanting to be the son they could lean on, especially now when they seemed so fragile. But my phone buzzed, and I was jolted back to the construction site, where the air was thick with dust and the clang of metal. As I walked past the crane, I spotted a coworker, headphones in, about to step under a suspended load. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d I had to act, to shout, to keep everyone safe. But my mind was still with my parents, torn between the urge to call home and the immediate need to prevent an accident. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the son my parents needed and the vigilant worker my team depended on."}
