The deadline for filing was tomorrow, and I still had pages to review. My phone buzzed\u2014my younger sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. We\u2019d argued last night, voices raised over something trivial that had spiraled out of control. She wanted to talk, to clear the air, to rebuild the trust we\u2019d always shared. I knew I should answer, listen, and communicate openly like we promised each other we would. But the contract\u2019s clauses swam before my eyes, each one demanding my attention, my expertise. My firm expected nothing less than perfection, and missing the deadline wasn\u2019t an option. My heart pounded as the phone rang again. I was torn\u2014my family needed me to be a good brother, to show respect and understanding, but my clients needed me to be a diligent lawyer, focused and precise. I stared at the phone, caught between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
