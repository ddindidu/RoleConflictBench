She had reminded me just this morning that the annual family dinner was coming up, and everyone was expected to help with the preparations. It was a big deal\u2014my grandmother always said that keeping these customs alive was what kept our family close. As her daughter, I felt the weight of that expectation, the unspoken rule that I should be present, involved, and respectful of our heritage.\n\nBut as I sipped my coffee, my phone buzzed with a new email from work. The transit authority was offering a professional development seminar for subway operators, and though attendance was optional, my supervisor had hinted that those who participated would be considered for future promotions. I knew I should reply soon, maybe even sign up, to show my commitment to my job and my willingness to grow. Yet, the seminar was scheduled for the same weekend as the family dinner. My mind spun with the pressure\u2014my family\u2019s pride on one side, my career ambitions on the other. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the tension build inside me."}
