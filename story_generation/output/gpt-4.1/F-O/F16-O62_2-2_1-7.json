I could see the tension in their eyes, the way their hands twisted nervously. They needed me to be present, to offer comfort and advice, to reassure them that whatever choice they made, I\u2019d be there. I reached for their hand, trying to focus on their words, but out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a group of teenagers gathering at the deep end. They were laughing, daring each other, edging closer to the no-diving signs. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and I knew I had to act before someone got hurt. But my partner\u2019s voice trembled, searching my face for support. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to enforce the rules and the promise to be the supportive spouse they needed. The seconds stretched, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding my attention, forcing me to choose."}
