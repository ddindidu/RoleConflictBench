It was the school. My heart sank as the principal\u2019s voice told me my son had been caught bullying another child. They needed me to come in and discuss it immediately. As a father, I knew I had to be there for my son, to understand what happened and help him learn from his mistake. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t just leave the kit unchecked\u2014lives depended on it being ready. My supervisor expected me to finish the inspection before my shift started, and any missing supplies could mean disaster for a patient. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My son needed his father, but my community needed me to be prepared. I stared at the half-checked kit, my phone still in my hand, caught between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
