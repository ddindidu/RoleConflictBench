He was upset, feeling I\u2019d dismissed his concerns during our last conversation. As his sister, I knew I should call him, listen, and talk things through\u2014build the trust we\u2019d always promised each other. But my laptop chimed with a reminder: the project review meeting was in ten minutes. As the lead architect, I was expected to keep the team on track, even if our check-ins were informal. If I let things slide, the project could fall behind, and my reputation would take a hit. My brother\u2019s words echoed in my mind, but so did my team\u2019s expectations. I felt torn, my heart heavy with the weight of both roles. Should I call my brother now and risk being late, or focus on the meeting and hope he\u2019d understand? The pressure of being both a dependable sister and a responsible architect pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
