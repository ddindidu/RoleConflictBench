We need five more sales to hit target. Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d My headset felt heavier than usual, pressing into my temples as I glanced at the clock. 6:15 p.m. The family group chat buzzed with photos of my little brother setting the table, my mom\u2019s message: \u201cDon\u2019t be late for dinner tonight! It\u2019s important to us.\u201d I could almost smell her homemade lasagna through the screen.\n\nMy heart thudded with guilt. I knew how much these dinners meant\u2014my parents worked hard to keep us close, and my brother always looked for me at the table. But the pressure at work was suffocating. If I logged off now, I\u2019d let my team down, maybe even cost us our bonuses. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss another family moment, another memory. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between dialing the next number and grabbing my coat. The voices in my head clashed: be a good sister, be a good employee. I closed my eyes, wishing I could split myself in two."}
