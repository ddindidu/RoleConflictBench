My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the family emergency\u2014her husband had been rushed to the hospital, and she needed me to stay with the children. My heart ached to be present, to offer the steady reassurance only a grandfather could give. Yet, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from my clerk: an attorney in a high-profile case had just cited a new appellate decision, one that could shift the entire direction of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. As a judge, I was expected to be fully prepared, to uphold the integrity of the court by understanding every nuance of the law. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me\u2014my family\u2019s need for my warmth and presence, and my duty to justice demanding my focus and diligence. I felt torn, the expectations of grandfather and judge pulling me in opposite directions, each too important to ignore."}
