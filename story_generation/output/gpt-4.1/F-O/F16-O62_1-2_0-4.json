They looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in their eyes. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, their voice light but edged with fatigue. I wanted to sit down, listen, and be the supportive spouse they deserved\u2014someone who could offer comfort and a listening ear.\n\nBut as I set my bag down, my phone buzzed with a message from the pool manager: \u201cBroken lane rope found. Needs fixing before tomorrow\u2019s swim lessons.\u201d My mind raced. If I didn\u2019t get back to the pool tonight, the morning classes would be a mess, and the kids\u2019 safety could be at risk. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my partner\u2019s need for me here, and my responsibility to the swimmers and staff. My heart tugged in two directions, and I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the call of duty."}
