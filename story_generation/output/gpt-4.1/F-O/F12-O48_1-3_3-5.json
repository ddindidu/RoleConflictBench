My husband\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019ve done the dishes.\u201d I nod, meaning to, but my phone buzzes with a message from the hospital\u2014my patient\u2019s condition is unstable, and I\u2019m needed for an extra shift. At work, I\u2019m expected to be vigilant, checking and recording vital signs every few minutes, my focus unwavering. But as I stand by the patient\u2019s bedside, clipboard in hand, my thoughts drift home. I imagine my husband, alone, folding the laundry, maybe feeling let down. The weight of the blood pressure cuff in my hand feels as heavy as the guilt in my chest. I want to be present for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t see how to be enough for either."}
