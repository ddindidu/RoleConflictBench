Everything okay?\u201d It\u2019s Saturday, and I know he expects me to check in, just a quick text to let him and Mom know I\u2019m thinking of them. I start typing a reply, but the clatter of the factory floor pulls me back. Across the room, two new hires are prepping the mixer for a batch run. I overhear them debating which button to press, their voices uncertain. My supervisor isn\u2019t around, and I\u2019m the only one here who knows the safety sequence. If they get it wrong, the machine could jam or worse, someone could get hurt. I glance at my phone, the half-written message blinking at me, my stepdad\u2019s need for connection tugging at me. But the staff are looking at me now, waiting for guidance. My chest tightens as I stand between the pull of family and the weight of responsibility, feeling the pressure mount from both sides."}
