The hum of my phone broke my concentration\u2014a message from my daughter. My grandson was struggling, caught in the middle of his parents\u2019 divorce, and she needed me to talk to him, to be the steady presence he could lean on. My heart ached; I wanted nothing more than to call, to listen, to reassure him that he was loved and not alone. But the hospital project was at a critical stage. The operating rooms and emergency routes had to be flawless; lives would depend on my precision. My team expected answers, revisions, leadership. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s pain pressing against the professional responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore. My mind raced, caught between the urge to reach for the phone and the obligation to keep my pencil moving, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
