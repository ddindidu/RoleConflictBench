Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter and smell the food, the warmth of being together after a long week. But just as I was about to leave, my work phone buzzed urgently. The new staff at the plant were about to start a batch on the old press, and from the frantic messages, it was clear they didn\u2019t understand the safety protocols. If I didn\u2019t guide them, someone could get hurt. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family counting on me to be present, to share stories and laughter, and my responsibility as a machine repairer, knowing that my absence could mean disaster. I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides, wishing I could split myself in two. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, caught between the pull of home and the call of duty, not knowing which role to answer first."}
