I want to tell you about my first day!\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014she\u2019d landed that job she\u2019d worked so hard for, and I knew she wanted to share every detail.

I wanted to be the grandmother who always listened, the hairdresser who never rushed. My hands hovered over Mrs. Carter\u2019s hair, my mind racing with the demands of both roles, unsure which to answer first."}
