My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014Mom, again. I\u2019d noticed the lines on her face deepening lately, the way Dad\u2019s hands shook when he thought no one was looking. They needed me, just to talk, to listen, to be there. But in the back seat, my passenger kept glancing at his watch, anxiety radiating off him. He had to catch an international flight, and the roads were a mess. Every red light, every cautious turn, I felt his impatience grow. I was supposed to get him there safely and on time, but my mind kept drifting to home, to the worry in Mom\u2019s voice.
