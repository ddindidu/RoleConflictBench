Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014just to talk, to hear my voice, to feel that I was still part of their world. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But as I looked up from my phone, the lab\u2019s clock glared back at me. The specialized spectrometer, booked months in advance, was finally available for a few precious hours. My experiment, the one I\u2019d been building toward for months, depended on this window. If I missed it, I\u2019d have to wait another half-year, maybe longer. My hands trembled as I weighed the options: be the son my parents needed, or the scientist my research demanded. The guilt pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the tightening space between family and ambition, unable to move."}
