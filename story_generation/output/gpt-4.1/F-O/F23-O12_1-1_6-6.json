It\u2019s not critical, and there\u2019s a simple workaround, but the expectation is clear: I\u2019m supposed to fix these things quickly. My manager\u2019s message is polite but firm\u2014users are getting frustrated, and it\u2019s my job to keep them happy. I glance at the clock. It\u2019s almost five, and my stepson\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me of the Nintendo I promised him. He\u2019s been counting down the days, and I know how much it means to him. But the price tag is steep, and I\u2019ve been trying to save, making sure we\u2019re financially stable. If I stay late to fix the bug, I\u2019ll miss the store\u2019s closing time and break my promise. If I leave now, the bug lingers, and I risk disappointing my team. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014provider, parent, developer. I can\u2019t seem to be enough for everyone at once."}
