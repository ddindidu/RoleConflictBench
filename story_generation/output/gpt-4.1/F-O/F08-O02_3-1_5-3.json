As an engineer, I knew the audit was still weeks away, but the urge to double-check every safety protocol gnawed at me. My team relied on my thoroughness; any oversight could mean real consequences. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you come over? It\u2019s urgent. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I was expected to be the steady presence, the one who dropped everything for family. The thought of my grandchildren needing me pulled at my chest, but the unfinished compliance reports loomed large in my mind. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice reminding me of the importance of preparation. I stared at the screen, torn between the family crisis and my professional responsibility, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding all of me at once."}
