My son, still in his pajamas, was slouched at the other end, poking at his breakfast with a fork. I noticed him mutter something rude under his breath when the toast fell to the floor. Instinctively, the mother in me wanted to seize the moment, to talk about respect and patience, to guide him gently but firmly toward better manners. But the engineer in me was restless\u2014my team was waiting for my input on a new design direction, and I could almost hear the ping of incoming messages, the expectation that I\u2019d be ready with ideas and feedback.
