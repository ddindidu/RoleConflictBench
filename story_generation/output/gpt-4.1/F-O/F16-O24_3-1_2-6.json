My partner was curled up on the couch, eyes red from crying, voice trembling as they recounted the latest blow in a string of hardships. I knew they needed me\u2014my presence, my words, my arms around them. But the journal\u2019s arrival had been marked on my calendar for weeks. As a judge, I was expected to stay sharp, to know the latest legal theories, to be prepared for the cases that would soon land on my docket. The articles inside could shape my understanding, maybe even my rulings. Yet, every time I glanced at the cover, guilt twisted in my chest. My partner\u2019s pain was immediate and raw, their need for comfort undeniable. But the law demanded my attention too, in its own relentless way. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
