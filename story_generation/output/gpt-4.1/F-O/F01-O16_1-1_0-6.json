It was my granddaughter, her voice uncertain as she asked, \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d She was on the cusp of starting high school, and I could hear the anxiety in her words. As her grandfather, I wanted to pause everything, listen deeply, and offer the wisdom she sought\u2014reassure her that uncertainty is normal, that courage grows with each step.\n\nBut just then, my nurse knocked, reminding me that my next patient, a young woman with strep throat, was waiting. As her doctor, I was expected to be prompt, thorough, and focused\u2014ready to diagnose, prescribe, and move to the next case. My granddaughter\u2019s question lingered in my mind, tugging at my heart, while my professional duty pressed on my shoulders. I felt torn, caught between the urge to nurture my family and the responsibility to care for my patient. The clock ticked, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the grandfather she needed and the doctor my patient depended on."}
