Tomorrow, I start the biggest project of my career\u2014a custom library for the city hall. Every detail must be perfect, every joint precise. My mind races with angles and wood types, but from the living room, I hear my grandson\u2019s quiet sigh. He\u2019s curled up on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes distant. I know that look; he\u2019s wrestling with something heavy, something only a grandfather\u2019s ear might ease. I want to set aside my work, offer him the wisdom I\u2019ve gathered over decades, let him know he\u2019s not alone. But the clock ticks on, and the blueprints demand my attention. If I don\u2019t prepare tonight, I risk mistakes tomorrow. My heart aches, torn between the call of my craft and the needs of my family, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions."}
