It was a routine check-up, nothing urgent, but I knew I owed him my full attention. Just as I was about to call him in, my phone buzzed. It was my daughter, her voice trembling. \u201cMom, can you come? Grandma\u2019s not well, and the kids are scared. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandparent, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to guide, to hold my family together in moments like this. But as a doctor, I had a duty to my patient, to listen carefully, to diagnose accurately, to not let my mind wander. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I stared at the door, torn, my mind racing, feeling the impossible pull of love and responsibility."}
