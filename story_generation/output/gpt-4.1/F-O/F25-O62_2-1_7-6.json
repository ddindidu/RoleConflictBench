My stepdad and mom were at the edge, chatting quietly, their faces drawn and tired. Lately, they\u2019d been arguing more, and I knew they needed me\u2014someone to talk to, someone to lean on. I wanted to go over, offer a hug, maybe just sit with them for a while. But as I watched, a group of kids slipped into the shallow end, giggling, no adult in sight. My training kicked in: I had to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, no exceptions. My heart twisted. If I left my post, even for a minute, I\u2019d be letting down the swimmers and breaking the trust my boss had in me. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring my parents when they needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, unable to be the step-child my family needed and the lifeguard my job demanded\u2014all at the same time."}
