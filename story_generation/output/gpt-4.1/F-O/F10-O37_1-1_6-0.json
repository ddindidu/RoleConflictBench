The living room was scattered with magazines and empty cups\u2014my parents\u2019 quiet messes from the week. As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew I should get to work, scrubbing the coffee table and vacuuming the rug, making everything spotless. But as a daughter, I noticed the tired slump in my mother\u2019s shoulders and the way my father sighed as he read the newspaper. I wanted to sit beside them, ask if everything was okay, and listen to whatever was weighing on their minds. Yet, I could hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that the house needed to be immaculate, that I couldn\u2019t let standards slip. My parents expected warmth and attention, but my job demanded efficiency and thoroughness. I felt torn, standing there, unsure whether to put down the dustpan and offer comfort, or to keep cleaning and meet the expectations of my role. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the urge to care and the need to clean."}
