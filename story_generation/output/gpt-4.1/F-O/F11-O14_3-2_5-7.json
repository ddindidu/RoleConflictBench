Mom was so excited, and I could almost hear her voice urging me to join, reminding me how rare it was for all of us to be together. I knew how much it meant to them, especially after how distant I\u2019d been lately. But as I glanced at the lab schedule on my computer, my stomach tightened. The safety audit was on Monday, and the last inspection had already flagged a few minor issues with the centrifuge and chemical storage. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to make sure everything was perfect\u2014one overlooked detail could mean a shutdown or worse, someone getting hurt. My team was counting on me, and I couldn\u2019t just leave them to handle it alone. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, my family\u2019s expectations pulling me one way, my professional duty tugging the other. I sat at my desk, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
