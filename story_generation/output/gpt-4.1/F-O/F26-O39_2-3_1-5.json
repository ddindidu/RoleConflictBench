I could tell something was weighing on her, and as her grandmother, I felt the urge to reach out, to offer the kind of comfort and wisdom only years of living can provide. I wanted to tell her that it\u2019s okay to feel lost sometimes, that she\u2019s stronger than she thinks. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014my lunch break was over. I hurried back to the construction site, my mind still on her troubled face.\n\nAs I picked up my hard hat, I saw a coworker step toward a crane\u2019s swinging load, oblivious to the danger. My heart pounded. I knew I had to shout, to keep the site safe, to do my job. But my thoughts were tangled, torn between the gentle words I wanted to give my granddaughter and the urgent warning I needed to give my coworker. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, wise, and responsible. For a split second, I stood frozen, caught between the worlds that needed me."}
