It means a lot to your father.\u201d My heart tightened. Ever since I became part of this family, I\u2019ve tried to honor their traditions, to show I belong. But now, as I faced two drivers arguing on the roadside, my mind was split. One of them was my step-uncle, his face flushed with frustration. He expected me to side with him, to show family loyalty, especially today of all days. But as a police officer, I was bound to act with fairness, to listen to both sides and uphold the law, not family ties. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my stepmother\u2019s hope that I\u2019d honor the family, my duty to serve justice impartially. I could feel my hands trembling as I prepared to speak, torn between the family that wanted me to prove I belonged, and the oath I\u2019d sworn to serve everyone equally."}
