He wanted to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the argument we\u2019d had last night. He said he needed me to listen, to help us move past the misunderstanding. I could hear the hope in his voice, the expectation that I\u2019d be the brother he could count on, someone who\u2019d make time to build back our trust.\n\nBut just as I promised I\u2019d call him back in five minutes, my pager buzzed. Room 214. Mrs. Carter, fresh out of surgery, needed her vitals checked. The nurse\u2019s note was clear: \u201cMonitor closely\u2014slight fever, borderline pulse.\u201d I knew the protocol. I had to be thorough, careful, and quick. My supervisor expected nothing less; the patient\u2019s safety depended on it.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My brother\u2019s need for connection, my patient\u2019s need for care. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demanded all of me. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the call I needed to make and the patient I needed to see."}
