My grandson had called me last night, his voice bubbling with excitement, asking if I\u2019d bring the old photo albums. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. But as I walked the site this morning, the sharp scent of chemicals hit me. There it was\u2014a small, slick puddle right in the middle of the walkway. I knew the rules: any spill, no matter how minor, had to be cleaned up immediately. If someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d I checked the time. If I started cleaning now, I\u2019d be late for the gathering. If I left it, I\u2019d be risking someone\u2019s safety and my job. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and warmth waiting at home, and the responsibility I owed my crew. I stood there, mop in hand, torn between the faces I loved and the duty I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
