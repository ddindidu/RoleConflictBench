As a judge, I know I must draft a scheduling order for a new case by the end of the week\u2014my reputation depends on the clarity and thoroughness of my legal opinions. Yet, my phone buzzes with a message from my spouse: \u201cWe\u2019re short on groceries again. Can you pick up some extra work this month?\u201d The kids\u2019 school fees are due soon, and the rent is looming. I feel the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing down on me, the expectation that I will keep us afloat financially. But overtime at the courthouse means less time for careful writing, and rushing my orders could compromise my integrity as a judge. My mind races, torn between the duty to my family and the demands of my profession. I stare at the blank document, heart pounding, knowing I can\u2019t give both roles what they deserve at the same time."}
