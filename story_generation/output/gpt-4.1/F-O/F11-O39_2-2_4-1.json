Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family dinners were rare, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially Mom, to have us all together. But as I tucked my phone away, the foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise of the site. \u201cWe need that lumber now! The carpenter\u2019s waiting!\u201d Sweat trickled down my back as I hefted another plank, feeling the weight of more than just wood on my shoulders. The clock on the wall mocked me\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d let the crew down, slow the whole project, maybe even risk my job. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the laughter, the stories, the warmth of home. My hands trembled, torn between the call of my family and the demands of the site, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I stood frozen, the world spinning around me, unable to move forward in either life."}
