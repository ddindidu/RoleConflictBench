My passenger, a young woman with anxious eyes, kept glancing at her watch and muttering about missing her flight. I knew the roads were slick, and every minute counted. At the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my daughter\u2014reminders about the family holiday dinner tonight, the one time each year everyone gathered. My grandson had even sent a voice note, his small voice asking if I\u2019d be there to play chess with him. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me: to be the reliable grandfather who never misses a family moment, and the professional driver who gets his passengers safely and punctually to their destinations. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil inside me. I could picture my family waiting, the empty chair at the table if I didn\u2019t make it. But beside me, the passenger\u2019s hope rested on my driving. I stared at the red taillights ahead, torn between the warmth of home and the duty of the road, not knowing which path I would choose."}
