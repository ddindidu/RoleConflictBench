The routine safety audit was still weeks away, but my manager had made it clear\u2014every document needed to be flawless, every standard met. I knew I could get ahead if I started now, but my phone buzzed with a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I remembered how I promised myself to check in more, to be the son who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home. My parents rarely asked for much, but I could sense the weight in her words. I glanced at the growing stack of reports, feeling the pressure to prove myself as a diligent engineer. Yet, the thought of my parents waiting for my call tugged at me. I wanted to be there for them, to ask if everything was okay, to listen. But the demands of my job pressed in, reminding me of the expectations I couldn\u2019t ignore. My heart pulled in two directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role needed me more tonight."}
