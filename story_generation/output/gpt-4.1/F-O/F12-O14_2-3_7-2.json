He hadn\u2019t said much all evening, and I knew I should sit down, ask him what was wrong, and really listen. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how busy life got. But my phone buzzed again: a message from the lab. The atmospheric conditions I\u2019d been waiting months for had finally aligned. If I didn\u2019t get to the lab now, I\u2019d miss the only chance to run the experiment that could make or break my research\u2014and my funding. My mind raced. I could see the expectation in his eyes, the silent plea for me to be present, to share and listen. At the same time, the scientist in me screamed that this was the moment I\u2019d been preparing for, the culmination of late nights and careful planning. I stood in the doorway, torn between the person I loved and the work I\u2019d dedicated my life to, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
