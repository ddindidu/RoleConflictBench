Her text was desperate: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her sister, I wanted to be there\u2014patient, understanding, someone she could trust. But my calendar reminded me of the procedural hearing scheduled in an hour. It was a minor matter, one that could be postponed without much fuss, but as a lawyer, I\u2019d always prided myself on being reliable for my clients, no matter how small the case. I could almost hear my client\u2019s voice, expecting me to show up and represent them, even if just for a routine appearance. My heart tugged in two directions: the sister who wanted to build trust and be present, and the lawyer who didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. I sat at my desk, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
