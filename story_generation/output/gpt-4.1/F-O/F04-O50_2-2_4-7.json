My sister sent a photo of the table already set, my mom\u2019s favorite casserole steaming in the center. I knew how much these gatherings meant to them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But just as I was about to leave, my work phone rang. It was the plant manager\u2014again. The new operator was making the same mistake, adjusting the machine settings without understanding the process, and now material was piling up in the scrap bin. I could hear the frustration in his voice, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d come in and walk the operator through it, step by step, so production wouldn\u2019t fall behind. My family expected me at the table, laughing and sharing stories. My job expected me to be the expert, the fixer, the one who kept things running smoothly. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, work phone in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door to walk through."}
