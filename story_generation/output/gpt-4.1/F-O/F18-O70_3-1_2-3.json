It was my sister, her voice trembling, barely holding back tears. She\u2019d just gotten some terrible news\u2014her job was gone, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. I could hear the panic in her voice, and every instinct in me screamed to drop everything and be there for her, to listen, to comfort her like I always had. But as I listened, I glanced at the package in my passenger seat, the address matching the house in front of me. The instructions were clear: leave the package only if someone was home, otherwise, take it back to the depot. No one answered the door, and I knew if I didn\u2019t follow protocol, I could get in trouble at work. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, torn between my sister\u2019s pain and my responsibility to my job. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which one I could let down."}
