Dispatch had just called in\u2014a woman with a broken leg, nothing life-threatening, but I was expected to get there quickly and safely. My hands gripped the wheel, eyes darting between the road and the flashing lights ahead. Suddenly, as I turned onto Main Street, I saw my younger brother on the sidewalk, headphones in, about to step into the street without looking. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was always the one to look out for him, to make sure he was safe. But now, as the ambulance driver, I was responsible for my patient and everyone on the road. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my brother\u2019s safety on one side, the duty to drive carefully and reach my patient on the other. My mind raced, torn between slamming the brakes or trusting he\u2019d see me in time. The world seemed to slow as I wrestled with what to do next."}
