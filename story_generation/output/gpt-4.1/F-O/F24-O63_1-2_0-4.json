My sales numbers glared at me from the screen\u2014still three short of the weekly target. If I didn\u2019t make it, my manager would definitely have a word with me, maybe even cut my hours. I took a deep breath, ready to dial the next number, when my stepbrother\u2019s name flashed on my phone. He never called during the day unless it was important. I remembered this morning, how pale he looked, hunched over his textbooks, muttering about failing his final exam. I knew he needed me, probably just to talk, to hear that he\u2019d be okay. But every minute I spent on the phone with him was a minute I wasn\u2019t making calls, wasn\u2019t closing sales. My job demanded focus, numbers, results. My family\u2014my brother\u2014needed comfort, reassurance, someone to listen. My thumb hovered over the answer button, my heart pounding, torn between the voice of my manager in my head and the shaky voice I imagined on the other end of the line."}
