Mom had sent a picture of the table set for dinner, my favorite dishes lined up, and a caption: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone!\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant. As the eldest, I knew how much it meant to her when we were all together, especially after Dad passed away. But on my desk, a thick stack of legal documents waited\u2014an urgent purchase agreement that needed my review before tomorrow\u2019s filing deadline. My client was counting on me; any mistake could cost them dearly. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family wanted me present, laughing and sharing stories, but my client needed my focus and expertise. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing either side. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the comfort of home and the demands of my profession, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
