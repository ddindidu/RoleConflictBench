His backpack was tossed carelessly on the floor, and his eyes were red, like he\u2019d been fighting back tears. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his sibling, I felt that familiar tug to sit down beside him, to ask what happened, to listen and be there for him like I always promised I would.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I kept replaying the image of the pool deck from earlier. The manager had reminded us that all equipment had to be perfectly arranged before we left, and I\u2019d noticed a few chairs were out of line. They weren\u2019t dangerous, but the rules were clear. If I didn\u2019t go back and fix them, I could get written up, maybe even lose my job. My brother needed me right now, but so did my responsibilities as a lifeguard. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the urge to comfort him and the pressure to uphold my duties at work, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
