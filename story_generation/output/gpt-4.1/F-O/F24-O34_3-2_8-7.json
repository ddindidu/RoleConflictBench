My voice was steady, relaying instructions, but my mind was racing\u2014one wrong call and chaos could erupt in the skies. Just then, through the glass wall of the break room, I saw my stepbrother outside, headphones in, about to step off the curb without looking. My heart lurched. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe, especially after Mom\u2019s reminder this morning. But right now, I was the only controller on this sector, and the frequency was alive with pilots\u2019 voices, each needing guidance through the storm. If I left my post, even for a minute, I\u2019d risk the safety of hundreds in the air. If I stayed, I might not be able to stop my brother from walking into traffic. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t bear to imagine."}
