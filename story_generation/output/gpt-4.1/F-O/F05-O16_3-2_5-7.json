She needed reassurance, a careful adjustment to her medication, and a plan for the next few weeks. My mind raced through her lab results, the possible side effects, the urgency of her symptoms. At the same time, I could hear the clatter of dishes and the vacuum running in the living room. My wife\u2019s voice floated in, tense and hurried, reminding me that her parents would arrive in two hours and the guest room still needed fresh sheets. I saw the laundry basket overflowing, the list of chores we\u2019d divided up this morning, and the expectation in her eyes that I would do my part. My patient\u2019s needs tugged at my conscience, but so did the promise I\u2019d made to my wife to be present, to share the load. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly meet both expectations at once."}
