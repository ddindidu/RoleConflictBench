My phone buzzed with another message from my sister: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you! Don\u2019t be late for the family photo.\u201d Today was our annual holiday celebration, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and posing for pictures, just like every year. But as I scanned the pool, I noticed a few swimmers drifting toward the deep end. They weren\u2019t in trouble, not yet, but I knew my job was to keep a constant watch, to be ready for anything. My family wanted me to be present, to show I cared, but my duty as a lifeguard demanded my full attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, my heart tugged in two directions. I glanced at the clock, then back at the water, torn between the call of family and the responsibility of keeping others safe."}
