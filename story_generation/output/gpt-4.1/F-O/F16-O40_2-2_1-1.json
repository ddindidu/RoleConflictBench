It was Mia, my wife. Her message was short: \u201cCan you talk? I need you.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been anxious about the big project at her office, and today was the day her boss would announce who\u2019d lead it. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But the workshop was a mess\u2014scraps of wood littered the floor, sawdust clung to every surface, and tools were scattered everywhere. I\u2019d been warned twice this month about safety; one more slip-up and I could be off the site for good. I looked at the phone, then at the chaos around me. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward Mia, who needed my words and warmth, and toward the responsibility of keeping my workspace safe, my job secure. I stood there, phone in hand, sawdust swirling in the air, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
