This tradition had been passed down for generations, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to everyone else. At the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my project team. They wanted me to join an informal planning session, to help estimate timelines for our new engineering project. The session wasn\u2019t urgent, and the deadlines weren\u2019t set in stone, but my manager had emphasized how much he valued my input. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: my family counting on me to honor our heritage, and my team relying on my expertise. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the son my family needed and the engineer my team expected. I stared at my calendar, torn between two parts of myself, unsure which role to let down."}
