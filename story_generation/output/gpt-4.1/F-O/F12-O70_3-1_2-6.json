I really need you.\u201d His father\u2019s illness had shaken him, and lately, he\u2019d needed me more than ever. I wanted nothing more than to rush home, hold him, and listen\u2014be the steady presence he counted on. But I was still on my delivery route, and the next stop was a regular customer who always expected a friendly chat and perfect service. As I pulled up to her house, I could feel my heart racing, torn between the urge to call Alex right away and the need to put on my professional smile. I forced myself to greet her warmly, but my mind was with Alex, worrying if he felt abandoned. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my husband\u2019s desperate need for comfort, and my duty to treat every customer with patience and care. I stood at her doorstep, package in hand, caught between the person I needed to be for him and the person I was expected to be for my job, not sure which demand I could meet first."}
