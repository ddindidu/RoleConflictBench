I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. I hadn\u2019t called her all week, and she always worried if I didn\u2019t check in by Sunday. Mrs. Lee looked anxious, her hands trembling as she clutched the prescription bag. I could see she needed reassurance, someone to patiently walk her through the instructions and side effects. But Mom\u2019s message blinked insistently: \u201cAre you okay? Haven\u2019t heard from you.\u201d Guilt twisted in my chest. I wanted to step away, call Mom, let her know I was fine, that I hadn\u2019t forgotten her. But I also knew Mrs. Lee depended on me to be present, to answer her questions and ease her fears. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, and I stood there, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
