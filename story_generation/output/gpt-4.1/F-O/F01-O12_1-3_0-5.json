My grandson, Ethan, wandered in, his face a mix of excitement and uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what you wanted to do with your life?\u201d he asked, eyes searching mine for some kind of anchor. I felt the weight of his question\u2014he was on the cusp of high school, anxious about choices and futures. I wanted to give him the kind of thoughtful, patient guidance my own grandfather once gave me.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. The product manager\u2019s message flashed: \u201cNeed your input on the API structure ASAP. Teams are waiting.\u201d The launch date had been moved up, and every minute I delayed meant architects from three teams sat idle, their work at a standstill. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of my job and the quiet, pressing need of the boy in front of me. I could see Ethan\u2019s hopefulness, and I could feel the pressure from my team. My heart ached as I wrestled with which role needed me more in this moment."}
