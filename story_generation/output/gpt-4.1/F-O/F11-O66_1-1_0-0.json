Family dinner tonight at 7. Don\u2019t be late!\u201d I smiled, proud of him, and promised I\u2019d be there. As a sister, I knew how much it meant to him for me to show up, to celebrate his big moment together. But as I pulled up to the curb, a passenger slid into the back seat, announcing a ride across town. \u201cNo rush, I\u2019ve got plenty of time before my meeting,\u201d he said, settling in. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I drove him now, I\u2019d barely make it to dinner, maybe not at all if traffic was bad. My brother expected me to be there, to support him, but my passenger expected a safe, unhurried ride. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with the choice: speed through the trip and risk my passenger\u2019s comfort, or drive carefully and risk missing my brother\u2019s celebration. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between being the reliable sister and the responsible driver."}
