As their step-parent, I promised to be there, to show up for them in ways that mattered. Today was no different; they\u2019d be waiting, scanning the crowd for my face. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, the PA system crackled. \u201cOperator 14, please begin your pre-departure check.\u201d I looked down the length of my train, the familiar hum of the platform vibrating beneath my feet. The checklist in my hand felt heavier than usual. The non-critical systems could wait a few minutes, but protocol was clear: every check, every time, for the safety and punctuality of hundreds of passengers. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no shortcuts, no exceptions. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing in, the expectation to be a reliable step-parent and a responsible subway operator. My hands trembled as I stood between the train and the exit, torn by the demands of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
