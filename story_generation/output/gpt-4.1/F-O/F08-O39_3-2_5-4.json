My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, telling me that my grandson had fallen and was being rushed to the hospital. She needed me there, needed my calm, my comfort\u2014my presence as his grandmother. My heart clenched, every instinct screaming to drop everything and go. But as I turned, I caught sight of a slick, glistening puddle on the walkway\u2014oil, maybe, or some chemical. I knew the rules: as a construction laborer, it was my responsibility to keep the site safe, to clean up hazards immediately. If I left it, someone could slip, get hurt, and it would be on me. My supervisor expected diligence, and my coworkers trusted me to look out for them. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent pull of family and the pressing duty of safety at work, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, demanding I choose."}
