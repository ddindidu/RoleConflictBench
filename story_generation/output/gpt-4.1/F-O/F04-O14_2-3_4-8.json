My mother chimed in, reminding me to bring the dessert I\u2019d promised. I could almost hear their laughter and smell the food already. But as I slipped my lab coat on, a shrill alarm pierced the quiet of the lab. The gas chromatograph was flashing red\u2014an alert I\u2019d never seen before. My mind raced through the safety protocols: if the seal failed, there could be a hazardous leak. I was the only scientist on shift, and the manual was clear\u2014never leave equipment unattended during a warning. My hands shook as I texted my family, \u201cRunning a bit late.\u201d Guilt gnawed at me. I imagined my empty chair at the table, my family\u2019s disappointment, and my own longing to be with them. But the lab demanded my attention, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on me. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the cold, urgent beeping of the machine, unable to move toward either."}
