My stepbrother opened the door, his eyes red and puffy. I knew he\u2019d just gotten the news about his father\u2019s health\u2014our father now, I guess. He looked like he could barely stand, let alone talk. As his step-sibling, I wanted to drop everything, step inside, and just be there for him, to listen, to offer a hug, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But the uniform I wore felt heavy, reminding me of the other expectation: I had to get his signature for this delivery, confirm the package was received, and move on to the next stop. My supervisor had been clear\u2014no exceptions, especially for moderately valuable items. I could see the pain in my stepbrother\u2019s face, and I felt torn. Should I push the clipboard toward him, forcing him to deal with this small but official task when he could barely function? Or should I set work aside and be the sibling he needed right now? My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between duty and family, not sure which role to let down."}
