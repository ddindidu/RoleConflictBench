My shift was slow today, and my supervisor had just messaged that I could take my break whenever I wanted. I was about to step outside for some air when my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling as she shared how overwhelmed she felt at work and how lonely she\u2019d been lately. I could see she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort she rarely asked for. But in the back of my mind, I kept glancing at the clock, knowing my break was ticking away. If I didn\u2019t take it now, I might not get another chance before the next wave of calls. My heart ached as I tried to focus on her words, torn between being the supportive child she needed and the responsible employee I was expected to be."}
