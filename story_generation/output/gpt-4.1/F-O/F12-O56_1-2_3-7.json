He\u2019s been picking up the slack all week, and I know he\u2019s expecting me to finally tackle the folding tonight. But my phone buzzes\u2014a last-minute client, desperate for a wash and cut before her big interview tomorrow. I glance at the clock. If I leave now, I can just make it to the salon in time. My mind races: the client\u2019s hair will need extra care after her gym session, and she\u2019s counting on me to make her look her best. But the laundry sits there, accusing, and I can almost hear my husband\u2019s tired sigh when he sees it untouched again. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014am I a reliable partner at home, or a dedicated professional at work? I stand frozen, keys in one hand, a crumpled t-shirt in the other, torn between the two worlds that both need me right now."}
