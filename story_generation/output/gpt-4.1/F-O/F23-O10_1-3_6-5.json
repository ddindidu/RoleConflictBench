My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes from this morning replayed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days, trusting my promise. But now, the envelope from the tax authority lay open in front of me, its official language cold and urgent. As an accountant, I knew the gravity of a tax discrepancy; ignoring it, even for a day, could mean penalties or worse. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up Nintendo for Jamie.\u201d My heart twisted.
