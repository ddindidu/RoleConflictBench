It was my daughter, her voice tight with worry. \u201cMom, can you talk to Lily? She\u2019s really upset about something at school.\u201d I glanced at the splintered beams above me, the telltale trails of termites snaking through the wood. The homeowner was counting on me to assess the damage and get a repair plan together before the rain hit this weekend. But Lily\u2019s voice, small and trembling, came through the line: \u201cGrandma, can you help me? I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d My hands, rough from years of carpentry, ached to hold her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she needed. Yet, the weight of responsibility pressed on me from both sides\u2014my family needing my guidance, and a family\u2019s home needing my skill. I stood there, torn, the scent of sawdust mixing with the ache in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
