The email from my firm was clear: attendance was strongly encouraged, and missing it could mean falling behind on crucial updates. As I weighed the importance of staying current, my granddaughter slid into the chair beside me, her eyes bright but uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when it\u2019s the right time to try something new?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see she needed more than a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of thoughtful conversation only a grandfather could give. But the seminar started in twenty minutes, and I knew missing it could jeopardize my standing at work. My mind raced between the duty to my profession and the responsibility to my family, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. I wanted to be the wise, attentive grandfather she believed in, but I also needed to be the diligent accountant my colleagues relied on. My heart tugged in two directions as I looked from her hopeful face to the ticking clock, caught in the impossible space between."}
