It was a text from my stepbrother: \u201cCan you call? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I ducked into the break room, heart pounding, and called him. His voice was shaky, barely holding together. He\u2019d just gotten terrible news\u2014something about our dad\u2019s health. He needed me, and I could hear the tears in his voice. I wanted to drop everything, to be the sibling he could lean on, to listen and reassure him.\n\nBut as I tried to comfort him, the bell above the salon door chimed. Through the glass, I saw a young woman step in, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously. My manager shot me a look: greet her, make her feel welcome. I was torn. My brother\u2019s pain pressed on me, demanding my attention, but my job required me to put on a smile and help this anxious client feel at ease. My heart ached as I stood there, phone in hand, caught between being the supportive sibling my brother needed and the professional hairdresser my client expected."}
