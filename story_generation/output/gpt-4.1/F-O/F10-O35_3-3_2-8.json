I know it\u2019s my mother\u2014she always texts around this time, wanting to know if I\u2019ve eaten, if I\u2019m safe, if work is going well. We have this unspoken rule: I reply quickly, with details, so she doesn\u2019t worry. But now, I\u2019m gripping the controls, every muscle tense, because the supervisor is watching my every move. I can\u2019t risk even glancing at my phone; protocol is strict, and any distraction could mean a mark against me. My mother\u2019s messages keep coming, each vibration a reminder of her expectations, her need for reassurance. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my duty as a daughter pulling me one way, my responsibility as a subway operator pulling me another. My heart pounds as I stare straight ahead, caught between the urge to comfort my mother and the necessity to prove myself at work."}
