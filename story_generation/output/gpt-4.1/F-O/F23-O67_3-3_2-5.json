I was already picturing the patient\u2014someone\u2019s parent, someone\u2019s partner\u2014waiting for help that only I could give. But then my phone buzzed. It was the school. My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying another student. The principal\u2019s voice was stern: \u201cWe need you here as soon as possible to discuss Ethan\u2019s behavior.\u201d I could hear the disappointment in her tone, the expectation that I\u2019d drop everything for my family. I glanced at the ambulance, my partner already prepping the gear, and felt the weight of two worlds pressing in. Ethan needed me to show up, to prove I was there for him, not just as a step-parent in name. But someone else needed me too\u2014someone whose life might depend on how quickly I responded. My hands trembled as I weighed the uniform on my back against the promise I\u2019d made at home, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the school\u2019s demand, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
