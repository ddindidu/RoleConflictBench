My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind\u2014\u201cWe both work, we both share the chores.\u201d She\u2019s right, of course. I promised I\u2019d help more, and I can see how tired she is lately. But my phone buzzes again: a message from the site manager. The cabinetry project is behind schedule, and the electrician needs me there to coordinate the next steps. If I don\u2019t go, the whole job could fall apart, and I\u2019ll let down the crew and the client. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure build in my chest. If I stay and fold the laundry, I\u2019ll be a good husband, but a lousy carpenter. If I rush out the door, I\u2019ll be a reliable craftsman, but I\u2019ll leave my wife to shoulder the burden at home\u2014again. My hands hover over the laundry, my mind already at the job site, torn between two worlds that both need me right now."}
