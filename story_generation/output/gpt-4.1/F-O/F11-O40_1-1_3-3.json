My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my mom suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me, expecting me to join in and help decide. I smiled, nodding along, but my mind was elsewhere. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d received a message from a client\u2014an urgent new furniture order. As a carpenter, I needed to estimate the materials, check my inventory, and place orders for supplies before the end of the day if I wanted to meet the deadline. My phone buzzed again, a reminder from the supplier. My sister nudged me, asking if I\u2019d be free Saturday. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, the warmth of family togetherness on one side, and the responsibility of my craft on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on their laughter, but all I could see were measurements, wood grains, and looming deadlines."}
