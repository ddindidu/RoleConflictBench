My phone buzzed with a new message from my granddaughter, who had just started her first job. She\u2019d sent a photo of her new office, her smile wide and proud. My daughter had already replied, and I knew the rest of the family would soon chime in, sharing in her excitement. I wanted to respond, to be present, to show her that her achievements mattered to me.\n\nBut my inbox was filling up with reminders from management. The quarterly roadmap meeting was in an hour, and they needed my estimates for the new project phases. I was the only one with the technical background to break down the tasks accurately. If I delayed, the whole team would be left waiting, and the project could slip off schedule.\n\nI stared at the two screens\u2014one filled with family joy, the other with professional urgency. My heart tugged in both directions, the weight of expectation pressing down. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demanded my attention now."}
