The store manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHe was caught taking snacks without paying.\u201d As a step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and discipline. But my phone buzzed urgently\u2014an alert from the courthouse. An emergency motion for a restraining order had just landed on my desk. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to ensure justice and safety, and I had less than an hour to make a ruling.
