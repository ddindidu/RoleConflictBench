I\u2019m feeling lost about college.\u201d My heart swelled with the familiar urge to guide her, to share the lessons I\u2019d gathered over decades. But just as I started to type a reply, the call light blinked for Mr. Harris, my post-op patient. He\u2019d struggled all morning, wincing with every movement, and I knew he needed my steady hands to help him dress and move safely. My supervisor expected me to be attentive, quick, and gentle\u2014my patients depended on it. Yet, my granddaughter\u2019s words echoed in my mind, her trust in me a responsibility I cherished.
