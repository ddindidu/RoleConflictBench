My last client, Mrs. Lee, smiled at me in the mirror. \u201cCould you just trim a bit more off the fringe?\u201d she asked, her tone gentle. I nodded, reaching for my scissors, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my wife: \u201cRough day, nothing major, just need to talk.\u201d I pictured her sitting on the couch, waiting for me to come home and listen, to be present, to care. But Mrs. Lee was watching me expectantly, trusting me to get her hair just right, as always.
