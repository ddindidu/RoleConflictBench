Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, voice barely above a whisper. I felt the familiar tug\u2014she needed my guidance, the kind only years of mistakes and triumphs could offer. But my phone buzzed, a sharp reminder: the pre-shift briefing on new subway procedures was about to begin, and attendance was non-negotiable. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, a safety risk for the thousands who\u2019d ride my train today. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s trust, the company\u2019s expectations. I glanced at the clock, then back at her hopeful face, torn between the wisdom she sought and the duty I owed to my job."}
