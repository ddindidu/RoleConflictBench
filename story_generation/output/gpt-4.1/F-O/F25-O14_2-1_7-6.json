My mom moved quietly, her eyes shadowed with fatigue. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to talk to, someone to help lighten the mood. As their step-child, I felt the weight of their unspoken expectation: be present, offer comfort, show I care. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the lab\u2019s maintenance checklist was due tomorrow. As a scientist, I was responsible for ensuring every piece of equipment was safe, every protocol followed. Even if nothing seemed wrong, skipping a check could mean disaster. My mind raced between the two worlds: the warmth of my family\u2019s kitchen, the sterile hum of the lab. I wanted to stay, to listen, to be the support my parents needed. But the lab\u2019s silent demands pressed on me, reminding me of the trust my colleagues placed in me. I stared at my parents, then at my phone, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
