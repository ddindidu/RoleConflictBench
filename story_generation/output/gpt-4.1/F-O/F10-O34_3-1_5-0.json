My mother\u2019s voice, soft but urgent, reminded me that today was the day I was to lead the family\u2019s ancestral ceremony\u2014a role my grandmother had entrusted to me before she passed. \u201cIt\u2019s important, darling. You\u2019re the eldest now. Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I glanced at the radar screen; the airspace was quiet, only a few blips moving steadily, no holding patterns, no emergencies. Still, protocol demanded my full attention, every second. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEven in the calm, you must be vigilant. One mistake can cost lives.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s expectations to honor our traditions, and my duty to keep the skies safe.
