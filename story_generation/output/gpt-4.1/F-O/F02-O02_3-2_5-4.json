The manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences, and that honesty matters. My mind raced with the words I should say, the lesson I needed to impart, the discipline I must enforce.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. A message from my team: the new safety standard documentation was due by noon, and without my sign-off, the project would stall. As an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every detail was compliant, every risk accounted for. The company\u2014and my reputation\u2014depended on it.\n\nI looked down at my son, his eyes wide with fear and confusion, and felt the pull in two directions. My heart ached with the need to be present, to guide him through this mistake. Yet my mind screamed about deadlines, regulations, and the trust my colleagues placed in me. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of fatherhood and the unyielding responsibilities of my profession."}
