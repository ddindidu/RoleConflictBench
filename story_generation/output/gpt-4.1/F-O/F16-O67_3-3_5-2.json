My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me that the relatives would arrive in less than two hours and the house still looked like a whirlwind had passed through. I could hear the clatter of dishes and the stress in their tone\u2014this visit meant a lot, and we\u2019d promised to present a spotless home. Just as I reached for the mop, my work radio crackled to life: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries, immediate response needed. My heart pounded. I knew every second counted for those people, and my training screamed at me to drop everything and run to the ambulance. But I could also feel the weight of my spouse\u2019s expectations, the silent plea for help, the promise I\u2019d made to be present and share the load. Torn between the chaos at home and the chaos on the road, I stood frozen, keys in one hand, mop in the other, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds."}
