My wife\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She rarely called during the day, so I wiped my hands and answered. Her voice trembled as she explained the dilemma at work\u2014her boss wanted her to take on a new project, but she wasn\u2019t sure she was ready. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to help her sort through her fears. I glanced around the workshop. Sawdust coated the floor, scraps of wood littered the corners, and the foreman had just reminded us about the importance of keeping the area spotless for everyone\u2019s safety. If I stepped outside to give my wife the attention she deserved, I\u2019d leave my workspace a mess and risk a warning\u2014or worse, an accident. But if I stayed and cleaned, I\u2019d be distracted, unable to give her the support she needed. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling torn between being the husband she counted on and the carpenter my crew depended on."}
