I stood behind the register, scanning items, my mind half on autopilot. Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. As her brother, I knew I should be there, ready to listen, to support her like we always promised. But as a cashier, I was expected to stay focused, process each transaction accurately, and not let personal matters interfere with work. I glanced at the line\u2014two customers, both looking tired and impatient. My heart pounded. I could feel the weight of my sister\u2019s need pulling me one way, and the responsibility to my job pulling me the other. I gripped the scanner tighter, torn between the urge to step away and call her, and the duty to stay put and do my job."}
