He looked up at me, eyes wide, waiting for my approval as he wiped the spill. Just then, my radio crackled to life\u2014an emergency call. A patient with a broken bone, a few miles away, city traffic already building up. My heart raced. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. The expectation was clear: drop everything and respond, lives depended on it. But here, at home, my son needed me to be patient, to guide him through these small but important lessons. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the urgency of the call clashing with the quiet responsibility of fatherhood. My son looked at me, seeking reassurance, while the dispatcher\u2019s voice urged me to hurry. I stood frozen, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the quiet needs of my child, unsure which duty should come first."}
