He was chattering about his day, but my mind kept drifting to the thick stack of notes in my bag\u2014reminders of the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded. As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, detailed judgment, and the deadline loomed over me like a storm cloud. But right now, Sam was my responsibility. Our parents trusted me to look out for him, to make sure he got home safely. I glanced at my phone, feeling the weight of an email from the court clerk reminding me of the thirty-day deadline. Sam darted ahead, nearly stepping off the curb, and I reached out, pulling him back just in time. My heart pounded\u2014not just from the scare, but from the pressure building inside me. How could I be fully present for Sam when my mind was tangled in legal arguments and findings of fact? Each role demanded my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two, unsure which expectation I was about to fail."}
