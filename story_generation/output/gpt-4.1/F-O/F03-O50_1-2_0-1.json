Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glanced at it, thumb hovering over the screen, but the clatter of urgent voices in the factory snapped me back. The main production unit had been down for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s face was tight with worry. I knelt by the machine, tools in hand, sweat prickling my neck as I traced the tangled wires and blinking sensors. Every minute the line was stopped meant lost revenue, and everyone was waiting for me to fix it. But Mom\u2019s message lingered in my mind\u2014her gentle reminder that I\u2019d promised to check in more often, that she worried when I went silent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the reliable son who keeps in touch, and the indispensable repairer who gets things running. My hands hesitated, torn between typing a quick reply and diving back into the mess of circuits. The pressure built inside me, a silent tug-of-war, as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
