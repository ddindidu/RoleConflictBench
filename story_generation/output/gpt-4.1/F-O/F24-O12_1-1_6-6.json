He was chattering about his science project, but my mind was half on the notification: another bug report from QA. The UI glitch again. It wasn\u2019t critical, but the team expected me to jump on these things fast. I could probably fix it in ten minutes if I ducked into a caf\u00e9 with Wi-Fi.\n\nAlex darted ahead, balancing on the curb. I remembered Mom\u2019s words: \u201cLook out for him, okay? He\u2019s still getting used to the neighborhood.\u201d I watched him, torn. If I stopped to fix the bug now, I\u2019d have to let him walk the last few blocks alone. He\u2019d be fine, probably, but what if something happened? But if I waited, the team might think I was slacking off. My chest tightened as I weighed the responsibility of being a good stepbrother against the pressure to be a reliable developer. I slowed my steps, phone heavy in my hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
