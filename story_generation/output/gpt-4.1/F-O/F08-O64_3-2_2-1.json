My hands moved automatically\u2014scan, bag, smile, repeat. I could feel the impatience in the air, customers shifting from foot to foot, glancing at their watches. In the middle of this, my phone buzzed in my apron pocket. I glanced down and saw my granddaughter\u2019s name. She never called during the day. I answered quietly, expecting a quick hello, but her voice trembled. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice. It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart twisted. She sounded so lost, and I knew she needed me to listen, to offer the kind of comfort only a grandmother could give. But the line in front of me grew longer, and my manager\u2019s eyes darted over, reminding me of my duty to keep things moving. I felt torn, the weight of my granddaughter\u2019s trust pulling me one way, the responsibility to my job tugging the other. My mind raced, caught between the beeping register and the desperate plea in her voice, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
