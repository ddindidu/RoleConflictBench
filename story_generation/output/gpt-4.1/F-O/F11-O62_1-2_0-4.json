He\u2019d begged me to come home early to celebrate, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. But as I did my routine check, my heart sank\u2014a lane rope was snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the class would be a mess, maybe even unsafe. My supervisor always reminded us that equipment maintenance was non-negotiable. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of my brother\u2019s expectant smile and my own promise to be there for him. At the same time, I knew the kids and instructors were counting on me to keep things running smoothly. My mind raced, torn between the pride of being a supportive sister and the responsibility of being a reliable lifeguard. I stood at the edge of the pool, the broken rope in my hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
