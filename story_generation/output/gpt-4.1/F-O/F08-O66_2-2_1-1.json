My passenger, a young man clutching his train ticket, kept checking his watch, anxiety etched on his face. I knew the route to the station by heart, but the clock was not on our side. My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She rarely called during my shift. I let it ring, but a message popped up: \u201cMom, can you talk to Lily? She\u2019s really upset.\u201d My heart clenched. Lily, my granddaughter, had been quiet lately, and I\u2019d promised to always be there for her, to listen and offer the wisdom only a grandmother could give. But right now, I was a taxi driver, responsible for getting my passenger to his train on time. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family needed my comfort, but my passenger needed my focus and speed. I gripped the wheel tighter, torn between the demands of the road and the call of my family, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once."}
