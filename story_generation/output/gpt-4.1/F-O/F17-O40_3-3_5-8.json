My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the importance of tonight\u2019s ceremony. \u201cYou must lead, just like your grandfather did. It\u2019s our family\u2019s way.\u201d I could see the pride in her eyes, the weight of tradition pressing on my shoulders. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the homeowner whose house I\u2019d inspected earlier. The termites had done more damage than I\u2019d thought, and the family was desperate for a repair plan before the rains came. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency; if I didn\u2019t act now, the house might not last the week. My mind spun between the two worlds: the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations, the cold reality of a client\u2019s collapsing home. Both needed me, both counted on me. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, feeling the pull of duty from two directions, each demanding all of me, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
