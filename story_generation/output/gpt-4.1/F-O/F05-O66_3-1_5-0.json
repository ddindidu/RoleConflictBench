My wife had called just before I picked up this passenger, her voice tight with urgency. \u201cCan you be home early? The house is a mess, and your cousins will be here by six. I can\u2019t do it all alone.\u201d I promised I\u2019d help, but now, as I drove through the slow afternoon traffic, I felt the weight of my other responsibility. The man in the back seat was relaxed, scrolling through his phone, unconcerned about time. He\u2019d mentioned his meeting wasn\u2019t for another hour, but I knew my job was to get him there safely and promptly, no matter how much time he had. Every red light made me anxious. Should I take a shortcut and risk a bumpier ride, or stick to the main road and arrive later at home? My hands tightened on the wheel. I could picture my wife, frazzled and disappointed, and I could hear the company dispatcher\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that customer satisfaction was everything. I was pulled in two directions, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
