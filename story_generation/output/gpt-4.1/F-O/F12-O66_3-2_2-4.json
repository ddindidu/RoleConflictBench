My phone buzzes again in the cup holder\u2014another message from my husband. He\u2019s unraveling, his words raw and desperate, needing me to be his anchor.

I know I have to stay alert, keep both hands on the wheel, follow every rule, or risk an accident. My heart aches with the urge to be there for him, to offer the comfort he expects, but my duty to my passengers and the rules of the road demand my full attention. I feel torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, as I wrestle with the impossible choice between being the wife he needs and the responsible driver I must be."}
