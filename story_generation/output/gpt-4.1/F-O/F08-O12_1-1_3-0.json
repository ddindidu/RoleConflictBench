I pictured their eager faces, the way little Emma would tug at my sleeve, asking for another story, and how Ben would want to show me his latest Lego creation. I wanted to be there, to be present, to be the grandmother they remembered.\n\nBut my laptop hummed quietly on the desk, the code editor still open. I\u2019d been meaning to refactor the payment module for weeks, and with the generous deadline, I finally had the time to do it right. Clean, maintainable code was my pride\u2014my team counted on me to set the standard. If I left it now, I\u2019d lose my momentum, and the tangled logic would haunt me until I fixed it.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be the grandmother who never missed a moment, and the developer who never left a mess behind. The clock ticked closer to two, and I sat frozen, torn between the laughter in the living room and the silent promise of better code."}
