As a spouse, I knew how important it was to have everything spotless before my partner\u2019s relatives arrived. We\u2019d promised each other to share the chores, and I could already hear the hum of the vacuum in the next room\u2014my partner doing their part. But as a professional cleaner, I couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that I\u2019d forgotten to put on gloves and a mask. The cleaning products were strong, and I knew the protocols: always protect myself, always follow hygiene steps. Yet, the clock was ticking, and every minute spent searching for equipment was a minute the house stayed less than perfect. My partner expected me to keep pace, to not fall behind. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I stop and follow the safety rules, risking the house not being ready, or keep going and ignore what I knew was right? My hands hesitated over the spray bottle, caught between the demands of my two worlds."}
