My sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I hesitated. She never called during work hours unless it was serious. I answered, and her voice trembled as she told me about her breakup, how she needed someone to talk to, someone to lean on. I promised I\u2019d be there for her, like always.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes drifted back to the plans. There were minor inconsistencies in the fire exit placements\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but not quite up to code either. My project manager was pushing for a quick sign-off, and I knew a delay would mean missed deadlines and angry clients. Yet, as an architect, my responsibility was to ensure every detail was safe and compliant.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My sister needed me now, but so did my team. I was torn between being the brother she could always count on and the architect who never compromised on safety. My heart pounded as I stared at the plans, my phone still warm in my hand, caught between two promises I wasn\u2019t sure I could keep."}
