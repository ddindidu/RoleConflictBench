She had just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew I needed to step in, to teach her about patience and kindness\u2014values I want her to carry for life. As I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed urgently. There\u2019d been a traffic accident nearby, and as a police officer, I was needed immediately to secure the scene and protect the people involved. My daughter looked up at me, her eyes searching for guidance, while my radio crackled with the dispatcher\u2019s voice, reminding me of my duty to the community. I felt torn\u2014my child needed me to be present, to teach her right from wrong, but out there, people were depending on me to keep them safe. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, caught between the expectations of being a good parent and a responsible officer."}
