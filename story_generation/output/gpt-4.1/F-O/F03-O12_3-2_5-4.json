It means a lot to your father.\u201d My heart thudded. This ceremony was more than a ritual\u2014it was a thread tying our family together, a tradition my parents cherished. I knew how much it would mean to them if I stepped up, especially now, when everyone looked to me to carry the torch.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with Slack notifications. The product manager was asking for my feedback on the new feature specs. The design document deadline was tomorrow, and the other teams were waiting for my technical input to move forward. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen; any delay from me would hold up the whole project.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, the responsibility to my team on the other. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety tangling together. I wanted to be the son my parents needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down. I sat there, torn, unsure which role I could afford to disappoint."}
