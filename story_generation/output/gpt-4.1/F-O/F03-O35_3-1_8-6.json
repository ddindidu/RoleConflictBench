Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how lonely she\u2019d been feeling since Dad\u2019s health started declining. She reached for my hand, her voice trembling, and I could feel the weight of her need for comfort. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the optional professional development seminar at work. The email said spots were limited and would be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. I knew how much management valued initiative, and missing out could mean falling behind my colleagues. But as my mother\u2019s words grew softer, I could see how much she needed me to listen, to be present. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure her and the pressure to respond quickly to the email. I felt the tension coil in my chest, caught between being the son she needed and the operator my job demanded."}
