She\u2019d just landed her first job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her excitement. My daughter had already called, asking if I\u2019d be joining the video call tonight to celebrate. As a grandmother, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014how much my family counted on me to be present, to share in their joys, to offer encouragement. But my briefcase sat open on the counter, files spilling out, reminders of the trial starting tomorrow. As lead counsel, I was expected to be fully prepared, focused, and available for my client, who was depending on me to fight for them in court. There would be no time for distractions, no room for missed details. My heart ached as I weighed the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations against the unyielding demands of my profession. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between the joy of my granddaughter\u2019s milestone and the gravity of my client\u2019s case. The phone buzzed again, and I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible pull of both worlds."}
