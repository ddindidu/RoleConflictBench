Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014almost three. I promised myself I\u2019d check in with her this weekend, but I\u2019m standing in the workshop, hands greasy, staring at the blinking red lights on the control panel. Three of the machines are running hotter than they should, and I know they missed their last maintenance. If I don\u2019t get to them soon, we could be looking at a costly breakdown. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime.\u201d I wipe my hands on my overalls, feeling the weight of my phone in my pocket. I know Mom worries when I go silent, and I hate the thought of her waiting for a reply. But the machines can\u2019t wait either. My heart pounds as I stand there, torn between the daughter I want to be and the repairer I\u2019m expected to be, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
