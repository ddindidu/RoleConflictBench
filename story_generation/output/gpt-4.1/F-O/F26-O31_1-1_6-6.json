I could almost hear their laughter, and I felt the familiar warmth of being the grandparent who keeps the family close. But as I walked my beat that afternoon, I spotted a car parked illegally outside a busy bakery. The driver was a neighbor, a single mother I\u2019d known for years, rushing in to pick up a cake for her own family\u2019s celebration. She pleaded for understanding, her eyes tired but hopeful. My badge reminded me of my duty to uphold the law with integrity and fairness\u2014no special treatment, no bending the rules. Yet, my heart ached, knowing how much a ticket would set her back, especially during the holidays. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be compassionate and present for my family, and the demand to be impartial and just as a police officer. I stood there, ticket book in hand, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
