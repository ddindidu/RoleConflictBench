As his step-sibling, I felt responsible for him, making sure he was safe, especially since our parents always reminded me to look out for him. We turned the corner onto our street, and I noticed flashing lights ahead\u2014my police radio crackled with a noise complaint about a late-night party at a house just up the block. I was off duty, but as a police officer, I knew I was expected to step in if things got out of hand, to enforce the law and keep the peace.\n\nJake tugged at my sleeve, whispering that some of his friends were at that party. He looked worried, asking if we could just go home and not get involved. My mind raced. As his sibling, I wanted to shield him from trouble, to keep our walk home normal and safe. But as an officer, I felt the weight of my badge, the duty to act, even if it meant confronting people I knew\u2014or putting Jake in an uncomfortable spot. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between protecting my brother and upholding the law."}
