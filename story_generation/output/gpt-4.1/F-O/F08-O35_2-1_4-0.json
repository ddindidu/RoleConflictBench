My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cMom, we\u2019re all waiting for you! Lily wants to tell everyone her big news.\u201d My heart swelled\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s first piano recital win, and she wanted her grandmother there to celebrate. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled over the radio, reminding all operators that the pre-departure check was about to begin. I was responsible for ensuring every system was in order before the train left the station, even if today\u2019s check was only for non-critical systems.
