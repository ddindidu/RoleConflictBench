She\u2019s been asking for new shoes, and I keep thinking about the home loan payment looming in two months. I need every shift I can get, every overtime hour, to make sure we don\u2019t fall behind. At the control tower, the pre-dawn airspace is calm\u2014no holding patterns, no frantic radio calls. It should be a relief, but my mind is racing. I know the expectation: stay sharp, keep the skies safe, even when it\u2019s quiet. But my thoughts keep drifting to our finances, to the bills piling up, to the fear of letting my family down. I want to be present, focused, the professional my team relies on. But I also want to be the parent who provides, who never lets the roof over our heads feel uncertain. The silence in the tower is heavy, filled with the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding my full attention, and I can feel myself pulled in two directions, unsure which need is more urgent."}
