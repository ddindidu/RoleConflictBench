It was Sunday evening\u2014my stepmom\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I\u2019d promised her and Dad I\u2019d call every week, no matter what, to keep them updated and check in. They said it made them feel like a real family, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially after all the effort they\u2019d put into making me feel at home.\n\nBut right now, I was the only operator on duty, and the report about the suspicious bag had just come in. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cPassenger safety is your top priority. Respond quickly, keep everyone calm.\u201d I could already picture the anxious faces in the security camera feed, waiting for guidance. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the comfort of a familiar conversation and the weight of a hundred strangers\u2019 safety. The call kept ringing, and I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in, demanding my attention at the exact same moment."}
