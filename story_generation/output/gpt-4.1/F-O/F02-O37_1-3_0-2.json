The scent of bleach clung to my skin, and I could hear the hum of the vacuum in the next room. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery corner spotless, every surface sanitized. We have guests coming tomorrow.\u201d I knew I couldn\u2019t leave a single room unfinished, not if I wanted to keep this job. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that school was ending soon. My kids would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there to pick them up like I promised. I pictured their hopeful eyes, the way they\u2019d run to me, and my heart twisted. I wanted to be the father who never let them down, who showed up for every moment. But the mop in my hand felt heavier, the clock ticking louder. I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my children, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which to choose."}
