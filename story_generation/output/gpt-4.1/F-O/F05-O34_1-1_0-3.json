My wife\u2019s voice echoed in my mind from our hurried call before my shift\u2014she\u2019d had a rough day, nothing catastrophic, but enough to leave her sounding tired and a little withdrawn. I knew she wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just a few words to let her know I cared. But now, as I monitored the steady blips of aircraft, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d Routine, nothing urgent, but my focus had to be absolute. The expectation was clear\u2014no distractions, no mistakes. My mind tugged in two directions: the urge to text my wife, to be the supportive husband she needed, and the unyielding demand of my job, where even a moment\u2019s lapse could have consequences. My heart thudded with the weight of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
