I glanced at the screen\u2014my brother\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted. As his brother, I was supposed to be there, the one he could lean on when things got tough. But right now, Mrs. Lee was waiting, and I knew she\u2019d been feeling especially isolated lately. As her nursing assistant, I was expected to offer her comfort, to sit and listen, to be the presence she needed. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother needed me, but so did Mrs. Lee. I could feel the anxiety rising, my mind racing through the expectations on both sides, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
