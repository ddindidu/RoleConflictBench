The deadline looms, and as the architect in charge, I\u2019m expected to have answers, to keep everything moving smoothly. My mind races with solutions, but then my son\u2019s voice echoes in my head, reminding me of the Nintendo I promised him. He\u2019s been counting down the days, his excitement growing with each passing morning. But the project\u2019s setbacks mean extra hours, and the budget is tighter than ever. I know how much that gift means to him, but I also know every dollar counts right now. My heart aches, torn between the need to provide joy and stability for my child and the relentless demands of my job. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
