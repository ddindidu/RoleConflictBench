It was a video call from my granddaughter, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart clenched. She\u2019d never sounded so lost before. I wanted nothing more than to sit with her, listen, and share whatever wisdom I could offer. But just then, a customer approached, peering into the cab and commenting on how clean it looked. I was proud of my reputation\u2014passengers expected a spotless ride, and I\u2019d worked hard to earn their trust. Yet, as I glanced between my phone and the waiting customer, I felt torn. My granddaughter needed me as her grandmother, but my next fare expected me to be the reliable, professional taxi driver. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of my family and the demands of my job."}
