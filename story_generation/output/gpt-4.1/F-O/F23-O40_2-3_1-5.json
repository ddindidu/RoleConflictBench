As her step-parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. She\u2019d asked me twice this week if I was coming, her eyes hopeful. But on the kitchen table, blueprints for tomorrow\u2019s big cabinetry project lay spread out, untouched. My boss had stressed the importance of getting every measurement right\u2014one mistake, and the whole job could fall apart. I was expected to show up prepared, to have every detail memorized, every cut planned. The pressure pressed in from both sides: Lily\u2019s need for my presence, my crew\u2019s need for my expertise. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me as I tried to focus on the technical drawings, but my mind kept drifting to Lily\u2019s smile, her small hand waving from the classroom. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between the demands of two worlds that both needed me, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
