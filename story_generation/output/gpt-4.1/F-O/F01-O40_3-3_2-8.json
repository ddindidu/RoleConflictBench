It was the homeowner, her voice trembling as she described the spreading termite damage in her living room beams. She needed me there immediately\u2014her family\u2019s safety depended on it. I glanced at my workbench, already laid out with tools for the urgent repair, and felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nJust then, my grandson appeared at the door, his eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandpa, can we talk? I really need your advice,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper. I could see he was struggling, searching for the kind of wisdom only a grandfather could offer. My heart ached to sit with him, to listen and guide him through whatever storm he was facing.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. The house needed me, and so did he. I stood there, torn between the call of my craft and the call of my heart, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which path to take."}
