As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing has consequences. But I couldn\u2019t dwell on it; my shift as a taxi driver had just started, and I had a passenger in the back, tapping impatiently at his phone. \n\nAs I turned onto Maple Avenue, a construction detour forced all traffic into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, the yellow sign flashed: SCHOOL ZONE, 20 MPH. Children clustered near the curb, some darting dangerously close to the street. My mind raced\u2014should I pull over and call my partner about what happened at the store, or focus on driving safely through this chaos? I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the need to discipline my stepson, to be a good parent, and the responsibility to drive carefully, to protect these children and obey the law. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, caught between two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
