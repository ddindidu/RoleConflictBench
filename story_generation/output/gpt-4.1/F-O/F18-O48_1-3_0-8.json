She\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, and I could already hear her muffled sobs through the door. As a nursing assistant, I knew my job was to be there for her, to offer comfort and a listening ear. But the message on my phone was from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call? I\u2019m freaking out about my exam tomorrow.\u201d I pictured him hunched over his books, biting his nails, needing the kind of reassurance only a sibling could give. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for him, to remind him he was capable and not alone. But Mrs. Carter needed me too, right now, in this moment of fear and vulnerability. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the two people who needed me, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides. My hands trembled as I tried to decide who needed me more, wishing I could split myself in two."}
