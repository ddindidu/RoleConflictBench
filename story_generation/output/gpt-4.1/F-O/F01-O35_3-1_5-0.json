As a grandfather, I knew my presence mattered\u2014my daughter needed comfort, my grandson needed reassurance, and I wanted nothing more than to be there, holding his hand.\n\nBut the clock on the wall reminded me of my other duty. In ten minutes, I was scheduled to begin the pre-departure check on my subway train. The city depended on me to ensure every system was safe, even the non-critical ones.
