My little sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents were excited about a movie night. They looked at me, expecting me to join in, to be part of the plan. I felt their warmth, their hope that I\u2019d be there, just like old times. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a notification from work. A customer had requested an urgent grocery delivery, and the time window overlapped with our family outing. The message was clear: the delivery had to be on time, no exceptions. I could picture the customer waiting, counting on me for their dinner plans. My family\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my answer, while my mind raced with the pressure of both worlds. I wanted to be the reliable brother, but I was also the dependable delivery person. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the people I love and the job I need."}
