Her eyes were red, and she hesitated before asking, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d I could see she needed me\u2014not just as a listener, but as someone who could offer real guidance. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the online seminar on upcoming tax law changes was starting in ten minutes. As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated, especially with so many clients depending on my expertise to keep them compliant. Missing this seminar could mean falling behind, risking mistakes that could cost people dearly. But Emma\u2019s voice trembled as she waited, and I felt the weight of her trust. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the granddaughter who needed my wisdom, and the professional duty that demanded my attention. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, unsure which role I could let down."}
