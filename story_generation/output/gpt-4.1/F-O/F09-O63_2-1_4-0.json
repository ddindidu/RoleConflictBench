My script was clear, and the customer\u2019s questions were easy, but my eyes kept flicking to my son, who was now giggling and weaving dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why we don\u2019t run indoors, why we respect public spaces. That\u2019s what a good mother does\u2014teaches discipline, instills values. But the call was still live, and my supervisor\u2019s warning about call drops echoed in my mind. I was expected to be calm, professional, attentive, never distracted.
