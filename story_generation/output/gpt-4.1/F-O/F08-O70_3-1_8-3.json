It was a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. I\u2019d heard earlier that my son was having a tough time, and now this. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my family needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. But as I glanced at the package on the seat beside me, I remembered the other role I wore: delivery person. The company expected me to secure every package, confirm each delivery, and keep to a tight schedule. I looked at the empty porch, the wind picking up, and thought about the risk of leaving the box unattended. My hands trembled as I weighed the phone in one hand and the package in the other, torn between the urgent pull of family and the pressing demands of my job."}
