My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d I nod, guilt already prickling at my skin, knowing I\u2019ve let it pile up again. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from the pharmacy. A high-risk chemotherapy prescription just came in, and I\u2019m the only one on shift with the certification to check it. The margin for error is razor-thin; one wrong decimal, and someone\u2019s life could be at risk. My heart pounds as I picture my partner\u2019s weary face and the patient\u2019s fragile hope. Both need me, both trust me. I feel the weight of expectation pressing from all sides, my hands frozen between the soft cotton of home and the sterile precision of the pharmacy."}
