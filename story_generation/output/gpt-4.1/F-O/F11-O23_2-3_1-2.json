It was my younger brother, his name lighting up the screen. I hesitated, knowing he wouldn\u2019t call unless it was important. When I answered, his voice was shaky\u2014he\u2019d just broken up with his girlfriend and needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I felt the pull to be there, to listen, to comfort him like I always had. But as a lawyer, I was painfully aware that the merger contract in front of me had a looming deadline. If I didn\u2019t review it tonight, my client could face serious financial consequences. My mind raced with the expectations on both sides: my family needed my emotional support, my client needed my legal expertise. I stared at the contract, my brother\u2019s voice echoing in my ear, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could let down."}
