My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but my laptop screen glows with the building plans I brought home. There\u2019s a nagging detail\u2014a measurement off by a few centimeters, a wall that doesn\u2019t quite line up. It\u2019s probably nothing, but as an architect, I know that \u201cprobably\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. My team expects me to catch these things, to ensure every line is perfect, every structure safe. But the laundry is still there, and so is the expectation that I\u2019ll pull my weight at home. My mind tugs in two directions: the responsibility to my partner, who just wants a little help, and the duty to my profession, where a small oversight could mean real consequences. I sit, paralyzed, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
