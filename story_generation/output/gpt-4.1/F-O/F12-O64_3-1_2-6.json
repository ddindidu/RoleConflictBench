But bills don\u2019t wait for anyone\u2019s crisis, so I forced a smile and promised I\u2019d be home soon.\n\nNow, behind the register, I greet customers with practiced warmth, scanning groceries and making small talk. \u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d I ask, even as my mind drifts to my husband, wondering if he\u2019s eaten, if he\u2019s okay.
