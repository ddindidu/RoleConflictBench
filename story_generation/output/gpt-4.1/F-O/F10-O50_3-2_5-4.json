It was my turn, she said, to honor our traditions, to show respect and keep our family\u2019s values alive. I could see the pride in her eyes, the hope that I would not let her down. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another alert from the factory. The machines I was responsible for had missed their last service window, and now a few were running dangerously hot. If I didn\u2019t get there soon, we could be facing a costly breakdown, maybe even a safety hazard. My supervisor\u2019s text was blunt: \u201cWe need you now.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my family\u2019s expectations on one side, my professional duty on the other. My heart pounded as I stared at the family altar, then at my work boots by the door, torn between the two parts of myself that everyone seemed to need at the same time."}
