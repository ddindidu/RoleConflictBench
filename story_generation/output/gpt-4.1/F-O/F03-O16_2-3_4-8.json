Our family has always trusted natural remedies first. It\u2019s our way.\u201d Her words reminded me of the countless times we\u2019d gathered around herbal teas and poultices, honoring traditions passed down for generations. But just beyond the door, a patient\u2019s life hung in the balance. The infection was spreading rapidly, and every guideline I\u2019d learned as a doctor screamed for immediate, aggressive antibiotics. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s faith in our customs, their hope that I\u2019d carry them forward, and my duty as a physician to do what I knew was right for my patient. The pressure from both sides pressed in, leaving me caught between the values I was raised with and the oath I\u2019d taken to heal. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be at stake."}
