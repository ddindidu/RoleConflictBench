The address was only a few blocks away, but the time window was tight\u2014just thirty minutes. The customer\u2019s note read, \u201cGroceries needed for dinner tonight, please don\u2019t be late.\u201d I knew how important it was to deliver on time; my job depended on it, and I prided myself on never missing a deadline.\n\nBut as I slipped on my jacket, I heard my mom call from the kitchen. \u201cCome help set the table! We\u2019re about to start the holiday dinner.\u201d This was one of those rare nights when the whole family gathered, sharing stories and laughter, upholding the traditions that meant so much to my parents. I could see my dad already lighting the candles, a ritual he never missed.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my family, missing the start of a tradition they cherished. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down a customer who was counting on me. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I felt torn, unable to move."}
