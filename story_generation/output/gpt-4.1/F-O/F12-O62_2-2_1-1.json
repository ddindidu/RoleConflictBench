My husband\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d called just before my shift, his words heavy with worry about a big decision at work. He needed me, needed my reassurance, my advice. I could still hear the tremor in his voice, the way he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I wanted to be there for him, to listen, to offer the comfort he expected from me as his wife.\n\nBut as I glanced across the pool, I noticed a swimmer\u2019s strokes faltering near the middle. My training kicked in\u2014every instinct told me to focus, to be ready to act. The expectation was clear: I had to watch every movement, every splash, because a life could depend on it. My phone buzzed in my pocket, another message from my husband, but my eyes stayed glued to the water.

I gripped the armrest, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
