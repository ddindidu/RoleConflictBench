I felt the familiar tug to offer her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over decades, to be the steady hand she needed. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the lab\u2019s maintenance checklist was due soon. As the lead scientist, I was expected to ensure every piece of equipment was checked, every protocol followed, even if nothing seemed amiss. The safety of my team depended on my diligence. I looked at my granddaughter, her hope for guidance clear, and then at the message on my phone, the weight of responsibility pressing in. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be present for her and the duty to uphold the standards that kept my colleagues safe. The two worlds collided inside me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, caught in the silent struggle of choosing which role to honor in that moment."}
