I glance at the screen\u2014it's a message from Mom: \"Are you okay? Haven't heard from you today.\" Guilt pricks at me. I promised I'd check in more often, especially after Dad's health scare last month. But now, the red emergency light flashes above the door, and I can see passengers crowding around someone slumped on a seat. My training kicks in: I need to keep everyone calm, call for medical help, and make announcements. But my mind is split. I know Mom will worry if I don't reply soon, imagining the worst. I want to send a quick text, just a few words to reassure her. But every second counts for the person in need on my train. My hands hover between my phone and the intercom, heart pounding, torn between being the daughter my parents need and the operator my passengers depend on."}
