He asked about mine, and I knew he expected more than my usual, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d He wanted me to open up, to share the little frustrations and victories, to let him in. But my mind kept drifting back to the factory floor, to the shrill screech of the bearing that had started just before I left. If I didn\u2019t get back soon, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours of downtime and a mountain of blame. I tried to focus on his words, to be present, but the pressure built inside me\u2014torn between the need to be a good wife, to communicate and connect, and the urgent responsibility to keep the machines running. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
