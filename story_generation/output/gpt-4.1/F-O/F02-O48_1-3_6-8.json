He\u2019s so excited.\u201d I feel a pang in my chest. Money\u2019s tight, but I want to keep my word, to see my son\u2019s face light up. I tuck the phone away and return to the ward, where Mrs. Patel sits alone, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. She just got the news\u2014her cancer\u2019s back. I know she needs me, someone to sit with her, to listen, to offer comfort. But my mind keeps drifting to Jamie, to the cost of the Nintendo, to the bills piling up at home. I feel torn in two\u2014my heart aches for my son\u2019s happiness, for my family\u2019s security, but I can\u2019t ignore the pain in front of me. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I stand frozen, unsure which need to answer first."}
