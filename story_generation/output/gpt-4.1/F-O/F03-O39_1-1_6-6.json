Lately, she seemed more tired, and I\u2019d made it a habit to check in, asking if everything was okay at home. She smiled, but I could tell she was holding something back. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer support, especially since Dad\u2019s health had been shaky. But as I reached for my phone to call her during my lunch break, my supervisor walked by and reminded us about the optional training session next week. He said it would help us work better as a team and hinted that those who attended would be looked upon favorably. I knew missing it might set me back at work, but the session was scheduled right when I usually visit my parents. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me, but so did my job. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
