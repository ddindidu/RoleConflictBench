It was a ritual, a promise I made when I moved to the city for law school. They counted on these calls, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since Dad\u2019s health started to decline.\n\nBut this Sunday, my client\u2019s hearing was unexpectedly rescheduled for Monday morning. The prep work, though for a minor matter, needed my attention tonight. I could technically ask for a postponement, but I knew my client was anxious and wanted closure. My phone vibrated again\u2014Mom\u2019s name on the screen. I stared at it, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I answered, I\u2019d be distracted, unable to give either my parents or my client the attention they deserved. If I ignored it, I\u2019d break the routine that kept my parents feeling close and cared for. My heart pounded as I sat at my desk, torn between the son they needed and the lawyer I promised to be."}
