He looked tired, his nose red and eyes watery. \u201cHey, can you fill this for me?\u201d he asked, handing over a prescription for cold medicine. I smiled, trying to be the patient, understanding brother he needed, especially since he hated being sick and always got grumpy. As a pharmacist, though, I had to check everything carefully. I glanced at the label and noticed the doctor had prescribed a higher-than-usual dose. Mark, impatient, urged me to hurry up, insisting he just wanted to get home and rest. I felt the pressure to be supportive and not make him feel worse, but my professional responsibility demanded I double-check the dosage and possibly call the doctor. My mind raced, torn between being the caring brother who trusts and comforts, and the meticulous pharmacist who can\u2019t let a potential error slip by. I could feel Mark\u2019s eyes on me, waiting, as I hesitated, caught between the expectations of family and duty."}
