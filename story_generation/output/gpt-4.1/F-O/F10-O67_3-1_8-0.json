My mom sat across from me, her hands trembling as she spoke about her fears of growing older, her voice barely above a whisper. She needed me\u2014her daughter\u2014to listen, to reassure her that everything would be okay. I reached out, squeezing her hand, trying to be present, to offer the comfort she sought. But my radio crackled on the counter, a sharp reminder that I was also on standby as an ambulance driver. Any second, a call could come in, demanding I drop everything and rush to someone else\u2019s emergency. My mom\u2019s eyes searched mine, pleading for understanding, while my mind raced with the possibility of the radio\u2019s next urgent summons. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached as I tried to be both the daughter my mom needed and the professional my job required, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at the same time."}
