Two drivers argued heatedly, voices rising over a dented bumper. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen to both sides and make a just decision. But when I recognized one of the drivers\u2014my stepfather\u2014my heart clenched. He shot me a look, the same one he gave me at family gatherings when I hesitated to join in their traditions. I remembered my mother\u2019s words: \u201cFamily comes first. We stick together.\u201d The other driver, a stranger, pleaded his case, but my stepfather\u2019s eyes silently begged for leniency. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the step-child, expected to uphold family loyalty, and the officer, sworn to impartiality. My mind raced, torn between the family that never quite felt like mine and the badge that demanded I treat everyone equally. I took a deep breath, feeling the conflict twist inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, something would be lost."}
