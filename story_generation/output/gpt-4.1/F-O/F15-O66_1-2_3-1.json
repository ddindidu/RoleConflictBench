She was fidgety, barely listening, and I knew I needed to be patient, to guide her with calm words and set a good example. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent ride request. The passenger\u2019s message was frantic: their train was leaving in less than half an hour, and the station was all the way across town. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be reliable, to get people where they need to go safely and on time. I glanced at my daughter, her eyes searching mine for approval, and then at my phone, the seconds ticking by. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of shaping my child\u2019s character against the duty to my passenger, both expecting my full attention. I felt torn, caught between the quiet demands of home and the pressing urgency of the world outside, unsure which role to answer first."}
