Users can\u2019t log in. Can you look now?\u201d My heart pounds. I know the outage is traced back to a bug in my code, and the pressure to fix it is crushing. At the same time, my son tugs at my sleeve, his eyes wide with hope. \u201cMom, are we going to the store? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo today.\u201d I remember the promise, the excitement in his voice all week, and the importance of keeping my word. But the outage means customers are locked out, and my team is counting on me to restore the service. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s trust and happiness, and my responsibility to my job and our financial stability. My mind races, torn between the urgent demands of my work and the promise I made to my child. I can\u2019t let either down, but right now, I don\u2019t know how to choose."}
