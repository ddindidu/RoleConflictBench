The family gathering was something I\u2019d promised not to miss\u2014my daughter had even called last night, reminding me how much the little ones looked forward to baking cookies with Grandma. But as I set down the phone, my work boots caught my eye by the door. The cabinetry project at the new house was behind schedule, and the contractor had just texted, asking if I could meet the team this afternoon to finalize the framework. They were counting on me; the timeline was tight, and any delay would set everyone back. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and flour-dusted hugs waiting at home, and toward the half-finished cabinets and the trust my crew placed in my hands. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s giggle, but I could also picture the anxious faces of my colleagues. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, rolling pin in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door I would walk through."}
