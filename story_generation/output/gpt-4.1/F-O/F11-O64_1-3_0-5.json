My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014my little brother had just won his school\u2019s science fair, and the family group chat was exploding with messages. I knew they were waiting for me at home, cake and balloons ready, expecting me to be there to celebrate his big achievement. But as the clock struck closing time, my manager reminded me of the strict deposit procedure for the day\u2019s unusually large cash intake. Every bill had to be counted, double-checked, and logged, no shortcuts allowed. I could already picture my brother\u2019s hopeful face, scanning the door for me, and my parents\u2019 gentle reminders about how much it would mean to him if I showed up. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if I rushed or made a mistake, it could mean trouble for the store and for me. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, torn between the sister my family needed and the cashier my job demanded."}
