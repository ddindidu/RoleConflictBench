My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright with hope. \u201cYou\u2019ll come this time, right?\u201d she asked. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. On my phone, emails from the project manager kept popping up, each more urgent than the last. The hospital project\u2019s final safety review was due Monday, and I was the lead architect. If I missed a detail, lives could be at risk. My father caught my distracted gaze and frowned, expecting me to be present, to laugh and plan with them. But the weight of responsibility pressed on me. I wanted to be the brother who showed up, who made memories. But I was also the architect who couldn\u2019t let anything slip. My heart pounded as I tried to balance their hopeful faces with the relentless demands of my work, feeling the two worlds pulling me apart."}
