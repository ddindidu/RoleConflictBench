I knew something was bothering her, and as her husband, I felt the urge to sit down, ask her about her day, and listen\u2014really listen. We\u2019d promised to share our worries, to be open, especially when work weighed us down. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the pharmacy: a patient was waiting, confused about which pain reliever to buy. As a pharmacist, I was expected to provide clear, careful counseling, even for simple questions. I could picture the patient, anxious and hoping for reassurance. My wife looked up, searching my face for comfort, while my mind raced with the responsibility waiting at work. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my wife\u2019s silent plea for connection, the patient\u2019s need for guidance. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, caught in the impossible space between being the husband she needed and the pharmacist my patient expected."}
