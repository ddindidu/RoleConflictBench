Mom expected me to help set the table, Dad would want to talk about his day, and everyone would notice if I was missing. But at my telemarketing job, the rules were strict. My break was scheduled for 8, and the automated system tracked every second. If I left my desk early, even for a minute, the system would flag me. Too many flags, and I could lose my job. My headset pressed against my ear as I listened to another customer\u2019s voicemail, my mind racing. I wanted to be the brother my family counted on, but I also needed this job. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest, and I felt trapped between the warmth of home and the cold logic of the compliance system. My finger hovered over the \u201clog out\u201d button, heart pounding, as voices from the kitchen drifted through my memory."}
