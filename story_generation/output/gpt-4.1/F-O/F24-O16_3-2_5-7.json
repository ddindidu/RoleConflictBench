My stepbrother sent a message: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to have you with us this year!\u201d My stepmother chimed in, reminding me how much it would mean to everyone if I joined. I knew how important it was to show up, to be present, to prove I was part of this family, not just an outsider.\n\nBut as I scrolled through my emails, a new message from the hospital appeared. One of my patients, a young woman with a rare autoimmune disease, needed her medication adjusted. The pharmacy was out of stock, and she was running low. The attending physician was away, and the responsibility fell to me. If I didn\u2019t act quickly, her health could deteriorate.\n\nMy heart pounded. I could almost hear my stepmother\u2019s voice, disappointed if I missed another family event. At the same time, I felt the weight of my patient\u2019s trust, her life depending on my decisions. I sat at my desk, torn between the family I was trying to belong to and the oath I had sworn as a doctor, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
