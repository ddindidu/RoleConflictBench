I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cPlease call me. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart pounded. As her brother, I knew I should be there, especially since she\u2019d been struggling lately. But as a pharmacist, I had a duty to Mrs. Lee, who was waiting anxiously, her bag of pill bottles clutched tightly. She depended on me to catch any dangerous interactions, to explain her regimen clearly, to keep her safe.

I felt torn, standing in the consultation room, phone in hand, caught between the pull of family and the demands of my profession, unsure which need was greater in that moment."}
