My family gathered around, laughter and stories bouncing off the walls. My father caught my eye, nodding toward the old family photo on the mantle\u2014a silent reminder of the traditions I was expected to uphold. I was supposed to help with the preparations, join in the rituals, and be present, just as I had every year. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from work flashing on the screen: \u201cMachines overheating. Need urgent maintenance.\u201d I pictured the machines, neglected after missing their last service, the risk of breakdown growing with every minute. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe rely on you to keep things running.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my family\u2019s expectations pulling me one way, my responsibility as a machine repairer tugging me the other. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of tradition and the cold urgency of duty, unsure which demand I could bear to disappoint."}
