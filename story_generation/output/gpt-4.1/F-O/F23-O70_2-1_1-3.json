As a step-parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. She\u2019d asked me twice this week if I was coming, her eyes hopeful. But as I loaded the last package into the van, my work phone buzzed\u2014a high-priority delivery, the customer had left strict instructions: \u201cMust be left at the door, call to confirm, no exceptions.\u201d The address was across town, and the window for delivery overlapped exactly with the open class. My boss had been clear: no missed deliveries, or there\u2019d be consequences. I felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to Jamie and the responsibility I owed to my job. I could already picture her searching the crowd for my face, and at the same time, I imagined the angry call from my supervisor if I failed to deliver. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I sat in the van, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
