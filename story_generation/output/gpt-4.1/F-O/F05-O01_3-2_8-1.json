My wife sat across from me, her eyes searching mine, waiting for answers about our finances. She wanted honesty, needed to know if we could afford the treatment her doctor recommended. I owed her openness, but my mind kept drifting to the construction site. Earlier that day, I\u2019d noticed a flaw in the support beams\u2014something that could compromise the building\u2019s safety if not addressed immediately. My phone buzzed with messages from the contractor, urging me to make a call before work resumed in the morning. I felt torn, the weight of my wife\u2019s trust pressing on one side, the responsibility for dozens of lives on the other. She reached for my hand, her voice gentle but insistent, \u201cWe need to talk about this, really talk.\u201d I nodded, heart pounding, caught between the need to be fully present for her and the urgent demand to ensure no one would be at risk because of my delay."}
