As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014patients depended on me to give them the right advice, and my manager expected nothing less than full commitment to professional growth. My phone vibrated in my pocket, and I glanced down to see a text from my younger brother: \u201cWaiting for you outside. Hurry up!\u201d He\u2019d insisted on tagging along today, promising to stay put while I attended the workshop.\n\nA few minutes later, I glanced out the window and saw him on the sidewalk, fiddling with his phone. Suddenly, he stepped off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart lurched. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe\u2014our parents always reminded me of that. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the most important part of the workshop, risking my professional credibility. My mind raced, torn between the urge to dash outside and the responsibility to stay. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
