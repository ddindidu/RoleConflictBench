I called after him, reminding him to stay close\u2014our parents always said I should look out for him. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from the court clerk: the final judgment for the trial I\u2019d just concluded was due soon. Thirty days, but the case was complex, and the parties were anxious for closure. I felt the weight of my robe even in my jeans and sneakers, the expectation to write a clear, thorough opinion pressing on my mind. My brother veered toward the curb, chasing a stray ball. I reached out, heart pounding, torn between the immediate need to keep him safe and the relentless mental pull of the judgment waiting to be written. Each step home, I wrestled with the demands\u2014my brother\u2019s safety in the here and now, and the duty to deliver justice, both urgent in their own way."}
