My mother\u2019s eyes were red, her hands trembling as she finally opened up about the anxiety that had been gnawing at her for weeks. My father, silent and stoic, looked to me for reassurance, for the words that would hold them together. I reached out, ready to listen, to be the son they needed. But then the radio crackled\u2014dispatch calling, a woman had fallen, broken her arm, and needed immediate care. My heart pounded. My parents\u2019 faces pleaded for comfort, for me to stay, to be present. But the uniform on my back demanded I go, that I be the calm, capable ambulance driver someone else desperately needed. I felt split in two, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s kitchen and the cold urgency of the ambulance bay, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the son my parents needed and the professional my patient depended on."}
