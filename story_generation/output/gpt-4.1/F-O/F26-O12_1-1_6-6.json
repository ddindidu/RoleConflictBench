My daughter sent a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom, we\u2019re all counting on you to help organize the games this year!\u201d I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, and I knew how much these moments meant to everyone. But my laptop chimed with a new bug report\u2014another user had stumbled on that pesky UI glitch. It wasn\u2019t critical, but QA flagged it again, and my manager\u2019s email was clear: \u201cLet\u2019s get this sorted before the weekend.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to be present, to keep our traditions alive, to be the glue that held us together. My team needed me to be reliable, to fix problems quickly, to keep our users happy. I wanted to be both: the dependable grandparent and the responsible developer. My heart tugged me toward the warmth of family, but my mind raced with code and deadlines. I sat at my desk, torn, the holiday and the bug both demanding my attention, unsure which role I could let down less."}
