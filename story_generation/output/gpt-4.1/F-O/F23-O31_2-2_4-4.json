I glanced at my stepdaughter, who was darting between aisles in the supermarket, giggling as she weaved past startled shoppers.

My wife had asked me to pick up groceries and keep an eye on her daughter, trusting me to set a good example. Now, I was torn\u2014should I leave immediately to help at the accident, fulfilling my duty as a police officer, or stay and address my stepdaughter\u2019s behavior, showing her the discipline and care she needed?
