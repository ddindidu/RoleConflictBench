My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my husband, checking in. We\u2019d barely spoken this week, just quick exchanges about groceries and work. He wanted to talk, to really talk, and I knew I owed him that. He expected me to be present, to share, to listen. But the beach was packed, the waves rough, and every instinct screamed at me to keep my gaze fixed on the swimmers. One distracted moment could mean disaster. My heart pounded as I glanced at the message, guilt twisting inside me. I wanted to be the wife who listened, who cared, but right now, I was the lifeguard who couldn\u2019t look away. The demands of both roles pulled at me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
