I know she\u2019s waiting for my daily update\u2014she worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly, especially since I moved out. But right now, I\u2019m at my station, headset pressed to my ear, eyes darting between radar blips. A pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cMayday, mayday, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart pounds. I have to focus, every instruction I give could mean the difference between safety and disaster. But my phone keeps vibrating, and I can almost hear my mom\u2019s anxious voice in my head, wondering if I\u2019m okay, if I\u2019m eating well, if I\u2019m safe. I want to reassure her, to be the attentive daughter she expects, but I can\u2019t tear my attention away from the screen. The pressure from both sides squeezes my chest\u2014I can\u2019t let the pilot down, but I can\u2019t let my mom worry, either."}
