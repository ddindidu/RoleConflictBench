My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson. I knew something was wrong\u2014her words were clipped, urgent. As a grandfather, I felt the pull to drop everything, to be the steady voice, the comforter, the one who listens and reassures. But just then, a nurse knocked, handing me a chart. My next patient, a young woman, waited outside. Her symptoms were puzzling\u2014fever, joint pain, a rash that didn\u2019t fit any pattern I knew.
