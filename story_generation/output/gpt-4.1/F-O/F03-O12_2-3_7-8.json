Can you come home tonight?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words, and I pictured them both, faces drawn, waiting for me to bring some comfort. But my laptop chimed with another urgent Slack message\u2014our app was down, and the outage was traced to a bug I\u2019d pushed earlier that day. Customers were locked out, and the team was counting on me to fix it, fast. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need this resolved now.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my parents\u2019 need for support and my team\u2019s desperate reliance on my skills.
