As a father, I knew the home loan repayment looming in two months was non-negotiable. My wife trusted me to keep us afloat, and my kids depended on the roof over their heads. Every dollar mattered, and I needed to plan carefully to ensure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. But as an accountant, I\u2019d just received an email about a seminar on upcoming tax law changes\u2014changes that could impact my clients and my own family\u2019s finances. The seminar wasn\u2019t cheap, and it would mean taking a day off work, but missing it could leave me unprepared for the future. My mind raced with the competing demands: the immediate need to save for the loan versus the long-term responsibility to stay informed and compliant. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the anxiety building in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
