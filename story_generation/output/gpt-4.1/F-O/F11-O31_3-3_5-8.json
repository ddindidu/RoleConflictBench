My mom\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cWe need you with us this year. It\u2019s been too long since we were all together.\u201d The holiday trip was something my siblings and I had planned for months, and everyone was counting on me to be there, to laugh, to help cook, to just be a sister. But then, the email from the precinct arrived\u2014my testimony was needed in court, the same day as our family celebration. As a police officer, I knew how important it was to act with integrity, to show up and speak the truth, no matter how inconvenient. The justice system depended on officers like me to do our part. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my support. The court expected my professionalism, my honesty, my duty. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, my heart torn between loyalty to my family and my responsibility to the badge. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decided, someone would be disappointed."}
