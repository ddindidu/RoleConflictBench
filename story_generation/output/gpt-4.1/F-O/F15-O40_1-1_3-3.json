My mind was deep in measurements and supply lists when I heard a crash from the living room. My son, Jamie, had knocked over his juice, and now he was staring at the spreading stain on the carpet, eyes wide with guilt. I knew this was one of those moments\u2014he needed me to show him how to take responsibility, to help him clean up and talk about being careful and honest. But the phone buzzed with a message from the supplier, asking for my final numbers before their midday cutoff. If I didn\u2019t respond now, the whole project would be delayed, and I\u2019d risk disappointing a loyal customer. My heart tugged in two directions: the parent in me wanted to kneel beside Jamie, to teach and comfort; the carpenter in me felt the pressure of deadlines and precision. I stared at the mess, the phone, and my son, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
