She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, her eyes shining with anticipation every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d I promised her I would. But now, at my desk, surrounded by towering stacks of case files, I felt the weight of another promise. The final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s civil trial had just landed on my desk, and the case was intricate\u2014years of evidence, conflicting testimonies, and the expectation that I, as judge, would be fully prepared to preside with fairness and clarity. My colleagues and the parties involved trusted me to be thorough, to leave no detail unexamined. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: my daughter\u2019s hopeful face, the silent demand of the files. My heart ached with guilt and anxiety, torn between being the parent she needed and the judge my profession demanded. I closed my eyes, wishing for more time, knowing I had to choose."}
