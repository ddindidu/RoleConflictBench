Call us when you can.\u201d I hadn\u2019t replied since Friday, and it was already Sunday afternoon. Guilt gnawed at me; I knew how much my parents valued our weekend check-ins, especially since Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But inside the house, the homeowner was waiting anxiously. The termite damage was worse than I\u2019d expected\u2014beams sagging, floorboards soft underfoot. They needed a repair plan today, and I could hear the urgency in their voice when they called me this morning. My phone buzzed again. Another message from Mom: \u201cJust want to hear your voice.\u201d I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My parents needed reassurance, but my client needed answers. I gripped my phone, heart pounding, caught between the son I wanted to be and the carpenter I was expected to be."}
