My stepson\u2019s open class was circled in bright red, a reminder of the promise I\u2019d made to him last week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d he\u2019d asked, his eyes searching mine for reassurance. I\u2019d nodded, determined to show him I cared, to be the parent he could count on. But now, my phone buzzed with a message from the hospital: my patient, Mrs. Lee, was having a flare-up. She needed me to review her labs and adjust her treatment\u2014no one else on the team knew her case as well as I did. I could picture her anxious face, the trust she placed in me to manage her rare autoimmune disease. My mind raced, torn between the classroom where my stepson would look for me and the clinic where Mrs. Lee waited for answers. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. I felt the weight of their hopes pressing on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
