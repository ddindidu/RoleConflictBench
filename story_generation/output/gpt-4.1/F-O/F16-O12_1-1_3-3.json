My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d Guilt prickles at my skin. I know I should help\u2014sharing chores is part of our promise to each other, and I can see the fatigue in their eyes.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a calendar reminder: \u201cOptional Product Brainstorm, 7:00 PM.\u201d The invite says \u201coptional,\u201d but I know how these things go. If I skip it, I\u2019ll miss out on early input, and my absence will be noticed. Collaboration is key, and I want to be seen as a team player, someone who cares about the product\u2019s direction.\n\nI glance between the laundry and my laptop, heart thumping.
