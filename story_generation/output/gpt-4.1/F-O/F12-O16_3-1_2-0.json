He was struggling, his father\u2019s sudden illness shaking him to the core. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my presence. I could almost hear his voice, raw and uncertain, asking if I\u2019d be home soon. But inside, a patient waited, coughing quietly in the exam room. The chart said \u201croutine check-up,\u201d but I knew that even a simple cold could mask something more serious. My mind raced with differential diagnoses, the responsibility to catch what others might miss pressing on my shoulders. I felt the weight of my white coat and the invisible pull of my wedding ring. My husband expected comfort, my patient expected competence. I wanted to be both: the steady wife, the vigilant doctor. But as I stared at the clinic door, my heart twisted, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
