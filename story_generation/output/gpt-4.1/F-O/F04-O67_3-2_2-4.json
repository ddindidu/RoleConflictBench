She was crying, her voice trembling as she told me about her breakup, how she needed me, how I was always the one she could lean on. I promised I\u2019d call her back as soon as I could, but then the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut in: a woman had fallen, broken her arm, and needed immediate care. My hands tightened on the wheel. As a brother, I wanted nothing more than to be there for my sister, to listen and comfort her like I always had. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to focus, to provide calm, professional care to a stranger in pain. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I pulled up to the scene, torn between the sister who needed my support and the patient who needed my skill."}
