My sister called out, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the salad!\u201d I smiled, feeling the warmth of being home, but my phone buzzed again. It was an email from a vendor\u2014just a standard payment confirmation, but protocol demanded a formal reply. My manager had reminded us last week: \u201cPrompt communication keeps our reputation strong.\u201d I could already hear his voice in my head, urging me not to let things slip, even after hours.\n\nMy mother\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, \u201cCome join us, we\u2019re about to start!\u201d I looked at the email, then at my family, all waiting for me. I felt the tug of both worlds\u2014my family expecting me to be present, to laugh and share stories, and my professional self knowing that a delayed response could reflect poorly on me and the company. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family and the cold professionalism of my inbox, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
