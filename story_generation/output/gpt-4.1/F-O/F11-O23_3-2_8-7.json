It was from my younger sister, who also worked at the firm as an internal assistant. \u201cCan you send me the client files for the Carter case? It\u2019ll save me hours,\u201d she wrote, adding a smiley face. I knew she was overwhelmed, and as her sister, I wanted to help, to show her I respected her hard work and trusted her judgment. We\u2019d always promised to be honest and open, to talk through any misunderstandings.\n\nBut as a lawyer, I was bound by strict confidentiality. The Carter files contained sensitive information, and sharing them with someone not directly involved\u2014even my own sister\u2014could breach ethical standards. My heart twisted. If I refused, would she think I didn\u2019t trust her? If I agreed, I\u2019d be betraying my professional duty. I stared at the screen, torn between the expectations of being a supportive sister and an ethical lawyer, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
