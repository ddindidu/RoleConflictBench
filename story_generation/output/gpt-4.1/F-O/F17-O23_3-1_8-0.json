It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew I should at least skim it before the end of the day. Just as I started reading, my mother sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She began to talk, her voice trembling, about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how the house felt too quiet since Dad\u2019s surgery, how she missed the way things used to be. She looked at me, searching for comfort, for the kind of support only a child could give. I felt the weight of her need, the expectation that I would listen, reassure, and be present. But in the back of my mind, the lawyer in me nagged about deadlines, about professionalism, about not letting work pile up. My heart ached for my mother, but my mind kept drifting to the contract, the emails, the responsibilities waiting for me. I felt torn, caught between being the child my mother needed and the lawyer my client expected. I stared at my mother, then at my laptop, paralyzed by the pull of both worlds."}
