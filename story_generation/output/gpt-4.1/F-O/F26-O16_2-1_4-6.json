She wanted the whole family there, and I could see how much it meant to her. My daughter had already arranged for everyone to attend, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. Just as I was about to help my granddaughter rehearse her lines, my phone buzzed. The clinic receptionist\u2019s voice was urgent\u2014one of my regular patients, a single mother, had come in with a high fever and a sore throat. She needed to be seen right away, and there was no other doctor available. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the expectation to be present for my family, to cheer on my granddaughter, and the responsibility to care for my patient, to diagnose and prescribe the right treatment. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family and the duty I owed to my patient, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
