He sat quietly, eyes fixed on his shoes, the stolen candy bar now surrendered. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable. But I also knew he was still getting used to me, and I worried that being too harsh might push him further away. My mind raced with what to say, how to balance discipline with understanding.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a new ride request. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I didn\u2019t get back on the road soon, I\u2019d miss the evening rush and lose out on much-needed fares. As a taxi driver, I was expected to follow every traffic law, to drive safely and calmly, no matter what was happening in my personal life. But my hands trembled on the wheel, torn between pulling over to talk to my stepson or focusing on the road and my next passenger. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
