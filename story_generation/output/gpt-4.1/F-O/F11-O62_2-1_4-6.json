Your brother\u2019s home from college.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and insistent, and I knew how much it meant to her for all of us to be together. As a sister, I was expected to show up, laugh at old stories, and make my brother feel welcome. But as I scanned the pool, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. A group of kids had slipped into the shallow end, giggling and splashing, their parents distracted on the benches. I was supposed to keep everyone safe, enforce the rules, and never leave my post unattended. My shift was supposed to end soon, but the next guard hadn\u2019t arrived yet. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my family waiting at home, my duty to the swimmers right in front of me. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the pull of home and the responsibility of the whistle around my neck."}
