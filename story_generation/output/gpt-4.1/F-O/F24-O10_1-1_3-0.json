My stepbrother nudged me, grinning as our parents tossed out ideas for the weekend\u2014hiking, a movie, maybe a barbecue. They looked at me, waiting for my input, expecting me to join in, to be present, to help us feel like a real family. But my mind kept drifting to the looming deadline: the quarterly financial documents for work. My boss had emailed twice, reminding me how crucial accuracy was, how the company depended on these records being filed on time. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I closed the laptop, I\u2019d disappoint my team and risk errors. If I kept working, I\u2019d miss another chance to bond with my new family, to show them I cared. My heart pounded as I tried to smile, torn between the numbers on my screen and the hopeful faces around me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me right now."}
