My son\u2019s laughter echoes from the next room, but my mind is tangled in lines of code and red performance warnings from the latest review. The new feature is almost done, but the feedback is clear: it\u2019s not efficient enough. My manager expects clean, maintainable code, and I know I can\u2019t cut corners\u2014not if I want to keep this job. The bills on the kitchen table remind me why I\u2019m here, working late again. My family depends on me to keep us afloat, to make sure there\u2019s food on the table and the rent is paid. But every minute I spend perfecting this code is a minute I\u2019m not with them, not helping with homework or tucking my son into bed. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I feel I can give. I hover over the keyboard, torn between fixing the code and closing the laptop to be present for my family, caught in the impossible space between what I must do and what I long to do."}
