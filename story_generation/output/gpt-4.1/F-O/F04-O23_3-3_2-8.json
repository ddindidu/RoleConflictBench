It was my younger sister, her name lighting up the screen. She never called this late unless something was wrong. I answered, and her voice trembled as she poured out her troubles\u2014her job was on the line, and she needed advice, someone to lean on.

They were demanding information about my client, information I knew could devastate their case if revealed. The pressure was mounting, and I could feel the weight of my professional oath pressing down on me.
