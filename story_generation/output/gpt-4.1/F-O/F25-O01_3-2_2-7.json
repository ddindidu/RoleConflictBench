She wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I\u2019d remembered to call Dad about his doctor\u2019s appointment. I glanced at the blueprints spread across my desk, the contractor waiting on the other end of a Zoom call, tapping his pen impatiently. The site had hit a snag\u2014unexpected plumbing issues\u2014and I needed to make quick decisions to keep the project on schedule. But my stepmother expected daily updates, and if I didn\u2019t reply soon, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call my father, who\u2019d then call me, asking why I was distant. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the need to be present for my family and the responsibility to keep my team moving forward. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, caught between typing a reassuring message and unmuting myself to address the contractor\u2019s questions. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I could feel myself stretching thin, uncertain which demand to answer first."}
