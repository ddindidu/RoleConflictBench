My stepbrother trudged in, his shoulders hunched, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something had gone wrong at school. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, listen, and help him through whatever mess he\u2019d gotten tangled in. He dropped his bag and looked at me, waiting for me to ask what was wrong.\n\nBut my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from work: the new staff were about to start the old press, and they hadn\u2019t been briefed on the safety protocols. As the machine repairer, it was my job to guide them, make sure no one got hurt. If I didn\u2019t respond now, someone could get seriously injured.\n\nI could feel my heart pounding, torn between the two worlds. My stepbrother needed me, but so did the staff at the shop. Both expected me to be present, to help, to prevent disaster. I stood frozen, phone in hand, my brother\u2019s silent plea on one side and the blinking message on the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
