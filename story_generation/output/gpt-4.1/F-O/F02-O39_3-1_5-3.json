The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cKeep your area spotless, or it\u2019s your job.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just a few minutes left to sweep up the dust and debris before the final inspection. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my wife, her voice trembling. \u201cYou need to come to the store. Now. Our son was caught stealing snacks.\u201d My heart dropped. As a father, I knew I had to be there, to teach him right from wrong, to show him discipline and guide him through this mistake. But as a laborer, I couldn\u2019t just walk off the job, not with the foreman watching, not with my family depending on my paycheck. The broom felt heavy in my hands, my mind torn between the duty to my son and the responsibility to my work. I stood there, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
