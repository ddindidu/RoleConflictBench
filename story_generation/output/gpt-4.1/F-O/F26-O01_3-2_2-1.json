The lines and numbers blurred as I spotted a critical flaw in the new community center\u2019s design\u2014an oversight that could endanger lives if left unaddressed. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a message from my granddaughter, her words trembling with urgency. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart clenched. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be struggling. I wanted nothing more than to be the wise, steady presence she needed, to listen and guide her through whatever storm she faced. But the clock ticked relentlessly; the contractor was waiting for my approval to proceed, and every minute I delayed increased the risk of a costly, dangerous mistake. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014my family needing my wisdom, my profession demanding my vigilance. I stared at the phone, then at the blueprints, caught in the impossible pull of two worlds that needed me, right now."}
