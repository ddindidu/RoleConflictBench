My phone vibrated with a reminder: the next slot for the experiment was in an hour, but I could easily reschedule. I glanced up and saw my younger brother, Sam, a few feet ahead, distracted by his phone, about to step off the curb. My heart lurched. As his older sibling, I was always supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe. But my mind was tangled with data points and hypotheses, the urge to get back to the lab and not lose my focus. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014Sam\u2019s safety in this moment, and the pull of my scientific curiosity and responsibility. My feet felt rooted to the spot, torn between calling out to him and dashing back to the lab. The seconds stretched, my breath caught between two lives, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
