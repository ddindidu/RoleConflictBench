The ride is smooth, traffic light, and I know I could take my time. But my mind keeps drifting home, to the mountain of laundry that\u2019s been growing for days. My partner texted this morning, a gentle reminder: \u201cCould you fold the laundry today? I\u2019m swamped.\u201d I promised I would, but now, with another fare lined up after this one, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll make it back before dinner. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my passenger expects a calm, safe ride, and I can\u2019t rush or cut corners. At the same time, I know my partner is counting on me to help, to share the load, to keep our home running smoothly. I grip the steering wheel tighter, torn between the responsibility to my passenger and the promise I made at home, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
