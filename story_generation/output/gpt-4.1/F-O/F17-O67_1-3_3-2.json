Laughter and stories bounced between us, and I felt the familiar comfort of belonging, of honoring the traditions that had shaped me. My father caught my eye, nodding with pride as I helped my younger sister recite the family blessing. Just as I reached for my glass, my phone buzzed sharply. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries, every second mattered. My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me\u2014my family needed me here, to uphold our traditions, to be present. But as an ambulance driver, I was also needed out there, to save lives, to respond without hesitation. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, my hands trembling as I looked from my family\u2019s hopeful faces to the flashing screen of my phone, torn between the call of duty and the call of home."}
