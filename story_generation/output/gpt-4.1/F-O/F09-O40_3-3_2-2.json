My heart sank. The principal\u2019s voice was tight: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. They needed me to come in, now, to discuss what happened and how we\u2019d move forward. I looked at the half-assembled frame and the scattered tools around me. The crew was waiting for my inspection before we could start\u2014if I left, the whole site would be at a standstill, and rushing the safety check wasn\u2019t an option. But my son needed me, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the school\u2019s call. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to keep my team safe, and my duty as a mother to guide my child through a mistake. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment."}
