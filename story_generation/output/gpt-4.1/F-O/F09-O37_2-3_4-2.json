My shift as a housekeeping cleaner was supposed to start in an hour, and I still had to deep clean every room in the house before my supervisor\u2019s inspection. But here I was, in the middle of the supermarket, with my son darting between aisles, giggling as he knocked over a display of cereal boxes. Other shoppers stared, some with disapproval, others with sympathy. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and teach him about respect and discipline\u2014about how we treat public spaces and other people\u2019s property. That\u2019s what a good mother would do. But my mind kept racing back to the list of rooms waiting for me, the thought of missing a single spot and facing my supervisor\u2019s disappointment. I felt torn, my heart pounding with anxiety. Should I take the time to correct my son, risking being late and not meeting the cleaning standards at work? Or should I rush him along, ignoring the lesson he needed, just to make sure I didn\u2019t fail at my job? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds I was supposed to manage."}
