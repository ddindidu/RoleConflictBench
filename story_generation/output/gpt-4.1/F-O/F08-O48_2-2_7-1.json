She\u2019d just started her new job and wanted to share her excitement, hoping I\u2019d call soon. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be present, to listen, to celebrate her first steps into adulthood. But just as I was about to reply, the nurse in charge called me back\u2014Mr. Harris, my post-op patient, needed help getting dressed. He was anxious and unsteady, and I knew he depended on me for comfort and safety. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the duty of care. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice, eager for encouragement, while Mr. Harris waited, vulnerable and in pain. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expecting my full attention, each deserving it. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the needs of my family and the needs of my patient, unsure which to answer first."}
