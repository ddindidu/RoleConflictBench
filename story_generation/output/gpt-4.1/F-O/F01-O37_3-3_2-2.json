It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she must be struggling. As a grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to sit with her, listen, and offer the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But the house was only half-cleaned, and my supervisor had made it clear\u2014every room needed to be spotless by the end of my shift. I could already hear her voice in my head, reminding me of the standards, the importance of thoroughness, the consequences of falling short. I stared at the mop in my hand, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility of my job. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
