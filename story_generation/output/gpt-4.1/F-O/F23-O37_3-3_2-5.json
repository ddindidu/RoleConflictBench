The principal\u2019s voice was stern: my stepson had bullied a classmate, and I was expected to come in, talk things through, and show support for both him and the school\u2019s values. I knew how important it was to be there, to show I cared, to help him learn from this. But as I hung up, my work phone buzzed. My client\u2019s house was out of the specialized cleaner I needed for the marble floors\u2014without it, I couldn\u2019t finish the job, and my boss had warned me about being thorough. I was supposed to manage supplies, keep everything running smoothly, and not let clients down. I felt pulled in two directions: my stepson needed me, but so did my job. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety, wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without failing someone."}
