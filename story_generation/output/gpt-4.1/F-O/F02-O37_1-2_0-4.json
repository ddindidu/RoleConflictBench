My shift as a housekeeping cleaner was almost over, but I noticed the bottle of floor cleaner was nearly empty. My client expected me to keep track of supplies, and if I didn\u2019t let them know now, the next cleaning would be a mess. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my kids were finishing school in twenty minutes. I promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like I always tried to be. I could already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the responsible cleaner who never let a client down, and the father who never wanted his children to feel forgotten. My mind raced, torn between sending a quick message about the supplies or rushing out the door to beat the school traffic. I stood there, mop in hand, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
