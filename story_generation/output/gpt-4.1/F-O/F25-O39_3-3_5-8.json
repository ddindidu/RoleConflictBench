Everyone\u2019s waiting for you to start the ceremony.\u201d My hands shook, dust clinging to my skin, as the site-wide evacuation alarm blared overhead. The foreman\u2019s voice cut through the chaos, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d My heart pounded. At home, I was the step-child expected to honor my late father by leading the family\u2019s annual remembrance\u2014something my stepmother insisted would keep us together. But here, on the construction site, I was just another laborer, expected to follow safety protocols without question. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my family, maybe even fracture the fragile peace we\u2019d built. If I stayed, I\u2019d be risking my job and the safety of my team. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I stood frozen, torn between the echoing alarm and the silent pull of family tradition, unable to move in either direction."}
