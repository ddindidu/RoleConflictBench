My phone buzzed in the cup holder\u2014my husband\u2019s name lit up the screen. We\u2019d agreed to talk tonight, to finally lay everything out about our mounting bills and his recent health scare. He wanted honesty, openness, no more hiding worries behind tired smiles. But right now, the wipers barely kept up, and cars darted unpredictably in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring in the gloom. I knew I should answer, to show him I was ready to be the partner he needed, but every instinct screamed to keep both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.

My heart pounded as I glanced between the phone and the rain-slicked chaos outside, torn between the two worlds that needed me, both right now."}
