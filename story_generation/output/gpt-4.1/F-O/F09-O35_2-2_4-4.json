My son darted away from me, weaving between carts and displays, laughing as he ignored my calls. I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to show him that running in public places was dangerous and disrespectful. But just as I reached for his arm, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from work: a suspicious, unattended bag had been found on one of the train cars. As a subway operator, I was expected to respond quickly, to ensure passenger safety and coordinate with security. My heart pounded as I looked at my son, cheeks flushed and eyes bright, and then at my phone, the weight of responsibility pressing down on me from both sides. I felt torn, caught between the need to be a good mother and the duty to protect hundreds of strangers. My mind raced, trying to decide which role needed me more in this moment."}
