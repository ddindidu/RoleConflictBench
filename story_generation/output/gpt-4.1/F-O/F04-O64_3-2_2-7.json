It\u2019s a text from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d My heart sinks. She never asks for help unless it\u2019s serious. I glance at the long line of customers, all waiting for me to smile, scan, and wish them a good day. My manager expects me to keep things moving, to be friendly and efficient, especially now when the store is packed. But my sister\u2014she\u2019s always been there for me, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to be there for her now. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the brother who should drop everything to support his family, and the cashier who can\u2019t abandon his post. My hands tremble as I hand change to the next customer, my mind torn between the demands of the job and the needs of someone I love."}
