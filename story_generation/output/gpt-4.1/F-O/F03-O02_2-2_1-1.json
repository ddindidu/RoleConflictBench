My parents look forward to these conversations, and I know how much it means to them to hear about my week, to feel connected even though I live hours away. But tonight, my laptop screen is filled with lines of code and error messages. The prototype for our new project is nowhere near ready, and the stakeholders are pushing hard for a demo tomorrow. My manager\u2019s emails are piling up, each one more urgent than the last. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the warmth and expectation of my family, the relentless demands of my job. My hand hovers over my phone, torn between dialing home and diving back into debugging. The guilt of possibly disappointing my parents battles with the anxiety of letting my team down. I close my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left waiting."}
