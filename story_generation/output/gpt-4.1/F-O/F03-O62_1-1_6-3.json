They weren\u2019t broken, just a little misaligned, but I knew part of my job was to keep everything tidy. As I started to straighten them, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mom: \u201cRough day. Can you call when you have a minute?\u201d I knew she\u2019d been stressed lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more often, just to make sure everything was okay at home. I looked at the chairs, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. My supervisor expected the pool area to be perfect, but my parents needed me, too. I could hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, hoping for comfort, while also picturing my boss\u2019s frown if the chairs weren\u2019t fixed. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the reliable son and the responsible lifeguard, not sure which expectation I should meet first."}
