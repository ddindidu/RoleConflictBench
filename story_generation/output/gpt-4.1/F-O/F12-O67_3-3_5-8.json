The siren wails, echoing my own racing heart. Dispatch\u2019s voice crackles in my ear, reminding me of the patient\u2019s fragile state in the back. Every second counts, but the roads are slick, visibility nearly gone. I have to drive safely, keep everyone alive. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014my husband\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I know what he wants: a quick update, maybe a promise that I\u2019ll be home soon. Relatives are arriving tonight, and the house is a mess. He\u2019s counting on me to help clean, to make everything perfect. I can almost hear the vacuum running, the clatter of dishes, the anxious energy in our small kitchen. I feel torn in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the reliable partner at home, the other bound by duty to the stranger fighting for life behind me. The storm rages on, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unable to be fully present in either world."}
