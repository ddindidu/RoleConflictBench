It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart twisted, but I slipped my phone back into my pocket. Inside, Mrs. Lee sat anxiously on the exam table, clutching the pamphlet I\u2019d just given her about her new diagnosis. Her eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance and clarity. As her doctor, I knew she needed my full attention, my patience, and my empathy to help her understand what this diagnosis meant for her life. But my mind kept drifting to my brother, wondering what he was going through, feeling the weight of his expectation that I\u2019d be there for him, as I always had. I felt torn, the demands of being a good sister and a good doctor pulling me in opposite directions, each role asking for all of me at the same moment. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s questions, my brother\u2019s message echoing in my mind."}
