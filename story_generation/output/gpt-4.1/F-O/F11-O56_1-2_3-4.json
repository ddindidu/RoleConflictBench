My little brother wanted to go hiking, and my mom suggested a movie night. I felt their eyes on me, waiting for my input, and I knew how much it meant to them that I joined in. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the salon: my last client, a first-time visitor, was unhappy with her hair color and wanted to come back in for a fix\u2014tonight, if possible. My heart sank. I could picture her disappointed face in the mirror, and I knew how important it was to make a good impression, especially with new clients. My family\u2019s laughter faded into the background as I stared at my phone, torn between being the supportive sister they expected and the dedicated hairdresser my client needed. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
