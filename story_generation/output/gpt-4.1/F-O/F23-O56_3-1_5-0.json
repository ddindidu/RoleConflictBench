My heart pounded as I tried to remember all the advice about teaching kids right from wrong, about being firm but loving. I knew I had to address it, to guide him, to show him that stealing was wrong\u2014especially as his step-parent, I felt the weight of needing to prove I could be a good role model. But as we walked into the salon, my other world snapped into focus. Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, breezed in, her smile wide and expectant. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Patel always looked for me, always expected a warm greeting and a few minutes of friendly banter before her appointment. I could see her eyes searching for me, waiting for that comfort she\u2019d come to expect. I stood there, torn, Jamie\u2019s guilty face on one side, Mrs. Patel\u2019s hopeful one on the other, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from opposite directions."}
