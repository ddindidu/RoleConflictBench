My family was gathered, laughter echoing through the house as my father recounted stories from his childhood. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the new pharmacy newsletter I\u2019d been meaning to read. I knew I should be present, helping my mother prepare the traditional dishes, listening to my grandmother\u2019s advice about life and love, but my mind kept drifting to the latest drug updates and clinical guidelines. My supervisor always emphasized the importance of staying current, and I worried about falling behind. Yet, here I was, expected to honor our family traditions, to be the attentive daughter everyone relied on during these gatherings. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family and the weight of professional responsibility. I glanced at my phone, then at my mother\u2019s expectant smile, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
