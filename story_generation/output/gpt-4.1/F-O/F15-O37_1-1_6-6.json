He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, and I\u2019d promised\u2014maybe too quickly\u2014that I\u2019d get it for his birthday. As a parent, I want to keep my word, to see his face light up, to give him something special. But the numbers in my bank account don\u2019t lie, and every extra shift as a housekeeping cleaner is a trade-off: more money, but less time at home.\n\nToday, the supervisor reminded us\u2014again\u2014about the strict safety protocols. Gloves at all times, especially with the new disinfectants. But gloves slow me down, and I\u2019m already behind. If I skip them, I can finish faster, maybe pick up an extra room, earn a little more. But I know the risks: my health, and the rules I\u2019m supposed to follow.\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s birthday is coming, and so is the next inspection at work. I stand in the supply closet, gloves in hand, heart pounding, torn between being the parent I want to be and the employee I\u2019m expected to be."}
