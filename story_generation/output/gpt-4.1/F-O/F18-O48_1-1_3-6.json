My younger sister nudged me, her eyes bright with excitement, and I knew she wanted me to chime in, to be part of the planning. Just as I opened my mouth to suggest a movie night, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, it was a message from the nursing home. Mrs. Carter, one of my regular patients, was having a rough day and had asked if I could come by for a chat. I could picture her sitting by the window, waiting for someone to listen, to make her feel less alone. My family\u2019s voices grew louder, their expectations clear: be present, be involved, be the sibling they could count on. But Mrs. Carter needed me too, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my time, my care, my presence. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat frozen, torn between the warmth of home and the quiet need waiting for me at work."}
