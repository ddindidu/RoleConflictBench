Mom had sent a picture of the dinner table, already set, and my little brother texted, \u201cDon\u2019t be late!\u201d Tonight was Dad\u2019s birthday, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing and sharing stories, just like always. But as I reached for my coat, my work laptop pinged with a high-priority alert. The production system was down\u2014users locked out, support tickets piling up. My manager\u2019s message was blunt: \u201cWe need you on this now. It\u2019s your module.\u201d My heart pounded as I imagined frustrated customers and the team waiting for my fix. I could almost hear my family\u2019s voices in the next room, but the weight of responsibility from both sides pressed in. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the warmth of home and the cold glow of my screen, feeling the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
