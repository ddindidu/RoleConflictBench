I know the symptoms well\u2014strep throat, likely, and I\u2019m already thinking through the best antibiotic to prescribe. But the vibration in my pocket is persistent, and I know it\u2019s my mother. She\u2019s been texting more often lately, asking for updates, wanting to know I\u2019m okay. I promised her I\u2019d check in this weekend, but the clinic is busier than ever, and I haven\u2019t replied to her last message. \n\nAs I finish the exam and prepare to write the prescription, my mind drifts. I imagine my mother waiting for my response, maybe worrying, maybe just missing me. I feel the weight of my white coat and the stethoscope around my neck, the responsibility to my patient right in front of me. But I also feel the tug of home, the expectation to be present as a daughter, to reassure my parents that I\u2019m thinking of them. The demands of both roles press in on me, and for a moment, I\u2019m caught between the clinic and my family, unsure which need to answer first."}
