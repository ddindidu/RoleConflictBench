My phone buzzes with a reminder to update the research logs\u2014something I could do later, but I like to keep things precise and timely. Suddenly, I notice my son darting down the cereal aisle, giggling, weaving dangerously close to other shoppers. I feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. My scientist\u2019s mind is still half-occupied, cataloging results and thinking about the next steps in the lab. But as a mother, I know I should stop, kneel down, and talk to him about behaving in public, about kindness and safety. The pressure mounts\u2014should I pause my mental calculations and focus on parenting, or let this moment slide in favor of scientific accuracy? My heart tugs one way, my mind the other, and for a moment, I stand frozen between the cereal boxes and the weight of two worlds."}
