Did you eat lunch?\u201d she wrote, expecting the usual quick reply and a rundown of my morning. I glanced at the clock\u2014my ten-minute break had just started, and I was supposed to use it to grab a snack and stretch before the next round of calls. Management had sent another reminder this morning: \u201cBreaks must be taken on schedule and not extended. The queue is full.\u201d I could already picture the supervisor watching the break log, ready to question any delay. But Mom would worry if I didn\u2019t answer right away; she always did. I felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between the need to reassure her and the fear of being called out at work. My fingers hovered over my phone, caught between typing a quick message and putting it away to follow the rules. The seconds ticked by, and I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding my attention at the same time."}
