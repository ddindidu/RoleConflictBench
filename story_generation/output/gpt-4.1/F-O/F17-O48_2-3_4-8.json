It\u2019s important to your grandmother.\u201d Her words echoed the recent conversations at home\u2014how we must uphold our traditions, especially now that my grandmother\u2019s health is failing. I could almost smell the familiar dishes, hear the laughter, feel the weight of expectation pressing on my chest.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my pager beeped. Room 214. I hurried down the hall to find Mrs. Lee, her face streaked with tears, clutching the hospital blanket. She\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned. She looked up at me, eyes pleading for comfort, for someone to sit with her, to listen. My supervisor\u2019s words rang in my ears: \u201cOur patients need us, especially in moments like these.\u201d\n\nI stood in the doorway, torn. My family needed me to honor our traditions, to be present, to show I cared. But Mrs. Lee needed me too, right now, in a way that felt just as urgent. My heart ached as I tried to figure out where I belonged most in this moment."}
