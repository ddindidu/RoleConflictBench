Lately, I\u2019d noticed the tension in their voices, the way they avoided each other\u2019s eyes. As their child, I felt the urge to ask, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d I wanted to be there for them, to offer comfort and support, but I hesitated, not wanting to pry or make things worse.\n\nLater that evening, at a networking event, a colleague leaned in and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the story with that big case you\u2019re working on?\u201d As a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t share any details\u2014client confidentiality was sacred. But the question lingered, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides. My parents needed me to be open and caring, while my profession demanded discretion and restraint. I could feel the two roles pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding a different part of me, and I wasn\u2019t sure which part to listen to."}
