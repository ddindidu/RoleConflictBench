My mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a father, I felt the weight of ensuring my family\u2019s financial stability, and the numbers in my bank account replayed in my head like a warning siren. Just then, Mrs. Lee, an elderly patient, approached with a bag full of prescriptions. She was on several high-risk medications, and I knew she needed a thorough consultation to prevent any dangerous interactions. My professional duty as a pharmacist demanded my full attention and time for her safety. But as I listened to her, my phone buzzed with a message from my wife, reminding me about the loan and asking if I could pick up extra shifts. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me to secure our future, but my patient needed me now, in this moment, to safeguard her health. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I could feel my heart racing as I tried to decide where my responsibility lay."}
