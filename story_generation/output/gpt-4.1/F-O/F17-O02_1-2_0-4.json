Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014almost 3 p.m.\u2014and guilt prickles at me. I promised I\u2019d check in more often, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. But my laptop screen is filled with technical documents, and my mind is tangled in the new safety standard that just dropped. The release deadline is Monday, and I\u2019m the lead engineer. If I don\u2019t get the compliance evidence sorted, the whole project could stall, and my team is counting on me. My parents expect a call, a simple sign that I care, but my job demands my full attention right now. I stare at my phone, torn between the warmth of home and the cold urgency of regulations, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
