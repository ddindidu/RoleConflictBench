My son\u2019s laughter echoes from the next room, but my mind is tangled in lines of code and looming deadlines. The new feature I\u2019ve been building for weeks is almost done, but the code review just came back with a slew of performance warnings. My manager expects clean, efficient code\u2014anything less could mean delays, or worse, questions about my competence. I know I need to stay up late, refactor, and test until it\u2019s perfect.\n\nBut the numbers in my bank app haunt me. The home loan repayment is due in two months, and every hour I spend debugging is an hour I\u2019m not searching for freelance gigs or overtime opportunities. My family depends on me to keep us afloat, to make sure we don\u2019t miss a payment. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest\u2014my team needs my best work, my family needs my security. I close my eyes, feeling the pull from both sides, and wonder which demand I\u2019ll have to let down tonight."}
