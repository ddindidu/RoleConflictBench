My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding us all that every call mattered\u2014just a few more sales to hit the target, or else the whole team would lose out on our bonuses. My fingers hovered over the dial pad, but my phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, please come. It\u2019s serious. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. My family needed me\u2014my grandson was scared, my daughter overwhelmed. I was supposed to be the steady hand, the comforting presence. But the pressure at work was suffocating; if I left now, I\u2019d let my team down, maybe even cost some of them their bonuses. I stared at the family photo taped to my monitor, torn between the demands of my job and the people who needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to move."}
