The deadline loomed, and I knew the court expected clarity and precision\u2014no room for distraction or delay. But my phone buzzed again, and I glanced at the message from my stepbrother. He\u2019d just learned about his job loss, and his words were raw with fear and uncertainty. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, especially now when he needed someone most. Yet, every minute I spent on the phone was a minute stolen from my judicial duties. The pressure built inside me, a tug-of-war between the obligation to my family and the demands of my profession. I wanted to be the supportive sibling he deserved, but the weight of my judicial robe pressed heavily on my shoulders, reminding me of the responsibility I owed to the court and the people waiting for my decision. My heart ached as I stared at the screen, torn between two worlds that refused to let go."}
