Everything okay?\u201d Guilt pricks at me\u2014I promised I\u2019d check in more often, especially on weekends. But in the rearview mirror, my passenger is fidgeting, glancing at his watch every few seconds. \u201cCan you go any faster? My train leaves in fifteen minutes,\u201d he urges, anxiety clear in his voice. I grip the wheel tighter, feeling the pressure mount. My parents just want to know I\u2019m safe, to hear a few words from me. But my job demands my full attention, especially now, weaving through city traffic to get this man to his train on time. My phone buzzes again. I know a quick reply would ease my parents\u2019 worry, but even a moment\u2019s distraction could risk my passenger\u2019s safety. The light turns green, and I\u2019m caught between the urge to be a good son and the responsibility of being a careful driver, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
