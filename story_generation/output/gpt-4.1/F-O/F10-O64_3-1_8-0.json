I could hear the pain in her voice, the kind that made me want to drop everything and just listen, to be the daughter she needed right now. But the line at my register was growing, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, reminding me that accuracy and speed were expected. I tried to offer soothing words, but my hands shook as I fumbled with a coupon, the customer in front of me sighing impatiently. My heart ached to give my mom the comfort she sought, but my mind raced with the need to keep the line moving and avoid mistakes.
