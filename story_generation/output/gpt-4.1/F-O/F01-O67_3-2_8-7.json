My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I knew it was my daughter. She\u2019d texted earlier\u2014something was wrong with my grandson, and she needed to talk. As a grandfather, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and advice. But as an ambulance driver, my focus had to be on the road, on getting my patient\u2014an elderly woman with a sprained ankle\u2014to the hospital safely. Every honk and screech of brakes reminded me of the responsibility I carried. My heart ached, torn between the urge to call my daughter and the duty to keep my patient safe. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each refusing to wait. I glanced at my phone again, feeling the pull of family and the pressure of the job, caught in the impossible space between them."}
