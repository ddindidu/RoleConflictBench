I glanced at the screen\u2014Mom. I hesitated, but answered, hearing her voice trembling. She told me Dad had been feeling down for weeks, barely eating, and she was scared. She needed me, her son, to listen and reassure her, to help her make sense of Dad\u2019s silence. My heart twisted; I wanted to be there, to comfort her, to be the son she could lean on. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, her medications spread out on the counter, trusting me to catch any dangerous mix-ups, to explain what she needed to know to stay safe. I could hear the worry in my mother\u2019s voice, but I could also see the anxiety in Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support my family and my duty to protect my patient. I stood there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
