As an accountant, the company\u2019s quarterly tax filing was looming, and I knew every number had to be perfect. The deadline was next week, and my boss had made it clear: no mistakes, no delays. But as a father, my mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment due in two months. I needed to review our family budget, find ways to save, and make sure we wouldn\u2019t fall short. My wife had asked me twice already if I\u2019d checked the loan statement, and I could see the worry in her eyes. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my professional duty demanded my focus on tax compliance, but my family needed me to secure our financial future. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I stared at the screen, paralyzed, knowing I couldn\u2019t let either side down."}
