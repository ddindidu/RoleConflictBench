It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I ducked into the break room, heart pounding, and called her. Her voice was shaky, and she could barely get the words out\u2014she\u2019d just gotten some terrible news, and I could hear her trying not to cry. I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to listen, to comfort her like I always had. But as I whispered reassurances, I heard the bell above the salon door jingle. Through the glass, I saw Mrs. Patel, one of my regulars, walk in, smiling and waving at the receptionist. I knew she expected a warm greeting, a chat about her grandkids, and the comfort of our usual routine. My manager shot me a look, silently reminding me of my professional duties. My sister\u2019s sobs echoed in my ear, but Mrs. Patel\u2019s expectant face was just a few steps away. I felt torn in two, caught between the person who needed me most and the role I was supposed to play."}
