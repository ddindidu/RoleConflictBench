My stepsister\u2019s eyes lit up, and my mom nudged me, expecting me to chime in with enthusiasm. I knew how much it meant to them that I joined in, especially since I\u2019d missed the last two outings. But my phone buzzed on the table\u2014another message from the contractor. The new building site had hit a snag, and if I didn\u2019t coordinate with the team over the weekend, we\u2019d risk falling behind schedule. My boss had made it clear: delays weren\u2019t an option. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my family\u2019s hopeful faces on one side and the relentless demands of my project on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to smile, torn between the warmth of belonging and the cold urgency of responsibility, knowing I couldn\u2019t possibly satisfy both."}
