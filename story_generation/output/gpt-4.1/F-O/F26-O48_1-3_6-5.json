Her numbers were erratic, and the doctor\u2019s orders were clear: monitor her closely, don\u2019t leave her side. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014another message from my daughter, reminding me that the family was gathering tonight for our holiday dinner. It\u2019s tradition, she wrote, and the grandkids can\u2019t wait to see you. I pictured their faces, the laughter, the warmth of being together. But here, in this sterile room, Mrs. Lee\u2019s life depended on my vigilance. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my patient, whose fragile breaths I counted, and the promise to my family, who expected my presence and love. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give. My hands trembled as I recorded another set of vitals, the phone still buzzing with reminders of the life waiting for me outside these walls."}
