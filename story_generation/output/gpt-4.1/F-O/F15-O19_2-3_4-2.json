As I scanned the shelves for cereal, I noticed my child darting between aisles, giggling and weaving dangerously close to other shoppers. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014this was my chance to teach him about respect and discipline, to remind him that running indoors isn\u2019t safe or polite. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: a message from work. The pharmacy was short-staffed, and a high-risk chemotherapy prescription was waiting for me to fill as soon as I arrived. I knew that even the smallest distraction could lead to a catastrophic error. My mind raced. Should I stop everything to correct my son, risking being late and possibly making a mistake with the medication? Or should I hurry him along, letting the teachable moment slip by, so I could focus on the life-or-death task ahead? My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of being a good parent and a vigilant pharmacist, knowing that both roles expected nothing less than my full attention."}
