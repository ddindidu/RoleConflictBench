It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d My family had planned this holiday dinner for weeks, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time. But as the subway rumbled beneath the city, my radio crackled with urgency\u2014security had just reported an unattended bag in car three. My heart pounded.
