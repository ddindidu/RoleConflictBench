She\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I promised her I\u2019d make time, just the two of us. As her brother, I knew how much it meant to her that I included her in my life, especially after missing her birthday last month. But just as I was about to leave, my radio crackled\u2014there\u2019d been a major traffic accident a few blocks away. As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to protect the people involved and keep the scene safe. My duty was clear, but my heart twisted. I could picture my sister waiting, checking her phone, hoping I\u2019d show up this time. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my promise to her, my oath to the city. I stood frozen, keys in hand, torn between the brother she needed and the officer I was sworn to be."}
