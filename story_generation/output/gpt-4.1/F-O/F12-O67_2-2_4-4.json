My husband called from the hallway, \u201cDid you get to the laundry? The kids need their uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I glanced at the overflowing basket, guilt prickling at my chest.

I could already picture her pain, the fear in her eyes, and I knew she\u2019d need me to be calm, quick, and competent. My hands shook as I weighed the uniforms against the emergency.
