It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew my family expected me to be there, especially when things got tough. I glanced over at my grandson, who was playing quietly nearby, waiting for me to join him. But just then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a group of teenagers laughing and edging dangerously close to the deep end, ignoring the bold red \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, and I could already picture the worst if I didn\u2019t intervene. My mind raced, torn between the pull of family and the duty to protect these kids. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, and for a moment, I just stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which way to turn."}
