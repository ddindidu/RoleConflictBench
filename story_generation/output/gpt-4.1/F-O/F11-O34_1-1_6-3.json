Everyone\u2019s asking about you.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just past six. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d make more of an effort, that I\u2019d show up, be present, not just the sister who\u2019s always too busy. But the headset pressed against my ear, and the radar screen glowed with a steady stream of blips. \u201cApproach, Delta 452, request altimeter setting,\u201d crackled through my headset. My job demanded my full attention; a single distraction could mean disaster. I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014my family expecting me to be there, to laugh and share stories, and the pilots relying on my calm, precise instructions. My heart thudded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my sister\u2019s invitation and the cold, unwavering responsibility of the airspace under my watch. I hesitated, caught in the impossible space between being the sister I wanted to be and the controller I had to be."}
