My sales numbers are soaring this week\u2014my manager even gave me a thumbs-up as I passed her desk. I should feel proud, but my phone buzzes with a text from my stepdad: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while. Everything okay?\u201d I realize I haven\u2019t checked in since last weekend. My mom always says it means a lot to them when I reach out, even just a quick hello. But every minute I spend texting is a minute I\u2019m not making calls, and I\u2019m so close to smashing my sales target. I stare at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, torn between the warmth of family and the thrill of professional success. The guilt gnaws at me\u2014am I letting them down if I wait until after work? Or am I risking my momentum at the job if I pause now? My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations, feeling stretched thin between two worlds that both want more of me."}
