My stepkids\u2019 school was letting out early for the holiday, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there at the curb, waving, just like all the other parents. I could picture their faces, searching the crowd, hoping I\u2019d show up this time. But in front of me, the radar screen was a mess of blips\u2014planes stacked in holding patterns, pilots requesting updates, the radio a constant buzz. The holiday rush had hit hard, and every decision I made rippled through the sky, affecting hundreds of lives. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my headset, reminding me of the critical congestion. I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashing: \u201cPick up kids\u20143:15.\u201d My chest tightened. I couldn\u2019t leave the scope, not now, not with so many flights depending on me. But if I didn\u2019t go, I\u2019d let the kids down again, reinforcing every fear they had about not being important. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the sky and the sidewalk, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
