My husband and I had agreed to split the work since his relatives were coming over, and everything needed to be spotless. I promised him I\u2019d be back in time to help with the cleaning, the cooking, and making sure the guest room was perfect. But as I walked into the nursing home, my other world took over. Mrs. Carter was waiting for me, her eyes lighting up as I entered her room. She needed help with her bath and breakfast, and I knew she depended on me to start her day with dignity and comfort. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my husband, reminding me not to be late. I felt the pressure building, torn between the home I shared with my husband and the care I owed my patients. Both needed me, both expected me to give my best. My heart ached as I stood in Mrs. Carter\u2019s room, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
