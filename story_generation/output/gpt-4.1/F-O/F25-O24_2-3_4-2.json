The courthouse clock ticked louder than usual, reminding me that I had less than an hour to review everything and make a ruling that could change someone\u2019s life. My phone buzzed with a message from my stepmother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. It\u2019s important to your father and me that you\u2019re there. We\u2019re counting on you to help lead the blessing.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, heavy with the weight of tradition, echoing the family\u2019s recent insistence that I embrace their customs as my own. My mind raced between the legal arguments in front of me and the expectation that I would be present, respectful, and engaged at dinner. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my duty to the law clashing with my obligation to my family. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the urgent needs of strangers and the longing in my stepmother\u2019s words for me to belong."}
