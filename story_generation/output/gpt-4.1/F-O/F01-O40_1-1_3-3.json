My grandson had called me last night, his voice bubbling with excitement, asking if I\u2019d bring my old chess set and stories about when his mother was little. I promised I\u2019d be there, just like every year. But as I set down my coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a new order from a longtime client, urgent, with a tight deadline. They needed a custom bookshelf, and I had to estimate materials and place the order today if I wanted the wood delivered in time. My mind raced with measurements and supply lists, but my heart tugged toward the laughter and warmth waiting at home. I could almost hear my wife\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cFamily comes first.\u201d Yet, the pride I took in my craft and the trust my clients placed in me weighed just as heavily. I stood in my workshop, torn between the scent of sawdust and the promise of my grandson\u2019s hug, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
