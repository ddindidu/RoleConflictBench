Can you call when you get a chance?\u201d My heart squeezed. He rarely reached out like this, and I knew Mom had been distant lately. I wanted to pull over, call him, and ask if everything was okay at home, like I always tried to do. But the light turned green, and my passenger in the backseat cleared his throat impatiently. I gripped the wheel, reminding myself to keep my eyes on the road, obey the speed limit, and drive safely\u2014my job depended on it. Every time my phone buzzed, I felt torn. My stepdad needed me, but I couldn\u2019t risk a ticket or an accident. The city rolled by, my mind split between the responsibility to my family and the duty to my passenger. I wrestled with the urge to help at home and the need to be a professional behind the wheel, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I drove on."}
