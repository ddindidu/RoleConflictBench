I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed messages from Mom, each more insistent than the last. We always texted during my lunch break, but today, a last-minute walk-in had thrown off my schedule. Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair was thick with product, the kind that needed extra time and care to detangle before I could even think about cutting. She was already in the chair, waiting, and I could feel her eyes on me, expecting the usual attentive service. But Mom\u2019s messages weighed on me; she worried if I didn\u2019t reply quickly, imagining the worst. I could almost hear her voice, anxious and disappointed, if I left her waiting. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind split between the duty to my client and the unspoken promise to my mother. The pressure built in my chest, torn between being the reliable son and the professional hairdresser, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at this moment."}
