I wiped the sweat from my brow, glancing at the pile of unused bricks my supervisor had just pointed out. \u201cMove these to the back lot before you leave,\u201d he\u2019d said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. My hands ached from the day\u2019s work, but I knew the job wasn\u2019t done until every brick was stacked where it belonged. Still, my mind kept drifting to my children\u2014how their faces would light up when they saw me, how they\u2019d scan the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the expectation to be a reliable worker, the need to be a present parent. My heart pounded as I stared at the bricks, torn between the demands of the site and the promise I\u2019d made to my kids."}
