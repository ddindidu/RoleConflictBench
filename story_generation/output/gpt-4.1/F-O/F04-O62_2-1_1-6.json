My little sister, Mia, was sitting on the bleachers, her face streaked with tears. She\u2019d just had a fight with her best friend, and I could see her shoulders shaking as she tried to hide her sobs. As her brother, I wanted nothing more than to rush over, sit beside her, and let her know I was there for her, just like Mom always said we should. But as the only lifeguard on duty, I couldn\u2019t leave my post. At the same time, a group of kids started slipping into the shallow end without waiting for me to check the area, breaking the rules I was supposed to enforce. My supervisor expected me to keep everyone safe, no exceptions. I felt torn\u2014my sister needed me, but so did the swimmers. My heart pounded as I gripped the whistle, caught between the urge to comfort Mia and the responsibility to keep the pool safe."}
