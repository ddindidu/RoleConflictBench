It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling as she asked if I had a moment. She needed advice\u2014something about a friend, trust, and a secret she wasn\u2019t sure she should keep. I could hear the weight in her words, the kind of worry that only a grandparent\u2019s wisdom could soothe. But as she spoke, my mind kept drifting to the order slip on my workbench. A new client wanted a custom bookshelf, and I was already behind on estimating the materials. If I didn\u2019t get the order in by noon, the lumberyard would close, and the whole project would be delayed. My granddaughter\u2019s need for guidance pulled at my heart, but the ticking clock and the promise I\u2019d made to my client pressed on my conscience. I gripped the phone tighter, torn between the comfort I owed my family and the commitment I owed my craft, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
