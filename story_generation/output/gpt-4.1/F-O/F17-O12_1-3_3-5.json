The aroma of my mother\u2019s special holiday stew drifted from the stove, and laughter echoed from the living room where my family gathered, waiting for me to join the annual storytelling tradition. My phone buzzed with Slack notifications\u2014messages from architects in three different time zones, all waiting for my input on a critical feature. The launch date had been moved up, and everyone was blocked until I made a decision. My mother peeked in, her eyes gentle but expectant. \u201cWe\u2019re starting soon, sweetheart. It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I nodded, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of family tradition and the urgent demands of my team. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present, neither willing to wait."}
