My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my mom suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me, expecting I\u2019d be there, too. I nodded, trying to sound enthusiastic, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. The message was urgent: an emergency diversion was coming in, cutting across three sectors. I was needed on the comms, coordinating with other controllers to keep the airspace safe. My mom\u2019s eyes met mine, full of hope that I\u2019d finally join a family outing. At the same time, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing from the other side\u2014lives depended on my focus and quick decisions. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations with the cold, immediate demands of my job. I could feel myself being pulled in two directions, each one impossible to ignore."}
