She had been talking about it for days, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to shut down my laptop, a Slack notification popped up\u2014urgent, all caps. The production system was down, and the outage was traced back to a bug in my code. Customers were locked out, and the team was scrambling for a fix. My manager pinged me, asking for an immediate update. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d make it to the school on time, but the team would be left waiting, and the users would keep refreshing, frustrated. If I stayed, I could help resolve the crisis, but I\u2019d break my promise to my daughter. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I sat frozen, torn between the classroom and the code, unable to move."}
