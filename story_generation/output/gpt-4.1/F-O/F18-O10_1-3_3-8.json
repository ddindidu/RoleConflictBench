My younger sister was excitedly describing her idea for a family hiking trip this weekend, and everyone was chiming in with suggestions. I tried to focus, nodding and laughing at the right moments, but my mind kept drifting to the urgent email I\u2019d just received at work. Our biggest supplier was threatening to stop all shipments unless I resolved a past-due invoice immediately. My manager had made it clear: this was my responsibility, and any delay could cost the company dearly. My mom looked at me expectantly, asking if I\u2019d be free on Saturday. At the same time, my phone vibrated again\u2014another message from the supplier, more insistent this time. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between being the supportive sibling my family expected and the reliable accountant my job demanded. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more right now."}
