She wants us to be honest, to lay everything out\u2014what we can afford, what we can\u2019t, what scares us. I know she needs my full attention, my openness, but my phone keeps buzzing with Slack messages. The product manager is asking for my feedback on the new feature specs, and the design document deadline is tonight. Other teams are waiting on my technical input to move forward, and I can\u2019t let them down. My mind is split: one part wants to close the laptop and look my wife in the eye, to be the partner she needs right now; the other part is calculating how much time I have before the team\u2019s progress stalls. I feel the pressure mounting from both sides, my chest tight with the fear of disappointing someone I care about\u2014at home or at work."}
