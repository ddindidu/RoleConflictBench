I knew I should ask what was wrong, open up about my own worries, and be present for them\u2014after all, we promised to communicate openly, to share our burdens. Just as I turned to speak, a loud splash caught my attention. A group of teenagers was laughing and diving right under the no-diving sign, their feet skimming dangerously close to the edge. My training as a lifeguard kicked in; I was responsible for enforcing the safety rules, for keeping everyone safe. But my spouse\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for connection, for a moment of honesty. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads\u2014torn between the duty to protect those kids and the promise to be there for the person I love. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I was frozen, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
