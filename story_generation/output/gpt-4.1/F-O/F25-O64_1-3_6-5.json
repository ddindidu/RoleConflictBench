The store was finally empty, and I started counting the cash for the end-of-shift deposit, double-checking every bill as the policy demanded. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my stepdad\u2019s name flashed on the screen. He rarely called during my shift. I hesitated, remembering how Mom had seemed distant at breakfast, and how I\u2019d promised myself to check in, to be the supportive step-child they needed. But the deposit procedure was strict; if I made a mistake or left the register unattended, I could get written up or even lose my job. My hands shook as I tried to focus on the numbers, but my mind kept drifting to home. Was something wrong? Was I failing them by not being there? The pressure of being a good step-child and a responsible cashier pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, torn between answering the call and finishing my duties."}
