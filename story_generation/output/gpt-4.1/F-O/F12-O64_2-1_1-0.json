My husband\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from our rushed phone call during my break\u2014he\u2019s anxious, facing a tough decision at work, and he needs me. He asked if I could talk, just for a few minutes, to help him sort through his thoughts. I want to be there for him, to offer the comfort and advice he\u2019s always counted on. But now, as I glance at the small line forming at my register, I feel the weight of my other role. Each customer expects me to be focused, to ring up their groceries without error, to smile and wish them a good day. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014another message from him, maybe.
