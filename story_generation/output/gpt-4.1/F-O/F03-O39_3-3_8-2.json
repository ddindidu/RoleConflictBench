The crane operator\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my signal. I could feel the weight of the beam, the urgency in the air\u2014if I didn\u2019t move now, the whole crew would be stalled, and the beam could become unstable. But when I glanced at my phone, I saw a message from my mom: \u201cCan you talk? Dad\u2019s not doing well. I need you.\u201d My heart twisted. I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless she really needed me. I could picture her sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for my voice, hoping I could help her hold things together. But here, on the site, my hands were needed just as desperately. The foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, calling my name again. I stood frozen, torn between the steel and the softness of home, between the weight of the beam and the weight of my parents\u2019 pain, not knowing which way to turn."}
