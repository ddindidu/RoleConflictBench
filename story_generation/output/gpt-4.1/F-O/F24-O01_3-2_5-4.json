My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my stepbrother, reminding me about the family holiday trip tomorrow. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Mom really wants you there,\u201d he wrote. I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken plea for me to be part of the family, to show up and belong. But the deadline for the office design loomed, and my boss had made it clear: the client expected a complete, functional plan by Monday. Every detail mattered\u2014natural light, collaborative spaces, quiet zones. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family wanted me present, laughing and sharing stories, while my team needed my focus and creativity. I wanted to be the reliable step-sibling, the one who didn\u2019t disappoint, but I also wanted to be the architect who delivered excellence. My chest tightened as I glanced between the family group chat and the unfinished design, torn by the impossible choice between belonging and responsibility."}
