The journal\u2019s submission portal blinked on my screen, reminding me that the finalized report and datasets were due in just a few hours. My mind raced through the data, double-checking every figure, every sentence, knowing that accuracy was everything in my work as a scientist. But from the living room, I could hear my stepfather\u2019s voice, softer than usual, as he spoke to my mother. I remembered how I\u2019d promised myself to check in on them more, to be the step-child who noticed when things weren\u2019t quite right at home. I knew they expected me to ask, to care, to be present. Yet, the weight of my research pressed down on me, demanding my full attention. My heart tugged me toward the living room, but my mind screamed that I couldn\u2019t afford a single distraction. I sat frozen, torn between the family who needed my support and the career that demanded my precision, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
