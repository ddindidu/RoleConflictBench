It was a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you talk to Lily? She\u2019s really upset.\u201d My heart tightened. As a grandmother, I always tried to be there for Lily, to offer her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. I could hear her voice trembling when I called. \u201cGrandma, I don\u2019t know what to do about my friend. She\u2019s been lying to me, and I feel so lost.\u201d I wanted to sit with her, listen, and help her untangle her feelings.\n\nBut as I glanced at the cleaning cart, I noticed the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner. My client expected me to keep track of supplies, and the next cleaning was in just three days. If I didn\u2019t notify them now, there wouldn\u2019t be enough time to restock, and I\u2019d be letting them down. My mind raced between Lily\u2019s pain and my responsibility to my client. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my attention at the very same moment."}
