My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mother, reminding me that tonight I was to lead the family\u2019s annual remembrance ceremony. It was my turn, she said, to honor our ancestors and show respect, just as my father and grandfather had done. I could almost hear her voice, heavy with expectation, echoing the weight of tradition.\n\nA customer approached the counter, her face pinched with discomfort. \u201cWhich painkiller should I take for my headache?\u201d she asked. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of time. I knew I should take a moment to counsel her properly, ask about her symptoms, allergies, and other medications. That was my duty as a pharmacist\u2014to ensure her safety and well-being.\n\nBut my mind was split. If I spent too long here, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, disappointing my family and risking their disapproval. If I rushed, I\u2019d fail my patient and my professional standards. My heart pounded as I stood between the counter and my phone, torn by the demands of two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
