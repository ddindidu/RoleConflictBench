It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just past 8 p.m.\u2014and my laptop screen, where lines of code blink back at me. The new feature I\u2019ve been building for weeks is almost done, but the last code review flagged performance issues. My team expects me to fix them before tomorrow\u2019s demo. I know I should stay focused, refactor the code, and make sure it\u2019s clean and efficient. But my brother never asks for help unless he really needs it. I imagine him sitting alone in his apartment, waiting for me to call, hoping I\u2019ll be there for him like I always promised. My mind races, torn between the pressure to deliver flawless work and the responsibility to support my family. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestle with the impossible choice between being the reliable sister he needs and the dependable developer my team counts on."}
