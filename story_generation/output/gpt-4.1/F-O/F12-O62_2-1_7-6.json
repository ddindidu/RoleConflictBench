He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I knew I should reach out, ask him what was wrong, and share my own worries from work. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or distracted we felt. But my mind kept drifting back to the pool, where I\u2019d just finished my shift as a lifeguard. Earlier, I\u2019d caught a group of kids slipping into the shallow end without supervision, ignoring the posted rules. I\u2019d had to raise my voice, feeling the weight of responsibility to keep everyone safe, even if it made me seem harsh. Now, sitting here, I felt torn. My husband needed me to listen and open up, but my thoughts were tangled with the stress of enforcing rules and the fear of what could go wrong if I let my guard down. I wanted to be present for him, but the demands of my job clung to me, making it hard to switch roles. I took a deep breath, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
