The aroma of her favorite cookies filled the air, and I could see the anticipation in her eyes\u2014she wanted me there, fully present, to celebrate this milestone with her. But my phone buzzed insistently beside me, a reminder from my team that the new safety standard documentation was due by midnight. The updated regulations were strict, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure every detail was perfect before the product release. My mind raced with checklists and compliance forms, but my heart ached at the thought of missing this precious family moment.
