Her voice was bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had just won his first school award, and they were gathering the family for a small celebration at home. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile and hear him talk about his big day. I could almost picture his face, eyes wide, waiting for his grandpa\u2019s hug.\n\nBut as I looked around the cab, I noticed muddy footprints on the backseat from my last passenger. The dispatcher had just radioed in, reminding all drivers that a company inspector might drop by for a surprise cleanliness check. If my cab wasn\u2019t spotless, I could lose my bonus for the month. My family expected me to be present, to share in their joy, but my job demanded I stay and scrub every inch of the car. I stood there, torn, the phone still warm in my hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
