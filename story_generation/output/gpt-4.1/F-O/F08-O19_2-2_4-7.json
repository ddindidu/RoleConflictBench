My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile and hear him talk about his painting. I could already picture his eager eyes searching for mine in the crowd, waiting for my hug.\n\nBut on the kitchen table, my registration badge for the pharmacy workshop stared back at me. The session on new prescription guidelines was tonight, and I knew how important it was to stay current. My patients depended on me to give them the best advice, and missing this workshop could mean falling behind. My manager had reminded me just yesterday how crucial these updates were for our practice.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my pride. My profession demanded my diligence, my commitment, my expertise. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, workshop notes in the other, torn between the laughter of my family and the responsibility of my calling."}
