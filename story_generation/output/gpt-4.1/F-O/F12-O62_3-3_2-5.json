He needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my presence. I wanted nothing more than to sit beside him, to listen, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone in this storm. But as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed with a maintenance alert from the pool. The filtration system was malfunctioning again, and if I didn\u2019t address it right away, the water could become unsafe for the morning swimmers. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety is your top priority. Equipment checks can\u2019t wait.\u201d I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the man I loved, who needed me now more than ever, and toward my duty to protect the people who trusted me with their safety. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the urge to comfort my husband and the responsibility to act as a vigilant lifeguard."}
