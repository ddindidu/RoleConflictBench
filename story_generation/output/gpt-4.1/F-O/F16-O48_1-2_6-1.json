They asked how my shift went, and I hesitated, not wanting to burden them with the details. Still, I knew they expected honesty and openness, so I started to mention the patient who\u2019d just had surgery, how frail she seemed, how every movement required my full attention. My spouse listened, nodding, but I could see the worry in their eyes. I wanted to reassure them, to be present, but my mind kept drifting back to the hospital\u2014wondering if I\u2019d done enough, if the patient would be okay through the night. My spouse reached for my hand, expecting me to share more, to let them in, but I felt torn. I was supposed to be here, attentive and open, but part of me was still in that hospital room, responsible for someone else\u2019s comfort and safety. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I struggled to find the right words, caught between being the supportive partner and the vigilant caregiver."}
