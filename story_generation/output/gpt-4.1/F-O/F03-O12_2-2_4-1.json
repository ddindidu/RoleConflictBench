My inbox pinged with another code review comment: \u201cPerformance issues\u2014please refactor.\u201d I knew the team expected nothing less than clean, efficient code, especially with the new feature launch looming. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, mind racing with possible solutions. But my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from my mother. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, tonight is the family dinner. We\u2019re counting on you to help with the rituals. It\u2019s important to your father and me.\u201d \n\nI glanced at the clock. The dinner was in an hour, and my code was far from perfect. My family had been talking for weeks about the importance of upholding our traditions, especially now, when everyone seemed so busy and distant.
