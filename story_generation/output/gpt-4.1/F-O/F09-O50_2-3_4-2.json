Suddenly, he darted away, weaving between carts and displays, giggling as he went. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline and respect for public spaces. My phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was the hospital\u2014an ICU nurse, her voice tight with panic. The life-support device I\u2019d serviced last week was flashing critical fault codes. They needed me now, to diagnose and fix it before a patient\u2019s life was at risk. My heart pounded. I looked at my son, still running, and then at my phone, the nurse\u2019s words echoing in my mind. Both worlds demanded me, right now. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
