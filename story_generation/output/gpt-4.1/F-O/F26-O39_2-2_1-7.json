Two minutes until the safety briefing. The foreman\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, calling everyone to gather. I knew how important it was to be on time\u2014missing it could mean a warning, or worse, a mark against my reliability. But as I reached for my gloves, my phone buzzed. A message from my daughter: \u201cCan you talk to Jamie? He\u2019s really down this morning.\u201d My heart clenched. Jamie, my grandson, always looked up to me for advice, and I could picture his small face, eyes clouded with worry. I wanted to be there for him, to offer the comfort and wisdom he needed. But the team was counting on me, and the rules were strict. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
