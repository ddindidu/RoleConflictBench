My daughter had called, her voice bubbling with excitement, inviting me to the family dinner. She said my grandson had something important to share\u2014something he wanted the whole family to hear together. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing his eager face and the warmth of everyone gathered around the table. But as I guided my subway train through the evening rush, the emergency alarm blared. My heart jumped. The control panel flashed: medical emergency, car three. Instinctively, I reached for the intercom, my training kicking in. I knew every second mattered for the passenger in distress. But my shift was almost over, and if I stopped now, I\u2019d miss the dinner, the announcement, the look on my grandson\u2019s face. My hands trembled on the controls. My family expected me to be present, to share in their joy. My passengers depended on me for safety, for help in a crisis. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and for a moment, I sat frozen, torn between the people I love and the duty I cannot ignore."}
