I really need you.\u201d My heart tightened. He\u2019d been struggling lately, and as his sister, I knew he needed my support now more than ever. But just then, my patient walked in, sniffling and coughing, expecting me to listen carefully and diagnose her illness with the thoroughness she deserved. I could see she was anxious, hoping for reassurance and clarity. \n\nInside, I felt torn. My brother\u2019s message replayed in my mind, his words heavy with distress. I wanted to be there for him, to offer comfort and advice, just as we always promised each other. But as a doctor, I couldn\u2019t let my personal life interfere with my duty to my patient. She was counting on me to focus, to be present, and to provide the best care possible. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat there, caught between the needs of my family and the responsibilities of my profession, unsure which to answer first."}
