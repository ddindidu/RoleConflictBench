My mom barely touched her coffee, her eyes distant. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, maybe even to offer a hug or a few comforting words. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Johnsons\u2019 house needed cleaning in three days, and I\u2019d just realized their floor cleaner was almost gone. If I didn\u2019t let them know or pick some up, I\u2019d be failing as their cleaner\u2014something I prided myself on never doing. My mind raced between the urge to sit down and ask my parents what was wrong, and the responsibility to manage my client\u2019s supplies before it was too late. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be reliable in a different way. My heart ached with the need to be there for my family, but my sense of duty as a cleaner wouldn\u2019t let me ignore the dwindling bottle in the Johnsons\u2019 closet."}
