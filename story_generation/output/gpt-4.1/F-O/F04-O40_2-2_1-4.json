It was my sister, her voice trembling as she told me about her rough day and how she needed someone to talk to. I glanced at the clock\u2014only two hours left before the electricians arrived, and I still had to finish assembling the framework. The contractor had made it clear: any delay would set the whole project back, and everyone was counting on me to keep things moving. But my sister rarely reached out like this, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t call unless she really needed me. I felt the weight of the saw in my hand, the scent of fresh-cut wood mixing with the anxiety rising in my chest. My team expected me to be reliable, to collaborate and keep the project on track. My family expected me to be there, especially when it mattered most. I stood there, torn, the demands of brother and carpenter pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
