My heart pounded as I listened to the principal\u2019s message: my son had been caught bullying another child. They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss what happened. I could already picture his face, anxious and ashamed, waiting for me to show up and defend him, to be his mother. But as I reached for my coat, my calendar pinged\u2014a reminder that I had a contested motion in court in less than an hour. My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I was their last hope. I could hear my client\u2019s voice in my head, desperate and trusting, counting on me to fight for them. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My son needed me to be his mother, to guide him through this mistake. My client needed me to be their lawyer, to stand up for them in court. I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between the demands of the courtroom and the school office, my heart aching as I tried to decide who needed me more."}
