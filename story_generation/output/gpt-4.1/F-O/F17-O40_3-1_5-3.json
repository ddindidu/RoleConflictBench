My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that I was to lead the family ceremony this year\u2014a role my father and grandfather had always taken with pride. The weight of their expectations pressed on me; I knew how much it meant to them that I honor our traditions, that I stand before our relatives and guide the rituals with confidence and respect.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the workshop: a new client needed a custom bookshelf, and the deadline was tight. I was expected to estimate the materials, place the orders, and get started immediately if I wanted to keep my reputation for reliability. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my craft. I could almost hear the sawdust settling in the empty shop, waiting for me, while my family\u2019s eyes would soon be on me, waiting for a leader. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in both places at once, knowing that failing either would mean letting someone down."}
