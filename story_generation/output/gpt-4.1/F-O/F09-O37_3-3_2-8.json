It was the school. My heart dropped as I listened to the teacher\u2019s voice: my son had been caught bullying another child. They needed me to come in, to talk, to show I cared and would help him understand. I pictured his face, confused and maybe scared, waiting for me to show up as his mother.\n\nBut my supervisor had just reminded us\u2014no exceptions, no shortcuts. Gloves, masks, sanitizers, every protocol followed to the letter. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my shift, risking a warning or worse. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the mother who didn\u2019t show up when her child needed her most. My hands trembled, torn between the mop and my phone, between being the reliable cleaner and the present mother. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that refused to overlap."}
