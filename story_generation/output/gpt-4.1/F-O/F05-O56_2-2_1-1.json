She\u2019d just told me about the promotion her boss offered\u2014one that would mean longer hours and more responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do it,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I reached for her hand, wanting to be the anchor she needed, to listen and help her sort through her doubts. But just then, my phone buzzed. My first client of the day had arrived early. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. I knew the expectation: greet every client warmly, especially new ones, and make them feel at ease. Through the salon window, I saw her\u2014a young woman, fidgeting with her purse, eyes darting nervously. My wife squeezed my hand, waiting for my words, while my mind raced between the comfort she needed and the welcome my client deserved. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which door to walk through first."}
