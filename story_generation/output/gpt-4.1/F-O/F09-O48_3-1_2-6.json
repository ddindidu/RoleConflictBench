She looked especially down today, her eyes searching mine for comfort. I sat beside her, holding her hand, listening as she spoke about her late husband and the ache of loneliness. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my son\u2019s school. My heart dropped. The principal wrote that my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and they needed me to come in immediately to discuss his behavior.\n\nA wave of guilt and anxiety washed over me. As a mother, I knew I should be there for my child, to understand what happened and help him make things right. But as a nursing assistant, I couldn\u2019t just leave Mrs. Carter, not when she needed someone to talk to, someone to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my attention. I felt torn, my mind racing with worry for my son and empathy for my patient, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
