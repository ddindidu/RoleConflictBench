I could see she needed guidance, that familiar look in her eyes\u2014the one that always made me want to drop everything and listen. But just as she opened her mouth, the bell above the door jingled. A new client stepped in, clutching her purse, eyes darting nervously around the salon. I knew what she needed too\u2014a warm welcome, reassurance, the comfort of a friendly hairdresser. My heart tugged in two directions. Emma\u2019s question hung in the air, her need for wisdom pressing on me, while the client\u2019s anxious presence demanded my professional attention. I felt the weight of both roles, the urge to be the steady grandparent and the attentive hairdresser, each expectation pulling at me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, caught between the two worlds I cared about most."}
