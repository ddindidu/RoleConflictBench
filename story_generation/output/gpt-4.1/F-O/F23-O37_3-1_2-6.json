My heart pounded as I listened to the vice principal explain that my stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying another student. They wanted me to come in for a meeting this afternoon. As his step-parent, I knew I was expected to show up, support him, and work with the school to address his behavior. I wanted to be there for Ethan, to show him I cared, even if I was still learning how to fill this role.\n\nBut I was in the middle of my shift as a housekeeping cleaner at the hospital. I had just started scrubbing the patient bathrooms, and I knew the supervisor was strict about safety and hygiene protocols. I was supposed to wear gloves at all times, but I\u2019d only put them on for the dirtiest jobs, trying to save time. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking a warning for not following the rules. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call to be a responsible step-parent and the unyielding demands of my job. I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
