He\u2019s chattering about his day, but my mind keeps drifting to the stack of files waiting for me at home. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to draft a scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline is looming. I know the order needs to be clear and thorough\u2014anything less could cause confusion or delay justice. But right now, Jake is my responsibility. Our parents expect me to look out for him, make sure he\u2019s safe, especially since he\u2019s been bullied before. I glance at my phone, feeling the pressure of the ticking clock and the unread emails piling up. Jake suddenly asks if we can take the long way home, and I hesitate, torn between the duty to protect him and the professional obligation that demands my focus. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
