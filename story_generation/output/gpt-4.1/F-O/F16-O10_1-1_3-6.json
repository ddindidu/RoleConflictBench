My partner\u2019s been patient, but I know the expectation: we share these chores, and it\u2019s my turn. I reach for a towel, but my phone buzzes\u2014a new email. It\u2019s from a vendor, a standard payment confirmation, but protocol demands a formal reply. As an accountant, I can\u2019t ignore it; timely communication is part of my job, and I pride myself on professionalism. My partner walks by, glancing at the laundry, then at me, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. I want to be present, to show I care about our home, but the email nags at me, a thread pulling me back to my desk. My mind races, torn between folding laundry and drafting a reply, each choice feeling like a small betrayal of the other role. I stand frozen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of work and home, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
