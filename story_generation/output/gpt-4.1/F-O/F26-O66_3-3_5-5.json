It\u2019s serious.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandmother, I knew my family needed me\u2014my presence, my comfort, my steady hands. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold my grandchild and reassure everyone that things would be okay.\n\nBut as I turned the corner, a construction detour forced all traffic into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, the yellow sign flashed: SCHOOL ZONE. Children clustered near the curb, some darting unpredictably. The urge to rush, to get to my family as fast as possible, pressed hard against my chest. Yet, as a taxi driver, I was responsible for every life around me. I had to obey the speed limit, stay alert, and drive defensively\u2014no matter how desperate I felt.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. My family\u2019s need pulled me forward, but the safety of these children and my duty as a driver held me back. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the demands of my heart and the rules of the road."}
