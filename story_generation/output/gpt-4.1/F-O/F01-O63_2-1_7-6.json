As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break now\u2014supervisors had said we could be flexible today since the call volume was light. My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, I got the job! Can we talk?\u201d My heart swelled with pride. I knew how much this meant to her, and as her grandfather, I wanted nothing more than to hear every detail, to be the first to share in her excitement.\n\nBut the rules at work were clear: breaks had to be taken within certain windows, and I was expected to return promptly. If I called her now, I might run over my allotted time, risking a reprimand. Yet, if I waited, I\u2019d miss the chance to be there for her in this special moment. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family expecting my presence, my job demanding my discipline. I stared at my phone, torn between the joy of a proud grandfather and the responsibility of a diligent employee, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
