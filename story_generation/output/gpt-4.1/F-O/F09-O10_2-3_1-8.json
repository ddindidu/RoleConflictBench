They threatened to stop all shipments unless I resolved the overdue invoice today. I knew what that meant for the company\u2014production delays, angry clients, and a mess I\u2019d have to clean up. I started drafting a response, my mind racing through numbers and possible solutions. Then my phone buzzed: a reminder for Mia\u2019s open class at school, starting in just thirty minutes. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines and asking if I\u2019d be there. I could picture her scanning the classroom for me, her face falling if I didn\u2019t show. My boss expected me to handle the supplier crisis immediately, but my daughter expected me to be in that classroom, cheering her on. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
