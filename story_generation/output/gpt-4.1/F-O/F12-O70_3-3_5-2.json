My phone buzzed on the counter\u2014dispatch reminding me that the medical supply package needed to be at the hospital by noon, no exceptions. I glanced at the living room, half-vacuumed, and the pile of laundry waiting to be folded. My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, your cousins will be here in two hours. Can you help set the table?\u201d I nodded, forcing a smile, but my mind raced. If I left now, I could just make the delivery, but the house would be a mess, and I\u2019d let my family down. If I stayed, the hospital might not get what they needed in time. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the reliable wife, the dependable delivery person. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to move."}
