My family gathered around, laughing and sharing stories, expecting me to join in the tradition of preparing the meal together, hands bare, feeling the dough and vegetables as generations before us had done. My mother smiled at me, nodding toward the bowl, her eyes full of warmth and expectation. But in my other life, as a housekeeping cleaner, I\u2019d been drilled on the importance of safety and hygiene\u2014always wear gloves, never touch food or surfaces with bare hands after cleaning chemicals. The memory of my supervisor\u2019s stern warnings echoed in my mind. I glanced at my hands, torn between slipping on gloves and risking my family\u2019s disapproval, or going barehanded and betraying everything I\u2019d learned about cleanliness. My heart pounded as I looked from my family\u2019s eager faces to the gloves tucked in my bag, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
