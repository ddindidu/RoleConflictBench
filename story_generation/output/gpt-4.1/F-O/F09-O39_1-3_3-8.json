He was fidgety, but I knew these small lessons mattered. My phone buzzed\u2014an emergency alert from the construction site. The site-wide evacuation alarm had sounded. My heart pounded. I was supposed to be logged in remotely, monitoring the site\u2019s progress, ready to respond to emergencies. Protocol was clear: drop everything, check in, and head to the muster point. But here I was, in the middle of teaching my son about kindness and respect, something I promised myself I\u2019d never rush. My supervisor\u2019s messages started coming in, each one more urgent. My son looked up at me, waiting for my next gentle correction. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my team counting on me to follow safety rules, my child needing my steady presence. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between the rules of the site and the rules of my home, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
