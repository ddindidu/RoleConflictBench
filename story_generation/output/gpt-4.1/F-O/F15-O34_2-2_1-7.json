My daughter had been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class presentation, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. But as I slipped on my headset at the control tower, the radar screen lit up with a mess of rerouted flights. Thunderstorms were rolling in, and the airspace was a tangled web of blinking blips, each one a plane needing guidance. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, \u201cWe need all hands on deck\u2014handoffs are going to be nonstop.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the expectation to keep hundreds of passengers safe in the sky, and the promise I\u2019d made to my daughter to be there, watching her from the classroom door. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the urgent demands of the tower and the quiet hope of a little girl waiting at school."}
