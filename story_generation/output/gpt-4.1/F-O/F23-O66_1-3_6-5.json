My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my memory\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days until I could buy him that Nintendo, a promise I made to help him feel at home in this new family. But fares had been slow, and every dollar mattered. I needed to work extra shifts, keep every tip, and make sure I didn\u2019t get fined or lose my license. As I turned the corner, a construction detour forced all the cars into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, the yellow school zone sign blinked, and a group of kids lingered near the curb, their backpacks swinging. The car behind me honked impatiently. If I slowed down, I\u2019d lose time and maybe a fare. If I rushed, I\u2019d risk a ticket\u2014or worse. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the provider my family needed, keep my promise, but also be the careful driver my job demanded. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt trapped between the roles, unsure which demand to answer first."}
