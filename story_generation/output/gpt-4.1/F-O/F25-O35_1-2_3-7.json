It\u2019s important to your dad.\u201d My heart squeezed. Ever since I became part of this family, I\u2019d tried to show I cared about their traditions, even if they still felt foreign to me. Tonight\u2019s holiday gathering was supposed to be my chance to prove I belonged.\n\nBut my other phone vibrated\u2014dispatch reminding me about the mandatory pre-shift briefing. New operational procedures, no exceptions. As a subway operator, I knew the rules: miss a briefing, risk suspension. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cWe count on you to keep the system safe and running.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. The briefing started in ten minutes, the same time my family would be gathering in the living room, waiting for me to light the candles.

I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
