The house was a whirlwind of activity\u2014relatives would arrive in just a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. We\u2019d promised each other to share the load, to make our home welcoming. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen: a dispatch call. A patient needed transport, nothing life-threatening, but protocol demanded I respond immediately. I could already picture the city traffic, the frustration of weaving through impatient drivers, the pressure to get there quickly but safely. My spouse caught my eye, silently pleading for help with the vacuuming. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my family, my responsibility to my job. My heart pounded as I grabbed my keys, torn between the chaos at home and the urgency of the call, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
