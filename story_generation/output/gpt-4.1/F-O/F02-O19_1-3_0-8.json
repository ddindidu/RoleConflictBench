My children\u2019s school was letting out soon, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like all the other parents. They\u2019d been talking about it all week, excited for me to see their artwork and meet their teacher. But here I was, sitting in front of my laptop in the cramped back office, logged into a national continuing education webinar that was crucial for maintaining my pharmacist license. The speaker\u2019s voice droned on about new treatment protocols, and I tried to focus, but my mind kept drifting to my kids\u2019 expectant faces. I knew how much it meant to them, but I also knew how important it was to stay updated in my profession. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning that missing these sessions could put my job at risk. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence at the same time. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPick up kids \u2013 3:00 PM.\u201d I stared at the screen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
