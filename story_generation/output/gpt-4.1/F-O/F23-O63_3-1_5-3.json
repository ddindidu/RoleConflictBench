The store manager\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response. I knew what was expected of me as her step-parent: to teach her right from wrong, to show her that stealing was unacceptable, and to discipline her with fairness and care. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014another reminder from my manager about the week\u2019s sales targets. I was already ahead, but every call, every sale, mattered. If I didn\u2019t keep up this momentum, I might fall behind next week, and the pressure to perform was relentless.\n\nMy mind raced. Should I take her outside and have the difficult conversation she needed, risking precious time away from my calls? Or should I rush through this, offer a quick scolding, and get back to my headset and scripts? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I looked at my stepdaughter, her eyes wide with fear and confusion, and felt the tug-of-war inside me grow stronger."}
