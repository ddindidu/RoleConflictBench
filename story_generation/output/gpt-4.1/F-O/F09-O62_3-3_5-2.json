My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty as a lifeguard. Suddenly, I caught sight of my son near the snack stand, his small hand slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart clenched. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with discipline and honesty. But the beach was packed, the tide was high, and every instinct screamed that I couldn\u2019t look away from the water for even a second. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my child needed me to be his mother, to correct him, to show him the consequences of his actions. But dozens of strangers depended on me to keep them safe, to never let my attention waver. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my son and the silent, ever-present danger of the sea."}
