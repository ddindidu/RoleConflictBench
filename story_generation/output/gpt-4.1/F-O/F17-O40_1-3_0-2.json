My hands moved automatically, checking the teeth of the circular saw, tightening bolts, making sure every tool was in perfect condition before the crew arrived. Safety was everything here\u2014one mistake, one overlooked detail, and someone could get hurt. My mind ticked through the checklist, but my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of another world. It was my mom, just a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d text, but I knew she expected more than a quick reply. She wanted to hear from me, to know I was okay, to feel that connection we promised to keep up every weekend. I felt the weight of the wrench in my hand and the weight of her expectations pressing on my chest. If I stopped now to call her, I\u2019d lose focus, maybe miss something important in the inspection. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting her down again, making her worry. The noise of the shop faded as I stood there, torn between the safety of my team and the comfort of my family, not sure which role needed me more in that moment."}
