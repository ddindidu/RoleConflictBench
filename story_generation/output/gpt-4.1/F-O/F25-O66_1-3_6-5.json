Can you call when you get a chance?\u201d My heart squeezed. I knew he needed someone to talk to, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be there for him and Mom, especially since things had been tense at home lately. But right now, I was behind the wheel, driving a passenger through a busy neighborhood. Suddenly, orange cones forced me into a single lane, and I spotted a group of kids giggling near the curb, backpacks swinging. The school zone sign flashed, reminding me to slow down. My passenger checked his watch, clearly in a hurry. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the urge to pull over and call home, to be the caring step-child my parents needed, and the responsibility to drive safely, obey the law, and protect the children outside. My hands tightened on the wheel, torn between the demands of my family and the duty to my passengers and the kids on the street. I could feel my chest tighten as I tried to decide what to do next."}
