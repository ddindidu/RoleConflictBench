It was our weekly call, something my mom insisted on to keep our family close. He asked about my classes, my friends, and I could hear the hope in his voice that I\u2019d share more than just the basics. I tried to focus, but my eyes kept darting to the pool. The afternoon sun glinted off the water, and I scanned the swimmers, counting heads, watching for any sign of trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a kid in the middle of the pool, arms flailing, head bobbing awkwardly. My heart pounded. I knew I needed to keep my eyes on the water, to be ready to jump in at any second. But my stepdad was still talking, waiting for me to respond, to show I cared. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. My hand tightened around the phone as I tried to decide what to do next."}
