The family group chat buzzed with excitement\u2014tonight was the long-awaited family gathering, and my daughter had sent a picture of my grandson holding up a drawing he made just for me. I could almost hear his little voice asking if I\u2019d be there to play with him. But as I tucked my phone away, Mrs. Evans, my patient, looked up at me with tired eyes. She\u2019d been quieter than usual, her loneliness almost palpable as I sat beside her bed. She reached for my hand, her grip gentle but pleading. \u201cWill you stay a little longer?\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I knew how much these moments meant to her, how my presence could ease her isolation, even if just for a while. Yet, the image of my family waiting at home pressed on my mind, the expectation to be present, to be the grandfather my family needed. The weight of both worlds settled on my shoulders, and I felt the ache of being needed in two places at once, torn between the warmth of home and the comfort I could offer here."}
