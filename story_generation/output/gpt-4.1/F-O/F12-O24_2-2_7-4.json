The trial had ended yesterday, and now the responsibility of writing the final judgment weighed heavily on me. Thirty days, I reminded myself, to craft a clear, detailed opinion\u2014every word scrutinized, every fact carefully considered. My mind kept circling the evidence, the legal arguments, the consequences of my words.\n\nAcross from me, my husband stirred his tea, glancing at me with concern. He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I could sense something was troubling him. As his wife, I knew I should reach out, ask him what was wrong, share my own worries, and listen to his. We\u2019d always promised to communicate openly, to never let stress build up between us.\n\nBut as I looked at him, guilt twisted inside me. If I started this conversation, I\u2019d lose precious hours needed for the judgment. If I ignored him, I\u2019d be failing him as a partner. The expectations of my two worlds pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of justice and the needs of the person I loved most."}
