My husband\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I nod, guilt already gnawing at me, but my phone buzzes before I can even start. It\u2019s the site foreman\u2014urgent. The crane is holding a steel beam, swaying in the wind, and I\u2019m needed now to help guide it into place. My boots are still muddy from the morning, my hands rough and tired, but the job can\u2019t wait. If I don\u2019t go, the whole crew is stalled, and the beam could become dangerous. I glance back at the laundry, then at my work gear by the door. My chest tightens, torn between the home that needs me and the job that depends on me. I can\u2019t be in both places at once, and the weight of both worlds presses down, demanding an answer I don\u2019t have yet."}
