My younger sister trudged in, her shoulders slumped, eyes red. She dropped her backpack and headed straight for her room, but not before I caught the quiver in her voice as she muttered, \u201cHi.\u201d I knew something was wrong\u2014she always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As her sibling, I felt the pull to go after her, to sit on her bed and listen, to be the support she needed after a rough day with her friends. But the clock on my screen glared at me: the compliance report was due by midnight, and the new safety standard was stricter than ever. If I missed a single detail, the whole release could be delayed, and my team was counting on me. My heart twisted as I sat frozen, torn between the urge to comfort my sister and the pressure to meet my professional responsibilities. The weight of both worlds pressed down, and I found myself unable to move, caught in the impossible space between family and duty."}
