I knew I should sit down, ask what was wrong, and really listen\u2014be the partner who communicates openly, who shares and supports. But as I glanced around, I saw the crumbs on the counter, the dust gathering on the shelves, and the laundry basket overflowing in the hallway. My job as a housekeeping cleaner meant the house had to be spotless, and I\u2019d only managed to do a quick sweep and tidy up the obvious messes today. My supervisor had already warned me about missing details, and I couldn\u2019t afford another complaint.\n\nInside, I felt pulled in two directions. My spouse needed me to be present, to talk and share, but the house demanded my attention too. If I sat down now, I\u2019d fall behind on cleaning, but if I kept working, I\u2019d be ignoring the person I loved most. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the kitchen, torn between the expectations of my job and my marriage, unsure which role to answer first."}
