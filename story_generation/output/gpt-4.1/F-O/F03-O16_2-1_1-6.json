It was Sunday evening\u2014my usual time to call my parents. I could picture my mother waiting by the phone, expecting to hear about my week, wanting to know I was eating well and getting enough sleep. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved to the city for my residency. But on the other side of the door, a patient waited, her chart in my hand: strep throat, fever, and a worried look when I last saw her. She needed my full attention, a careful review of her symptoms, and the right prescription. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my parents\u2019 gentle expectation for connection, my patient\u2019s need for competent care. My heart tugged toward home, but my mind raced with clinical questions. The phone vibrated again, and I stood frozen, torn between the son my parents hoped for and the doctor my patient needed."}
