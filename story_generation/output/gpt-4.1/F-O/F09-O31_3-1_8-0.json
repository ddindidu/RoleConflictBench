My son\u2019s school fees, groceries, and the mortgage all swirled in my mind. I needed every overtime shift I could get, every extra dollar to keep us afloat. My phone buzzed\u2014dispatch. A noise complaint, just a few blocks away. Another late-night party, neighbors losing sleep, and I was the officer on call. I glanced at the clock; it was almost midnight. My son was asleep in the next room, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be home tonight. But duty called. If I ignored the call, I risked my job, and with it, our financial stability. If I left, I\u2019d break my promise to my son, who already missed me more than I liked to admit. My heart pounded as I grabbed my keys, torn between the badge and the home I was fighting so hard to keep."}
