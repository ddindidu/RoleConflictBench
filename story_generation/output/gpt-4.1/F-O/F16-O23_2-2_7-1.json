The purchase agreement deadline loomed, and every clause demanded my full attention. My mind raced with contingencies and risks, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the way my spouse lingered by the sink, shoulders tense, eyes distant. I remembered our promise to communicate openly, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. I wanted to ask what was wrong, to listen and be present, but the clock on the wall ticked louder with every passing minute. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReview contract by 9 PM.\u201d I felt torn\u2014my client depended on my thoroughness, but my partner needed me, too. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, and I sat frozen, caught between the urge to close my laptop and the pressure to keep working, unsure which role to honor first."}
