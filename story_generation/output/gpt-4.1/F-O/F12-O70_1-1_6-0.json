He asked, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and I hesitated, thinking of the package that had arrived late\u2014just an hour behind schedule, but still within the day. As a delivery person, I knew the company expected punctuality, precision, and no excuses. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery minute counts. No delays.\u201d I felt the weight of that late delivery pressing on my chest, but I also remembered the expectation at home\u2014to be open, to share, to not keep secrets. My husband looked at me, waiting for an answer, and I could sense his hope for honesty, for connection. But if I told him about the late delivery, would he worry about my job? Would he think less of me? The urge to protect him from my stress clashed with the need to be truthful. I stared at my plate, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my marriage, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
