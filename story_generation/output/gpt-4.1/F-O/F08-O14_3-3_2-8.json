My heart skipped; if the warning was right, a hazardous leak could be imminent. I started toward the lab, mind already running through safety protocols, when my personal phone buzzed. It was a video call from my granddaughter, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She looked so small and lost, and I knew she needed the comfort only I could give. But the lab\u2019s alarms grew louder in my mind, reminding me of my responsibility to keep everyone safe. My hands shook as I held both phones, torn between the wisdom and comfort my granddaughter desperately sought and the immediate, technical demands of my scientific duty. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the call of family and the call of science, not knowing which to answer first."}
