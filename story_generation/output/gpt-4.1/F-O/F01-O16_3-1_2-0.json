It was a message from my grandson, his words urgent: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. He rarely reached out like this, and I knew something serious must be weighing on him. At that moment, my nurse knocked, ushering in my next patient\u2014a middle-aged man with a runny nose and a cough, here for his routine check-up. As a doctor, I owed him my full attention, to listen carefully, to ensure his symptoms weren\u2019t masking something more serious. But as a grandfather, I felt the pull to step out, to call my grandson, to offer the guidance and comfort only I could give. The expectations pressed in from both sides: my patient waiting, trusting me with his health; my grandson, reaching out for wisdom only I could provide. I sat there, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, uncertain which path to take first."}
