He\u2019d been saving up, but the final purchase depended on me, and I knew how much it meant to him. I wanted to give him everything, to keep my promise, to show him that his hard work and patience would be rewarded. But as I checked my phone, an email from a client flashed across the screen, reminding me of the delicate case I was handling\u2014one that paid well, but demanded absolute discretion.\n\nLater that evening, at a networking event, a colleague leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHey, what\u2019s the real story with your new client? I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d The question was casual, but the expectation was clear: share a little, build trust, maybe open doors for future business. I felt the weight of my roles pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s anticipation, my family\u2019s needs, the professional code I\u2019d sworn to uphold. My mind raced, torn between the urge to secure more work for my family\u2019s sake and the unyielding duty to protect my client\u2019s secrets. I hesitated, caught in the silent struggle between father and lawyer."}
