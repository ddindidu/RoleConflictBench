My husband\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cLet\u2019s try to keep up with it this week, okay?\u201d I knew he\u2019d had a long shift, and I wanted to do my part. But just as I reached for a crumpled t-shirt, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from work: the new staff were about to run the industrial mixer, and no one had shown them the safety protocols. My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t guide them now, someone could get hurt. But if I left the laundry again, I\u2019d be letting my husband down, and the guilt of neglecting home would gnaw at me. I stood frozen, torn between the safety of my team and the quiet expectations of my marriage, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I could give at once."}
