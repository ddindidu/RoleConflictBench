The radio crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, each one depending on me to guide them safely through the chaos. A sudden route closure has turned the sky into a tangled knot of holding patterns, and every second counts. My hands hover over the console, calculating, prioritizing, trying to keep everyone safe. But my phone vibrates insistently in my pocket\u2014my mother\u2019s name flashes on the screen. I know what she wants: tonight is the family\u2019s annual tradition, a ritual my parents have reminded me about all week. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a dinner,\u201d my father said, \u201cit\u2019s who we are.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, that I wouldn\u2019t let work come between us. But now, as the sky grows more crowded and the pressure mounts, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expects me to honor our traditions, to show I belong.
