The filtration system\u2019s warning light blinked insistently, a silent alarm that only I seemed to notice. As a lifeguard, I knew the risk\u2014unclean water could make swimmers sick, and the pool could be shut down if the problem wasn\u2019t fixed. But repairs would mean closing the pool for the day, and if I reported it, I\u2019d lose a full shift\u2019s pay. My family was already scraping by; every dollar mattered for groceries, rent, and my son\u2019s school supplies. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the whistle around my neck and the invisible badge of motherhood. My supervisor expected me to keep the pool safe, but my family needed me to keep working. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking light, torn between the safety of strangers and the security of my own home, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left unprotected."}
