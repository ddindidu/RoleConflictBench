The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014groceries, rent, school supplies. I needed to make sure we had enough for the month. My phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cClient needs your time estimates by noon. Contract\u2019s on hold until then.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The project was complex, and I hadn\u2019t finished reviewing the requirements. If I rushed, I might miss something critical, but if I delayed, the contract\u2014and my job security\u2014could be at risk. My chest tightened. My family depended on my paycheck, but my team depended on my expertise. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing down from both sides. My daughter called for me, and I hesitated, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the demands of my profession, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
