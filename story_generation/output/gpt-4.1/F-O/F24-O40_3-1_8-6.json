Before I could answer, a customer entered, holding her daughter\u2019s broken toy and asking for a repair quote. I glanced at the clock\u2014my lunch break was almost over, and I had promised my boss I\u2019d handle all walk-ins today.\n\nAs I started to examine the customer\u2019s toy, I noticed my stepbrother drifting toward the open door, distracted by something outside. Suddenly, he stepped onto the sidewalk, not looking for traffic. My heart pounded. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to keep him safe, but as a carpenter, I was expected to focus on the customer and provide a quick, professional quote. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urgent need to protect my brother and the responsibility to my work and the waiting customer. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of family and duty."}
