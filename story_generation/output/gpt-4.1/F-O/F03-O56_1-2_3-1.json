My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t be late for the family blessing tonight. It\u2019s important.\u201d I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, just like every year, to light the candles and recite the prayers. But as I slipped behind my station, a young woman stepped inside, her eyes darting nervously. She clutched her coat, hesitating at the threshold. I could see her anxiety, the way she scanned the room for a friendly face. My training kicked in: greet every client warmly, make them feel at home. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my father\u2019s reminder about the family gathering. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. Should I rush through the appointment to make it home in time, risking the comfort of my client? Or do I give her the care she deserves, knowing I might miss the family tradition that means so much to my parents? My heart pounded as I stood between the salon chair and the pull of home, torn by the expectations of both roles."}
