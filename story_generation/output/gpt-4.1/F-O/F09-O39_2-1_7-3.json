My hands ache from hauling bricks all day, but I know the routine: every worker is expected to sweep their area spotless, no exceptions. Safety is everything here\u2014one stray nail, one pile of dust, and someone could get hurt. But as I grip the broom, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from my eldest: \u201cMom, we\u2019re out of rice. Can you come home soon?\u201d My heart twists. The kids are waiting for dinner, and I still need to stop by the store before it closes. If I leave now, I can make it, but I\u2019ll be shirking my duty here, risking a warning or worse. If I stay and do the job right, I might not have time to buy food, and my children will go to bed hungry. The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I stand frozen, broom in hand, torn between the demands of the site and the needs of my family."}
