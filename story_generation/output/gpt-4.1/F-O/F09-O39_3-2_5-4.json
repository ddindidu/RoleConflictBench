The store manager\u2019s voice was tense\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart pounded. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable and guide him toward honesty. But as I turned to leave, I spotted a small puddle of oil glistening on the walkway. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the site safe, no exceptions.\u201d If someone slipped, it would be on me. I glanced at the clock, torn. My son needed me now, to see that I cared enough to show up and help him learn from his mistake. But my coworkers depended on me to keep them safe, to not leave hazards behind. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between the mother my son needed and the worker my team relied on."}
