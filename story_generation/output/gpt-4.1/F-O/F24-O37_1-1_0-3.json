He\u2019d been holed up for days, cramming for his final exam, and I knew the pressure was getting to him. As the housekeeper, I was supposed to finish the inventory and report any shortages before the end of my shift. But as his step-sibling, I was expected to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort when he was anxious. I could hear him pacing, muttering formulas under his breath, and I felt the urge to drop everything and knock on his door, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. But the list in my hand reminded me of the supplies I still had to count, the responsibilities I couldn\u2019t ignore. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the brother who needed me, and the job that demanded my attention. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the roles I was supposed to fill, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
