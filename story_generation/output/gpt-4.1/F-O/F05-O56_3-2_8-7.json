It\u2019s important.\u201d My stomach tightened. We\u2019d been dancing around the topic of our finances for weeks, and I knew she expected me to be honest, to lay everything out on the table. But right now, I was standing behind my next client, a regular who\u2019d just rushed in from the gym, her hair damp and sticking to her forehead. She smiled apologetically, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t have time to shower. Can you just trim it quickly?\u201d \n\nAs a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before I even think about picking up my scissors, especially when it\u2019s sweaty and greasy. Hygiene and professionalism are non-negotiable. But my mind kept drifting to my wife, to the conversation waiting for me at home, to the pressure of being open and vulnerable when I felt so exposed already. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each with its own rules I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my chair and my home."}
