The open class at my daughter\u2019s school started in thirty minutes, and she\u2019d begged me to be there. \u201cPlease, Mom, I want you to see me read my story.\u201d Her hopeful eyes flashed in my mind as I pulled up to the curb for my next fare. The passenger slid in, breathless, clutching a train ticket. \u201cPlease, can you get me to the station? My train leaves in forty minutes. I can\u2019t miss it.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing on me. My daughter\u2019s face, full of expectation, and the anxious urgency of the passenger beside me. If I drove him, I\u2019d miss the open class. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d let down someone counting on me for their own important moment. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between being the mother my daughter needed and the reliable driver my passenger expected. The city\u2019s traffic lights blinked ahead, and I sat at the crossroads, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which way to turn."}
