I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them\u2014our traditions were the glue that held us together. But as I glanced at my phone, I saw the message from the salon: the bride and her party had arrived early, nerves already fraying, and they needed me to greet them, to calm them, to make their day perfect. My heart pounded as I pictured the anxious faces waiting for me, the trust they\u2019d placed in my hands. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family\u2019s legacy on one side, my professional promise on the other. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the daughter my family needed and the hairdresser my clients depended on."}
