He wanted to know how my day was going, if I\u2019d eaten, if I was feeling okay. Ever since I moved in, he and Mom expected me to check in, to share the little details of my life. It was their way of making me feel part of the family, and I tried to keep up, replying quickly, sending photos, even when I was tired.\n\nBut at the site, things were different. The foreman had just posted a notice about an optional training session next week. He said it was a good chance to learn new skills, maybe even get considered for more responsibility. The guys were already talking about who\u2019d go, and I knew showing up would mean I was serious about the job. But the session was in the evening, right when my family expected me home for dinner and our usual catch-up. I could already imagine the disappointment in my stepdad\u2019s voice if I told him I\u2019d be late, or worse, if I didn\u2019t answer his messages at all. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the pressure building, torn between being the son they wanted and the worker I needed to be."}
