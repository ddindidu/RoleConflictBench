But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that the safety briefing at the site starts in two minutes. If I\u2019m late, the supervisor will call me out in front of everyone, and I can\u2019t afford to look careless or uncommitted. My husband\u2019s eyes are gentle, waiting for me to let him in, but my mind is already at the construction site, picturing the team gathering, the protocols, the pressure to be on time. I want to be present for him, to talk honestly, but the clock is ticking, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I try to decide which expectation I can afford to let down."}
