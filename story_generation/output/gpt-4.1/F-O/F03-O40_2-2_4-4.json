The deadline for the custom cabinetry loomed, and the contractor had just called, reminding me that the electricians and plumbers needed my work finished before they could start. My mind raced with measurements and joinery techniques, but my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was my mother. She reminded me that tonight was the annual family gathering, a tradition my family held sacred for generations. Lately, my parents had been insistent that I show more respect for our customs, especially after missing last month\u2019s event. I could hear the disappointment in her voice, the unspoken expectation that I would put family first. But the job site was counting on me, and any delay would throw off the entire project. I felt torn, the weight of my father\u2019s words about honoring our heritage pressing against the urgent demands of my trade. My heart pounded as I stared at the unfinished cabinets, caught between the pull of family tradition and the responsibility of my craft, unsure which path to take."}
