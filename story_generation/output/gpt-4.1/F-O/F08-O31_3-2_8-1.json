Shouts echoed down Main Street, the crowd swelling, faces tense. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my daughter\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I knew why she was calling. My grandson had been struggling, and last night she\u2019d hinted things were worse than she\u2019d let on. As a grandmother, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and advice. But as a police officer, I was expected to keep my focus, to help de-escalate the growing chaos before it turned violent. My sergeant\u2019s voice barked orders through my earpiece, demanding my attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family needed me, but so did the city.
