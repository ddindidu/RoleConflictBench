My stepbrother, Tyler, was strapping on his helmet, eyes fixed on the battered ramp he\u2019d dragged out from the garage. \u201cWatch this, okay?\u201d he called, excitement and nerves in his voice. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014quarterly filings were due in an hour, and I still had to double-check the expense reports. My boss had made it clear: no mistakes, no late submissions. Tyler\u2019s skateboard clattered as he tested the wheels, and I felt my stomach twist. If I focused on my work, I might miss a fall or a cry for help. If I hovered over him, I\u2019d risk missing a deadline and letting my team down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the numbers on my screen and the brother on the ramp."}
