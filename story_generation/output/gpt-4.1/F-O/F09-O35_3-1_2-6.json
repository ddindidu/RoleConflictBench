The first was an email from my child\u2019s school: my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and they wanted me to come in and discuss it as soon as possible. My heart clenched with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I knew I needed to be there for him, to show the school I took this seriously, to help him understand what he\u2019d done.\n\nAlmost at the same moment, another email popped up from my supervisor: a professional development seminar was coming up, and they were looking for operators to sign up. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but everyone knew that those who volunteered for extra training were seen as more committed, more promotable. I\u2019d been hoping for a chance to move up, to give my family a better life.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son needed me, but so did my career. I could only choose one."}
