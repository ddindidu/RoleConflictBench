My spouse\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cWe need to talk tonight. It\u2019s important.\u201d My stomach twisted. We\u2019d been dancing around the topic of our mounting bills and my recent doctor\u2019s visit. I knew I owed them honesty, that we needed to sit down and lay everything out, no matter how hard it was to admit how scared I felt.\n\nBut right now, a woman in front of me was fuming, her voice rising about a coupon that wouldn\u2019t scan. I forced a smile, trying to keep my tone light and apologetic, even as my mind raced with what I\u2019d say to my spouse later. The store was packed, the beeps and chatter pressing in on me, and I felt split in two\u2014one part of me desperate to be the open, honest partner I promised to be, the other struggling to stay calm and friendly for the next customer. My heart pounded as I handed back the receipt, caught between the demands of the person I loved and the job I needed."}
