As a cashier, I\u2019m supposed to greet each customer with a smile, scan their items quickly, and make small talk to keep things pleasant. But my mind keeps drifting to the promise I made to my son last week: if I picked up a few extra shifts, I\u2019d buy him the Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about. The money I\u2019ve earned is just enough, but it means cutting it close on groceries and bills. My heart aches at the thought of disappointing him, but I also know how important it is to keep our finances stable. A customer asks about a coupon, and I force a cheerful answer, but inside, I\u2019m torn. I want to be the parent who keeps promises, but I also need to be the responsible adult who keeps the lights on. The next customer steps up, and I paste on another smile, my mind wrestling with what I should do."}
