As her brother, I was expected to be there, clapping the loudest, making her feel like a champion. But I was also on duty as the lifeguard, whistle around my neck, eyes scanning the water. The rules were clear: no one was allowed in the deep end without passing the swim test. Suddenly, I spotted a child flailing in the deep water, panic on their face. My sister, still beaming from her victory, was about to jump in to help\u2014she hadn\u2019t passed the test yet. My heart pounded. As her brother, I wanted to trust her, to let her shine and support her instinct to help. But as the lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, including hers. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between pride and duty, celebration and caution, as I rushed toward the edge of the pool."}
