He\u2019d asked me, his big sister, to drive him to a friend\u2019s house for a casual get-together. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being punctual and professional, always getting my passengers to their destinations safely and on time. Today, though, the roads were clear, and we had more than enough time. \n\nBut as his sister, I knew he was nervous about meeting new people. He started talking about his worries, his voice barely above a whisper. I wanted to be patient, to listen and reassure him, to show him the respect he deserved by understanding his feelings. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to the clock, calculating the best route, worrying about traffic that might appear out of nowhere. Should I pull over and give him a few minutes to calm down, risking being late? Or should I keep driving, focusing on my duty as a taxi driver, and hope he\u2019d be okay? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt torn, unsure which expectation to meet."}
