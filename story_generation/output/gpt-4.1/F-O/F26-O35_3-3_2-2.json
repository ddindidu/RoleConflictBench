Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my granddaughter, Mia. \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice. It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she expected from me.

My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report and stop the train immediately to keep everyone safe.
