My morning rounds were running smoothly, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad seems down today.\u201d I felt a familiar tug in my chest. As a daughter, I knew how much my parents relied on me to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, especially since Dad\u2019s health had been fragile lately. But as a nursing assistant, I was expected to stay focused, moving from room to room, taking and recording each patient\u2019s vital signs without delay. I could picture my parents waiting for my call, needing reassurance, while at the same time, I could hear the beeping from the next patient\u2019s monitor, reminding me of my duty here. My hands trembled slightly as I held the thermometer, torn between the urge to step out and call home, and the responsibility to my patients who depended on my care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, caught between two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
