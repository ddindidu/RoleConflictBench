My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a text from my stepdad: \u201cRough day. Can we talk later?\u201d I knew what he wanted. Ever since Mom remarried, I\u2019d tried to be there for both of them, asking if things were okay, listening to their worries, trying to be the glue that held our patchwork family together. But right now, the intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop is closest to the hospital?\u201d a passenger\u2019s voice echoed through the speaker. My training was clear: keep passengers safe, answer their questions, stay alert. I glanced at my phone, thumb hovering over the reply button, heart tugging me home. But my eyes flicked to the security monitors\u2014dozens of faces depending on me to keep them safe, to guide them. My stepdad\u2019s message blinked on the screen, a silent plea for support. The intercom light blinked, the passenger waiting. I felt split in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which voice to answer first."}
