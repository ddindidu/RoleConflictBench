My spouse was in the next room, vacuuming, both of us tense as we tried to make the house spotless before the relatives arrived. Every surface had to shine, every room had to be perfect\u2014my partner\u2019s voice echoed in my head, \u201cWe need to make a good impression.\u201d I knew how important this was, how much it meant to share the load and show we were a team.\n\nBut my phone wouldn\u2019t stop. It was the owner of the old house I\u2019d inspected yesterday, her voice urgent in the voicemail: \u201cThe termites have eaten through the beams. I need your repair plan today, or the whole place could be unsafe.\u201d As a carpenter, I couldn\u2019t ignore it\u2014someone\u2019s home, maybe their safety, depended on me. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be present and helpful at home, and the professional duty to respond immediately to a crisis. I stared at the mop in my hand, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I could let down."}
