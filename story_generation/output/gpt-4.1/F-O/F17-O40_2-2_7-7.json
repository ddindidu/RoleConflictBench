As I passed the kitchen, I saw my parents sitting quietly, their faces drawn and tired. Lately, they seemed weighed down by something unspoken, and I felt the familiar tug of worry. I wanted to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to be the support they needed. But my phone buzzed\u2014a homeowner\u2019s message, urgent: the deck was splintered and unsafe, and they needed it fixed today. My mind raced with the expectation to be reliable, to show up and do the work right. Yet, as I gathered my tools, I kept glancing back at my parents, guilt gnawing at me. I was torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to my craft. The pressure built inside me, each role demanding more than I felt I could give. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unsure which door to walk through."}
