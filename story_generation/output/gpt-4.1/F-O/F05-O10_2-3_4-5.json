My wife had reminded me this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, and I\u2019d promised to handle the laundry tonight. As I headed toward the washing machine, my phone buzzed with an email notification. It was from the tax authority\u2014a notice about a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return, demanding an immediate response. My heart raced. As an accountant, I knew ignoring this could mean penalties for my client and trouble for the firm. But as a husband, I\u2019d made a commitment to help at home, to be present and reliable. The weight of the basket seemed to double as I stood there, torn between the urgent call of my profession and the quiet promise I\u2019d made to my family. My mind spun with the consequences of letting either side down, and I felt the pressure mounting, unsure which responsibility to face first."}
