My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cDad, can you please be here when we tell everyone the news?\u201d Today was the day my granddaughter would announce her engagement, and I\u2019d promised to be present, to share in the joy, to be the grandfather who never missed a moment. But as I glanced at the family group chat lighting up on my phone, a pilot\u2019s urgent voice crackled through my headset: \u201cTower, this is Delta 452, declaring minimum fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My training kicked in, hands moving to reroute traffic, mind calculating safe paths.
