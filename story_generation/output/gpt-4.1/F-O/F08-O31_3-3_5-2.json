My daughter\u2019s voice trembled on the other end\u2014her husband had collapsed, and she needed me right away. My heart clenched; family always came first. But before I could grab my keys, my police radio crackled to life: \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and Fifth. Immediate backup needed.\u201d I froze, torn. As a grandmother, I was expected to rush to my family\u2019s side, to comfort and support them in crisis.
