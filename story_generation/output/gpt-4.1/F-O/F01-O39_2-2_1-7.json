My hard hat felt heavy, but not as heavy as the look I\u2019d just seen on my grandson\u2019s face. He\u2019d come to see me off, shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with something he wouldn\u2019t say. I knew that look\u2014life had thrown him a curveball, and he needed someone to help him make sense of it. My heart ached to sit him down, to share the lessons I\u2019d learned the hard way, to be the steady hand he needed.\n\nBut the foreman\u2019s voice crackled over the loudspeaker, calling us to the safety briefing. Two minutes. If I missed it, I\u2019d be letting the crew down, maybe even risking my job. The team counted on me to be there, to pull my weight and follow the rules. I glanced back at my grandson, torn between the duty to my work family and the pull of my own flesh and blood. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
