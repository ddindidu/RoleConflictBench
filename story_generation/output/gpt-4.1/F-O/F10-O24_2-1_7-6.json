My father barely spoke during dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them, to simply be present. But as I cleared the dishes, my mind kept drifting to the thick envelope waiting on my desk upstairs: the latest law review journal, filled with articles on emerging legal theories I couldn\u2019t afford to ignore. As a judge, I was expected to stay sharp, to keep up with every shift in the law, to be prepared for the cases that would soon land on my docket. The weight of both worlds pressed on me. I wanted to sit with my parents, to offer comfort and understanding, but I also felt the urgent pull of my professional duty. My heart ached with the knowledge that, tonight, I could not fully be both the daughter they needed and the judge I was expected to be."}
