My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the family meeting tonight. We need to discuss the festival arrangements.\u201d Lately, my family had become insistent about upholding our traditions, especially after my grandfather\u2019s passing. They expected me to take a more active role, to honor our customs and help organize the upcoming festival, just as he would have wanted.\n\nBut the hospital project was at a critical stage. The chief surgeon had just sent urgent feedback about the placement of the operating rooms, and I needed to revise the plans before tomorrow\u2019s review. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s hope that I would carry forward our legacy, and my professional responsibility to create a space that could save lives. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of tradition and the cold precision of my work, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
