Now, as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes urgently. It\u2019s a message from work: the new staff are about to run the press, and no one\u2019s shown them the safety protocols. My heart pounds. If I don\u2019t guide them, someone could get hurt. But if I leave the laundry again, I\u2019ll be letting my wife down\u2014again. I can almost hear her sigh, see the disappointment in her eyes. My hands freeze, caught between the soft cotton and the cold, hard reality of my job. Both sides need me, right now. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me apart, and wonder which one I\u2019ll let down today."}
