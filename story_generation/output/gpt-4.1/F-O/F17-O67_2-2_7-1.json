Lately, their faces seemed drawn, their voices softer, weighed down by something they wouldn\u2019t say out loud. I wanted to stay, to sit with them, maybe make tea, and just be there so they\u2019d know they weren\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed, and the dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cBroken femur, three miles out, moderate traffic.\u201d My heart jumped. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. Someone was waiting, in pain, counting on me to get there fast. I looked at my parents, wishing I could split myself in two\u2014one to comfort them, one to race through the city. My hands shook as I grabbed my keys, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to a stranger in need. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just stood there, caught in the impossible space between home and the siren\u2019s call."}
