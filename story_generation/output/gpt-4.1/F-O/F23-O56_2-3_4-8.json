I know I should call her back, remind her about respect and safety, but my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a client is early at the salon. My mind flashes to the thick, sticky residue I saw in her hair last time; I\u2019ll need extra time to wash and detangle before I can even think about cutting. My boss expects efficiency, and my client expects to leave looking polished, not frazzled from a rushed job. But here, in this moment, I\u2019m supposed to be the parent, the one who teaches right from wrong, who doesn\u2019t let a child run wild in public. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the need to be present and patient for my stepdaughter, and the professional obligation to deliver quality service at work. My heart pounds as I watch her weave dangerously close to a pyramid of cans, and I can almost feel the slippery, tangled hair between my fingers, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
