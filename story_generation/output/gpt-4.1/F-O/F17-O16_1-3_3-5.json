Grandma made your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the familiar dishes, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of home. As the eldest child, I was expected to be there, to honor our traditions, to show respect and unity. But just down the hall, a family waited for me, their faces drawn with worry. I was their doctor, and I had to tell them that their loved one\u2019s condition was worse than we\u2019d hoped. They needed me to be calm, clear, and compassionate, to answer their questions and hold space for their pain. My heart twisted as I thought of my own family, expecting my presence, and this family, needing my strength. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
