My daughter calls, her voice warm, reminding me how much the grandchildren look forward to our annual gathering. \u201cYou always tell the best stories, Dad,\u201d she says, and I hear the hope in her words. I promise to try my best, but my mind drifts to the thick file on my desk. My client\u2019s case is hanging by a thread, and the hearing is set for the same day as the holiday. He\u2019s counting on me to be there, to fight for him, and I know how much is at stake. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting my presence, my client needing my expertise. I want to be the dependable grandfather, the trusted lawyer, but the demands are pulling me apart. I sit at my desk, torn, the phone in one hand and the case file in the other, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
