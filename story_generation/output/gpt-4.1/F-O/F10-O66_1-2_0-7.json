It was a text from Mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Miss you.\u201d I hadn\u2019t replied to her last message, and guilt pricked at me.

As I hoisted a heavy suitcase, my phone vibrated again in my pocket. I could almost hear Mom\u2019s voice, gentle but worried, wondering if I was okay.
