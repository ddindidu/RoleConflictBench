It was the store manager, his voice tight: \u201cYour stepson was caught taking snacks without paying.\u201d My heart sank. I rushed over, my mind split between the sterile, logical world of blueprints and the messy, unpredictable reality of parenting. \n\nStanding in the store, I saw the guilt in his eyes. As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to teach him right from wrong, to be firm but fair, to guide him with patience. But my mind kept drifting to the hospital project, the looming deadline, the expectation that I\u2019d deliver a flawless design. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding discipline and understanding, the other demanding precision and focus. My hands trembled as I tried to find the right words, torn between the urge to rush back to my plans and the responsibility to shape this boy\u2019s future."}
