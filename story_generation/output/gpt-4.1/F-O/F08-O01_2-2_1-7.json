The contractors needed my input on a structural issue, and the project was already behind schedule. Every minute counted. But across the room, my granddaughter slouched on the couch, her eyes red and distant. I could sense her sadness, the way she avoided my gaze, the way she twisted her hands in her lap. I knew she needed me\u2014needed the kind of gentle guidance only a grandmother could give, someone to listen and offer comfort from a place of experience. Yet, the weight of the project pressed on me. If I didn\u2019t respond quickly, delays would snowball, and my team would be left waiting. My heart tugged in two directions: the urgent demands of my profession and the quiet, aching need of my family. I stared at my phone, then at my granddaughter, feeling the impossible pull between being the architect my team relied on and the grandmother my granddaughter needed right now."}
