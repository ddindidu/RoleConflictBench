My brother was excitedly suggesting a weekend picnic, and my mom chimed in, hoping I\u2019d be there. I smiled, picturing us all together, and felt the familiar warmth of belonging. Just then, my work phone vibrated. It was a message from the nurse\u2019s station: Mrs. Lee, one of my regular patients, was feeling down and could use some company. I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was about to start, and I knew how much Mrs. Lee relied on me for comfort, especially on lonely afternoons. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but my patient needed me too, in a different, quieter way. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
