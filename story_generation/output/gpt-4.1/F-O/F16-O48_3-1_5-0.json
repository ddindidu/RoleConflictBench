My spouse and I had agreed to split the work evenly\u2014relatives were coming, and the house had to be spotless. I promised I\u2019d vacuum, tidy the living room, and help with breakfast. But as I was about to start, my phone buzzed: the nursing home was short-staffed, and Mrs. Carter needed help with her morning routine. I could picture her waiting, anxious for her bath and breakfast, depending on me to start her day with dignity.\n\nMy spouse\u2019s voice called from the kitchen, asking if I could start the laundry. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I\u2019d let my spouse down, leaving them to handle everything alone. But if I stayed, Mrs. Carter would wait, uncomfortable and possibly distressed. Both needed me, both expected me to be present and reliable. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the home I\u2019d built and the care I\u2019d promised to give."}
