He wanted honesty, wanted me to talk about the numbers, about my health, about what we should do next. I could see the worry in his eyes, the way he needed me to be present, to share everything. My phone buzzed again\u2014third time in ten minutes. The plant manager\u2019s name flashed on the screen. The main production unit was down, and the sensor errors weren\u2019t going away. Every minute the line was stopped meant lost revenue, angry calls, and a team waiting for me to diagnose the problem. I felt my heart race, torn between the expectation to be open and vulnerable with my husband and the urgent demand to be the expert who could get the machines running again. I wanted to be both, but the weight of their needs pressed in from both sides, and I could feel myself caught in the middle, unable to move."}
