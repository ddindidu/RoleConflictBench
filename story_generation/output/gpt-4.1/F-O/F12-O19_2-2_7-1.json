My husband\u2019s voice from this morning echoed in my head\u2014soft, hesitant, asking if we could talk tonight. He\u2019d seemed distant lately, and I knew he needed me to listen, to share what was weighing on him. That\u2019s what we promised each other: to communicate openly, especially when things got tough.\n\nBut as I double-checked the prescription in front of me, my hands trembled. The patient\u2019s chart was complicated\u2014multiple chronic conditions, a delicate balance of medications. One mistake could mean disaster. My manager expected perfection, and so did I. I couldn\u2019t rush, not with someone\u2019s health on the line.\n\nYet, I felt torn. My husband needed my attention, my empathy. My patient needed my focus, my precision. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stood there, prescription in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
