The first message was from my mom: \u201cHow are you? Did you eat lunch? Let us know when you\u2019re free to call.\u201d I knew she expected a quick, thoughtful reply\u2014she worried if I didn\u2019t check in. Before I could type a response, another notification popped up. This time, it was a customer asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s my package? I need it urgently. Please update me ASAP.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. My parents wanted reassurance and connection, but my job demanded immediate, professional communication with customers. I stared at my phone, torn between sending a warm, detailed message to my mom or a prompt, courteous update to the waiting customer. My thumbs hovered over the screen, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations, knowing that whichever message I sent first, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
