My grandkids had been talking about it for weeks, and I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for me to show up with my famous apple pie and a new story. But as I set down my coffee mug, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the site manager. Today was the day I was supposed to inspect and maintain all the tools before we started the new structural work. Safety protocols were strict, and I knew how crucial it was to check every saw, drill, and ladder. If I skipped it or rushed, someone could get hurt. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my family\u2019s laughter, the responsibility of keeping my crew safe. I could almost hear my wife\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how much the kids missed me. At the same time, I felt the weight of my carpenter\u2019s belt, the trust my team placed in me. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
