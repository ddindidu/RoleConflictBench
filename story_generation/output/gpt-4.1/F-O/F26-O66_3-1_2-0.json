It was my granddaughter, her message trembling with urgency: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart squeezed. She never reached out like this unless it was serious. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer the wisdom she always said she valued. But just then, a passenger slid into my back seat, cheerful and relaxed, mentioning he was heading to a caf\u00e9 for a casual meet-up, no rush. As I started the meter, my mind raced. My granddaughter needed me now, but my passenger expected a safe, attentive ride. I couldn\u2019t split myself in two. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my presence and care, the other my focus and professionalism. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
