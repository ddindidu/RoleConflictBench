My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDeliver by 3 PM.\u201d It was already 2:55, and the address was two blocks away. But my stepbrother, Jamie, was at the top of the old ramp, helmet askew, grinning as he prepared to try a new skateboard trick. I knew how risky that ramp was\u2014uneven, with jagged concrete at the bottom. Mom always said, \u201cWatch out for each other.\u201d If I left now, I wouldn\u2019t be there if he fell. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late with the delivery, risking a complaint and maybe my job. My heart pounded as I watched Jamie set his board down, his eyes flicking to me for approval. I felt torn, the weight of the package in my hands matched by the responsibility I felt for him. I glanced at the ticking clock on my phone, then back at Jamie, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
