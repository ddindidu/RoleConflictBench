My screen lit up with a red alert\u2014an emergency diversion, a rare and dangerous situation, demanding my full attention and seamless coordination with my colleagues. My hands hovered over the console, ready to reroute planes and avert disaster. Just then, my phone buzzed. I glanced down and saw my granddaughter\u2019s name. She never called during my shifts unless it was important. I hesitated, but answered, hearing her trembling voice, \u201cGrandma, I really need your advice. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her words were heavy with worry, and I could picture her sitting on her bed, eyes wide and searching for comfort only I could give.
