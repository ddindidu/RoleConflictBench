Mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to promise I\u2019d be there, really be present, not just in the room but part of the family. I said I\u2019d try, and I meant it.\n\nThe next morning, I was behind the wheel of my taxi, weaving through the city. My mind replayed my sister\u2019s smile, the way she\u2019d tugged at my sleeve, asking if I\u2019d play Monopoly with her. Suddenly, a construction detour forced me into a single narrow lane. Up ahead, a school zone sign flashed, and kids clustered near the curb, some darting dangerously close to the street. The car behind me honked impatiently, but I knew I had to slow down, follow the rules, keep everyone safe\u2014even if it meant running late and risking missing out on family plans. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with the pressure to be a good sibling and a responsible driver, feeling pulled in two directions at once."}
