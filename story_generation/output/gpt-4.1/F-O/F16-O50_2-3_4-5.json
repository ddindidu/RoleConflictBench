My spouse had left a note on the fridge: \u201cPlease do the laundry today\u2014kids need uniforms for tomorrow.\u201d I glanced at the pile of clothes, feeling the weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the plant: \u201cCritical bearing screeching\u2014possible breakdown. Need you ASAP.\u201d My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t get to the factory soon, the machine could fail, halting production and costing the company thousands. But if I ignored the laundry, my family would be left scrambling in the morning, and I\u2019d be letting my partner down. I stared at the laundry, then at my phone, torn between the demands of home and work, feeling the pressure build as I tried to figure out which responsibility I could afford to let down."}
