She always expected me to check in during my break, to let her know I was safe and how my day was going. I knew if I didn\u2019t reply soon, she\u2019d worry, maybe even call the front desk. But at that moment, I noticed a small boy edging into the deep end, his arms flailing as he tried to keep his head above water. The rules were clear\u2014no children allowed in the deep end without an adult, and it was my job to enforce them, to keep everyone safe. My heart pounded as I glanced at my phone, torn between the urge to reassure my mom and the responsibility to act immediately. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each with consequences if I failed. I stood frozen for a split second, caught between the expectations of being a good daughter and a vigilant lifeguard."}
