She always wanted me to check in on weekends, just a quick message to let her know I was okay. I pulled out my phone, ready to type, but then I noticed the broken lane rope floating in the pool. Swim lessons would start in twenty minutes, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the kids would be all over the place. My supervisor always reminded us to keep the equipment in perfect shape\u2014no excuses. I glanced at my phone, feeling the weight of Mom\u2019s expectation, her gentle reminders about staying in touch. But the pool was my responsibility too, and I could already hear the voices of the kids and their parents echoing in my mind if something went wrong. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between sending a quick text and rushing to the storage room for the repair kit. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt stuck, unable to move, caught between being a good daughter and a responsible lifeguard."}
