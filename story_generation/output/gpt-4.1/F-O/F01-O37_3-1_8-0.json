It was a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call me? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart skipped. I knew she\u2019d been having a tough time lately, and as a grandfather, I always tried to be there for my family, to check in, to listen. But the vacuum was still running, and I had three more rooms to tidy before my shift ended. The supervisor had already reminded me last week that the tenants expected spotless common areas, not just a quick sweep. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stepped away now, I\u2019d fall behind on my cleaning duties, maybe even get a warning. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my family down when they needed me most. My hands trembled as I held the phone, torn between the mop and the call, between being the reliable cleaner and the caring grandfather."}
