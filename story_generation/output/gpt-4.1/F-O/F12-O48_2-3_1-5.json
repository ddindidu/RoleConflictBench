He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance as he spoke about the impossible choice he had to make at work. He needed me to listen, to comfort him, to help him find clarity. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the hospital. My patient, Mr. Lee, was in critical condition tonight. I was responsible for checking his vitals every five minutes, watching for the smallest change that could mean life or death. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. I knew I was already late for the next round. My husband\u2019s voice wavered, and I could see how much he needed me right now. But the weight of my duty at the hospital pressed down on me, the knowledge that someone else\u2019s life depended on my attention. I felt torn in two, pulled by love and responsibility, unable to give either the care they deserved."}
