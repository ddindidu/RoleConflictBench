Don\u2019t be late!\u201d I could almost hear her voice, teasing but firm, reminding me how much it meant to everyone that I show up. Being the eldest, I was supposed to set the example, to be present, to laugh and share stories over Mom\u2019s roast chicken. But my mind kept drifting to the thick stack of blueprints spread across my workbench in the garage. Tomorrow, I\u2019d be leading my first big carpentry project\u2014an entire custom kitchen. I needed tonight to pore over every measurement, every technical note, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss a single detail. My boss was counting on me, and so was the client. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I wanted to be the dependable sister, but I also needed to be the prepared carpenter. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDinner at 7.\u201d I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the warmth of my family and the silent call of my unfinished plans."}
