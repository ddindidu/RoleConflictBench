But my phone buzzes with a message from my wife\u2014she\u2019s worried about the bills piling up this month. The kids need new shoes, and groceries are running low. I promised I\u2019d pick up extra freelance work to help out, but that means less time to polish this feature at my day job. If I rush the code, I risk my reputation and maybe even my job security. If I stay late to fix it, I\u2019ll miss the freelance deadline and let my family down. My chest tightens as I weigh the demands: the need to provide for my family, the need to meet my professional standards. Both feel urgent, both feel non-negotiable. My hands hover over the keyboard, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
