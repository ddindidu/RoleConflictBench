I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: \u201cMachine maintenance\u2014next week.\u201d The factory\u2019s shutdown was rare, and my supervisor had stressed how crucial it was that every machine be serviced perfectly. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cAny mistake could cost us days of production.\u201d \n\nI could already feel the tension building inside me. If I missed the ceremony, I\u2019d disappoint my family and risk being seen as someone who didn\u2019t value our heritage. But if I skipped the maintenance, I\u2019d let down my team and possibly jeopardize my job. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding loyalty, each unwilling to yield. I stared at the calendar, heart pounding, torn between the son my family needed and the repairer my workplace depended on."}
