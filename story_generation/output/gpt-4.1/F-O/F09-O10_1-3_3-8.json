My phone buzzed with another email from our major supplier, the subject line in all caps: \u201cFINAL NOTICE.\u201d My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t resolve the overdue invoice today, our shipments would stop, and the company would be in real trouble. Just as I started drafting a response, my son spilled his juice all over the floor. He looked up at me, wide-eyed, waiting for my reaction. I remembered my promise to teach him about responsibility and honesty, to guide him through these little moments. But the phone rang again\u2014this time, the supplier\u2019s number. I could hear the urgency in their voice even before I picked up. My son tugged at my sleeve, whispering, \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. Can you help me clean up?\u201d I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My child needed my patience and guidance, but my job demanded immediate action. I stared at the blinking cursor, the ringing phone, and my son\u2019s hopeful face, caught between two roles that both needed me, right now."}
