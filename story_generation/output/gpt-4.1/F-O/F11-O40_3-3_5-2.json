Mom\u2019s counting on you to help with the kids.\u201d My heart squeezed with guilt. I knew how much these holiday gatherings meant to everyone, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But as I glanced at the pile of tools in my workshop, anxiety gnawed at me. The inspection forms were due today, and I hadn\u2019t checked the saws or calibrated the levels yet. If I skipped the safety checks, I\u2019d be risking not just my own fingers, but my crew\u2019s as well. The foreman had been clear: \u201cNo shortcuts. One mistake, and someone could get hurt.\u201d I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, warm but expectant, asking me to be present, to be a good sister. At the same time, the weight of responsibility as a carpenter pressed on my shoulders. I stood frozen, torn between the laughter of my family waiting for me and the silent, urgent call of my unfinished workbench."}
