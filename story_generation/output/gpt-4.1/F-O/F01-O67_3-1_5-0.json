The laughter and warmth in the room made me feel whole, reminded me of the importance of being present for my family, especially now, when my daughter needed me to help care for the kids during a difficult time. Just as I was about to pour another cup of tea, my phone buzzed. The screen flashed with the ambulance dispatch alert\u2014an emergency call, someone out there needed help, and I was the closest driver on standby.\n\nMy heart pounded. I knew the expectation: as an ambulance driver, I had to respond immediately, lives depended on it. But as a grandfather, my family was counting on me, too. My daughter\u2019s anxious eyes met mine, silently pleading for me to stay. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each equally urgent in its own way. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, my granddaughter\u2019s in the other, caught between duty and love, not knowing which path to take."}
