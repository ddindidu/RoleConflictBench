My phone buzzed with a message from my stepbrother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner\u2019s at six. Mom really wants you there.\u201d I could almost hear the hope in his words, the unspoken plea for me to be part of the family, to show up and belong. But in front of me, a prescription for Mrs. Lee waited\u2014eight medications, each with its own risks, and she depended on me to get it right. The pharmacy was short-staffed, and I was the only one left to check her order before closing. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: the warmth of the dinner table, laughter, and the chance to finally feel included, versus the sterile counters, pill bottles, and the trust of a patient who couldn\u2019t afford a mistake. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the family I was trying to build and the responsibility I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
