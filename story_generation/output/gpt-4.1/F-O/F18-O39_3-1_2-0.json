She\u2019d just gotten some terrible news\u2014her voice on the call was shaky, barely holding together. As her brother, I knew she needed me, needed someone to listen, to just be there. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the supervisor\u2019s words echoing in my head: \u201cMove those materials before you clock out, or it\u2019ll hold up tomorrow\u2019s work.\u201d The pile of unused boards and pipes waited for me across the site, and I could already feel the ache in my arms from the morning\u2019s labor. My sister\u2019s pain tugged at me, but so did the expectation to pull my weight on the crew. I stood there, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the urge to drop everything and rush to her side, and the pressure to finish my shift strong, not letting anyone down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and for a moment, I just stood frozen, caught between being the brother she needed and the worker I was expected to be."}
