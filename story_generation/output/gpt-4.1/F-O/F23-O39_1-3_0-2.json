My gloves were already slick, and I knew the whole crew was waiting on me\u2014if I didn\u2019t move fast, the beam could swing, or worse, someone could get hurt. But as I reached for the guide rope, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder: school\u2019s out in ten minutes. I was supposed to pick up the kids today\u2014my stepkids, but they\u2019ve started calling me \u201cMom\u201d lately, and I promised I\u2019d be there. I could picture their faces scanning the crowd, waiting for me at the gate, hoping I wouldn\u2019t let them down again. My foreman\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, urgent and impatient. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the weight of the steel beam and the weight of my promise. Both worlds needed me, right now, and I couldn\u2019t see how to be in both places at once."}
