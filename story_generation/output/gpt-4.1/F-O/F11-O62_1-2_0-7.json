He\u2019d just won his first swimming medal, and our family had gathered at the pool to celebrate. As his sister, I was expected to cheer the loudest, to make him feel like a champion. But as I watched him and his friends laughing near the deep end, I noticed them edging dangerously close to the \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My heart pounded. As a lifeguard, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, no exceptions. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that rules are rules, even for family. But my brother\u2019s eyes sparkled with pride, and I knew he wanted this moment to be perfect, free from embarrassment. I felt torn\u2014should I call out to them, risking his joy and possibly our closeness, or stay silent and betray my duty? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the whistle in my hand and the smile on my brother\u2019s face."}
