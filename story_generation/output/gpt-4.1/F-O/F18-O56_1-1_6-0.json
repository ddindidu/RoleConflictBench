I keep an eye on him, making sure he doesn\u2019t wander too close to the curb, just like Mom asked. He\u2019s chattering about his day, and I nod, half-listening, half-scanning the street for any sign of trouble. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my shift at the salon starts in ten minutes. I\u2019m supposed to be there early, ready to greet Mrs. Patel, my regular client who always expects a warm welcome and a cup of tea. I picture her walking in, looking for my smile, and the receptionist glancing at the clock, waiting for me to take over. My brother tugs at my sleeve, asking if we can stop for ice cream. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the need to keep him safe, to be the responsible sibling, and the pull of my job, where I\u2019m expected to be professional and attentive. My heart pounds as I try to figure out how I can possibly be in two places at once."}
