I know I should step in, remind her about respect and safety, but my phone buzzes\u2014my next client is early at the salon. She\u2019s texted: \u201cJust washed my hair, hope that\u2019s okay!\u201d I\u2019m expected to wash every client\u2019s hair, it\u2019s policy, but she\u2019s a regular and her hair always looks immaculate. My mind spins. If I let my stepdaughter\u2019s wildness slide, am I failing as a parent? But if I scold her too harshly, will I damage our fragile bond? At the same time, if I skip the wash at work, I risk my boss\u2019s disapproval, but insisting might annoy my client. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. I glance at my stepdaughter, then at the time, knowing I have to choose which expectation to meet first."}
