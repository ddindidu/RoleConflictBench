The case was complex, the kind that demanded every ounce of my attention and impartiality. I knew the attorneys would expect me to be fully prepared, to have every detail at my fingertips when court convened in the morning.

My daughter had called earlier, her voice warm with anticipation, reminding me how much the grandchildren were looking forward to seeing me. I could almost hear their laughter, feel their small hands tugging at mine, asking for stories and hugs. The weight of my robe felt heavier than usual tonight. I wanted to be the grandparent who showed up, who made memories, but I was also the judge who could not afford to be distracted or unprepared. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself caught in the quiet storm of wanting to be everything to everyone, knowing that, tonight, I could not."}
