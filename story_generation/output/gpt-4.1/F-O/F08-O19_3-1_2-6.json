The article about a new anticoagulant caught my eye\u2014something I needed to know for work tomorrow. Just as I started reading, my granddaughter shuffled in, her face clouded with worry. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I could see she needed me, not just as her grandmother, but as someone who could listen and guide her through whatever was weighing on her heart. Yet, the newsletter in my hands reminded me of the constant pressure to stay updated, to be the reliable pharmacist my patients depended on. My mind raced, torn between the urge to offer my granddaughter the wisdom and comfort she sought, and the professional responsibility nagging at me to keep reading, to not fall behind. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions at once."}
