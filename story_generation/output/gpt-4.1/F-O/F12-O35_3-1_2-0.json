I know it\u2019s him\u2014my husband. He\u2019s been struggling for weeks, barely sleeping, and I promised I\u2019d be there whenever he needed me. The message preview flashes: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart twists. I want to call him, to be the anchor he\u2019s reaching for, but the checklist in my hand reminds me of the other lives depending on me. The train\u2019s departure is in ten minutes, and even though these checks aren\u2019t critical, skipping them isn\u2019t an option. My supervisor expects precision and reliability; the passengers expect to get home safely and on time. I stare at my phone, torn between the voice of my husband, raw and pleading, and the silent weight of my uniform, heavy with responsibility. My hands tremble as I weigh which promise to break, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
