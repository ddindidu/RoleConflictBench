You coming?\u201d I could almost hear his hopeful tone, the unspoken wish that I\u2019d finally say yes and join the group. We\u2019d talked about spending more time together, about not letting work get in the way. I knew how much it meant to him, to both of us, to build that kind of respect and closeness.\n\nBut as I glanced over at the machines humming in the workshop, my stomach tightened. The last service window had slipped by during last week\u2019s rush, and now a few of the units were running hotter than they should. If I didn\u2019t get to them soon, I risked a breakdown\u2014maybe even a shutdown that would cost the company dearly. My supervisor had made it clear: maintenance was my top priority, and any slip-ups would be on me.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the pull of family and the push of responsibility. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between replying to my brother and logging another maintenance report, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice."}
