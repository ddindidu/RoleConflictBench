The defendant\u2019s anxious family waited for my order, knowing their loved one\u2019s release depended on my words. I opened my laptop, ready to draft the detailed conditions, but my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad seems down today.\u201d I knew what she needed\u2014my voice, my reassurance, the gentle questions I always asked to make sure everything was okay at home. But the clock was ticking. The defendant couldn\u2019t wait; the law demanded clarity and speed. My parents needed me to be present, to listen, to care. The court needed me to be precise, to act without delay. My heart tugged in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stared at the phone, then at the blank order on my screen, feeling the impossible pull between duty and love."}
