My grandkids had been talking about it for weeks, and I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for me to show up with my famous lemon bars. But as I walked the pool deck during my morning shift, my lifeguard instincts kicked in. A few pool chairs were out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standard I was expected to maintain. My supervisor had been clear: every detail mattered, even if it meant staying late to fix it. I felt the tug between the two worlds\u2014my family expecting my presence and warmth, my job demanding diligence and responsibility. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing either side. I stood there, towel in hand, staring at the misaligned chairs, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
