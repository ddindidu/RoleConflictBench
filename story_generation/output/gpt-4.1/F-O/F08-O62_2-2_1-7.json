My granddaughter, Emma, sat beside me, her shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on her hands. I could sense her sadness, the way only a grandmother can. I wanted to reach out, to offer her the comfort and wisdom she needed, to remind her that life\u2019s storms always pass. But just as I opened my mouth, a sharp splash caught my attention. Across the pool, a group of teenagers laughed, diving recklessly off the edge, ignoring the bold red \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs. My training screamed at me to act\u2014safety first, always. Yet Emma\u2019s quiet pain tugged at my heart. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I rush to enforce the rules, or stay and be the steady presence Emma needed right now? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between duty and love."}
