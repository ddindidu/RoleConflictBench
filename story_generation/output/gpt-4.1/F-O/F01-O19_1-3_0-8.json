The clock ticked closer to the start time, and I skimmed the agenda\u2014new guidelines, updated treatments, all crucial for my work as a pharmacist. Just as I was about to log in, my granddaughter wandered in, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you?\u201d she asked, voice small. She hesitated, then shared her worries about starting high school, about friendships and fitting in. I saw the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for guidance, for the kind of wisdom only a grandfather could offer. But the seminar was about to begin, and missing it could mean falling behind, risking my license, my professional standing. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the granddaughter who needed me, and the profession that demanded my attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present, fully committed. I looked at her, then at the screen, torn and uncertain, the decision looming between us."}
