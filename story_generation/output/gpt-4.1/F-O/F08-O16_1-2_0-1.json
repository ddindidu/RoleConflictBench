I wanted to offer her the comfort of my wisdom, to tell her that things would work out, that she should follow her heart. But my phone buzzed with a message from the hospital\u2014my patient\u2019s test results had arrived. The symptoms didn\u2019t fit any textbook diagnosis, and I knew I needed to review the data carefully, to be objective and methodical, not swayed by hope or intuition. My granddaughter waited, expecting warmth and certainty, while my mind raced with clinical possibilities and the responsibility to be precise. I felt torn, caught between the gentle guidance she needed and the analytical detachment my patient deserved. My heart ached with the pressure of both roles, each demanding a different part of me, and I sat in silence, unsure which voice to answer first."}
