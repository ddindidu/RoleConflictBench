My husband pours us tea, his eyes tired but gentle. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asks, and I know he means it. I want to tell him about the rude customer who hung up on me, about the pressure of the endless phone queue, about how management is now tracking every minute of our breaks. But my break is almost over, and I\u2019m supposed to log back in exactly on time. If I\u2019m late, it\u2019ll be flagged, and I can\u2019t afford another warning. Still, I see the hope in his eyes\u2014he wants me to share, to be open, like we promised. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cBreak ends in 2 minutes.\u201d My heart pounds. I want to be the wife who listens and shares, but I\u2019m also the employee who can\u2019t risk being late.
