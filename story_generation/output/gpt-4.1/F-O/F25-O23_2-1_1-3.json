It\u2019s a ritual we\u2019ve kept since Mom passed, a way to bridge the distance and reassure him he\u2019s not alone. Tonight, as I glance at the clock, my phone buzzes with a reminder: tomorrow\u2019s procedural hearing. It\u2019s a minor case, one I could easily postpone, but my client expects me to be there\u2014punctual, prepared, unwavering. My stepfather, on the other hand, waits for my call, his week shaped around our conversation. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I reschedule the hearing, I risk disappointing my client and appearing unprofessional. If I skip the call, I know my stepfather will sit in his quiet house, wondering if I\u2019ve forgotten him. My mind races, torn between duty and devotion, the expectations of family and career pulling me in opposite directions. I stare at my phone, heart pounding, caught in the space between obligation and love, unsure which role to honor this time."}
