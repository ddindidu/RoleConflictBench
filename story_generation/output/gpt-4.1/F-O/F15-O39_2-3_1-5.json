I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it this time. But as I glanced at the clock, I saw my coworker, distracted, heading straight toward a crane\u2019s suspended load. My supervisor always drilled into us\u2014safety first, always. If anything happened, it would be on me for not acting fast enough. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to shout and stop a disaster, and the guilt of knowing that if I did, I\u2019d be late for my daughter\u2019s big moment. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
