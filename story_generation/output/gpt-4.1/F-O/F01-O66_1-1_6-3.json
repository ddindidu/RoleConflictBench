The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d My heart warmed at the thought of my grandchildren, their laughter echoing in my mind. Family holidays were sacred, a time to reconnect, to share stories and hugs. I promised myself I\u2019d be there on time, as I always tried to be.\n\nBut as I drove my taxi through the city, a passenger in the backseat anxiously checked his watch. \u201cCan you hurry, please? I can\u2019t be late for my meeting.\u201d The roads were clear, the speed limit reasonable, but I felt the pressure mounting. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get my passengers to their destinations quickly, but also to obey every traffic law, to drive safely and defensively. My hands tightened on the wheel, my mind torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my family and the responsibility I owed to my passenger and the rules of the road. The minutes ticked by, and I wrestled with the weight of both roles, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
