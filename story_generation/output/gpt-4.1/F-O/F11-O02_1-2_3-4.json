My younger brother wanted to go hiking, my parents suggested a movie night, and everyone looked to me for input. I knew they expected me to be there, to join in and make memories. But my mind kept drifting back to work. As an engineer, I was responsible for ensuring our new product met the latest safety standards. The regulations had just changed, and I needed to gather evidence of compliance before the release next week. My manager had made it clear: any slip-up could mean delays or worse. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s hope for togetherness, my team\u2019s reliance on my diligence. I wanted to be present for both, but the demands clashed inside me, leaving me restless and torn as the conversation swirled around me."}
