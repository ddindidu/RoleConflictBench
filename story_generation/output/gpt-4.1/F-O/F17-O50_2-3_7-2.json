She tried to sound calm, but I could hear the exhaustion in her words, the way she hesitated before admitting Dad hadn\u2019t slept in days. I wanted to be there, to reassure her, to tell her I\u2019d come home and help, that I\u2019d sit with them and listen, just like they needed. But as I glanced through the glass at the ICU, alarms blared from the life-support device, its screen flashing urgent red codes. Nurses looked at me, waiting for answers, for me to fix what might mean life or death for someone\u2019s loved one. My mind raced, torn between the desperate need to be a good child and the critical responsibility of being the machine repairer. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart aching for my parents while my hands itched to get to work, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
