It\u2019s a message from Mom: \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20147:58 a.m. The safety briefing starts in two minutes, and the foreman\u2019s already eyeing the crew, making sure we\u2019re all present. I know how important these briefings are; missing one means I\u2019m not just letting myself down, but the whole team. But Mom\u2019s text tugs at me. She worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised her I\u2019d be better about staying in touch. My thumb hovers over the screen, torn between firing off a quick reply and shoving the phone away to join the others. The pressure builds in my chest\u2014if I text her now, I risk being late and getting called out in front of everyone. If I wait, I know she\u2019ll spend the morning anxious, wondering if I\u2019m okay. I stand frozen, caught between the expectations of being a good son and a reliable worker, the seconds ticking away."}
