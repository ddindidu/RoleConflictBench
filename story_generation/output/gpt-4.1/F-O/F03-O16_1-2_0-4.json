Haven\u2019t heard from you this week.\u201d I glance at it, guilt pricking at me. I know she worries, especially since I moved out for residency. I type a quick reply, promising to call later, but before I can hit send, my pager goes off. Room 312\u2014Mr. Patel, newly diagnosed with diabetes, is anxious and waiting for me. I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of both worlds. My parents expect me to stay connected, to reassure them I\u2019m okay. My patient expects me to be present, to explain, to listen. As I walk toward Mr. Patel\u2019s room, my mom\u2019s message lingers in my mind. I want to be a good son, but right now, I have to be a good doctor. The two roles pull at me, each demanding my time, my empathy, my words. I pause outside the door, torn, my phone still in my hand, uncertain which message to answer first."}
