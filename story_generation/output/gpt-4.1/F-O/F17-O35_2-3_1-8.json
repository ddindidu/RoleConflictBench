My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014right on cue, it\u2019s Sunday evening, the time I always call my parents. They wait for my updates, eager to hear about my week, and I know how much these calls mean to them. But just as I reach for my phone during a scheduled stop, the cabin door swings open. My supervisor steps in, clipboard in hand, eyes sharp. \u201cPerformance audit,\u201d he says, voice clipped. I nod, heart thumping. I know the rules: no personal calls, full attention on the job, especially now. My parents\u2019 faces flash in my mind, waiting for my call, probably worrying if I\u2019m late. I feel the weight of their expectations, the warmth of their concern. At the same time, the supervisor\u2019s presence is a cold reminder of my professional duty. I grip the controls tighter, torn between the comfort of family and the demands of my job, caught in the silent struggle of choosing which role to honor in this moment."}
