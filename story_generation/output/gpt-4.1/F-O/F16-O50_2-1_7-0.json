My spouse sat across from me, their eyes clouded with worry. I knew I should ask what was wrong, open up, and share my own frustrations\u2014like we always promised. But my phone buzzed with a message from the plant: the old packaging machine was acting up again, and no one else could figure it out. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but if I didn\u2019t at least start diagnosing the issue, it could cause bigger problems later. My spouse started to talk about their day, their voice soft and hesitant. I wanted to listen, to be present, but my thoughts kept drifting to the possible causes of the machine\u2019s glitch. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my partner needed me to be open and attentive, but my team expected me to be the one who could fix what no one else could. I gripped my coffee mug, torn between the person I loved and the job that depended on me, not sure which demand to answer first."}
