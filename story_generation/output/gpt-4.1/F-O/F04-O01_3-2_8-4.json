As an architect, I was expected to design a workspace that would foster productivity and comfort for dozens of employees. My phone buzzed\u2014my younger brother\u2019s name flashed on the screen. We hadn\u2019t spoken since our argument last week, and I knew he was waiting for me to reach out, to talk things through and rebuild the trust we\u2019d always shared. But the deadline for the office design loomed, and my supervisor had made it clear: the plan had to be flawless, every detail considered.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds. As a brother, I owed my sibling honesty and a willingness to resolve our misunderstanding. As an architect, I owed my team a design that met every expectation. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each refusing to wait. I sat frozen, torn between picking up the phone and picking up my pencil, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
