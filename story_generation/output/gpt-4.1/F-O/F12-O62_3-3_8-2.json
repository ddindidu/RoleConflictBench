My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my husband\u2019s name flashed on the screen. We\u2019d agreed to talk today, to finally lay everything out about our mounting bills and his recent health scare.

Every instinct screamed at me to keep my gaze fixed on the water, to not let my attention slip for even a second.
