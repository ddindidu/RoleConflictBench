We\u2019d agreed tonight was the night to lay everything out\u2014her recent test results, our mounting bills, the future neither of us wanted to face alone. She needed me to be present, to listen, to share my fears and hopes. But the message on my phone was urgent: the hospital\u2019s ICU needed me immediately. A life-support machine was failing, and I was the only one who knew its quirks well enough to fix it fast. My mind raced. My wife\u2019s hand trembled in mine, her voice barely above a whisper, \u201cPlease, just talk to me.\u201d At the same time, I pictured the blinking red lights, the nurses\u2019 anxious faces, the patient\u2019s life hanging in the balance. I felt split in two\u2014torn between the woman I loved and the life I might save. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, caught between the demands of honesty at home and the responsibility to act at work, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed from me in this moment."}
