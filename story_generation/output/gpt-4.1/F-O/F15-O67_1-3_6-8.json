The siren wailed, echoing my own anxiety. In the back, a patient clung to life, every second precious. My training screamed at me to focus, to drive with absolute care, to not let the storm or my nerves get the better of me. But my mind kept drifting to my son\u2019s hopeful face this morning, his eyes shining as he reminded me about the Nintendo I\u2019d promised. The money I\u2019d set aside for it was now in question\u2014overtime had been cut, and every shift felt like a gamble between safety and speed. I needed to keep this job, to keep the paychecks coming, to keep my promise. But right now, the only thing that mattered was the life in my ambulance.
