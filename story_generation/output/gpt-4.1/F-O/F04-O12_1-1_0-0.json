Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you!\u201d I smiled, proud of her, but glanced at the lines of code on my screen. I\u2019d finally gotten a generous deadline for this project, a rare luxury, and I wanted to use the extra time to refactor a messy module. It was the perfect chance to make the code cleaner and more efficient, something I\u2019d been itching to do for weeks.\n\nBut as I stared at the blinking cursor, my mind drifted to my sister\u2019s face, how much it would mean to her if I showed up on time, fully present, cheering her on. We\u2019d always promised to support each other, to be there for every milestone. Yet, the developer in me argued that this was my moment too\u2014a chance to do my best work, to take pride in my craft. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt the tension coil in my chest, unsure which part of me should take the lead tonight."}
