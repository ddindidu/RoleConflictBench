He wanted to know if I could join him and his friends for dinner tonight, something we hadn\u2019t done in months. He said it would mean a lot to him, that he missed hanging out like we used to. I knew how important it was to show up for him, to make him feel included and valued as my brother. But as I typed out a reply, the radio crackled with the dispatcher\u2019s voice, reminding us to stay alert for any incoming emergency calls. My uniform felt heavier than usual, the responsibility pressing down on me. I wanted to be the sister who always showed up, but I was also the ambulance driver who couldn\u2019t leave her post, not even for family. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the brother who needed me, and the city that might need me even more. I stared at my phone, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
