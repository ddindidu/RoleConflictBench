My heart ached to reach out, to offer the comfort and advice that only a grandmother can give. I wanted to tell her that feeling lost is part of growing up, that she\u2019s stronger than she thinks, and that I\u2019m always here for her. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a customer was calling, asking impatiently about the status of their package. I could hear the frustration in their voice, and I knew I needed to respond with calm professionalism, to reassure them and maintain the company\u2019s reputation. My granddaughter glanced at me, her expression hopeful, as if waiting for me to say something. I felt torn, caught between the urge to be the wise, attentive grandmother she needed and the obligation to be the reliable, courteous delivery person my job demanded. My chest tightened as I struggled to decide which role to fulfill in that moment."}
