My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his work shirt clean for tomorrow, and my daughter\u2019s soccer uniform was somewhere in that pile too. I promised I\u2019d get the laundry done today, but now, standing in my salon, I faced a different expectation. My next client, Mrs. Lee, sat in my chair, her hair already smelling of fresh shampoo. She smiled and said she\u2019d washed it just before coming, but the salon\u2019s policy\u2014and my own professional standard\u2014was to always wash and condition before a cut. I could hear my phone buzzing in my pocket, probably my husband checking if I\u2019d started the laundry. My mind raced: if I skip the wash, I risk disappointing my client or breaking salon rules; if I take a break to start the laundry, I\u2019ll run behind schedule and upset my clients. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
