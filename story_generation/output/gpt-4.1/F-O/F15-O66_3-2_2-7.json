My heart sank as I read that my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in immediately to discuss the situation. I knew I needed to be there for him, to show him that I cared and to help him understand the seriousness of his actions. But just as I was about to turn off my meter, two travelers flagged me down, their arms full of heavy suitcases. They looked desperate, explaining they were late for their train and needed help loading their bags. They promised a good tip and asked if I could split the fare between them. I could see the expectation in their eyes\u2014they needed a reliable, professional driver who wouldn\u2019t let them down. My mind raced, torn between my responsibility as a parent and my duty as a taxi driver. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
