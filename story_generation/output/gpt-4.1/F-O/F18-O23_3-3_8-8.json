He darted ahead, oblivious, about to step into the road without checking for cars. My heart pounded\u2014my instinct screamed to shout his name, to run and grab him, to protect him as I always had. But in my other ear, the opposing counsel\u2019s voice cut in, sharp and insistent, demanding details I knew I couldn\u2019t share. The rules of my profession were clear: client confidentiality was sacred, and any slip could ruin a life, a case, my career. My brother\u2019s safety was just as sacred, a bond forged in childhood promises. Both worlds collided in that moment\u2014my brother\u2019s life in one hand, my client\u2019s trust in the other. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing, torn between the urge to yell and the need to stay silent, between family and duty."}
