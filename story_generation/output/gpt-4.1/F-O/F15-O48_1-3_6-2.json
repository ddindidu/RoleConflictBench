My shift as a nursing assistant is almost over, but Mrs. Carter in room 204 is still struggling to eat her dinner. She winces with every bite, her pain obvious, and I know she needs me to stay a little longer, to help her finish her meal and maybe offer some comfort. But my phone buzzes with a message from home\u2014my son, reminding me about the Nintendo I promised him. Payday was today, and he\u2019s been counting down for weeks. I know how much he\u2019s been looking forward to it, and I want to keep my promise, to see his face light up when I walk through the door with the box in my hands. But overtime means extra money, and we need every bit of it. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between the needs of my patient and the expectations of my child, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
