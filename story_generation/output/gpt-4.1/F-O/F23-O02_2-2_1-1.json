My stepson had been talking about it for weeks, asking if I\u2019d be there to see him present his science project. I promised I would. But now, my phone buzzed with a reminder from work: \u201cPrototype review, 2:30 PM. Stakeholders attending.\u201d As the lead engineer, I was expected to present a working prototype\u2014something we\u2019d barely managed to piece together. The team was counting on me to explain our progress and secure the green light for the next phase.\n\nMy heart pounded as I imagined my stepson scanning the classroom, looking for my face, while at the same time picturing my manager\u2019s disappointment if I missed the review. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my commitment. I felt torn, guilty for even considering letting either side down. The weight of expectation pressed on me from both directions, and I sat frozen at my desk, unable to decide which promise to break."}
