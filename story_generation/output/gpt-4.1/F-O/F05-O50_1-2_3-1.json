But my phone buzzes, and the plant manager\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cWe need you now. The main unit\u2019s down again\u2014sensor errors. Production\u2019s at a standstill.\u201d My mind races. If I leave the laundry, I\u2019ll let my wife down, add to her exhaustion, and break my word. But if I ignore the call, the whole line stays frozen, and I know how much they rely on me to get things running.
