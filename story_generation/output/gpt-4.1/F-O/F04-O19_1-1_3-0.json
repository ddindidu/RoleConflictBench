My younger sister\u2019s eyes sparkled as she described a hiking trip she wanted us all to take. Mom looked at me, her voice warm, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of wanting to be there for them, to be the brother who never misses out.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the pharmacy. I was scheduled for a shift on Saturday, and I knew how short-staffed we\u2019d been lately. Just yesterday, I\u2019d caught a labeling error on a cold medication, and the thought of something slipping through if I wasn\u2019t there made my stomach twist. My manager always said, \u201cAccuracy is everything. People trust us with their health.\u201d I felt the weight of that trust, the responsibility to my patients.\n\nAs my family\u2019s laughter filled the room, I felt torn in two. I wanted to be the brother they could count on, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the duty I had as a pharmacist. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, caught between them, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
