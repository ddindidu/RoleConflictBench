My daughter had already texted twice, asking if I\u2019d spoken to my grandson about his travel schedule. I knew how much these moments meant, especially now that the kids were older and scattered.\n\nBut as I tucked the phone away, my eyes caught the pool chairs\u2014three of them, slightly askew, not quite in line with the rest. As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in perfect order, not just for safety, but because it was my job to set the standard. The manager had been clear: \u201cAttention to detail is what keeps this place running smoothly.\u201d\n\nI felt the tug in both directions. If I stopped to call my family, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty here, letting the little things slide. But if I focused on the chairs, I\u2019d be letting my family down, missing the chance to keep us connected. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and my phone, torn by the weight of both roles."}
