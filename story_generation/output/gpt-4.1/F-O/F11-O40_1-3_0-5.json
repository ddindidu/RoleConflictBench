My little brother just got into his dream college, and everyone expects me to be there, front and center, cheering him on. As his sister, I want to celebrate him, to hug him and tell him how proud I am. But in the back of my mind, the blueprints for tomorrow\u2019s big project are waiting. My first solo job as a carpenter\u2014an entire custom kitchen. The technical documents are spread across my desk, untouched. I know I need to study them, to make sure every measurement is perfect, every joint precise. My boss is counting on me, and I can\u2019t afford a single mistake. I feel torn, pulled between the warmth of my family and the cold, demanding lines of the drawings. My heart aches with guilt as I glance at my brother\u2019s beaming face, then at the unopened folder in my hands. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles presses down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
