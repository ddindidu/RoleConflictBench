My phone buzzed in my pocket for the third time in ten minutes\u2014another message from my stepbrother, reminding me that everyone was waiting for me at the family dinner. I could almost hear my stepmom\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, about how important it was for me to be there, to really be part of the family.\n\nBut here I was, still in my uniform, stuck behind the counter because my manager had asked me to cover an extra hour. The store was quiet, but I couldn\u2019t just leave. Customers expected me to be friendly, attentive, and professional, even if my heart wasn\u2019t in it. Every beep of the scanner felt heavier, torn between the warmth of a family gathering and the cold necessity of my job. I could feel the pressure building, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know which one I\u2019d let down."}
