My phone buzzed with their urgent texts\u2014\u201cCan you send the plan tonight? The inspector\u2019s coming tomorrow.\u201d I glanced up to see my stepbrother, shoulders slumped, eyes red. He dropped his backpack and headed straight for his room, the air heavy with the kind of silence that begs for comfort. I knew I should go to him, be the supportive sibling he needed, listen to whatever had happened at school. But the Johnsons were counting on me too; their house was unsafe, and my reputation as a carpenter was on the line. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be present for my family and the professional demand to deliver on time. I stared at the half-finished plan, then at his closed door, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
