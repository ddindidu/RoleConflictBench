It\u2019s my stepdad, again\u2014he wants to know how I\u2019m feeling after yesterday\u2019s long shift, and if I remembered to eat breakfast. I know he expects a quick reply, maybe even a photo, just like every morning. It\u2019s our thing, ever since Mom passed. But the foreman\u2019s voice cuts through the clatter of boots and tools, calling everyone to the safety briefing. I glance at the clock: two minutes. If I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get written up, maybe even sent home. The guys are already lining up, eyes on me, waiting. My phone vibrates again, a follow-up message. I can\u2019t ignore my stepdad\u2014he worries, and I promised I\u2019d keep in touch. But if I text now, I\u2019ll break site protocol and let my crew down. My heart pounds as I stand frozen between the two worlds, thumb hovering over the screen, hard hat in hand, the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
