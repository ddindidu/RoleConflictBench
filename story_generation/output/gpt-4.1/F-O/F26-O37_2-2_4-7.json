Tonight was special\u2014she had big news to share, and everyone was gathering to hear it. My daughter had asked me to be present, to listen, to be the supportive grandparent I always tried to be. But as I wiped down the counters, I noticed the cleaning supplies left out and the gloves I\u2019d forgotten to wear. The agency had just sent a reminder: strict adherence to safety and hygiene protocols was non-negotiable, especially with flu season looming. I glanced at my hands, realizing I hadn\u2019t followed every step. My mind raced\u2014should I excuse myself to redo the cleaning, put on the protective gear, and risk missing the moment my family had been waiting for? Or should I stay, risking a lapse in my professional standards? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own consequences. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility of my job, my heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do next."}
