It was my mother, her voice trembling as she told me about Dad\u2019s health scare that morning. She needed me, not just as a daughter, but as her anchor\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to be present. My heart ached to comfort her, to drop everything and rush home. But the supervisor was making rounds, and I was behind on my cleaning schedule. The rules were strict: gloves, mask, sanitizer for every room, no exceptions. If I slipped up, I could put patients at risk\u2014or lose my job. My hands shook as I tried to focus on the mop, but my mind was with my parents, picturing Mom\u2019s tearful face. I wanted to be the daughter they needed, but I was also the cleaner this hospital depended on. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the safety protocols in my hands and the desperate voice of my mother in my ear."}
