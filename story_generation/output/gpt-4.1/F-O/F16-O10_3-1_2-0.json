The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and I knew every number had to be perfect\u2014no room for error. My phone buzzed again. It was another message from my partner, who had barely slept in days, their world upended by a family emergency. They needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my presence. I could hear the tremor in their voice from our last call, the way they clung to every reassurance I could offer. But the numbers on my screen demanded my attention, too. If I missed a detail, the whole department could be thrown into chaos. My heart ached as I glanced between the phone and the ledger, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the rock my partner needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my team down. The clock ticked on, and I sat frozen, torn between the person I loved and the job I was trusted to do."}
