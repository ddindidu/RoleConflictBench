My partner had left a note on the fridge: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019m swamped at work.\u201d I promised myself I\u2019d get to it after my shift. As I slid behind the wheel of my taxi, the weight of that promise pressed on me. The day was busy, and my last fare needed to get across town fast. I took a shortcut, only to find myself in a school zone, the road squeezed by orange cones and construction barriers. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and sudden movements making me grip the wheel tighter. I knew I had to drive slowly, carefully\u2014no matter how late my passenger was running. But in the back of my mind, I pictured the laundry still waiting at home, my partner\u2019s tired face, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d help out. The demands of both worlds pulled at me, and I felt caught between the rules of the road and the rules of my own home, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
