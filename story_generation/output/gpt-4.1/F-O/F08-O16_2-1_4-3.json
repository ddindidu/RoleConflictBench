She wanted the whole family to gather tonight to watch her perform, and I promised I\u2019d be there, front row, cheering her on. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my clinic\u2019s number. I hesitated, but answered. On the other end, a patient\u2019s daughter sounded anxious. Her mother, scheduled for a routine check-up this afternoon, had questions about her recent test results and wanted to speak with me directly. I could hear the worry in her voice, the need for reassurance and clear answers. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of my granddaughter\u2019s big moment, the responsibility to my patient and her family. Both needed me, both expected my full attention and care. I felt the weight of their hopes pressing on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
