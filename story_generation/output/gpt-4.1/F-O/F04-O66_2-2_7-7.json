As I stepped out to help, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my younger sister. She was upset about our last conversation, asking if I could call her soon. I remembered our promise to be more patient and understanding, to really listen to each other, especially when we disagreed. But right now, the travelers were waiting, expecting me to load their bags quickly and get them to their destination. They mentioned wanting to split the fare, and I knew I needed to handle it professionally, making sure everything was clear and fair. My mind raced between the need to be a good brother, to show my sister respect and patience, and the demand to be a reliable, efficient taxi driver. I felt the pressure building, torn between the urge to call my sister and the responsibility to my passengers. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and for a moment, I just stood there, keys in hand, caught between two worlds."}
