He\u2019d been talking about nailing a new skateboard trick all week, but that ramp was cracked and uneven. My stomach twisted with worry\u2014Mom always said to look out for him, and I could already picture the scrapes and bruises if he fell. But inside, Mrs. Patel was waiting in my chair, her hair thick with product, tangles clinging stubbornly. She was in a rush, glancing at her watch, expecting me to work my usual magic and get her out the door on time. I could feel her impatience, and I knew if I didn\u2019t wash and condition her hair thoroughly, my scissors would snag and the cut would be a disaster. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, but my eyes kept darting to the window, torn between the duty to my client and the urge to dash outside and stop my brother before he hurt himself. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good sibling and a responsible hairdresser."}
