As a parent, I know I should call him over, kneel down, and explain why running in the store isn\u2019t safe or respectful. I want to teach him discipline, to show him that rules matter, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But just as I open my mouth, a customer steps forward, holding a blender and no receipt. She\u2019s frustrated, insisting she bought it here last week. Store policy is clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. I\u2019m expected to be firm, polite, and unwavering, even as she grows more upset. My son\u2019s laughter echoes, and I feel the eyes of the other customers on me, waiting for me to handle both the return and my child. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to step away and parent, while knowing my job demands my full attention right now. I\u2019m caught, torn between the expectations of being a good parent and a responsible cashier, unsure which role to answer first."}
