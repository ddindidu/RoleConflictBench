My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to prepare the house for the upcoming family gathering. \u201cWe must keep our traditions alive,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes full of expectation. The family altar needed dusting, the special tablecloth had to be ironed, and the old porcelain dishes\u2014used only on these occasions\u2014waited to be washed by hand, as my grandmother always insisted.\n\nBut as a housekeeping cleaner, my job was to keep the house presentable every day, not just for special events. My employer expected spotless floors, gleaming surfaces, and no trace of dust, even in the corners no one ever looked. I\u2019d already spent hours tidying up the visible mess, but the deep cleaning my boss demanded would take the rest of the afternoon.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, torn between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and meeting the high standards of my job. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
