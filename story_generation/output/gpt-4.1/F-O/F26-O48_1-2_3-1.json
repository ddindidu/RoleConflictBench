My daughter had called last night, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to baking cookies together. I could almost hear their laughter already, and I felt a warm tug in my chest. But as I poured my morning coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the nursing home supervisor. Mrs. Carter, who just had surgery, needed extra help today. They were short-staffed, and she\u2019d be relying on me to help her get out of bed, bathe, and dress safely. I knew how anxious she got with new faces, and how much she trusted me. My heart twisted. My family expected me to be present, to share stories and hugs, but my patient needed me too, in a way that felt urgent and personal. I stood in the quiet kitchen, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility I felt for Mrs. Carter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
