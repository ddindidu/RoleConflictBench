My wife was in the living room, curled up on the couch, her eyes red from crying. She\u2019d barely spoken all day, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed to know I was there, that I cared, that she wasn\u2019t alone in this storm. But as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a notification from work: a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol demanded a prompt, formal reply. I could already hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of timely communication, of professionalism. My wife\u2019s quiet sobs pulled at me, but so did the expectation that I would handle my responsibilities without delay. I felt torn, my heart heavy, as I tried to decide which role to step into first\u2014husband or accountant\u2014knowing that, for someone, I would fall short."}
