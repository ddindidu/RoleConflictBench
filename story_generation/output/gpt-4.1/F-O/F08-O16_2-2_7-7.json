She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with her excitement. I knew she expected me to call, to share in her joy, to be the supportive grandmother who always listened and celebrated every milestone. But as I glanced at the patient file open on my computer, my heart tightened. Mrs. Lee, who had battled her autoimmune disease for years, was waiting for my call too. Her treatment plan was complicated, and she needed reassurance and a careful adjustment of her medications. The hospital expected me to be thorough, attentive, and precise\u2014lives depended on it. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the warmth of family and the gravity of my profession pulling me in opposite directions.
