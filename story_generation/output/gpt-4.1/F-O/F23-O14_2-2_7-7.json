My partner\u2019s daughter, Mia, sat across from me, quietly working on her homework. I knew the groceries were running low, and the rent was due in a week. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of making sure our family was secure, that Mia never had to worry about the things I did as a child. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab safety audit was in two hours. I was the only scientist on my team who knew how to recalibrate the spectrometer, and last week\u2019s flagged issues meant the lab could be shut down if I didn\u2019t fix them. My supervisor had made it clear\u2014no mistakes, no excuses. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between rushing to the lab to protect my job and staying to figure out how to stretch our last dollars. My heart pounded as I glanced at Mia, then at the clock, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds demanding more than I could give."}
