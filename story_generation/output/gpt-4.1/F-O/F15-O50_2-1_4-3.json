Next week\u2019s shutdown is the only window for maintenance, and I\u2019m already planning which parts to clean first, which tools to bring. Suddenly, my son darts away, weaving between displays, giggling. Other shoppers glance over, some frowning. I feel the weight of their stares\u2014expecting me to step in, to teach him discipline, to show I\u2019m a responsible parent. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPrepare maintenance checklist.\u201d My thoughts split. I know I should kneel down, look my son in the eye, explain why running isn\u2019t safe or respectful. But I also know if I don\u2019t finalize the checklist now, I\u2019ll risk forgetting something crucial for the shutdown. My heart pounds, torn between the urge to guide my child and the pressure to keep the machines\u2014and my job\u2014running smoothly. I grip the cart, caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
