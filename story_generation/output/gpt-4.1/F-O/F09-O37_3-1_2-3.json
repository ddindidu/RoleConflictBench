It was a message from my son\u2019s school: \u201cPlease come in. Your child was involved in a bullying incident.\u201d My heart dropped. As a mother, I knew I needed to be there, to talk to the teacher, to comfort my son, to show him right from wrong. But as I looked around, I saw the half-emptied cleaning caddy and the list of supplies I still had to check before my shift ended. My supervisor expected a full inventory report today\u2014no excuses. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be failing my son when he needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I could feel my hands trembling as I tried to focus on the bottles in front of me, my mind racing between the school and the supply closet, torn by the impossible demands of being both a good mother and a reliable worker."}
