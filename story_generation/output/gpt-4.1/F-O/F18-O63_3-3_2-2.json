My script was open in front of me, but my mind kept drifting to the text I\u2019d just received from my sister\u2014three words: \u201cI need you.\u201d She never said things like that unless it was serious. I could picture her, curled up on her bed, eyes red, waiting for me to call. But the customer\u2019s voice snapped me back. \u201cAre you even listening?\u201d he barked. My manager expected me to handle objections, to keep the call going, to not let a long-time customer slip away. But my sister needed me, needed my comfort, my words, my presence. I felt the pressure building, my heart pounding as I tried to juggle the demands of being a reliable employee and a supportive sibling. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the voice in my ear and the silent plea on my phone, not knowing which role to answer first."}
