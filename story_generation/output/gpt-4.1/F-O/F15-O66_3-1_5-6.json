The store manager\u2019s voice was tense\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. My heart pounded as I rushed inside, still in my uniform, the scent of car freshener clinging to me. My son\u2019s eyes were wide, cheeks flushed with shame. The manager expected me to handle it, to teach my child right from wrong. But my mind raced with the demands of my other role: I had a client waiting outside, and the cab had to stay immaculate. If I left the car unattended, a mess or complaint could cost me my job. Yet, as a parent, I was expected to address my son\u2019s behavior immediately, to show him honesty and discipline mattered more than anything. I stood there, torn between the duty to my child and the responsibility to my work, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
