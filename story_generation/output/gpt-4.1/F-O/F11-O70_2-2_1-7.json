It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you call me? I really need to talk.\u201d I could almost hear the strain in his words, and I knew he\u2019d been having a rough week. As his sister, I felt that familiar tug\u2014he needed me, and I wanted to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like I always did.\n\nBut right then, the customer opened the door, her face already impatient. \u201cExcuse me, can you tell me when the rest of my order will arrive?\u201d she asked, her tone sharp. I forced a polite smile, remembering the training: always be courteous, always be professional, no matter what. My brother\u2019s message blinked on my screen, demanding my attention, while the customer waited for an answer, expecting my full focus.\n\nI felt torn, my heart racing. I wanted to step aside and call my brother, to be the supportive sister he needed. But I also knew I had to stay present, answer the customer\u2019s questions, and uphold my responsibility as a delivery person. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
