As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in perfect order\u2014safety first, always. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning: \u201cEven the small things matter. Chairs lined up, equipment checked.\u201d I noticed a few pool chairs were slightly misaligned, not a hazard, but not up to standard either. I knew I should fix them before my shift ended.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to my son\u2019s hopeful face. I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo if I got through this month without any extra expenses. He\u2019d been counting down the days, and I could already picture his excitement. But money was tight, and every hour I spent here mattered for our budget. If I stayed late to fix the chairs, I\u2019d miss the sale at the store, and the Nintendo would slip out of reach. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my duty as a lifeguard, and my promise as a parent. I stood frozen, clipboard pressed to my chest, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
