My daughter\u2019s message from this morning echoes in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Dad, everyone\u2019s waiting for you at six.\u201d The family gathering is circled in red on my calendar, a promise I made to my grandkids to play chess and tell stories. But now, I\u2019m stuck behind the wheel, rain streaking the windshield, the wipers barely keeping up. The roads are slick, and impatient drivers dart between lanes, their brake lights flashing unpredictably. My phone buzzes with another ride request\u2014one more fare before I head home, I tell myself. But every minute I spend here, I\u2019m not with my family. I know I can\u2019t rush; safety comes first, especially in this weather. Yet, the thought of my grandchildren\u2019s disappointed faces tugs at me. I grip the steering wheel tighter, torn between the duty to my passengers and the promise to my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in as the rain keeps falling."}
