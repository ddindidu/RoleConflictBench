Need you ASAP.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight settle in my chest. Across from me, my partner\u2019s eyes were red and tired. They\u2019d barely slept in days, and I knew they needed me here, to listen, to hold their hand, to just be present. I reached out, squeezing their fingers, trying to offer comfort, but my mind was already racing through possible causes for the machine\u2019s glitch. The plant was quiet this week, but if the press failed now, it could mean bigger problems down the line. I could hear the expectation in my manager\u2019s message\u2014quick, reliable, thorough. But here, at home, the expectation was different: patience, empathy, unwavering support. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me at the same time. I looked at my partner, then at my phone, the silence between us thick with everything I hadn\u2019t said."}
