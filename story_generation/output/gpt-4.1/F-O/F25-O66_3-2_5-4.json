The city was a blur of headlights and slick roads, every car around me darting unpredictably. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to keep my focus, drive defensively, and obey every traffic law\u2014especially in this weather. But my phone buzzed again on the seat beside me. It was my stepmother, reminding me that tonight I was expected to lead the family ceremony, a tradition my late father cherished. She said it was my turn to uphold our values, to show I belonged. My heart pounded with the weight of her words. I wanted to honor my family, to prove I was worthy of the role, but the clock was ticking and my shift wasn\u2019t over. Every minute I spent behind the wheel was a minute closer to disappointing someone\u2014either my family or the passengers who trusted me to get them home safely. The rain kept falling, the traffic kept shifting, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to see which road I should take."}
