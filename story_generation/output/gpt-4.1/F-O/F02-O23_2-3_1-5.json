My daughter\u2019s open class was circled in bright red, a reminder she\u2019d made herself, her handwriting shaky but hopeful. \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Dad?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her eyes shining with anticipation. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, and I meant it. But just below that, in bold, was the start of the jury trial I\u2019d been preparing for months. My client\u2019s future\u2014and a small fortune\u2014rested on my shoulders. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. I could already hear my client\u2019s anxious voice, feel the weight of his trust. My heart twisted as I imagined my daughter scanning the classroom for me, her face falling when she didn\u2019t see me. At the same time, I pictured the courtroom, the jury, the opposing counsel, all waiting for me to stand and fight. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn in two, desperate not to let anyone down."}
