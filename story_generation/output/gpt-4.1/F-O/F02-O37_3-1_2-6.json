He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. My heart twisted with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I knew I needed to be there for him, to show him right from wrong, to support him as a father should. But as I looked down at my cleaning cart, I remembered the strict protocols at the hotel. Today, I was assigned to deep-clean the kitchen, a task that required gloves and careful attention to hygiene. My supervisor had already warned me about cutting corners, and I couldn\u2019t afford another mistake. The pressure built inside me, the weight of being a good father and a responsible employee pulling me in opposite directions. I imagined my son sitting in the principal\u2019s office, waiting for me, while at the same time, I pictured my supervisor checking on my work, expecting everything to be spotless and safe. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role I could let down less."}
