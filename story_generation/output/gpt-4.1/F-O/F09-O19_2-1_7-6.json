New drugs, new protocols\u2014so much to keep up with. My phone buzzes with a message from my husband: \u201cWe\u2019re short on groceries again. Can you pick up extra shifts this week?\u201d My heart sinks. I know the kids need new shoes, and the bills are piling up. I want to be the mother who provides, who keeps the fridge full and the lights on. But as a pharmacist, I\u2019m expected to stay sharp, to know every new medication, every side effect. If I don\u2019t keep up, I risk falling behind, making mistakes, losing respect at work. My mind races\u2014should I volunteer for overtime, sacrificing precious hours with my children, or should I spend my evenings studying, ensuring I\u2019m the best pharmacist I can be? The weight of both worlds presses down on me, and I feel torn, unable to give either role what it truly deserves."}
