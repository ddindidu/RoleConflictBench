Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost hear the laughter and smell the food, the warmth of being together after a long week. But just as I was picturing myself at the table, my radio crackled. \u201cOperator, we have a report of an unattended bag in car three. Please investigate immediately.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew the protocol\u2014passenger safety always came first. I was supposed to check the bag, alert security, and possibly delay the train. But if I did, I\u2019d miss the family dinner, again. I could already imagine the disappointment in my mother\u2019s eyes, the subtle sighs, the feeling that I was always choosing work over them. Yet, if I ignored the report, I\u2019d be risking the safety of everyone on board. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me as I slowed the train, torn between the people waiting at home and the strangers depending on me now."}
