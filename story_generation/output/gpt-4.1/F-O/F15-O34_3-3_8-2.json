As an air traffic controller, I\u2019m expected to keep calm, to manage the chaos when a sudden route closure forces dozens of flights into tight holding stacks. Every instruction I give could mean the difference between order and disaster. But beneath my professional focus, another worry gnaws at me. At home, the mortgage statement sits on the kitchen table, a stark reminder that our home loan repayment is due in two months. My partner and I have been budgeting every cent, and I know I can\u2019t afford to make a mistake at work\u2014my job is our financial lifeline. The pressure to perform perfectly here, to keep every plane safe, is matched only by the pressure to provide for my family. My hands tremble slightly as I issue clearances, my thoughts torn between the crowded skies and the looming payment. I can\u2019t let either side down, but right now, both roles demand everything from me, and I feel myself stretched to the breaking point, caught between the needs of the skies and the needs of my family."}
