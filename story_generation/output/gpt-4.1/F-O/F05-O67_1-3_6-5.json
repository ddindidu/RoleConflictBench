She wanted me to open up, to share more than just the surface details. I could see the hope in her face, the expectation that I\u2019d let her in, that I\u2019d be the husband who communicates, who doesn\u2019t hide behind silence. My phone buzzed, sharp and urgent. Dispatch: a patient with chest pain, possible heart attack. My heart raced. I was needed\u2014someone\u2019s life depended on my quick response, my steady hands, my focus.
