My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019ve got meetings all afternoon.\u201d I promised I would, but now my phone buzzes with a message from the site foreman\u2014another delay, a shipment of steel beams hasn\u2019t arrived, and the contractors need my input to adjust the schedule. The project is already behind, and my boss expects me to keep everything on track. I pace between the living room and my laptop, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I ignore the laundry, I let my wife down, breaking the small promise that keeps our home running. If I ignore the site, I risk the project spiraling further out of control. My chest tightens as I try to decide which responsibility to tackle first, knowing that either way, I\u2019m letting someone down."}
