My father barely touched his dinner, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But my phone buzzed with another message from opposing counsel, pressing for details about my client\u2019s case. The information they wanted was confidential, and revealing it would betray my client\u2019s trust and violate my ethical obligations as a lawyer. Yet, my parents\u2019 questions about my day grew more insistent, their concern for me mingling with their own worries. I wanted to confide in them, to let them in on the stress I was under, but I couldn\u2019t. The weight of their expectations\u2014to be their supportive daughter\u2014clashed with the demands of my profession. I felt torn, caught between the urge to comfort my parents and the duty to protect my client. The pressure built inside me, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the daughter they needed and the lawyer I was sworn to be."}
