My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you fold the laundry tonight? I\u2019ve got dinner.\u201d I nod, guilt already prickling at my skin, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. At work, Mrs. Carter just had her gallbladder out, and her chart shows a low-grade fever and a racing pulse. The nurse on duty is swamped, and I know I\u2019m expected to check her vitals again, record them, and alert the team if anything changes. My hands hover over the laundry, but my mind is already at the hospital, picturing Mrs. Carter\u2019s pale face. I feel split in two\u2014one half pulled by the warmth of home and the other by the urgent responsibility at work. Both places need me, both expect me to show up, and I can\u2019t shake the ache of letting someone down, no matter which way I turn."}
