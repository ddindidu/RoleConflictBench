My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the kids would be finishing school in twenty minutes. As their step-parent, I promised to pick them up today, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially after missing last week\u2019s art show. But just as I was about to grab my bag, my next client arrived, her hair already washed and smelling of fresh shampoo. She smiled and said, \u201cI washed it right before coming, so we can skip straight to the cut, right?\u201d \n\nSalon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned here, no exceptions. My boss was strict about it, and skipping this step could get me in trouble. But if I insisted on washing her hair, I\u2019d be late for the kids\u2014again. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable step-parent my family needed, or the professional hairdresser my job demanded. I stood there, caught between the two worlds, feeling the pressure build as both waited for me to choose."}
