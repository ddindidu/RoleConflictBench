She\u2019s asking how my day is going, if I\u2019ve eaten, and reminding me to call her before dinner. We talk every day, and I know she worries if I don\u2019t reply quickly. At the same time, my work email pings\u2014a client wants clarification on a confusing line item in their invoice. My manager expects me to respond to clients promptly and professionally, especially with month-end approaching. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I answer my mom now, I risk delaying my client\u2019s response and possibly upsetting my boss. If I focus on the client, my mom will worry and maybe call again, anxious about my silence. My fingers hover over my phone and keyboard, my mind torn between being the attentive daughter my parents expect and the reliable accountant my job demands. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can feel my heart race as I try to decide which message to answer first."}
