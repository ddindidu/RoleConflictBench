My son darts between displays, giggling, nearly knocking over a stack of cereal boxes. I know I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why we need to respect public spaces and other people\u2019s property. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014teaches right from wrong, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But my phone keeps vibrating. I finally glance at the screen: it\u2019s a customer, asking about a package that\u2019s gone missing. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly, calmly, and with all the right answers, even when I don\u2019t have them. My heart pounds. I can\u2019t ignore my child\u2019s behavior, but I also can\u2019t leave the customer hanging. Both roles demand my full attention, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, the weight of expectation pressing down on me from both sides."}
