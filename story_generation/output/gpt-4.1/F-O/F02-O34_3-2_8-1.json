The holiday rush has packed the skies, and I\u2019m juggling holding patterns, calculating delays, and trying to keep the congestion from spiraling out of control. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNo mistakes, not today.\u201d But beneath the surface, another pressure gnaws at me. The home loan payment is looming\u2014just two months away\u2014and I know missing a shift or making an error could threaten the financial stability I promised my family. My wife\u2019s anxious questions about our budget, my daughter\u2019s hopeful talk of a new bedroom, all swirl in my mind as I try to focus on the task at hand.
