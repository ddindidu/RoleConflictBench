As a husband, I know I should help fold them\u2014my wife and I promised to share the chores, and she\u2019s had a long week. But as I reach for a towel, my phone buzzes with a reminder: check the cleaning supply inventory for my housekeeping job. I\u2019m supposed to finish the stocktake before the end of my shift, and I can\u2019t afford to let my boss down. My mind races. If I fold the laundry now, I\u2019ll be late with the inventory. If I do the inventory, the laundry will sit there, another broken promise at home. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be reliable. My hands hover between the laundry basket and my work checklist, heart pounding, torn between being a good husband and a responsible cleaner."}
