Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20148:30 a.m.\u2014and remember I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents in over a week. Guilt pricks at me; I promised I\u2019d check in more often, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. But my mind is already racing through the details of the contested motion I\u2019m arguing on Monday. My client\u2019s case is hanging by a thread, and I need every spare moment to review evidence and anticipate the opposing counsel\u2019s arguments. I stare at my phone, torn. If I call my parents now, I\u2019ll lose precious time I desperately need to prepare. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be letting them down again, reinforcing the distance that\u2019s crept in since I started this job. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, and I find myself frozen, unable to choose which role to honor first."}
