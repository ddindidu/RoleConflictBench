My phone buzzed in the cup holder, and I glanced down to see a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you come? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been having a rough week, and as his sister, I felt that familiar tug\u2014he needed me, and I should be there, no matter what. But the road was a mess tonight. Cars darted between lanes, their headlights blurring in the downpour, and I could feel the tension in my shoulders as I tried to keep my taxi steady and safe. My job demanded my full attention, especially in weather like this. I couldn\u2019t risk a mistake, not with passengers depending on me to get them home safely. But my brother\u2019s words echoed in my mind, guilt and worry twisting in my chest. I was torn, caught between the urge to pull over and call him, and the responsibility to keep my eyes on the road, to be the careful driver my passengers expected. The rain kept falling, and I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
