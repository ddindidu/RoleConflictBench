Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I promised I\u2019d be there, knowing how much these gatherings meant to her, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But as I was about to leave the station, a call came in\u2014two drivers in a fender-bender, tempers flaring, and I was the closest officer. Duty demanded I respond, to mediate fairly and uphold the law, no matter how minor the incident seemed. My badge weighed heavy on my chest as I drove to the scene, my mind torn. I could already picture my siblings\u2019 disappointed faces, hear Mom\u2019s sigh. Yet, I couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility to act with integrity, to treat both drivers impartially and ensure justice, even if it meant missing another family moment. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and as I stepped out of the cruiser, I felt the full force of being pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I\u2019d have to let down."}
