He\u2019d asked to ride along with me today, and I\u2019d hoped the change of scenery would lift his spirits. As a grandmother, I wanted to reach out, to offer the comfort and advice I\u2019d gathered over a lifetime. I could almost hear my own mother\u2019s voice, gentle and wise, urging me to say something, to help him find his way through whatever weighed on him.\n\nBut as a taxi driver, my attention was split.
