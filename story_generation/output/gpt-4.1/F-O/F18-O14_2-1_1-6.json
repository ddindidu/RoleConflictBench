My younger brother had just come home from school, and I could hear the front door slam, followed by the unmistakable sound of muffled sobs. I knew he\u2019d had a rough time with his friends lately, and as his sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort. But the lab\u2019s safety protocols weighed on my mind\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish the checklist tonight, tomorrow\u2019s experiments could be delayed, and my supervisor had made it clear how important it was to keep everything running smoothly. I stared at the checklist, pen in hand, but my thoughts kept drifting to my brother down the hall. The pressure to be a reliable scientist clashed with the urge to be a supportive sibling, and I felt torn, caught between the sterile order of the lab and the messy reality of family."}
