The weight of it pressed on me as I pulled up to the curb, where two travelers stood surrounded by suitcases. They waved me over, explaining they wanted to split the fare and needed help loading their heavy bags. I thought of the extra money this ride could bring\u2014every bit counts with the loan looming. But my back ached from the long shift, and I remembered my promise to my son to be home early tonight, to help him with his homework and cook his favorite meal. The travelers looked at me expectantly, and I saw the meter ticking in my mind, calculating what I could earn. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on earning more for my family\u2019s future, or keep my word as a mother and be there for my child? The pressure of both roles squeezed my chest as I stood by the open trunk, keys in hand, caught between duty and devotion."}
