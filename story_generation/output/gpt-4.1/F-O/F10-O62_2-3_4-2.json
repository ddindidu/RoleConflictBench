As a lifeguard, I knew the stakes\u2014one slip in attention, and someone could drown. But today, my mind was split. My family had gathered just up the beach, setting up for our annual midsummer ritual, a tradition my parents insisted I never miss. They waved, calling me over for the blessing, their voices tinged with expectation. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s words from this morning: \u201cFamily comes first, always. Traditions keep us together.\u201d But my supervisor\u2019s warning echoed too: \u201cNo distractions. Every second counts.\u201d My heart pounded as I watched my little brother, holding out a plate for me, while a group of kids splashed dangerously close to the rocks. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s legacy and the lives entrusted to my vigilance, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
