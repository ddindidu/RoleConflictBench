My wife sat across from me, her eyes red from crying, her hands trembling as she recounted the latest blow in her ongoing crisis. She needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my comfort, my words to anchor her. But my phone buzzed with another message from my manager: \u201cWe need the compliance report by midnight. The new standard is non-negotiable.\u201d I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My wife\u2019s voice wavered, searching my face for reassurance, while my mind raced through checklists and documentation, terrified of missing a critical detail that could jeopardize the project.
