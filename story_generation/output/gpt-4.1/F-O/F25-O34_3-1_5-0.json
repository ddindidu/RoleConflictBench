My stepmother\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cYou\u2019re the eldest now. It\u2019s your turn to lead the morning ceremony.\u201d I know how much this means to her, to the family\u2014preserving the tradition, honoring my late father. I want to do it right, to show I belong, but the thought of standing in front of everyone, reciting words that still feel foreign, makes my stomach twist.\n\nMy phone vibrates. The pre-dawn shift at the tower is quiet, but I\u2019m on call. Sparse traffic, yes, but the expectation is the same: be alert, be ready, keep the skies safe. I can\u2019t ignore the responsibility. If a flight diverts or a medical emergency arises, I\u2019m the one who has to respond, no matter how empty the radar looks.\n\nI stare at the ceremonial robe draped over the chair and the headset on my desk. Both worlds are waiting for me, both demanding I show up, both unwilling to yield. My heart pounds as I weigh the silence of the airspace against the heavy hush of family expectation, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
