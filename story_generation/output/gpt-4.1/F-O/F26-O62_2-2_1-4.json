My granddaughter, Emma, sat nearby, her shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the water. I could tell something was weighing on her\u2014she\u2019d barely spoken since we arrived. As her grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, offer a gentle word, and help her untangle whatever was troubling her. I knew she needed guidance, someone to listen and remind her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut just then, I noticed the lane rope had snapped, its frayed end floating dangerously close to the swimmers. As the lifeguard, it was my responsibility to keep the pool safe and the equipment in order. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the next lesson would be thrown into chaos, and someone could get hurt. My supervisor expected me to act quickly, to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward Emma\u2019s quiet distress and the urgent need to repair the lane rope. Both roles demanded my attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me as I stood there, caught between duty and love."}
