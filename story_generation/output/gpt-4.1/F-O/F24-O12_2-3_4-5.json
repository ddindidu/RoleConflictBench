My stepdad had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, to help everyone feel more connected. At the same time, my laptop pinged with Slack messages\u2014architects from three different teams were waiting for my input on a critical feature. The launch date had just been moved up, and everyone was blocked until I could help define the next steps. I could almost hear the tension in their messages, the urgency in their questions. My heart pounded as I tried to picture myself at the dinner table, pretending to be present while my mind raced through technical decisions. I wanted to be the reliable step-sibling, the one who showed up, but I also knew my team was counting on me. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I felt torn, caught between two worlds that seemed impossible to reconcile."}
