My stepbrother\u2019s voice trembled as he told me about the news\u2014our dad\u2019s cancer had returned. He was breaking down, and I could hear the pain in every word. I wanted nothing more than to be there for him, to listen, to reassure him that we\u2019d get through this together. But just as I tried to comfort him, I heard a sob from the room behind me. Mrs. Carter, my patient, had just learned her cancer was terminal. She was alone, her hands shaking, tears streaming down her face. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be her anchor, to sit with her, hold her hand, and help her through the shock. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my stepbrother needed me, but so did Mrs. Carter. I felt the weight of both their pain pressing on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the two people who needed me most."}
