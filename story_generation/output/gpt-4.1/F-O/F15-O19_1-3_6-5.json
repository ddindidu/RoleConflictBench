My shift was nearly over, but Mrs. Lee, a regular patient, had just arrived with a new prescription. She was already on several high-risk medications, and I knew she needed a thorough consultation to prevent any dangerous interactions. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t rush this\u2014her safety depended on my careful attention. But then my phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised to pick up the Nintendo for Jamie today. He\u2019s been talking about it all week.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Jamie had been saving up, and I\u2019d promised to make it special by buying it together after work. I wanted to keep my word, to give him that joy and show him I could provide for our family. But Mrs. Lee was waiting, trusting me with her health. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I stood there, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved at the same time."}
