As a father, I knew the home loan repayment was looming\u2014just two months away. My wife and I had talked about it last night, her voice tight with worry. I needed to pick up extra shifts, maybe even take on some private consultations, to ensure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. My family depended on me for stability, for the roof over our heads.\n\nBut as a doctor, my mind kept returning to Mrs. Patel, my patient with a rare autoimmune disease. She needed a very specific, expensive treatment plan, and the hospital administration was already questioning the costs. They wanted me to consider cheaper alternatives, but I knew those wouldn\u2019t be as effective. My duty was to prescribe what was best for her, to fight for her health, even if it meant more paperwork, more meetings, and less time at home.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the demands of my family and my patient. My heart ached with the knowledge that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
