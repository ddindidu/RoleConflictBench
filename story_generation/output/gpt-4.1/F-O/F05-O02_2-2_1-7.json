My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cQuarterly estimates due by 8 PM.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20147:15. My mind raced through dependencies, risks, and the pressure from management to avoid last quarter\u2019s overruns. Just then, my wife walked in, her face drawn and anxious. She sat across from me, voice trembling as she described the dilemma at her job\u2014her boss had offered her a new position, but it meant more hours and less time at home. She needed my advice, my reassurance, my full attention.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting back to the project plan, the numbers I still needed to check, the email I had to send. I wanted to be present for her, to listen and support her, but the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressed on me.

My heart ached as I tried to focus on her words, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
