She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave the office, my assistant knocked, looking flustered. She needed access to a client\u2019s confidential files\u2014something I knew I shouldn\u2019t allow, not without proper clearance. She insisted it was urgent, that it would save time for everyone. My mind raced. If I stayed to sort this out, I\u2019d be late for the open class, letting my daughter down. If I left, I risked breaching my professional duty and the trust my client placed in me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences I couldn\u2019t ignore. I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good father and an ethical lawyer, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
