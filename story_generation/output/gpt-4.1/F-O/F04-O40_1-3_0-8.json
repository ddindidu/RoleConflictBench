Can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you!\u201d She\u2019d just landed her dream job, and as her brother, I knew how much it meant for me to be there, cheering her on. But as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my client\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my mind. The termite damage in their house was worse than I\u2019d thought\u2014beams sagging, floors creaking, the whole place at risk. They needed an urgent repair plan, and as their carpenter, I was the only one who could assess and start the work before things got dangerous.\n\nI could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family expected me to show up, to be the supportive brother I\u2019d always tried to be. My client expected me to act fast, to keep their home safe. I paced the workshop, torn between the warmth of my sister\u2019s celebration and the cold urgency of splintered wood and worried homeowners. My heart thudded with the pressure of choosing, knowing that no matter what, someone would be let down."}
