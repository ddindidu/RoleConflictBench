My heart dropped\u2014my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As a mother, I knew I had to go there immediately, to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my break schedule, to be back on time, to keep my stats up. The call volume was light, and my supervisor had said we could be flexible, but I also knew that too much flexibility could be frowned upon if it became a habit. My mind raced with the expectations: my son needed me to guide him, to discipline him with love and firmness; my job needed me to be reliable, to respect the rules. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, torn between the mother my son needed and the employee my job demanded."}
