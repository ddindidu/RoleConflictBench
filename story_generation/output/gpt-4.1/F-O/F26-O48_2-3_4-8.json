Lily wants to tell everyone her big news.\u201d My heart swelled at the thought of my granddaughter\u2019s excitement, the way her eyes would light up as she shared her achievement. I pictured the family gathered around, laughter and hugs, the warmth of being together. But just as I was about to reply, the call bell rang from Room 204. Mrs. Jenkins, my patient, had just learned her cancer had returned. I found her sobbing, clutching her pillow, her eyes searching mine for comfort. She needed me to sit with her, to listen, to be present in her pain. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s joy, my patient\u2019s sorrow. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, fully. My hands trembled as I stood in the hallway, torn between the love of my family and the duty of my care."}
