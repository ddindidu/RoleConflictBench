My heart sank as I read it\u2014my son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the school wanted me to come in immediately. I glanced at the clock; my client, a first-time visitor, was peering into the mirror, her lips pressed tight in disappointment. She\u2019d been so specific about the colour she wanted, and now I could see it wasn\u2019t quite right. I could feel her expectation for me to fix it, to make her feel beautiful and heard. At the same time, I imagined my son sitting in the principal\u2019s office, waiting for his father to show up, to guide him, to help him understand what he\u2019d done. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the client\u2019s hair, but my mind was torn. Both needed me\u2014one as a professional, the other as a parent. I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between the demands of my chair and the needs of my child, not knowing which role to answer first."}
