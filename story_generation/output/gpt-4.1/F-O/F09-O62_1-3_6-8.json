My mind, though, kept drifting to my son\u2019s hopeful eyes this morning, his voice echoing, \u201cYou promised, Mom. You said I\u2019d get a Nintendo if I did well in school.\u201d I wanted so badly to keep that promise, but the bills piling up at home made every dollar feel precious. As a mother, I was supposed to provide, to make him happy, to keep our little world stable.\n\nSuddenly, a splash caught my attention. A child, not my own, was flailing in the deep end\u2014an area strictly off-limits. My training kicked in: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, act fast. But my thoughts tangled. If I left my post for even a moment, I risked my job, the paycheck that kept our lights on and maybe, just maybe, could buy that Nintendo. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between being the mother my son needed and the lifeguard everyone else depended on."}
