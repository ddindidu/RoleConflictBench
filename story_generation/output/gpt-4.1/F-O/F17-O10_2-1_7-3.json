Dad barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to be present. But as I sat with them, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the tax law seminar was starting in an hour. As an accountant, I couldn\u2019t afford to miss it; staying updated was crucial for my clients and my career. My mind raced with the expectations on both sides\u2014my parents needed my comfort, my profession demanded my diligence. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, my heart torn between the urge to stay and the responsibility to go. I looked at my parents, then at my phone, caught in the silent struggle of choosing who needed me more."}
