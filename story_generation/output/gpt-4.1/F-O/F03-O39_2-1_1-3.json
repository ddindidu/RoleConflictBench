My foreman always reminded us: \u201cA clean site is a safe site.\u201d I knew if I left even a stray nail, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be the one to blame. As I started sweeping, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was 7:00 p.m.\u2014the time I always called my parents. Mom would be waiting, probably already sitting by the phone, eager to hear about my day. I could picture Dad, too, asking if I was eating well, if I was safe. They worried if I missed even one call. But the site was a mess tonight, and the foreman was watching. If I left now, I\u2019d let my crew down and risk a warning. If I waited, I\u2019d break my promise to my parents. My hands tightened on the broom as I stared at my phone, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
