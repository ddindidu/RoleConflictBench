My son darted between aisles, giggling, ignoring my earlier warnings to stay close. I knew I needed to teach him about discipline and respect for public spaces, but the phone pressed hot against my ear, and my client\u2019s voice was tense. The operator at their plant had once again changed the machine settings, causing another batch of material to go to waste. The client expected me to provide clear, immediate guidance to prevent further losses. My son\u2019s laughter echoed, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. I felt the weight of both roles\u2014my responsibility to correct my child\u2019s behavior and my duty to help my client avoid costly mistakes. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, feeling the pressure mount from both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet the expectations of either role in this moment."}
