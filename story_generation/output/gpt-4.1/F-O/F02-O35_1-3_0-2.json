I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, waving, just like all the other parents. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder set by my daughter. I smiled, picturing her hopeful face. Then, suddenly, a shrill alarm cut through the hum of the train. A red warning flashed: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I stop the train immediately, report the issue, and ensure every passenger\u2019s safety. But if I did, I\u2019d be stuck underground for hours, unreachable, unable to pick up my kids. I imagined them waiting, scanning the crowd, their faces falling as the minutes ticked by. My duty as a father pulled me one way, my responsibility as a subway operator the other. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I gripped the controls, torn between the two worlds that needed me most."}
