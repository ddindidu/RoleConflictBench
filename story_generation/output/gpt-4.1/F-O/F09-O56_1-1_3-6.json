I reminded her gently, \u201cWe always show respect, even when we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d Later, at the salon, a client arrived for her appointment. She smiled and said, \u201cI just washed my hair at home, so you can skip the wash.\u201d Our salon policy is clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut, to ensure the best results and maintain hygiene standards. My boss expects me to follow this rule strictly. But the client\u2019s hair is spotless, and she seems in a rush. I remember the lesson I gave my daughter about following rules and showing respect. Now, I\u2019m torn\u2014should I insist on washing her hair, as my job requires, or respect her request and make her day easier? The weight of being a good example for my child presses on me, while the pressure to satisfy my client and boss tugs from the other side. I stand there, caught between the expectations of motherhood and my duties as a hairdresser, unsure which path to take."}
