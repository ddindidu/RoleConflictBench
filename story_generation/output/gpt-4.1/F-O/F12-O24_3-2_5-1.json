The living room is still cluttered with toys, and the kitchen counters are a mess. My husband calls from the hallway, asking if I can help him finish tidying up before his parents arrive. I promised him I\u2019d share the load, especially with relatives coming, and I know he\u2019s counting on me. But my laptop sits open on the dining table, case files spread around it. The final briefs for tomorrow\u2019s trial are dense, and I haven\u2019t finished my notes. As a judge, I\u2019m expected to be fully prepared, to give each case my undivided attention and careful analysis. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my husband\u2019s hopeful voice, the silent demand of the files. I want to be present for my family, to make our home welcoming, but I also know the responsibility I carry in court. My mind races, torn between the expectations of home and the demands of justice, unsure which to answer first."}
