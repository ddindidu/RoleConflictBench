It was my younger brother, his voice shaky. \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk. It\u2019s important.\u201d I could hear the strain in his words, the kind that meant he was barely holding it together. As his sister, I knew I should be there\u2014he\u2019d always been there for me, and we promised to support each other, especially when things got tough.\n\nBut then I glanced at the delivery schedule on my handheld device. One address was flagged: \u201cUrgent\u2014groceries for dinner, must arrive by 6 PM.\u201d The customer had called twice already, desperate for the delivery. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning how crucial it was to meet these time windows, especially for food orders.\n\nI felt my chest tighten. If I went to my brother, I\u2019d let down a customer who was counting on me, and possibly risk my job. If I stuck to my route, I\u2019d be abandoning my brother when he needed me most. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, keys in hand, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
