We chatted about our days, the usual exchange, but tonight she mentioned the neighbors\u2019 party\u2014how loud it was, how it kept her awake. She looked at me, expecting me to share my thoughts, to be open and honest, as we promised each other we would be. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation, the need to communicate, to be her partner first.\n\nBut my phone buzzed. Dispatch reported a noise complaint\u2014our street, that same party. As a police officer, I was expected to respond, to enforce the law, to be impartial and professional. I felt the tension coil inside me. My wife wanted me to talk, to be present, to share. My badge demanded I act, to step into the night and do my duty. I stared at my phone, caught between the warmth of home and the cold call of responsibility, unsure which role I could honor without betraying the other."}
