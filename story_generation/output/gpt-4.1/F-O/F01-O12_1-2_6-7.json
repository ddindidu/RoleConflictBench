My daughter sends a message: \u201cDad, can you help organize the games this year? The kids are so excited to see you!\u201d I smile, picturing my grandkids\u2019 faces, but my phone vibrates again\u2014this time, it\u2019s a Slack notification from work. The QA team has flagged a critical bug, and users are already complaining about app crashes. My manager\u2019s message is clear: \u201cWe need a fix before the weekend, can you jump on a call?\u201d\n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expects me to be present, to keep our traditions alive, to be the grandfather who listens and laughs and makes memories. But my team is counting on me too; I\u2019m the only one who understands this part of the codebase. I stare at the two screens, heart tugged in opposite directions, wondering how I can possibly be in both places at once."}
