My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014another message from my wife. She needed me. She was unraveling, her words raw and desperate, and I could hear the tremor in her voice from our last call. I wanted nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her hand and tell her it would be okay. But in the back seat, my passenger kept glancing at his watch, anxiety etched deep in his face. He had a flight to catch, and every red light, every cautious turn, made him shift impatiently. He was counting on me to get him there safely and on time, despite the storm.
