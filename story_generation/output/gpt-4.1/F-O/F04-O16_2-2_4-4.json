Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food, hear the laughter, feel the warmth of being with my family. They expected me there, not just as a guest, but as a brother\u2014someone who shows up, listens, and shares in the small joys of our lives.\n\nBut as I slipped my phone back into my pocket, I saw my patient\u2019s chart on the desk. Mrs. Patel had just learned she was diabetic. She sat in the exam room, her eyes wide with worry, her husband clutching her hand. They needed me to explain, to answer their questions, to offer reassurance and guidance. As her doctor, I was expected to be patient, thorough, and compassionate, no matter how long it took.\n\nThe clock ticked closer to seven. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the family waiting at home, and the family sitting before me in the clinic. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving my best."}
