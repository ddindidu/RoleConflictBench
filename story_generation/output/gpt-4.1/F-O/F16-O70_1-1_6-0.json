My spouse poured us both some tea, asking, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d I hesitated, thinking about the package that had arrived later than the customer expected, even though it was still within the promised day. My manager had reminded me, \u201cTimeliness is everything. Customers notice even small delays.\u201d I wanted to share my frustration, to be honest about the stress I felt, but I worried my spouse would think I was overreacting or not handling my job well. At the same time, I knew they expected me to be open, to let them in on what was really going on. I could feel the words on the tip of my tongue, but my mind raced with the fear of sounding like I was making excuses. Should I be the reliable spouse who communicates, or the professional who keeps work worries to myself? The silence stretched between us, the weight of both roles pressing down as I tried to decide what to say."}
