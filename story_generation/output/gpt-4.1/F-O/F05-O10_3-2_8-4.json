My wife sat across from me, her eyes searching mine, waiting for me to respond. She wanted to talk about our finances\u2014about the medical bills piling up and whether we should dip into our savings. She needed me to be honest, to share everything, to make this decision together. But my phone kept buzzing with emails from work, reminders that the quarterly tax filing was due next week. As the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to ensure every detail was perfect, every regulation followed, no mistakes allowed. My boss had made it clear: this filing was a top priority. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my wife needed my full attention and openness, but my job demanded focus and precision. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to her, guilt gnawing at me for not being fully present, while anxiety about the looming deadline pressed in from the other side."}
