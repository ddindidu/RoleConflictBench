Flights were stacking up, rerouting around the thunderstorm cells, and every second demanded my full attention. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, \u201cWe need you to stay for another shift\u2014too many flights, not enough hands.\u201d I glanced at my phone, where my wife\u2019s text glowed: \u201cGroceries are running low. Can you pick up milk and eggs? We\u2019re tight this week.\u201d My chest tightened. The overtime pay would help cover the bills, maybe even stretch to next week\u2019s rent. But the thought of missing dinner with my kids, of my wife\u2019s tired eyes as she juggled everything alone, gnawed at me. The radar beeped\u2014another flight needed a handoff. My family needed me home, but the skies needed me here. I stared at the storm, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019d let down tonight."}
