The line stretches down the aisle, customers shifting impatiently. My mind, though, is with my wife\u2014she called during my break, her voice softer than usual. \u201cJust a rough day,\u201d she\u2019d said, brushing it off, but I could hear the fatigue behind her words. I want to be there for her, to listen, to reassure her that she\u2019s not alone. But now, as I fumble with a price check and a customer sighs loudly, I feel the pressure mounting. My manager expects speed and accuracy, no room for mistakes or distractions. I glance at my phone, wishing I could text her, but the next customer is already unloading their cart. My heart aches with the urge to comfort her, but my mind is trapped in the rhythm of scanning, bagging, and making change. I feel torn, pulled between the demands of my job and the needs of the person I love most, unsure which role to prioritize as the line inches forward and my thoughts race."}
