My phone buzzed in the cupholder\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed on the screen. She was waiting at our parents\u2019 house, expecting me to show up for her graduation dinner, the one we\u2019d all been planning for weeks. I could almost hear her laughter, see the proud smile on her face. But in the back seat, my passenger was anxiously checking his watch, his suitcase wedged between his knees. He told me twice already: his flight to Tokyo was the last one out before the airport shut down. As a brother, I wanted nothing more than to be there for my sister, to celebrate her big day. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for getting this man to the airport safely and on time, no matter how treacherous the roads. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, the storm outside nothing compared to the one inside me."}
