My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I know I should, that sharing the load is part of being a good spouse, but my phone buzzes with a calendar reminder: \u201cLab equipment maintenance due tomorrow.\u201d As a scientist, I\u2019m responsible for the safety of everyone in the lab. The checklist is long, and while nothing seems wrong, skipping a step could mean disaster. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014at home, the expectation to be present and helpful; at work, the demand for diligence and responsibility. My hands hover over the laundry, but my mind is already running through the maintenance protocol. I can\u2019t shake the guilt, torn between the comfort of home and the duty of the lab, knowing that whichever I choose, something important will be left undone."}
