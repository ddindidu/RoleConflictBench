The airspace was quiet, a rare lull before the morning rush. My headset crackled, but it was only routine chatter. My phone buzzed\u2014my husband, his name lighting up the screen. He never called this early unless it was important. I hesitated, knowing the expectation: as his wife, I should be there, offering comfort and advice. He\u2019d mentioned a difficult decision at work last night, and I could hear the strain in his voice even through his texts. But as an air traffic controller, I was expected to be vigilant, even in the calm, ready for any sudden change. My supervisor trusted me to keep the skies safe, no matter how empty they seemed. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the urge to answer and the duty to stay focused. The silence in the tower pressed in, heavy with the weight of both roles, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
