My younger brother wanted to go hiking, and my sister suggested a movie night. Mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I needed to move the ambulance from the main station to the satellite location for the shift change. I was expected to be on time, alert, and above all, careful on the road. My family\u2019s voices faded as I stared at the message. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the rest of the planning, maybe even disappoint them. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my shift, risking a rushed drive and the safety of the vehicle. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn by the impossible choice."}
