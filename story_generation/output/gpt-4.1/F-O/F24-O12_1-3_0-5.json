I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in his words, and I knew he needed me. Ever since our parents married, we promised to be there for each other, especially when things got rough. But my laptop chimed with another Slack notification\u2014product architects from three teams were waiting for my input on the new feature specs. The launch date had just been moved up, and everyone was blocked until I made some decisions. My manager\u2019s earlier words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need your answers tonight, or the whole project slips.\u201d I felt my chest tighten, torn between the urge to call my stepbrother and the pressure to open another Zoom meeting. Both sides needed me, right now, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from all directions. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed, as I tried to figure out who I was supposed to let down."}
