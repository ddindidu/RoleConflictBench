My wife had reminded me twice this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, and I\u2019d promised to help with the laundry tonight. But as I walked into the pharmacy, I saw Mrs. Patel waiting anxiously at the counter, clutching a bag of new prescriptions. She was starting a complicated regimen\u2014blood thinners, diabetes meds, and something for her heart. I knew she needed a thorough consultation to avoid any dangerous interactions, and I was the only pharmacist on duty. My phone buzzed with a text from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the laundry!\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family counting on me at home, and my patient depending on my expertise here. My mind raced, torn between the promise I made as a husband and the responsibility I carried as a pharmacist."}
