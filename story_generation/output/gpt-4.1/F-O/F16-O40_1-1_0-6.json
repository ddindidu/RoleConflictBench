I wanted to drop everything, pull them close, and listen\u2014really listen\u2014to whatever was weighing on them. But at that exact moment, a customer stepped in, holding out a splintered wooden train. \u201cCan you fix this? My son\u2019s birthday is tomorrow,\u201d she asked, her eyes hopeful. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My partner lingered by the door, waiting for a sign that I\u2019d noticed their need. The customer waited too, expecting a quick answer and a fair quote. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to be present for the person I love, and the responsibility to my craft and my customer. I stood there, caught between the gentle ache in my partner\u2019s voice and the urgency in the customer\u2019s eyes, unsure which role to answer first."}
