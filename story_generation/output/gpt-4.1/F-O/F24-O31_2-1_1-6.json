He barely looked up as I set my keys down. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, especially when things got rough at school. But my mind was tangled up in the events of my shift. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d stood on Main Street, pen in hand, debating whether to issue a parking ticket to a woman who\u2019d pleaded for leniency. The rules were clear, but I\u2019d always been taught to use discretion, to be fair. Now, as I watched my brother struggle, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. He needed me to be present, to care, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the badge on my chest and the decision I\u2019d made\u2014or hadn\u2019t made\u2014about what fairness really meant. I wanted to be the sibling he could count on, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was failing at both."}
