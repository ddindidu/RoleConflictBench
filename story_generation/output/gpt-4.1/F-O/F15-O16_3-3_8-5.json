As a parent, my mind kept drifting to the looming home loan repayment. Two months wasn\u2019t long, and I needed to make sure we had enough saved. Every expense, every bill, every unexpected cost gnawed at me. I wanted to give my family security, to keep our home safe, to be the provider they expected me to be.\n\nBut as a doctor, I was about to walk into a room where a family waited, anxious and desperate for hope. I had to tell them that their loved one\u2019s diagnosis was serious, that the road ahead would be hard. They needed me to be calm, clear, and compassionate, to answer their questions and hold their pain with empathy.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my spouse about the bank statement. My heart pounded. I took a deep breath, trying to push aside my own worries, but they clung to me. How could I be fully present for my patient\u2019s family when my own family\u2019s future felt so uncertain? The door to the consultation room loomed ahead, and I hesitated, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
