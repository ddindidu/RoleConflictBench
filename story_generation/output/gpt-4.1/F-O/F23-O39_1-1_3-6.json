He\u2019d just snapped at me when I reminded him to say \u201cplease\u201d before asking for more cereal. I knew I needed to be patient, to guide him gently, to show him the right way to treat others. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does\u2014teaches, corrects, and models respect. But my mind kept drifting to the notice I\u2019d seen at the construction site earlier: an optional training session next week, right after my shift. The foreman had hinted that those who attended would be first in line for overtime. I wanted to be seen as reliable, a team player, someone who took the job seriously. But the training was at the same time as the evening routine at home, when my stepson needed me most. I felt the pressure building inside\u2014torn between being the steady hand at home and the dependable worker on site. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my best self. I stared at my stepson, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
