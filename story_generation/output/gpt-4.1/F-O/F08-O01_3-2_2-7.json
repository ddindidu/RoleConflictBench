My mind raced through deadlines and material lists, every minute counting toward the project\u2019s tight schedule. Just then, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important.\u201d She needed me\u2014needed my wisdom, my comfort, the kind of guidance only a grandmother could give. But the contractor was waiting for my answer, and if I didn\u2019t resolve this now, the whole project could be delayed. My heart ached as I looked at her, torn between the urgent demands of my work and the even more urgent need in her eyes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present, fully committed. I hesitated, caught in the impossible space between being the grandmother she needed and the architect my team depended on."}
