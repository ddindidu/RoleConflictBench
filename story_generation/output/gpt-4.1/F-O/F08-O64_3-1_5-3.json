The store was quiet, but my mind was anything but. My daughter had called just an hour ago\u2014my grandson was sick, and they needed me at home. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to rush to their side, to comfort and help, to be the steady presence my family expected. But as I closed out the register, I noticed a small discrepancy in the cash drawer. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. I knew my manager would expect me to stay, fill out the paperwork, and help investigate. My heart ached with worry for my family, but my sense of responsibility to my job pressed down on me. I stared at the register, torn between the demands of my family and the expectations of my workplace, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
