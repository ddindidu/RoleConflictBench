The team was waiting for my decision on a structural change\u2014one that could make or break our deadline. My mind raced through calculations and schedules, weighing the risks. Just then, my granddaughter slid into the chair beside me, her eyes wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandma, how do you know when it\u2019s time to take a big step in life?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I saw the hope in her face, the trust that I would have the wisdom she needed. But my mind was split, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, pressing need of the child before me. I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014my responsibility to guide her, to be present and wise, and my duty to the team counting on my leadership. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention at once."}
