The bathroom still needs cleaning. Relatives will be here in three hours!\u201d My stomach tightened. I was supposed to help make the house spotless, but the holiday rush at the store was relentless. As I returned to my register, a customer slammed her items on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about a pricing error. I forced a smile, trying to stay calm and helpful, but my mind kept drifting home. I imagined my spouse scrubbing floors alone, growing more irritated with every passing minute. The beeping of the scanner and the customer\u2019s complaints blurred together with the guilt and anxiety swirling inside me. I wanted to be the supportive partner, but right now, I was trapped behind the register, expected to be endlessly patient and cheerful. My heart pounded as I wondered which role I was about to let down."}
