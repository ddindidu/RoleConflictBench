She reminded me that tonight was the family\u2019s annual dinner, a tradition my parents insisted we never miss. I could almost hear her voice, full of warmth but edged with expectation, telling me how important it was to honor our customs, especially now that the family was making a renewed effort to keep them alive. \n\nBut as I glanced at the nearly empty shelves\u2014no more disinfectant, running low on gloves\u2014I felt the weight of my other responsibility. My supervisor had been clear: supplies must be managed meticulously, and any shortages reported before the end of my shift. If I left now, the next cleaner would be left in the lurch, and I\u2019d be letting down my team. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the list, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s traditions and the demands of my job. Both sides expected me to do the right thing, but I couldn\u2019t see how to meet both expectations at once."}
