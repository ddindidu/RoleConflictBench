My heart dropped as I heard the manager\u2019s voice: my son had been caught slipping a candy bar into his pocket. I rushed over, my mind racing with what I should say, how I should teach him right from wrong, how to make this a lesson he\u2019d never forget. But as I stood in the store, my phone buzzed urgently\u2014dispatch needed me back at the tower. Thunderstorms were rolling in, flights were stacking up, and every controller was needed to keep the skies safe. I could hear the tension in my supervisor\u2019s voice, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, focused and ready. But my son\u2019s eyes were wide and scared, waiting for me to be his mother, to guide him through this mistake. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding all of me at the same impossible moment."}
