Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, a mix of excitement and expectation. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and missing one was unthinkable. But as I glanced at the backseat of my cab, I noticed a coffee stain on the upholstery and crumbs scattered from my last passenger. My next fare was a regular who always complimented my spotless car. I prided myself on my professionalism\u2014clean cab, friendly service, always on time. The clock ticked closer to the dinner hour, and I felt the pressure mounting. If I rushed home to help, I\u2019d have to leave the mess for later, risking my reputation. If I stayed to clean, I\u2019d be late for the family, letting them down. My hands trembled on the steering wheel, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the pride I took in my work. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which part of myself to disappoint."}
