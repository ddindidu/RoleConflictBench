Hope you can make it!\u201d I knew how much she valued these outings, how we\u2019d promised to be more present in each other\u2019s lives. As her brother, I wanted to show her that she mattered, that I respected our bond enough to make time for her. But as I looked at the stack of law journals on my desk, my heart sank. The latest issue had just arrived, filled with articles on emerging legal theories\u2014exactly the kind of material I needed to stay sharp as a judge.
