It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cAbout to try the new trick. Wish me luck!\u201d I glanced at the photo he\u2019d sent\u2014him, helmet askew, grinning at the top of that battered old ramp behind our house. My heart skipped. As his sibling, I felt the urge to call him, to beg him to wait until I could be there, to make sure he was safe. But on the other side of the door, Mrs. Lee was waiting, her eyes red from crying after learning about her diagnosis. She needed me to be present, to answer her questions with patience and empathy, to help her feel less alone. I could almost hear my brother\u2019s laughter, reckless and bright, and I could see Mrs. Lee\u2019s trembling hands. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, pulling me in opposite directions. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my patient and the instinct to protect my brother, my mind racing with what I should do next."}
