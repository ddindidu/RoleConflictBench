The space was tight, and every inch mattered. I wanted it to be functional, a place where I could work without distraction. My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, are you coming for the holiday dinner? The kids are excited to see you.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the familiar tug. As a grandfather, I was expected to be present, to keep the family close, especially during the holidays. But as an architect, I was lost in the challenge of making this small space work, knowing that if I didn\u2019t finish the sketches now, the project would stall. The pressure built inside me\u2014my family wanted my time, my work demanded my focus. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, see the table set for the holiday meal, but the lines on my paper called me back. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
