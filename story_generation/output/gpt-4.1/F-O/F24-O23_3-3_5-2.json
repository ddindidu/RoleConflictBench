This holiday trip was supposed to be a chance for us to bond, to finally feel like a real family. I knew how much it meant to them, and to me, too, if I was honest.\n\nBut my laptop screen glared back at me, the merger contract open and waiting. My client\u2019s email was urgent: \u201cPlease review the liability clauses before 5 PM. We can\u2019t afford a mistake.\u201d The weight of responsibility pressed on my chest. If I missed something, the financial fallout could be catastrophic for my client\u2014and for my reputation as a lawyer.\n\nI could hear laughter from the kitchen as my family packed snacks and argued over playlists.
