My phone buzzed\u2014a message from my granddaughter, asking if she could come over. She arrived, eyes bright but uncertain, and soon confided in me about her worries starting high school. She wanted advice, reassurance, the kind of steady wisdom she believed I always had. As she spoke, my mind kept drifting back to the building plans. I\u2019d noticed a few minor inconsistencies earlier\u2014nothing that would cause immediate harm, but not quite up to code either. My team was under pressure to meet deadlines, and flagging these issues would mean delays and frustration for everyone. I felt the weight of my granddaughter\u2019s trust, her expectation that I\u2019d help her find her way, while the architect in me nagged at the back of my mind, demanding I uphold my professional standards. I wanted to be fully present for her, to offer the guidance she needed, but the responsibility of ensuring safety and compliance tugged at me, making it hard to focus. I sat there, torn, the two worlds colliding in the quiet of my kitchen."}
