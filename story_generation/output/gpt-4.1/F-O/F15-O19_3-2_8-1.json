As a parent, I know I must keep our finances steady\u2014missing a payment could put our home at risk. The numbers run through my head: bills, groceries, the loan. I can\u2019t afford a single mistake, not now. But as a pharmacist, I\u2019m holding a prescription for Mr. Lee, who depends on me to get his medications right. He has diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure; one error could mean a hospital visit or worse. My hands tremble as I double-check the dosages, but my thoughts keep drifting to the bank statement in my bag. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down\u2014my family\u2019s security on one side, my patient\u2019s health on the other. I know I can\u2019t let either down, but right now, the pressure is almost too much to bear."}
