My manager\u2019s words from the morning meeting echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cKeep up the momentum, you\u2019re on track to break your record!\u201d\u2014but my thoughts kept drifting to my daughter\u2019s trembling voice from last night. She\u2019d called late, her words choked with worry about my grandson\u2019s sudden illness. I promised I\u2019d check in today, to be there for her, to listen. But now, the call list blinked on my screen, names and numbers waiting, and I knew every minute I spent away from dialing was a minute lost in potential sales. The pressure to keep my numbers high gnawed at me, but so did the guilt of not being there for my family. I stared at my phone, torn between the expectation to be the supportive grandmother my family needed and the top-performing telemarketer my boss expected. My finger hovered over the keypad, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which call to make next."}
