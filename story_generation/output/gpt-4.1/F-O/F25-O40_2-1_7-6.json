The little boy beside her looked up at me with wide, hopeful eyes. I knew I needed to examine the damage, estimate the time and cost, and reassure them I could fix it. But my phone buzzed again in my pocket\u2014another message from my stepdad. He and Mom had been arguing more lately, and I could hear the exhaustion in his voice when he called last night. I was supposed to go home early today, maybe cook dinner, just be there for them. But the shop was busy, and this repair would take time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the reliable, caring step-child at home, and the skilled, attentive carpenter here. My hands hesitated over the toy, my mind torn between the anxious faces waiting for me in both places."}
