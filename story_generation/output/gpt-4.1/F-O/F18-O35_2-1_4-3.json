Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family dinners were rare, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially after the week we\u2019d all had. But as the train slowed into the next station, the intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you help me? I\u2019m lost\u2014how do I get to the hospital from here?\u201d The voice was anxious, and I could picture someone standing alone, needing reassurance. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways prioritize passenger safety and assistance.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family waiting at home, expecting me to show up and be present, and this passenger, relying on me for guidance and calm. My hands hovered over the controls, torn between the warmth of home and the duty of my uniform, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
