My granddaughter, Emma, wandered in, her shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. I recognized that look\u2014something was weighing on her, something she wasn\u2019t ready to share. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to set aside everything, to offer her the comfort and wisdom she needed, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as a lawyer, I knew I had a responsibility to my client, even if today\u2019s hearing was minor and could be postponed with a simple call. The expectation to be present and professional tugged at me, while the pull to be the steady, loving presence Emma needed was just as strong. My heart ached as I watched her hesitate in the doorway, torn between my duty to my client and my duty to my family, unsure which role should take precedence in this moment."}
