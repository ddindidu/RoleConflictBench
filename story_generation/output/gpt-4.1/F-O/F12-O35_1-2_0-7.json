My husband sits at the kitchen table, swirling his coffee, and mentions offhandedly that his day was rough\u2014nothing major, just a string of annoyances at work. I can see the tiredness in his eyes, the way his shoulders slump. He doesn\u2019t ask for much, but I know he wants me to listen, to offer a few words of comfort before I leave. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the mandatory briefing on new subway procedures starts in ten minutes, and being late isn\u2019t an option. Missing it could mean disciplinary action or, worse, putting passengers at risk if I\u2019m not up to date. I hover in the doorway, torn between sitting down to be the supportive wife he needs and rushing out to fulfill my duty as a subway operator. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, each pulling me in a different direction as I stand frozen, keys in hand."}
