My son stood beside him, cheeks flushed, a half-opened bag of cookies in his hand. The manager\u2019s voice was gentle but firm, and I could see the shame in my son\u2019s eyes. As a mother, I knew this was a moment to teach him about honesty and consequences, to guide him with patience and love. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014dispatch from the tower. A major route closure had just been announced, and dozens of flights were now circling, waiting for instructions. My team needed me to manage the chaos, to keep hundreds of lives safe in the sky. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my child\u2019s need for guidance, and my duty to the pilots and passengers depending on my calm, focused decisions. My heart pounded as I stood between my son and the store manager, my phone vibrating insistently, torn by the impossible demands of being both a mother and an air traffic controller."}
