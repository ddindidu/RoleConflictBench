My daughter had called twice, making sure I\u2019d be there to play with the grandkids and share stories over dinner. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth. But as I settled into my chair, my phone buzzed\u2014a client had just emailed a contract for review. It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, and the deadline was weeks away. Still, the old habit tugged at me: review it now, get ahead, be thorough. My reputation as a lawyer was built on reliability and promptness. Yet, as a grandparent, I was expected to be present, to give my time and attention freely. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding a different kind of presence. I sat at my desk, the contract open on one screen, the family group chat lighting up on another, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to choose."}
