As a judge, I was expected to draft a standard scheduling order for a new case by the end of the week, and the pressure to be thorough and precise weighed heavily on me. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my family\u2019s living room, where my parents and siblings had gathered earlier, discussing the upcoming family ceremony. They reminded me, not for the first time, how important it was to uphold our traditions\u2014how every detail, from the rituals to the food, mattered. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but firm, \u201cYou\u2019re the eldest now. We need you to lead.\u201d The expectation to honor our customs clashed with the demands of my profession. I felt torn, knowing that if I focused on the order, I\u2019d disappoint my family, but if I prioritized the ceremony, my work would suffer. The weight of both worlds pressed in on me, and I stared at the blinking cursor, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
