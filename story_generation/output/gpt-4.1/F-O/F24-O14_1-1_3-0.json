My stepbrother grinned, nudging me to vote for the hiking trip. I knew how much these moments meant to my mom\u2014she wanted us to feel like a real family, to build memories together. But as I nodded along, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab had an open slot for my experiment this Saturday. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d been waiting weeks for the right conditions, and the data could be crucial for my research. My advisor expected me to seize every opportunity, to show commitment and initiative. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family hoping I\u2019d be present, my scientific ambitions demanding my focus. My heart pounded as the conversation turned to final plans, and I realized I\u2019d have to choose which part of myself to disappoint."}
