She\u2019d just started her new job and was bubbling with excitement, eager to share every detail. As her grandmother, I knew how much it meant to her that I listened and responded quickly, showing her that her milestones mattered to me. But just as I started typing a reply, my next client\u2014a first-time visitor\u2014sat down in my chair. She\u2019d asked for a warm chestnut brown, but as I removed the cape and she caught her reflection, her face fell. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and my heart sank. As a hairdresser, I was expected to address her concerns immediately, to reassure her and fix whatever she didn\u2019t like. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, my granddaughter\u2019s excitement waiting for me, while in front of me, my client\u2019s silence grew heavier. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention at the same moment."}
