It was a message from my husband: \u201cCan we talk tonight? You seemed distant lately. I\u2019m worried.\u201d My heart tightened. He always expected us to share our worries, to be open, especially when something was bothering one of us. I glanced at the half-checked kit, knowing my shift was almost over, but protocol demanded every item be accounted for\u2014lives could depend on it. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My husband needed me to be present, to listen and share, but my duty as an ambulance driver meant I couldn\u2019t leave until the kit was perfect. I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to rush home and the responsibility to finish my check. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension growing, caught between the expectations of being a good wife and a reliable ambulance driver."}
