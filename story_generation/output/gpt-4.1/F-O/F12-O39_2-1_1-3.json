He needed me\u2014he\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant longer hours and more stress. He wanted to talk, to hear my thoughts, to feel my support. I promised we\u2019d talk tonight, but as I walked onto the construction site, my mind was split. The foreman\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts, reminding us all that the end-of-shift sweep-up was non-negotiable. Safety first, always. I glanced at the clock, knowing my husband would be waiting for me to come home, hoping for comfort and advice. But the site was a mess, and if I left early, I\u2019d be letting my crew down and risking someone\u2019s safety.
