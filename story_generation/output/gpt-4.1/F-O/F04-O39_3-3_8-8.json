Protocol is clear: leave everything and head to the muster point. But just as I turn, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s my younger brother, the one I\u2019ve been arguing with for days. The message flashes: \u201cCan we talk? I need to clear things up.\u201d I know how much it means to him\u2014and to me\u2014to resolve this, to show him I respect him enough to listen, even when it\u2019s hard. But the foreman\u2019s voice is already barking orders, and the whole crew is moving. If I stay behind, I risk not just my job, but everyone\u2019s safety. If I go, I might lose the chance to finally fix things with my brother. My hands tremble as I stand frozen, torn between the urgent call of family and the unyielding demands of the site."}
