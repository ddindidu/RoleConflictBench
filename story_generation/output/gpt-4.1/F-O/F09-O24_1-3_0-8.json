My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014school pick-up was in twenty minutes. I pictured my twins, backpacks slung over their shoulders, scanning the crowd for me. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there today, the last day before summer break. Then my clerk slipped me a note: the Supreme Court had just overturned the precedent at the heart of this case. My heart pounded. I was expected to be the steady hand of justice, to adapt instantly, to ensure the law was followed. But I was also expected to be a mother who kept her word, who showed up.
