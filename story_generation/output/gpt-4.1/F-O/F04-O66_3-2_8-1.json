His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and traffic was already building up. I could feel the weight of his expectation: get him to the station on time, no excuses. But my sister\u2019s silence was heavier. I knew she wanted me to pull over, to finally have the honest conversation we\u2019d been putting off, to show her I cared enough to make time.
