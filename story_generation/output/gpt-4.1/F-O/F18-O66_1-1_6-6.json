The street is familiar, but I keep an eye out, just like Mom asked\u2014always look out for him. Suddenly, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s the taxi company: a last-minute booking, a regular client who expects my cab to be spotless. I glance at my brother, who\u2019s dragging his shoes through a puddle, splashing mud onto his pants\u2014and onto my cab keys dangling from my belt. My mind races. If I hurry him home, I can clean the cab before the client arrives. But if I rush, I might miss the cars speeding around the corner, or not notice if he trips. My brother\u2019s safety or my reputation as a reliable, professional driver? Both matter, both demand my full attention. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which role I\u2019m supposed to put first."}
