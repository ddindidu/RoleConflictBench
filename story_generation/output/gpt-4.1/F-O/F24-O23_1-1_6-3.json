The street is familiar, but today, Jake seems distracted, glancing over his shoulder more than usual. I know I\u2019m supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cYou\u2019re the older one, keep him safe.\u201d My phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder about a procedural hearing I\u2019m scheduled to attend in an hour. As a lawyer, I know this hearing is minor, something that could be postponed with a quick call. But I also know my client expects me to be there, to show up and represent them, no matter how small the matter.\n\nJake tugs at my sleeve, his voice low. \u201cCan we take the long way home? I think someone\u2019s following us.\u201d My heart pounds. I glance at the time, calculating how much longer the detour would take. If I go with Jake, I\u2019ll miss the hearing. If I rush him, I risk his safety. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I feel torn, standing at the crossroads of responsibility and duty, unsure which path to choose."}
