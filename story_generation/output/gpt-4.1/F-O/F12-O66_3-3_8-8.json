He wanted me to be open, to share every detail about our finances, to make decisions together. I could see the worry in his face, the hope that I would be fully present, that I wouldn\u2019t hide anything. My phone buzzed on the table, the app flashing: a passenger was waiting, sending urgent messages about needing to get to the hospital quickly. As a taxi driver, I was expected to be reliable, to respond immediately and get my passenger there safely and on time. My husband\u2019s voice grew softer, asking if I was listening, if I could promise to be transparent. The passenger\u2019s messages grew more frantic. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my husband needing my honesty and attention, my passenger needing my speed and professionalism. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
