The subject line\u2014\u201cFinal Notice: Immediate Payment Required\u201d\u2014made my stomach twist. As an accountant, I knew the consequences if we didn\u2019t pay soon: shipments would stop, and our business could grind to a halt. I needed to call the supplier, negotiate, and somehow buy us more time. But just as I reached for my laptop, my husband walked in, his face serious. He wanted to talk about our finances and some recent health concerns. As his wife, I owed him honesty and openness, especially now. He deserved my full attention, my willingness to share and listen. But my mind kept drifting to the urgent email, the looming threat to our business. I felt torn, pulled between the expectation to be present and transparent with my husband, and the professional demand to resolve a crisis that couldn\u2019t wait. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in from all sides."}
