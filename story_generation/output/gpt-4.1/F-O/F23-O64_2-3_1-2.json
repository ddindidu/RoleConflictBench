My stepdaughter\u2019s open class started at 3:30, and she\u2019d asked me twice this morning if I\u2019d be there. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes hopeful. I promised I\u2019d try, but now, as the line of customers grew and the manager reminded me that I was responsible for closing out the high-value register, my stomach twisted. The end-of-shift transactions were always stressful\u2014one mistake, and the numbers wouldn\u2019t add up, meaning paperwork, questions, and maybe even a write-up. But if I missed the open class, I\u2019d let her down again, reinforcing the distance she already felt. My hands shook as I scanned bills and receipts, my mind split between the beeping register and the image of her searching the classroom for my face. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
