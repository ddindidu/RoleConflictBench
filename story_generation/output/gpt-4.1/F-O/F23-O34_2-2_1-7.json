My stepson, Ethan, had been talking about it for weeks, his eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, just like the other parents. I promised him I would. But now, as I sat in the control tower, the radar screen was a mess of blips and shifting storm patterns. Thunderstorms had forced half a dozen flights to reroute, and the handoff frequency between sectors was relentless. My headset buzzed with voices, each one needing my full attention to keep hundreds of lives safe. My supervisor\u2019s expectation was clear: no distractions, not today. Yet, Ethan\u2019s teacher had emailed again this morning, reminding me how much it would mean to him if I showed up. My heart twisted as I watched the clock tick closer to two, torn between the sky and the classroom, between the safety of strangers and the trust of a child who was just learning to count on me."}
