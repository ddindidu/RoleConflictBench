The project was behind schedule, and I was expected to resolve a dispute between two teams before noon. Just as I started drafting an email, my stepson spilled his juice, then snapped at his little sister for laughing.

But the clock was ticking, and the client\u2019s expectations pressed on my mind. My heart tugged in two directions: the architect in me demanded focus and swift action, while the step-parent in me knew this was a moment that mattered.
