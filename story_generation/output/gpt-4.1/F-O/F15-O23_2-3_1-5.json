She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, her eyes shining with hope every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I promised her I would. But now, the trial date was set in stone\u2014jury selection starting the same morning. My client\u2019s future, their business, their family\u2019s security, all depended on my presence in that courtroom. The judge had already made it clear: no delays, no exceptions. I could almost hear my client\u2019s anxious voice, counting on me to fight for them. My heart twisted as I imagined my daughter scanning the classroom for my face, and not finding it. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding all of me, neither willing to yield. I sat at my desk, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I cared about would be let down."}
