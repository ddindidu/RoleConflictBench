The case was procedural, nothing complicated, but I knew the expectation: every file deserved my full attention, no matter how routine. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the open class at Lily\u2019s school. She\u2019d been talking about it for days, her eyes bright with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on like the other parents. As her step-parent, I wanted to show her she mattered, that I was present. But the judge in me felt the weight of duty, the silent demand to be thorough, to never let personal life interfere with justice. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the little girl waiting for me in a classroom, and the solemn responsibility waiting in the pages before me. I stared at the folder, then at my phone, feeling the pressure build, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
