As a wife, I knew he expected me to help share the chores, and folding laundry was one of those silent agreements we\u2019d made. But today, I was also here as the housekeeping cleaner, clipboard in hand, checking the dwindling bottles of detergent and scrubbing sprays. My boss expected a thorough inventory, and I couldn\u2019t afford to miss a single item. The clock ticked louder with every minute I spent torn between the two roles. If I stopped to fold the laundry, I\u2019d fall behind on my cleaning checklist and risk a reprimand at work. But if I ignored the laundry, I\u2019d disappoint my husband and feel the guilt gnawing at me all evening. My hands hovered between the soft pile of clothes and the cold, practical pen, my heart caught in the tug-of-war between being a good wife and a reliable cleaner."}
