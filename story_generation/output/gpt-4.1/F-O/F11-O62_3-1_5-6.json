My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my brother, reminding me that the family was waiting for me to join the holiday celebration at home. Mom had made my favorite dish, and everyone expected me to be there, to laugh, to share stories, to be a good sister. But as I glanced back at the water, I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, unsupervised, their parents distracted by their own conversations. My supervisor had drilled it into us: safety first, always. I was responsible for every person in that pool. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s warm expectations pulling me one way, my duty as a lifeguard anchoring me to the poolside. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the call of home and the responsibility in front of me."}
