The open class at my daughter\u2019s school was starting in thirty minutes. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with excitement every time she asked if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I would. But now, the shrill screech of the main conveyor\u2019s bearing echoed through the workshop, a sound I knew spelled disaster if left unchecked. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime today. Stay sharp.\u201d I could already picture the disappointment on my daughter\u2019s face if I didn\u2019t show up, but I also knew the chaos that would erupt if the machine failed. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the open class, just as my foreman called out for help. My heart pounded, torn between the world of whirring gears and the world of my child\u2019s hopeful gaze, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
