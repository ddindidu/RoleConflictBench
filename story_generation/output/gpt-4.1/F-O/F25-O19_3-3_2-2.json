Haven\u2019t heard from you today.\u201d I knew she expected me to check in, to share how my day was going, to keep the connection alive. It was something I promised after Dad passed, and I could hear her worry in every word. But right now, I was standing behind the pharmacy counter, double-checking the dosage on a chemotherapy prescription. The patient\u2019s life depended on my focus\u2014one decimal point off, and the consequences could be catastrophic. My hands trembled as I tried to ignore the persistent vibration in my pocket. I felt torn, the weight of my stepmother\u2019s loneliness pressing against the responsibility I owed my patient. I wanted to reassure her, to be the attentive stepchild she needed, but I couldn\u2019t risk a single distraction. My heart pounded as I stared at the prescription, caught between two worlds, both demanding my undivided attention."}
