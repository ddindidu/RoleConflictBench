She confided in me about her recent struggles\u2014her loneliness, her fears about growing older, and how much she needed someone to lean on. I could see the vulnerability in her eyes, the silent plea for comfort and reassurance. I wanted to be the child she needed, to offer warmth and understanding, to put aside everything else and just be there for her.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the station: a car was parked illegally outside, blocking a neighbor\u2019s driveway. I was expected to respond, to act with integrity and fairness, to uphold the law without bias. I knew the car belonged to my mother. She\u2019d parked there in a hurry, overwhelmed by her emotions. The rules were clear, but so was the pain in her voice. I felt torn, the weight of my badge pressing against the ache in my chest. I was both a child and a police officer, and in that moment, I didn\u2019t know which part of me should answer the call."}
