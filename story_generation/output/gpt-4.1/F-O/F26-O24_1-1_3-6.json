The family would arrive soon, laughter and stories filling the rooms as they always did during our gatherings. My grandson had called earlier, excited to show me his new science project. I knew how much these moments meant to them\u2014and to me. Yet, on the dining table, the latest law review journal sat unopened, its crisp pages promising insights into evolving legal theories. As a judge, I was expected to stay sharp, to keep up with every nuance and shift in the law. My docket was full next week, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the warmth of family, the duty of my profession. I felt the tug in my chest, torn between the laughter waiting in the living room and the silent, urgent call of the journal."}
