My father barely spoke, his shoulders hunched as if carrying a weight I couldn\u2019t see. I knew they needed me\u2014needed their daughter to sit with them, listen, and offer comfort. But my phone buzzed with reminders: the contested motion was scheduled for tomorrow morning. My client\u2019s case depended on my preparation tonight; they were counting on me to be sharp, persuasive, and fully present in court. I felt the pull from both sides\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for support, my client\u2019s trust in my advocacy. My heart ached with guilt as I tried to split my attention, but the demands were too great. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of expectation pressing in from both worlds, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
