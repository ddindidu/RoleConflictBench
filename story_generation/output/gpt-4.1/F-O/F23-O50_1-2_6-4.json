My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes from this morning replayed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days to the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. I wanted to keep my word, to show him he could trust me, that I could provide the things he dreamed about. But my phone buzzed again: a message from work. The machines in the shop were running hot, overdue for maintenance. If I didn\u2019t get in soon, we risked a costly breakdown, maybe even lost contracts. My boss expected me to be reliable, to keep everything running smoothly.
