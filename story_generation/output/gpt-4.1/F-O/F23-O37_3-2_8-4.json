The home loan repayment is looming, just two months away, and I know every cent counts. As a step-parent, I feel the weight of making sure our family is secure, that my partner and stepchild never have to worry about losing our home. But as I pack up my cleaning supplies after a long day, I notice the bottle of floor cleaner is almost empty. My client expects spotless floors, and I pride myself on never letting them down. The next cleaning is in just a few days, and I should buy more supplies. But the cost, though small, chips away at the money I\u2019m desperately trying to save for the loan. I feel torn\u2014should I spend on the cleaner to keep my job and reputation intact, or hold back every penny for the family\u2019s future? The pressure from both sides squeezes my chest, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
