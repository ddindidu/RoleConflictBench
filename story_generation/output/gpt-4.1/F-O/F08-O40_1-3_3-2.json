My daughter had called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandchildren missed my stories and homemade cookies. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter echoing through the house. But as I set down the phone, my eyes fell on the work order pinned to the fridge. Tomorrow, I was scheduled to begin a major project at the site\u2014new beams, heavy lifting, and strict safety checks before anything else. As the lead carpenter, everyone counted on me to inspect every tool, every harness, to keep the crew safe. If I skipped even a step, someone could get hurt. The pressure pressed in from both sides: my family expecting my warmth and presence, my team relying on my diligence and caution. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give less to either."}
