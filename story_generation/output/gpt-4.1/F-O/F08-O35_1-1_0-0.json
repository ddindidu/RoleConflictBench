My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I need advice about starting high school.\u201d My heart swelled\u2014she rarely reached out like this.

The systems weren\u2019t critical, but skipping the routine could mean missing a small issue that might grow into a bigger problem later.
