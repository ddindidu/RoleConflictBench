My screens were clear, no holding patterns, no congestion\u2014just the hum of machines and the city lights blinking below. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a message from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about my exam.\u201d I knew how much this final meant to him, how he\u2019d been struggling with anxiety for weeks. As his sibling, I wanted to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay. But as an air traffic controller, I was expected to be alert, undistracted, ready for anything, even in these quiet hours. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to lose focus, not even for a minute.\u201d I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to call my brother and the responsibility to keep the skies safe, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
