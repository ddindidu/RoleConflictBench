We needed to talk\u2014really talk\u2014about the medical bills piling up, about whether we could afford the surgery. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for honesty, for the kind of open conversation we\u2019d promised each other. But my radio crackled, and I glanced at the crowded shoreline. High tide was rolling in, and the waves were rougher than usual. Every instinct screamed at me to keep my eyes on the water, to scan for the flash of a raised hand or a struggling swimmer. My partner\u2019s voice trembled, asking for answers, for reassurance, but my gaze kept darting to the beach. I felt torn in two\u2014one part desperate to be present, to share my fears and hopes, the other unable to let go of the responsibility for every life in the surf. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I could feel myself fraying, caught between the person I loved and the people who depended on me to keep them safe."}
