They barely looked up when I greeted them, and I could feel the heaviness in the air. I wanted to sit down, ask them what was wrong, and just be there for them like a good daughter should. But my mind kept drifting back to the pool. Earlier, I\u2019d seen a few chairs out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standards I was supposed to maintain as a lifeguard. My supervisor had been clear: every detail mattered, and I was responsible for the facility\u2019s order. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, my parents\u2019 quiet sadness pulling at me while the nagging thought of those misaligned chairs tugged at my sense of duty. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both expectations pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
