My mother looked at me, her eyes hopeful. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us this time, right?\u201d she asked. I nodded, feeling the warmth of belonging, the comfort of being a brother who shows up. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the pharmacy. Tomorrow, I was scheduled to fill a high-risk chemotherapy prescription. The margin for error was razor-thin; one slip could mean disaster for a patient who trusted me with their life. My family\u2019s voices faded into the background as I pictured the vials, the calculations, the double-checking. I wanted to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but the weight of my responsibility as a pharmacist pressed down on me. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation impossible to ignore. I stared at my hands, torn between the safety of a patient and the happiness of my family, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
