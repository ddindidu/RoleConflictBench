She always wanted to know how my day was going, and I\u2019d promised to keep her updated, especially after she\u2019d worried so much about me working at the pool. I glanced at the screen\u2014three unread messages, all from her, asking if I\u2019d eaten lunch and how my shift was going. I knew she\u2019d be anxious if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But as I looked up, I noticed a swimmer in the middle lane, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly above the water. My training kicked in: eyes on the pool, ready to react. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my mom\u2019s expectation for constant communication pulling me one way, my responsibility as a lifeguard demanding my full attention the other. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between reaching for my phone and keeping my gaze locked on the struggling swimmer, caught in the impossible space between being a good daughter and a vigilant lifeguard."}
