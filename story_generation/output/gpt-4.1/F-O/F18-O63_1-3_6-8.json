Mom always says, \u201cLook out for each other,\u201d and I take that seriously, especially since the shortcut we take crosses a busy intersection. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my telemarketing shift starts in five minutes. I\u2019m supposed to log in from home, but we\u2019re still ten minutes away. The compliance system at work is strict; even a minute late, and I\u2019ll get flagged. Too many flags, and I could lose my job. My brother skips ahead, not noticing the light is about to change. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014do I rush him, maybe risk his safety, just to make it home in time to log in? Or do I slow down, keep him close, and risk another warning at work? My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations: be a good sibling, be a reliable employee. The crosswalk signal blinks, and I freeze, torn between two worlds that won\u2019t wait for me to choose."}
