My mother had already called twice, reminding me how important it was to be there, how my presence meant upholding our family\u2019s traditions. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a meal, it\u2019s who we are.\u201d But as I scrolled through my emails, a reminder popped up for the national continuing education seminar\u2014mandatory for pharmacists, scheduled for the same evening. Missing it would mean falling behind on the latest treatments, risking my license, and letting down my patients and colleagues. My heart pounded as I imagined my family\u2019s disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, the empty seat at the table, the questions. At the same time, I pictured my supervisor\u2019s raised eyebrow, the subtle judgment from peers if I missed the seminar. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by expectations I couldn\u2019t ignore, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
