Call us when you can.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised I\u2019d be better about staying in touch. But just as I start to type a reply, my assistant knocks, dropping a thick file onto my desk. It\u2019s for a procedural hearing\u2014nothing complicated, but the expectation is clear: I need to review every detail, no matter how routine, to uphold the integrity of my role as a judge. I stare at the file, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both responsibilities. My parents want to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, and I want to reassure them. But the file sits there, a silent demand for my attention, reminding me that diligence is not optional in my position. My mind races, torn between the warmth of family and the gravity of justice, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
