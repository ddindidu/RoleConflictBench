She asked about my day, her eyes searching for more than the usual, and I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the weight I\u2019d been carrying. I wanted to tell her everything, to be the husband who communicates, who doesn\u2019t hide behind tired smiles and vague answers. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another alert from the lab. The spectrometer was acting up, and if I didn\u2019t address it soon, there could be a dangerous leak. My team was counting on me to keep everyone safe, to maintain the equipment and protocols. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: the need to be present and honest at home, and the responsibility to prevent a potential disaster at work. My heart pounded as I looked at my wife, then at my phone, torn between the two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
