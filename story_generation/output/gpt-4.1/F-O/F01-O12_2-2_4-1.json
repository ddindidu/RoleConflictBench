My daughter had called earlier, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. But as I stared at the code on my screen, red flags blinked back at me from the review tool.
