It was my mom, as usual, checking in to see how my day was going. I\u2019d promised her and Dad that I\u2019d always keep in touch, answer their messages quickly, and let them know I was safe. It was our daily ritual, a way to keep them from worrying. But right now, I was standing in front of a car that belonged to an elderly man who\u2019d parked illegally, but only because he was rushing his sick wife into the pharmacy. Technically, I had every right to issue the ticket, but my training as a police officer emphasized fairness and using discretion when the situation called for it. My supervisor expected me to uphold the rules, but also to act with compassion. I could feel the weight of my phone in my hand, my mother\u2019s message waiting for a reply, and the ticket book in the other, the old man watching me anxiously. I was torn between the urge to respond to my mom immediately, as a good son should, and the responsibility to make a fair decision as a police officer."}
