Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone. It\u2019s important we\u2019re all together.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, and I knew how much these gatherings meant to her. As the oldest sister, I was expected to set an example, to show up and help keep the family close. But my delivery app pinged at the same time, assigning me a last-minute package drop across town. The customer\u2019s note was strict: \u201cPlease make sure the package is hidden and safe. Call me after delivery.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my boss expected reliability, and customers counted on me to keep their things secure. I glanced at the clock, calculating if I could do both, but the delivery window overlapped with dinner. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my mother\u2019s eyes against the risk of a bad review and letting down my team. Torn between being the dependable sister and the responsible delivery person, I sat in my car, keys in hand, unable to move."}
