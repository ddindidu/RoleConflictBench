My heart aches a little; this tradition means everything to my parents, and I know how much they count on me to be there, to uphold what our family has always done. But as I stand in the break room, the supervisor\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts, calling all operators to the mandatory pre-shift briefing. There\u2019s a new set of operational protocols, and attendance is non-negotiable. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, risking passenger safety. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectations pulling me home, the responsibility of my job demanding my focus. My hands tremble as I try to decide which role I can afford to let down, knowing that either choice will leave someone disappointed, maybe even myself."}
