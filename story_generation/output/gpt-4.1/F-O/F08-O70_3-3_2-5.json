The address was across town, and the package was marked \u201chigh value\u2014recipient must sign.\u201d I glanced at the clock, calculating the time it would take to get there and back. Just then, my granddaughter, Emma, walked in, her eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. I could see she needed me\u2014not just as her grandmother, but as someone who could listen and guide her through whatever storm she was facing.\n\nBut the delivery app pinged again, reminding me of the strict deadline and the company\u2019s policy: no late or missed deliveries, especially with sensitive packages. If I left now, I\u2019d make it on time, keep my job secure, and avoid disappointing my supervisor. If I stayed, I could be the grandmother Emma needed, offering comfort and wisdom when she was most vulnerable. My heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I stood frozen, torn between duty and love, not knowing which path to choose."}
