As a judge, I was expected to write a thorough and well-reasoned judgment for the trial I\u2019d just concluded. The law demanded clarity, precision, and timeliness\u2014my order was due in thirty days, and the parties deserved nothing less. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the looming home loan repayment. In two months, a hefty sum would be due, and I needed to ensure our finances were in order. My wife had already voiced her worries about the budget, and my children depended on me for stability. Every hour I spent crafting legal opinions was an hour I couldn\u2019t use to review our finances, seek advice, or perhaps find ways to supplement our income. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to the court and my responsibility to my family. I stared at the blank page, heart pounding, torn between the demands of justice and the needs of those I loved most."}
