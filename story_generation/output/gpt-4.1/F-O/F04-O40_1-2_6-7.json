It was my younger sister, inviting me to join her and some friends for dinner at her favorite restaurant. She sounded excited, and I knew she wanted me there\u2014not just as her brother, but as someone she could count on to show up and be part of her life. I promised her I\u2019d try, but as soon as I hung up, another call came in. This time, it was a homeowner whose deck I\u2019d inspected last week. The damage was worse than I thought, and he needed it fixed tonight before his family\u2019s big gathering tomorrow. He was counting on me, and I could hear the urgency in his voice. I stood in my workshop, torn between the expectation to be a present, supportive brother and the responsibility to deliver quality work as a carpenter. My mind raced, weighing the disappointment my sister might feel if I didn\u2019t show up against the trust the homeowner placed in me. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which role I should honor tonight."}
