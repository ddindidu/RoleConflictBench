I see my mom\u2019s name flash on the screen\u2014she\u2019s probably waiting for my daily update, wanting to know if I\u2019ve eaten, how my day is going, if I\u2019m safe. I know she expects a quick reply, maybe even a photo, and I can already imagine her worry growing with every minute I don\u2019t respond. But the travelers are waving, already opening the trunk, and I know I need to help them load their bags, greet them with a smile, and make sure their ride is smooth and professional. They\u2019re discussing how to split the fare, and I need to pay attention, answer their questions, and keep things moving. My phone vibrates again, more insistent this time. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my parents\u2019 need for connection pulling me one way, my duty to my passengers pulling me another. I stand there, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds, my heart pounding as I try to decide which expectation to meet first."}
