Can you pick up some food? We\u2019re short on cash again.\u201d The weight of being a step-parent pressed on me\u2014I knew the kids would be hungry tonight, and it was my responsibility to keep the household running. As I tried to focus on the tracks ahead, a shrill alarm blared through the control panel. The passenger emergency alarm. My heart raced. I glanced at the monitor and saw a crowd gathering around someone slumped on a seat. Protocol demanded I stop the train, call for medical help, and assist the passenger. But every minute I spent here meant less time to pick up groceries before the store closed, less chance to stretch our dwindling funds. My mind spun between the urgent needs of a stranger and the hungry faces waiting at home. I gripped the controls, torn between the duty to my passengers and the promise I\u2019d made to my family."}
