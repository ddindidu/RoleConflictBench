Two months left, and the numbers in my bank account didn\u2019t add up to security. As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my family depended on me to keep a roof over our heads. I needed every delivery, every tip, to make it work. \n\nToday, I was running late. The next customer was already waiting at the door, arms crossed, impatience written all over her face. As a delivery person, I was expected to greet her with a smile, apologize for the delay, and remain calm no matter how she spoke to me. But my mind was racing with worries about the loan, the bills, and the possibility of letting my family down. I could feel frustration bubbling up, threatening to spill over into my voice. I took a deep breath, package in hand, and walked up to the door, torn between the need to be professional and the anxiety gnawing at me as a father."}
