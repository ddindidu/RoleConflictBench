The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I needed every extra shift I could get. My wife and I had talked about it last night\u2014how important it was to keep our finances steady for the kids\u2019 sake. As I handed a customer their prescription, another patient approached, asking about over-the-counter pain relief. I gave a quick, standard answer, hoping it was enough. But as she walked away, I saw her hesitate, uncertainty in her eyes. Guilt twisted in my chest. As a pharmacist, I was supposed to offer thorough counseling, to make sure every patient left with confidence and understanding. But every minute I spent with one patient meant less time to fill prescriptions, less efficiency, and fewer opportunities to take on extra hours. I felt torn, caught between the need to provide for my family and the duty to care for my patients. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood there, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
