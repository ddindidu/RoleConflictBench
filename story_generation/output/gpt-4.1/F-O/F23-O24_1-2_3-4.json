I knew I should gently remind her to clean up, to reinforce the importance of responsibility and respect for our shared space. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does\u2014guides, teaches, sets boundaries. But my mind kept drifting to the thick file on my desk upstairs, the one from the bench trial I\u2019d just concluded. Thirty days to write a clear, thorough judgment, and the clock was already ticking. The parties were waiting, their futures hanging on my words. I felt the weight of the court\u2019s expectation pressing down on me, demanding focus and precision. Yet here, in this kitchen, another kind of expectation tugged at me\u2014a promise to be present, to nurture, to help shape a young life. My heart twisted as I tried to balance both worlds, feeling the pull of duty in two directions, each urgent, each important, and utterly incompatible in this moment."}
