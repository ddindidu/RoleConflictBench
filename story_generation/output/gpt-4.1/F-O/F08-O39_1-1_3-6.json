Family gathering, it read, and I could almost hear her excited voice asking if I\u2019d bring my famous apple pie. My daughter had called twice already, reminding me how much it meant to everyone that I be there, especially since I missed the last one. I wanted nothing more than to sit with them, to listen to stories and laughter, to be the grandmother they needed.\n\nBut at work, a new notice was taped to the break room wall: optional safety training, next Sunday. The foreman said it would help us all work smarter, safer, and those who attended would be first in line for overtime shifts. I knew how important it was to show commitment, to be seen as reliable, especially as one of the few women on the crew. My coworkers were already talking about who\u2019d be there, and I felt the pressure to prove myself, to not let the team down.\n\nI sat at the kitchen table, torn between the warmth of my family and the hard-earned respect at the site, my heart heavy with the weight of both worlds."}
