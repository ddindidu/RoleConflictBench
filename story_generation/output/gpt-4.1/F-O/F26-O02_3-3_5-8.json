My phone buzzed again\u2014my daughter\u2019s message, urgent: \u201cMom, can you come over? We really need you.\u201d My grandson was sick, and my daughter sounded overwhelmed. I knew how much my presence meant to them, especially now. But the email from my manager was just as pressing: \u201cClient needs your estimates by noon. Contract depends on it.\u201d The team was waiting for my numbers, and the client\u2019s entire project timeline hinged on my input. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed comfort and support, but my colleagues needed my expertise and reliability. I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s cough through the phone, but the spreadsheet on my screen demanded my focus. My heart pulled me one way, my professional duty the other. I closed my eyes, torn between the warmth of family and the cold logic of deadlines, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
