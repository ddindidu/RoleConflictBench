I glanced at the screen\u2014my sister\u2019s name flashed, followed by a desperate text: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d My heart squeezed. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious.\n\nBut as I reached for the next bottle, I realized the specialized cleaner for the marble counters was gone. Mrs. Lee had emphasized how important it was to use only that product, and she expected everything to be perfect for her dinner party tonight. I was supposed to manage the supplies, make sure nothing ran out, and now I\u2019d failed. My mind raced\u2014should I call my sister back right away, or rush out to buy the cleaner before Mrs. Lee noticed?\n\nI could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: my sister\u2019s need for support, and my responsibility to my job. My hands trembled as I stood in the supply closet, torn between the two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
