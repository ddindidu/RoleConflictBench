My stepkids\u2019 school let out at 3:00, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there at the gate, waving, just like the other parents. But the lunch rush at the grocery store was in full swing, and the line at my register snaked past the candy aisle. Mrs. Patel, a regular, chatted about her grandson\u2019s soccer game as I scanned her groceries, and I forced a smile, trying to keep my voice warm and friendly. My manager glanced over, eyebrows raised, silently reminding me that customer service comes first. My phone buzzed in my apron pocket\u2014probably a reminder from my partner about pick-up. I felt the pressure building, the expectation to be the reliable, loving step-parent, and the dependable, cheerful cashier. I could feel my heart pounding, torn between the kids waiting for me at school and the customers expecting my undivided attention. I tried to focus on the next customer, but my mind kept drifting to the schoolyard, imagining my stepkids searching the crowd for my face."}
