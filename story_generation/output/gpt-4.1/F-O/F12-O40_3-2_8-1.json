He wanted us to talk openly, to lay everything on the table, but my mind kept drifting back to the workshop. I\u2019d left in a rush, sawdust everywhere, tools scattered, and a half-finished cabinet teetering on the edge of my workbench. I knew the safety protocols by heart\u2014never leave a mess, always secure your tools\u2014but I\u2019d ignored them, desperate to get home in time for this conversation. Now, as my husband waited for my honest thoughts, I felt torn. He needed my full attention, my openness, but the image of that cluttered shop gnawed at me. What if someone got hurt because I hadn\u2019t done my job right? My heart pounded with guilt and worry, caught between the need to be a good wife and the responsibility of being a careful carpenter. I opened my mouth to speak, but the words tangled with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
