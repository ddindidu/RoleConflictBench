It means a lot to her.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how important it was to uphold our family traditions. My laptop chimed with a new email from my manager, subject line urgent: \u201cNeed your time estimates for the Q1 project plan by tonight.\u201d I knew the team was waiting on me, and management needed my input to finalize the roadmap.

I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, each pulling me in a different direction, unsure which responsibility I should honor first."}
