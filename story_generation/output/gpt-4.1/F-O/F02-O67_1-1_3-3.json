My phone was on, just in case dispatch called, but for now, I was home. My son, Ethan, wandered in, dragging his feet and mumbling under his breath. I noticed he hadn\u2019t greeted me or his mother, and he left his shoes in the middle of the hallway again. As a father, I knew I should stop what I was doing, call him over, and talk to him about respect and responsibility\u2014remind him of the importance of manners and discipline. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t afford to lose focus; a missing or expired item in the kit could mean the difference between life and death for someone later tonight. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention. My hands hovered over the kit, my eyes flicking between the scattered medical supplies and my son\u2019s retreating figure, torn between the duty to my family and the duty to my patients."}
