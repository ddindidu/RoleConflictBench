They needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice. Their boss had offered a promotion, but it came with strings attached, and they were desperate for someone to talk to. I reached for their hand, wanting to be the supportive spouse they deserved, to listen and help them sort through their tangled thoughts.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the networking event starts in thirty minutes.\u201d I was expected to be there, to mingle, to represent my firm. At the event, a friendly acquaintance leaned in, lowering their voice. \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re working on that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d The question was casual, but the expectation was clear\u2014they wanted details, gossip, maybe even a hint of inside information.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My partner needed my undivided attention and empathy, but my professional life demanded discretion and presence. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the confidant my spouse needed and the ethical lawyer my clients trusted."}
