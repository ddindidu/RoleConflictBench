Mom made your favorite.\u201d Tonight was our family dinner, a rare chance for all of us to be together. As a brother, I knew how much it meant to them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. But as I sat in my chambers, the bail hearing had just ended, and the defendant\u2019s lawyer was waiting outside, anxious for the release order. The defendant couldn\u2019t leave custody until I drafted and signed the detailed conditions. My clerk reminded me of the urgency\u2014any delay meant another night in jail for someone who might not deserve it. My family expected my presence, laughter, and stories at the table. The court demanded my focus, precision, and immediate action. I stared at the blank order on my screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, torn between the warmth of home and the cold responsibility of the bench."}
