She dropped her backpack and tried to slip past me, but I could see she was holding back tears. I knew she needed me\u2014she always did after a rough day at school. I reached out, ready to listen, to be the big brother she could lean on. Just then, my radio crackled to life: a call for an ambulance, a broken bone, only a few miles away but traffic was already building up. My heart pounded. I was expected to be there fast, to help someone in pain, but my sister needed me too. I could see her waiting, hoping I\u2019d stay, while the dispatcher\u2019s voice pressed urgency into my ear. I stood frozen, torn between the duty to my family and the responsibility to a stranger, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
