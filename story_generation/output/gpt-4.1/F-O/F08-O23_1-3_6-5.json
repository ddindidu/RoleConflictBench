Every year, I\u2019m the one who brings everyone together, the grandmother who listens, who remembers everyone\u2019s favorite treat, who makes sure no one feels left out. This year, though, my mind is elsewhere. My briefcase sits by the door, packed for the trial that starts tomorrow\u2014a case I\u2019ve spent months preparing for, with a client whose future depends on my focus and presence in court. The judge has made it clear: no delays, no excuses. My heart aches as I picture my grandchildren\u2019s faces, expecting me at the table, while my client expects me to fight for them with everything I have. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
