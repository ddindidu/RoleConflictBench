My younger brother wanted to go hiking, and my parents hoped I\u2019d finally join them after weeks of missed outings. I smiled, nodding along, feeling the warmth of belonging. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from the hospital. One of my patients, a woman with a complicated autoimmune disease, needed her medication adjusted immediately. The pharmacy was calling for my approval, and the treatment plan was delicate; any delay could put her at risk. My mother\u2019s eyes met mine, hopeful, as she asked if I\u2019d be free this Saturday. I felt the weight of their expectation, the longing to be present as a sister, but also the pressing responsibility as a doctor. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of family and the duty to my patient, both needing me in ways that felt impossible to reconcile."}
