They needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my encouragement, my advice. Their boss had just offered them a promotion, but it meant longer hours and more stress. I reached for their hand, trying to listen, to be present, to offer the support they deserved. But my phone buzzed. The salon was short-staffed today, and I was already running late. As I hurried in, a regular client walked through the door, her face lighting up when she saw me. The receptionist was free, but the client expected my warm greeting, my personal touch. I could see her waiting, hoping for that familiar connection. My mind was still with my partner, replaying their anxious words, but my hands were expected to be steady, my smile genuine. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
