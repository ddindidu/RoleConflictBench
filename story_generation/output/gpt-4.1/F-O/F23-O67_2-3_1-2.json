My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about Mia\u2019s open class at school. She\u2019d asked me twice if I\u2019d be there, her eyes searching for reassurance. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. The school expected parents to show up, to be present, especially for kids like Mia who needed to know their new family cared.\n\nJust as I was about to leave for the school, the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through: \u201cAll units, multi-vehicle collision, Highway 17, possible fatalities. Immediate response needed.\u201d My heart pounded. The city counted on me to be fast, to save lives. Every second mattered. But Mia would be scanning the classroom door, waiting for me to walk in, hoping I\u2019d keep my word.\n\nI gripped the steering wheel, torn. The weight of two worlds pressed down on me\u2014one where I was a lifeline for strangers, another where I was supposed to be a lifeline for my own family. I stared at the dashboard, caught between the wail of sirens and the silent plea of a little girl."}
