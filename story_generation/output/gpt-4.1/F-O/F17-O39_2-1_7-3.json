My father\u2019s voice was softer than usual, his shoulders slumped. I knew they needed me to sit with them, to listen, to offer the kind of comfort that only family can give. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my shift at the construction site was ending. I was responsible for sweeping up my section, making sure every nail and scrap was cleared away. If I left early, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be letting my crew down. My parents needed me at home, but my team needed me at work. I stood in the doorway, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached to be the child my parents needed, but my hands itched with the responsibility of the broom waiting for me at the site."}
