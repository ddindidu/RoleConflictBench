I force a smile as the next customer slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about a missing discount. My mind races, not just with her complaint, but with the memory of my son\u2019s hopeful eyes this morning. I promised him a Nintendo for Christmas, but the bills are piling up, and my paycheck barely stretches. As a father, I want to keep my word, to see his face light up, to give him something special. But as a cashier, I have to stay calm, polite, and efficient, even as the woman\u2019s anger rises and the line grows longer. My heart aches with the weight of both roles\u2014my son\u2019s happiness on one side, my duty to my job and the need to keep it on the other. I can\u2019t let my frustration show, but inside, I\u2019m torn, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the father I want to be and the employee I have to be."}
