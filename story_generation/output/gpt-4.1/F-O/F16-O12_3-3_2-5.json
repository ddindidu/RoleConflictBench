My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my partner, who was struggling through a storm of grief after losing a close friend. They needed me, not just in passing, but truly present: to listen, to hold them, to reassure them that things would be okay. I wanted nothing more than to close my laptop and be by their side.\n\nBut Slack was exploding with pings. The product manager was asking for my input on a critical feature, and architects from two other teams were waiting for my decisions before they could move forward. The launch date had been moved up, and everyone was looking to me to unblock the process. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, the urgency in their messages impossible to ignore.\n\nMy heart ached with the pull in both directions. I was needed at home, and I was needed at work. I stared at the screen, torn, the demands of both worlds colliding inside me."}
