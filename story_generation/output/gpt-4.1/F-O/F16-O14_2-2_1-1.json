She twisted her wedding ring, voice trembling as she described the impossible choice her boss had given her\u2014take on a risky project or risk being sidelined. I could see how much she needed me, needed reassurance, a sounding board, someone to tell her she was strong enough to handle whatever came next. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the lab\u2019s specialized equipment was available for only a few hours, and my experiment\u2014months in the making\u2014depended on this window.
