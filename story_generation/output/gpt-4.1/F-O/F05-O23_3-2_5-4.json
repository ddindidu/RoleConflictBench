She\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d help make the house perfect. But as I reached for the vacuum, my phone buzzed: a reminder about the court hearing in two hours. My client\u2019s case is hanging by a thread, and I know how much he\u2019s counting on me to be sharp, prepared, and present in that courtroom. I can\u2019t let him down; his livelihood is at stake. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore the look on my wife\u2019s face, the silent plea for partnership at home. My mind races, torn between the duty to my client and the promise to my wife. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand in the hallway, paralyzed, the vacuum in one hand and my briefcase in the other, heart pounding as I try to figure out which role I must let down."}
