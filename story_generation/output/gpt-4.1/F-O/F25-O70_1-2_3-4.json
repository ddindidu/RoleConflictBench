As a delivery person, I was supposed to get a signature for anything over fifty dollars, no exceptions. But today, the address on the label was my own house\u2014my stepmother\u2019s name printed in bold. Inside, I could hear laughter and the clatter of dishes; the family was gathered for our annual holiday lunch, a tradition I was expected to honor as a step-child. My stepmother always said, \u201cFamily comes first, especially on days like this.\u201d But my supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts, no favors. Treat every delivery the same.\u201d I hesitated, knowing that if I rang the bell and asked for a signature in my uniform, I\u2019d be seen as an outsider, not a family member. If I just left the package, I\u2019d be breaking company policy. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between being the dutiful step-child who didn\u2019t disrupt family harmony and the responsible delivery person who followed the rules."}
