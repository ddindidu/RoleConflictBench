My shift is almost over, but I know I need to stay late to earn the overtime pay. Every extra hour means a little more security for my family. As I prepare a prescription for Mr. Lee, a regular with a complicated list of medications, I feel the weight of responsibility pressing down. One mistake could harm him, and I can\u2019t afford to be distracted. But my phone buzzes with a message from home: my daughter\u2019s fever has spiked, and my husband is asking if I can come home early. My hands tremble as I count the pills, torn between the need to provide for my family and the duty to ensure my patient\u2019s safety. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I feel the familiar ache of guilt and anxiety. I close my eyes for a moment, caught in the impossible space between being a good mother and a careful pharmacist, knowing I have to choose which role to honor right now."}
