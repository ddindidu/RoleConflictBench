Grandpa expects you to lead the blessing.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but firm, reminding me of the importance of tradition. I glanced at the clock\u2014just a few hours left before I needed to leave. \n\nJust then, an assistant from another department knocked on my door, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential file. \u201cIt\u2019ll save us so much time if you just send it over,\u201d she said, her tone casual. But I knew she wasn\u2019t authorized. My mind raced: as a lawyer, I was bound by strict ethical rules. No shortcuts, no matter how small. \n\nBut the pressure from home tugged at me. If I delayed, I\u2019d be late for dinner, disappointing my family and breaking a tradition that meant so much to them. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s trust in me as their child, and my duty to my clients and the law. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
