Today was the day of my family\u2019s annual blessing ceremony, a tradition my father insisted I help lead. He\u2019d called me that morning, his voice full of pride and expectation, reminding me how important it was to honor our heritage. I promised I\u2019d be there, but as the ceremony time approached, the pool grew crowded. Kids darted in and out of the shallow end, some without parents nearby. My supervisor had drilled into me that safety came first\u2014no exceptions. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my family counting on me to uphold our traditions, my duty as a lifeguard demanding my full attention. My heart pounded as I watched a group of unsupervised children giggling near the water\u2019s edge, while my phone buzzed with messages from home, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility to keep everyone safe."}
