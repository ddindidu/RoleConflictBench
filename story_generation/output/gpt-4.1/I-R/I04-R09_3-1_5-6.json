It was Sarah, her voice trembling, telling me her car had broken down on the highway. She was alone, scared, and needed me to come get her right away. My heart raced. As her friend, I knew she counted on me, especially in moments like this. But tonight was Shabbat, and I had promised myself\u2014and my community\u2014that I would attend services, as I always did. I could already picture the familiar faces, the warmth of the prayers, the sense of belonging. Yet, I also imagined Sarah, stranded and anxious, waiting for me to answer her call for help. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each tugging me in a different direction. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the comfort of tradition and the urgency of friendship, feeling the conflict twist inside me as I tried to decide what to do."}
