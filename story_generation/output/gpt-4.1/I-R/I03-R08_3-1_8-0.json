Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even be together. As his girlfriend, I felt the weight of responsibility to reach out, to fix things, to not let our love slip away over harsh words and stubborn pride. My heart ached with the urge to call him, to apologize, to resolve the conflict before it grew any deeper.\n\nBut tonight was also the one evening this week with no obligations, a rare moment I had set aside to recite and reflect on the Quran. As a Muslim, I knew how much I needed this time for spiritual grounding, to reconnect with my faith and find peace within myself. The Quran lay open on my desk, its verses calling me to pause, to breathe, to seek guidance.\n\nTorn between the demands of my relationship and my faith, I stared at the phone in my hand, my mind racing with guilt and longing, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
