As I passed the benches, I noticed Sarah, someone I know from work, sitting alone, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. Instinctively, I slowed down. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to approach her, offer comfort, and be the friendly presence she might need right now. But the temple bell echoed in the distance, reminding me of my commitment as a Buddhist to join the community in our nightly practice. The expectation to be present, to contribute my voice and energy to the ceremony, weighed on me. I stood there, torn between the urge to sit beside Sarah and the sense of duty drawing me toward the temple. My heart ached with the tension\u2014one path meant possibly letting down my community, the other meant turning away from someone in pain. I hesitated, caught in the space between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
