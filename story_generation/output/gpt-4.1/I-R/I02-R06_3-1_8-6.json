The argument from earlier still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, and the threat of breaking up hanging in the air. As her boyfriend, I knew I was supposed to step up, resolve this, and fight for us. She expected me to be strong, to fix what was broken between us, to not let things fall apart. But my heart ached with the weight of my other role. As a Christian, I was taught to show love and kindness, to forgive, to be gentle even when I was hurt. I remembered how I tried to offer small gestures\u2014making her coffee, listening to her worries, holding her hand when she was anxious. Now, I felt torn. If I pushed too hard to resolve things, would I be loving, or just desperate? If I let go, would I be kind, or just weak? The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, wrestling with what to do next, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
