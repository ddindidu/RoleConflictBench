As a colleague, I knew my input was crucial\u2014my team counted on me to be present, to help steer us in the right direction. My phone buzzed just as I was gathering my notes. It was a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was in tears, her words trembling through the screen: her husband had just left, and she didn\u2019t know how to face her children or her own fears. She needed me, not just as a friend, but as her pastor\u2014someone to listen, to offer hope, to be there in her darkest hour. My heart twisted. I could almost hear the voices from both worlds: my team expecting my professional commitment, Maria needing my spiritual support. I stared at the meeting invite on my screen, then at Maria\u2019s desperate message, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
