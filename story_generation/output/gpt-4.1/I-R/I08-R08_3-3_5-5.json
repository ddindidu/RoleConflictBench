I had made sure my clothes were modest and clean, as is expected of me as a Muslim, especially on this important day. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Samir, an old acquaintance. His message was urgent\u2014his car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed help right away. I could almost hear the anxiety in his words. As an acquaintance, I knew I should go to him, offer support, maybe even drive out to help. But the call to prayer was moments away, and I was standing at the threshold of the prayer hall, where my presence was expected and my attire mattered. My heart pounded as I weighed the pull of duty to a friend against my religious obligations. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my immediate attention, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds."}
