She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with her boss, and the feedback had been harsher than she expected. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and comfort her, to show her that she wasn\u2019t alone. She leaned into me, her voice trembling as she asked if I could stay with her all afternoon, maybe watch a movie or just talk. I nodded, but my mind drifted to the church service starting in an hour. I hadn\u2019t been to Sunday worship in weeks, and I knew I was missing more than just a routine\u2014I missed the sense of peace, the community, the connection with God. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: Mia needed me now, but so did my faith. I could almost hear my pastor\u2019s gentle reminder about the importance of worship and fellowship, but Mia\u2019s quiet sobs pulled me back. My heart ached, torn between being the boyfriend she needed and the Christian I wanted to be."}
