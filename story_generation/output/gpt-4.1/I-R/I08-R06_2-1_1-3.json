As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to be welcoming, to approach her with a smile and gentle questions, to help her feel at ease. I knew how much it meant to be included, especially in a room full of strangers.

My Christian faith urged me to be present in worship, to join the community I cherished and deepen my relationship with God.
