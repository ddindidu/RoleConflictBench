I replayed our conversation in my mind, realizing too late how my offhand comment must have sounded. As his friend, I knew I needed to call him immediately, to apologize and talk it through before the misunderstanding grew. But just as I reached for my phone, the church office door creaked open. Mrs. Evans stepped in, her face pale and eyes rimmed red. She was in the middle of a crisis, desperate for spiritual guidance, and I was the only pastor available. She needed me to listen, to offer wisdom and comfort, and I could see the weight of her decision pressing down on her. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my friend, who needed honesty and care, and toward my calling, where someone\u2019s faith and future might hang in the balance. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn by the impossible demands of being both a good friend and a faithful pastor."}
