As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show my commitment to the project and my team. But my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder from my Buddhist teacher: I was to summarize tomorrow\u2019s temple session, distilling the essence of the teachings we\u2019d been studying for weeks. This was more than a task; it was a responsibility to my spiritual community, a chance to deepen my own understanding and help others do the same.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions. If I missed the meeting, I\u2019d let my team down and risk falling behind. If I skipped my study and reflection, I\u2019d be unprepared for the temple session, betraying the trust my teacher placed in me. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my workplace and the quiet call of my spiritual path. I sat at my desk, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
