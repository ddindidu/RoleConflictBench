She looked worried\u2014her voice trembled as she asked if I could receive her package. She had to leave for work, and her deliveries always seemed to arrive when she was out. I nodded, knowing how much she relied on me for these small favors. Just as she left, my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. There was a funeral prayer in an hour, and they were one person short for the minyan. He pleaded with me to come; without a quorum, the prayer couldn\u2019t proceed, and the grieving family would be left without the comfort of tradition. I felt the weight of both requests. If I left for the synagogue, Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s package might be stolen or lost. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community and a mourning family. My heart pounded as I stood in my hallway, torn between being a good neighbor and fulfilling my religious duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both."}
