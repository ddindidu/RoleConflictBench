As always, I greeted him with a warm smile and a polite \u201cGood morning.\u201d He returned the gesture, and we exchanged a few pleasantries before heading our separate ways. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u2014friendly, respectful, never intrusive. But today, as I walked past his door, I overheard a heated conversation inside. Through the slightly ajar door, I caught a glimpse of Mr. Sharma handing over an envelope stuffed with cash to a man I didn\u2019t recognize. Their words\u2014\u201cNo one will find out, just make sure the paperwork disappears\u201d\u2014sent a chill down my spine. \n\nAs a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and integrity, and to stand against wrongdoing.
