The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and inspiration\u2014something to help them navigate the week ahead. As a pastor, I felt the weight of their trust, the responsibility to teach principles that would truly matter in their lives. But my mind kept drifting to my other role, that of a mentee. My mentor had always encouraged me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in a theological article. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew the expectation: communicate promptly, don\u2019t let confusion fester.\n\nYet, I hesitated. Should I pause my sermon preparation to email my mentor about this minor terminology? Would that be responsible, or a distraction from my pastoral duty? The congregation needed my focus, but my mentor expected openness. I felt the tension rising, torn between the need to be a diligent mentee and a devoted pastor, both roles pulling me in different directions as the clock ticked on."}
