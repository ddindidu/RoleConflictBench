As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show that I was invested in our shared goals. But at the same time, my other life tugged at me. As the parish priest, I was responsible for leading the weekly religious education class for the children. Parents trusted me to guide their kids, and the children looked forward to our time together. Canceling or rescheduling would disappoint them and disrupt the rhythm of our small community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. My mind raced, torn between loyalty to my colleagues and my commitment to my parish. I could feel the tension building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
