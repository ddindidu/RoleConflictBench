The quarterly report was due next week, and though I had built in extra time, I knew my team expected me to keep pace. We prided ourselves on reliability, and I didn\u2019t want to be the one to slow things down, even if the project could technically wait. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from the parish secretary: a family needed a last-minute preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament, happening this weekend. It was the final, crucial step, and they were counting on me to guide them. I could picture the child\u2019s anxious face, the parents\u2019 hope. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues trusted me to deliver, to be present and dependable. My parishioners needed me to lead, to nurture their faith at a pivotal moment. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the quiet demands of my office and the urgent call of my ministry, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
