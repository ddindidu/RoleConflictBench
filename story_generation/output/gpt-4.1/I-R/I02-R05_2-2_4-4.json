Just us.\u201d My heart lifts\u2014this is our only evening together before I leave for the conference. She\u2019s been patient with my schedule, and I promised her this night. But as I set the phone down, my email pings. It\u2019s the synagogue board: a reminder that I\u2019m leading the children\u2019s Torah class tonight, as I do every week. There\u2019s no one else to cover; the parents expect me, and the kids look forward to our sessions. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. Rachel\u2019s face flashes in my mind, hopeful and trusting. Then I picture the circle of children, waiting for stories and guidance. I want to be the boyfriend who keeps his word, who makes her feel cherished. But I\u2019m also the rabbi, responsible for nurturing young souls. My chest tightens as I realize I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The clock ticks, and I sit frozen, torn between love and duty, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be disappointed."}
