The air was cool, and I felt a sense of calm, ready to guide everyone into mindfulness. Just as I reached the entrance, I saw Maya, an old acquaintance from college, sitting on the steps, her face streaked with tears. She looked up, eyes red and searching, and I felt her need for comfort. As an acquaintance, I knew I should sit beside her, offer a listening ear, and be present for her pain. But the clock was ticking\u2014our meditation group would be gathering inside any minute, expecting me to lead them in stillness and focus. My Buddhist practice called for mindfulness, to be present in the moment, but also to fulfill my commitment to the group. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of Maya\u2019s sorrow and the silent anticipation of the meditators inside. My heart ached with the pull of both roles, unsure which path to follow."}
