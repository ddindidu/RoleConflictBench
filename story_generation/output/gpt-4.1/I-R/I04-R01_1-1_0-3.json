Everything feels pointless.\u201d As his friend, I knew he needed me to listen, maybe even call and let him vent. I could picture him slumped on his couch, waiting for someone to care. At the same time, my mind flashed to Mrs. Evans, a quiet member of our congregation. I\u2019d heard she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in tonight. Both needed support, but in different ways\u2014Mark wanted a friend, Mrs. Evans needed her pastor. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I called Mark, would I be neglecting my pastoral duty? If I reached out to Mrs. Evans first, would I be letting down my friend? My heart ached, torn between the expectations of friendship and the calling of ministry, unsure which need should come first."}
