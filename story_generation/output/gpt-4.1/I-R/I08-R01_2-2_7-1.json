She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but Mark seemed to expect me to join in, to nod or at least offer some agreement. \n\nLater that afternoon, as I was preparing for my next meeting, a member of my congregation called, her voice trembling. She was facing a difficult life choice and needed spiritual guidance. As her pastor, I was expected to listen deeply, offer wisdom, and help her find peace in her decision. \n\nThe two moments collided in my mind. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, the pressure to maintain friendly rapport with Mark without betraying my values, and on the other, the weight of being a spiritual guide, always expected to rise above petty talk and offer compassion. My heart ached as I wrestled with these incompatible expectations, unsure how to honor both roles without letting someone down."}
