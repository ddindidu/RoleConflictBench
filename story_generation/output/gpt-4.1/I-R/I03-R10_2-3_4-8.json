It was our only free night before my week-long trip, and he\u2019d planned everything\u2014dinner, a walk, just us. But then, my mother called. \u201cWe must leave early tomorrow for the festival. It\u2019s important you\u2019re there for the rituals.\u201d The festival was sacred, a time for prayers and offerings, and my family expected me to be present, fully engaged, not distracted or absent. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. As a girlfriend, I wanted to cherish every moment with him, to show him he mattered. As a Hindu, I knew my presence at the festival was not just tradition, but devotion. My mind raced, torn between love and faith, between the warmth of his hand and the sacred flame of the temple. I sat in silence, the evening slipping away, caught between two promises I couldn\u2019t bear to break."}
