My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my department head, asking for a quick confirmation on the details for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our external partner. I knew the expectation: as a reliable colleague, I should respond promptly, keep the project moving, and not leave anyone waiting. But my mind kept drifting to the open notebook beside me, filled with half-formed thoughts for the High Holiday sermon I was supposed to deliver in less than twenty-four hours. The congregation would be gathering, looking to me for guidance and inspiration, expecting a message that would resonate and uplift. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my colleagues counting on my efficiency, my community counting on my wisdom. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent ping of the office and the sacred silence I needed to prepare. The clock ticked, and I could feel the tension building inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
