Just us.\u201d It\u2019s the only evening we have together before I leave for a week of conferences and he starts his own whirlwind of work. I promised him this night\u2014no distractions, just the two of us, maybe dinner and a walk by the river. But as I set the table, my email pings. A reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue is tonight. It\u2019s optional, but I know a few regulars count on me to be there, to answer questions, to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion. I picture the expectant faces, the quiet hunger for connection and learning. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the man I love, who needs my presence, and toward my community, who look to me for wisdom and comfort. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the impossibility of being fully present for both. I stand in the kitchen, torn, the evening stretching before me, waiting for a choice I\u2019m not ready to make."}
