My neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, waved from her porch. She\u2019s always particular about the bins\u2014never overfilling, always leaving space for others. I remembered her gentle reminder last week: \u201cLet\u2019s be mindful, so everyone has room.\u201d As a neighbor, I want to respect that, to be considerate and not crowd the shared curb.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to lead their son through this milestone. As their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to be present, focused, and spiritually supportive. The ceremony is tomorrow, and I need to finalize my remarks, check the Torah portion, and be available for last-minute questions.\n\nYet, my own trash is piling up, and if I don\u2019t take it out now, it\u2019ll overflow by next week. If I fill the bin, Mrs. Feldman might not have space for hers. If I wait, I risk being distracted and unprepared for the bar mitzvah. I feel the tension rising\u2014torn between being a good neighbor and a devoted rabbi, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
