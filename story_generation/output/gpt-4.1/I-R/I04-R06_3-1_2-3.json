My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I answered to the sound of her sobs. She could barely speak, but I understood enough\u2014her family had just received terrible news, and she needed someone to listen, to be there. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to offer comfort through the phone, knowing she was counting on me to help her through the night.\n\nBut as the minutes ticked by, I glanced at the clock and remembered tomorrow was Sunday. I had promised myself I\u2019d finally make it to church this week, to reconnect with my faith and the community I\u2019d been drifting from. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: my friend\u2019s desperate need for support, and my own longing to fulfill my commitment as a Christian. The expectations clashed inside me, and I wrestled with guilt and confusion, torn between being the friend she needed and the Christian I wanted to be."}
