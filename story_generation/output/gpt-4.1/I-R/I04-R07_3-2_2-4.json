I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes before I was supposed to join the group. My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and when I answered, her voice was raw with tears. She could barely speak, her words tumbling out between sobs about her family\u2019s sudden tragedy. I felt her pain through the line, every instinct urging me to stay, to listen, to be the friend she needed right now.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, the gentle pull of my Buddhist practice called to me. The group would be gathering soon, sitting together in silence, breathing in unison, cultivating the mindfulness I\u2019d promised myself to nurture. I knew how much I needed that hour of stillness, how it grounded me and helped me be present for others. Yet here I was, torn\u2014my friend\u2019s grief anchoring me to the moment, my commitment to meditation urging me to let go. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, unsure which path to follow."}
