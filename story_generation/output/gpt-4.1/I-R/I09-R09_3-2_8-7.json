She looked anxious. \u201cCould you keep an eye out for my package? With the power outage, I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll get left in the hallway.\u201d I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of neighborly duty. She\u2019s always been kind, watering my plants when I\u2019m away. But tonight, I\u2019m supposed to chant Torah at services\u2014a commitment I made weeks ago, and one that means a lot to my community and to me personally. The outage is scheduled right in the middle of the service, and if her package arrives, it could be vulnerable. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be a reliable neighbor, and the responsibility to honor my religious commitment. My mind races, torn between the warmth of community in the synagogue and the trust Mrs. Patel has placed in me. I stand in my hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unsure which door to walk through."}
