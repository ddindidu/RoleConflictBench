He needed me\u2014my comfort, my reassurance, my undivided attention. I wanted to be there for him, to hold his hand and tell him that one setback didn\u2019t define his worth. But in the next room, my son sat hunched over the Torah, frustration clouding his eyes as he stumbled through the Hebrew. The bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he was nowhere near ready. I was supposed to guide him, to pass on the traditions and values that meant so much to me, to our family, to our faith. My heart pulled in two directions: Ben\u2019s pain, raw and immediate, and my son\u2019s struggle, heavy with the weight of generations. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need to answer first."}
