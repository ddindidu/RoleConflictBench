He\u2019d had another long day at work, and I could sense the tension in his shoulders, the way his words trailed off into silence. As his girlfriend, I wanted to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone in his worries. But my phone buzzed with a message from the convent: Mother Superior needed me to prepare for the retreat, to lead daily reflections that would guide the sisters in their spiritual journey. The expectation weighed on me\u2014my community relied on my insight and presence, and I knew how much these moments meant to them. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Daniel needed my warmth and attention, but my sisters needed my devotion and leadership. I tried to focus on his words, but my mind kept drifting to scripture passages and meditation themes. Guilt pressed in from both sides, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both worlds."}
