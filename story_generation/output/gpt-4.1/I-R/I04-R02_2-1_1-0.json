I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name flashed, and I could hear the strain in their voice even before I answered. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d they said, their words trembling. As a friend, I knew what was expected: to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. But as a priest, I was minutes away from leading the daily prayer service, a commitment to my congregation, even if it was optional. My mind raced. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down those who came seeking spiritual guidance. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning a friend in pain. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between the call of friendship and the call of duty."}
