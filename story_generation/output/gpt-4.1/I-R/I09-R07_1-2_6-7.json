The chapter we\u2019re discussing is one I haven\u2019t read yet, and I know the group expects everyone to come prepared, ready to share insights and questions. I\u2019ve set aside these few hours to read and reflect, hoping for some peace and focus. Just as I settle in, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Lin. She\u2019s at work and asks if I can receive a package for her, since she\u2019s missed deliveries before and the courier is coming soon. I know how much she relies on me for these small favors, and I want to be a good neighbor, someone she can count on. But I also feel the weight of my commitment to the study circle, the expectation to be present and engaged, not distracted or unprepared. I sit there, torn, feeling the pull of both roles\u2014one rooted in community, the other in spiritual growth\u2014each asking something of me that the other makes difficult."}
