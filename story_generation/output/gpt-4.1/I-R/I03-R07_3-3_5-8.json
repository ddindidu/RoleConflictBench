I want to be present, to laugh and hold his hand, to make memories that will last until he returns. But my heart is pulled in another direction. My Buddhist teacher just called, asking if I could prepare a summary of key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. It\u2019s an honor, and I know how important it is to support the sangha and deepen my own practice. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me. My boyfriend\u2019s hopeful anticipation, the gentle but firm request from my teacher, and my own longing to be both a loving partner and a devoted practitioner. My mind races, torn between love and duty, between the warmth of shared moments and the quiet call of the Dharma."}
