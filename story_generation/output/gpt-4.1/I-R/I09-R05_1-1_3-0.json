My neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, had just texted, asking if I could wait until tomorrow morning to put out my bin so the shared walkway wouldn\u2019t be blocked overnight. I understood her concern\u2014she liked the path clear for her evening stroll. But I also knew that if I didn\u2019t take the trash out now, I might forget, especially with my mind already swirling with ideas for the upcoming Shabbat sermon. As a rabbi, I felt the pressure to craft something meaningful, and tonight was my only quiet window to brainstorm before the week\u2019s demands swept me away. I could feel the tension building inside me: the considerate neighbor in me wanted to respect Mrs. Feldman\u2019s wishes, but the rabbi in me needed to seize this rare moment of inspiration. I stood by the door, keys in hand, heart tugged in two directions, uncertain which role to honor first."}
