He barely spoke, his disappointment filling the room. As his girlfriend, I wanted to hold him, reassure him, and promise that things would get better. He needed me to be present, to listen, to help him feel less alone in his frustration. But my mind kept drifting to the email I\u2019d received earlier that day\u2014a reminder from my family about saving for Hajj. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of that obligation, the expectation to start preparing for the pilgrimage, even though I was just starting my career and barely making ends meet. I felt torn, wanting to be the supportive partner Amir needed, but also feeling guilty for not prioritizing my faith and the journey I was supposed to be planning for. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I sat there, unsure which part of myself to listen to first."}
