I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I remembered how, as an acquaintance, I was expected to be supportive, to lend a hand when someone reached out. I typed a quick reply, \u201cLet me check my schedule,\u201d but my mind was already racing.\n\nJust then, I noticed the reminder on my calendar: a counseling session with Mrs. Evans, a member of my congregation. She had confided in me last Sunday about her ongoing struggle with anxiety, and today was the only time she could meet. As a priest, I knew how much she depended on my guidance, how important it was to be present and attentive.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Mark needed practical help, and Mrs. Evans needed spiritual support. Both requests were genuine, both expectations clear. I sat at my desk, torn, the phone in my hand, my heart heavy with the knowledge that I could not be in two places at once."}
