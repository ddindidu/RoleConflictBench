I winced, knowing how much the neighbors value peace and quiet, especially in the evenings. As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to keep the shared spaces calm, to respect the boundaries that make communal living possible. But tonight, the convent is holding a special healing service for Sister Maria, who has grown so frail these past weeks. As a nun, I am expected to be present, to pray and support my sisters, especially in times of need. The service is outside our usual schedule, and I can\u2019t bring my dog with me. If I leave, he\u2019ll likely bark and disturb the neighbors. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the prayers and let down my community. My heart pounds with the weight of both expectations, torn between the quiet my neighbors deserve and the devotion my sisters need. I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both call me to do the right thing."}
