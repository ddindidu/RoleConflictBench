She was preparing for a major promotion, and I knew how much this opportunity meant to her. As her mentor, I was expected to help her shine, to encourage her to do whatever it took to stand out. She confided in me about a shortcut\u2014using confidential information she\u2019d overheard, something that could give her a significant edge. She looked at me, searching for approval, for guidance.\n\nBut as a Christian, I felt the weight of my faith pressing on my conscience. I was called to live with integrity, to uphold honesty and fairness, even when it was hard. The expectation was clear: I should guide her to act ethically, to trust in God\u2019s plan rather than manipulate the outcome. My mind raced with the tension between wanting her to succeed and knowing what was right. I could see her hope, her trust in me, and I felt torn\u2014caught between my responsibility as a mentor and my commitment to my faith. The silence stretched as I wrestled with what to say next."}
