My mind raced through the data I still had to analyze, the report I had to write, and the pressure of not letting my mentor down. Just as I started to focus, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Brother Ahmad, a long-time congregant. He asked if I could meet tonight, his words heavy with desperation about his family\u2019s troubles. As the imam, I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, especially in moments like this. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the mentee expected to deliver flawless work, the imam expected to offer comfort and wisdom. I felt torn, my heart aching for Ahmad\u2019s pain, my mind anxious about the looming deadline. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, paralyzed, wrestling with the impossible choice between my responsibilities."}
