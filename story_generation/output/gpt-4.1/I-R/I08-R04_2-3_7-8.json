One of them, Ahmed, leaned in and whispered a sharp criticism about another community member\u2019s recent work performance. I felt a familiar discomfort rise within me; as an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid engaging in gossip or speaking ill of others. Yet, as the imam, I was expected to guide my community, to gently correct and counsel when I saw behavior that could harm our unity.\n\nBefore I could respond, a young man hurried into the mosque, his face streaked with tears. He approached me, voice trembling, asking for immediate spiritual guidance to help him cope with a devastating loss. My mind raced\u2014Ahmed was still waiting for my reaction, expecting camaraderie or at least a sympathetic nod, while the young man needed my undivided attention and compassion. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding a different response in the same moment. My heart pounded as I stood between them, uncertain which expectation to fulfill first."}
