This was the final team meeting before we locked in the project decisions, and everyone\u2019s eyes were on me to contribute. Plates of food were passed around\u2014catered sandwiches, salads, and pastries, none of them marked with the kosher certification I needed. I could feel my manager\u2019s expectation: be present, be part of the team, share a meal, and show I\u2019m invested. But as a Jew, I couldn\u2019t just eat what was offered. I glanced at my colleagues, laughing and chatting, plates full, and felt the weight of standing apart. Bringing my own food would draw attention, maybe even questions I wasn\u2019t ready to answer. Skipping the meal might seem rude or distant, but eating would mean compromising my values. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the reliable teammate everyone expected and staying true to my faith. I stared at the untouched food in front of me, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
