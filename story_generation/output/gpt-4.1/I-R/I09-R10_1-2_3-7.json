My neighbor, Mrs. Patel, always appreciates when I help by taking out her extra bags if there\u2019s space. She\u2019s mentioned how much it means to her, especially since she\u2019s older and struggles with heavy lifting. I know being a good neighbor means looking out for her, making sure the shared spaces are tidy and everyone\u2019s needs are met.\n\nBut tomorrow is also the day of my cousin\u2019s puja, a ceremony my family has been planning for weeks. I\u2019m expected to arrive early, dressed in my best kurta, to help set up and participate in the rituals. My parents have reminded me how important it is to be on time and fully present, as it\u2019s not just a family event but a religious duty.\n\nAs I stand in the driveway, I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I wait for Mrs. Patel\u2019s trash, I\u2019ll be late for the ceremony. If I leave now, I\u2019ll disappoint her and possibly strain our neighborly bond. My mind races, torn between the expectations of my community and my faith, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
