He sounded upset, thinking I\u2019d forgotten our plans for Saturday. My heart squeezed with guilt\u2014I wanted to call him right away, to clear up the misunderstanding before it grew. As his girlfriend, I knew how important it was to resolve conflicts quickly, to show him he mattered. But the clock on the wall reminded me it was nearly time for Friday prayers. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, to guide the congregation with calm and wisdom. The guest speaker was ready, his notes in hand, and could easily step in if I asked. But would that seem irresponsible? Would the community question my commitment? My phone buzzed again. Amir needed reassurance, but so did my congregation. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to choose them first."}
