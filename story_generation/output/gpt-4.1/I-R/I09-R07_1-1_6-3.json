I set up my cushion by the window, ready to practice mindfulness as a Buddhist, to let go of distractions and simply breathe. Just as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Lee. She was expecting a delivery and asked if I could receive the package for her, since she\u2019d be out. I knew she often missed packages, and as her neighbor, I felt a responsibility to help, to be present and supportive in small ways. But the delivery window overlapped exactly with my meditation time. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, the gentle discipline of my Buddhist practice called me to honor my commitment to stillness and self-care. On the other, the neighborly thing to do was to stay alert, listen for the doorbell, and help Mrs. Lee. My mind raced, caught between the urge to serve others and the need to nurture my own peace. I sat there, wrestling with the weight of both expectations, uncertain which role to honor."}
