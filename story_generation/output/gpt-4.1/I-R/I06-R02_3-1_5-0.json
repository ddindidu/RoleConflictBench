My mentor had always insisted, \u201cIf you hit a wall, let me know right away.\u201d Now, with my project teetering on the edge because of a heated argument with my teammates, I knew I should reach out. But the church bell chimed softly in the background, reminding me of my other duty. As the priest, I was expected to lead the daily prayer service, even if it was just a handful of regulars who attended. They counted on me for comfort and routine, especially on days like this.\n\nMy mind raced. If I called my mentor now, I\u2019d miss the start of the service, disappointing the congregation and breaking the trust they placed in me. But if I delayed the call, I risked letting the conflict fester, possibly derailing the entire project and betraying my mentor\u2019s trust. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
