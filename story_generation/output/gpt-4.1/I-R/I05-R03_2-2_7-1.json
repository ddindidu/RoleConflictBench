As a mentor, I was expected to help Clara, my mentee, prepare for her upcoming interview\u2014a chance that could change her life. She was waiting for me in the library, her notes spread out, her eyes full of hope and anxiety. I knew how much this meant to her, and I wanted to give her my full attention, to encourage her growth and confidence.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave, Sister Agnes rushed in, her face grave. The Johnson family\u2019s house had burned down, and they needed help\u2014immediate help. As a nun, my calling was to serve, to be present for those in crisis, to offer food, clothing, and comfort. The other sisters were already gathering supplies, and I was expected to join them, to be a visible sign of our community\u2019s compassion.\n\nI stood frozen, my heart torn. Clara\u2019s future depended on my guidance, but the Johnsons needed me now. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the ache of not being able to give myself fully to either calling."}
