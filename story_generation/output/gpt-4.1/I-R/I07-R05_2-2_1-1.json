The team meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon, just hours before Shabbat began. My manager had emphasized its importance\u2014key project updates, decisions that would shape our work for months. \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s input,\u201d she\u2019d said, and I knew missing it meant falling behind, maybe even letting my team down.\n\nBut as a rabbi, Shabbat preparation was sacred. The congregation expected a thoughtful sermon, one that spoke to their week and their worries. I still had notes scattered across my desk, ideas half-formed, prayers to review. If I rushed, the message would be shallow, unworthy of the community\u2019s trust.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. My colleagues counted on my presence and participation; my congregants relied on my guidance and care. I wanted to honor both, but the clock was ticking, and I could feel the anxiety rising as I tried to imagine how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014including my own."}
