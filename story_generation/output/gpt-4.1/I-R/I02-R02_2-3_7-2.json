We\u2019d argued again last night\u2014money, always money. She wanted us to plan for the future, to talk about saving, but I\u2019d been distracted, preoccupied with preparations for the holiday service. As her boyfriend, I knew she expected me to listen, to help us find common ground, to show her she mattered more than anything. But as a priest, my congregation needed me now more than ever. The holiday was tomorrow, the most important day of the year, and everyone would be there, looking to me for guidance, for hope. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Anna\u2019s hurt, my duty to my faith. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, that someone would be disappointed. I closed my eyes, torn, the silence between us growing heavier with every passing minute."}
