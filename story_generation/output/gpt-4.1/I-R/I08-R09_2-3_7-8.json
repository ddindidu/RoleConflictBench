Total mess. She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I try to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but Mark was waiting for my reaction, expecting me to join in. Before I could respond, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral, and the service was starting soon. As a Jew, I know how important it is to help form the quorum, especially for a funeral prayer. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d make it, but I\u2019d have to excuse myself abruptly from Mark, possibly offending him or seeming rude. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the minyan and let down my community. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a supportive acquaintance and fulfilling my religious duty. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds."}
