She needed me\u2014her world had just shattered, and I was the one she reached for. As her boyfriend, I wanted nothing more than to be by her side, to hold her hand and comfort her, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone. But the office function was in a few hours, and she\u2019d asked if I could come with her, just for a little while, before I went. I knew she\u2019d want me to stay close, maybe even hold her, and I could already picture the room: colleagues, men and women, all dressed up, all watching. \n\nAs a Muslim, I was expected to dress modestly, to keep a respectful distance from women who weren\u2019t family, to avoid situations that might compromise my values. The thought of being seen in a setting where I might have to choose between comforting her and maintaining my boundaries made my stomach twist. I wanted to be the boyfriend she needed, but I also wanted to honor my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between love and conviction, not knowing which part of myself to betray."}
