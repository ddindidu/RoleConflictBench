I smiled and greeted her, as I always do. She stopped to chat, asking about my family and sharing news about her grandson\u2019s graduation. I listened, nodding politely, but my mind was elsewhere. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cIf you want to travel, do it soon. Your health may not allow it later.\u201d As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a dream and a duty, and this year might be my last chance. But Mrs. Lee mentioned she\u2019s having surgery next week and could use some help around the house. I know she relies on me for little things\u2014watering her plants, picking up her mail. I want to be the good neighbor she expects, but my heart aches for the pilgrimage I may never get another chance to fulfill. I stand there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
