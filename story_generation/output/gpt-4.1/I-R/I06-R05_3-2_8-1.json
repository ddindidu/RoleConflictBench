My mentor, who squeezed me in before his flight, is speaking with the intensity I\u2019ve always admired. I know how precious this hour is to him, and I want to honor his generosity by being fully present, absorbing every word. Yet, in the back of my mind, the weight of my other role presses in. As rabbi, I am expected to prepare a thoughtful sermon for Shabbat, and the service is only hours away. The congregation relies on me for guidance and inspiration, and I can\u2019t let them down. My notes are scattered, my ideas half-formed. I feel torn\u2014should I focus on my mentor, as a good mentee should, or excuse myself to prepare for my community? The expectations of both roles pull at me, and I feel the tension rising, my loyalty and sense of duty at war within me."}
