His father had passed away suddenly, and he needed me\u2014needed my words, my comfort, my presence. Every instinct in me wanted to rush to his side, to hold him and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I tried to soothe him, my other phone buzzed insistently. It was Sister Maria, reminding me that the mayor was waiting for us at the shelter. The hurricane had left so many without homes, and the community was counting on us nuns to lead the relief effort. I could hear the urgency in her voice, the expectation that I would be there, sleeves rolled up, ready to serve. My heart ached, torn between the man I loved and the vows I had taken. I wanted to be everything for everyone, but the weight of both worlds pressed down on me, leaving me paralyzed, unable to move in either direction."}
