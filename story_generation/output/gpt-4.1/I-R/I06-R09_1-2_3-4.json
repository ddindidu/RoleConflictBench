I could probably figure it out on my own, but I know my mentor expects me to be open and communicative. My stomach rumbles, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. I\u2019m traveling for this internship, and the only place nearby is a tiny vendor I researched beforehand\u2014thankfully, they\u2019re kosher-certified. I feel a wave of relief; keeping kosher is non-negotiable for me, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. But as I stand in line, I realize I\u2019ll have to wait a while, and my mentor is expecting a quick response. Should I message now, hungry and distracted, or wait until after I eat, risking the appearance of being uncommunicative? The pressure of honoring my commitment to my faith and meeting my mentor\u2019s expectations presses in on me, and I find myself frozen, torn between two worlds that both matter deeply."}
