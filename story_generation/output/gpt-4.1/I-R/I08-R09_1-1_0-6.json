He smiled and slowed, clearly expecting a friendly greeting. I felt the familiar tug of social obligation\u2014be warm, approachable, maybe even stop for a quick chat. But my mind was elsewhere. Tonight was a routine synagogue service, and though my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed in the crowd, I knew the expectation: regular attendance is a sign of commitment, a thread in the fabric of my Jewish identity. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I lingered to chat, I\u2019d risk being late or missing the service altogether. If I brushed past Mark with only a hurried nod, I\u2019d seem cold, maybe even rude, undermining the friendly rapport we\u2019d built. My heart pounded as I approached, torn between the pull of community and the simple, human need to connect."}
