It was Priya, my closest friend, texting, \u201cHad the worst day. Can I call you?\u201d I knew she needed me\u2014she always said I was the only one who really listened. As a friend, I wanted to be there for her, to let her vent and feel heard. But as a practicing Hindu, I had a strict schedule for my evening rituals. The incense was already lit, the lamp flickering, and the mantras waiting on my lips. Missing even a part of my daily prayers left me feeling unsettled, as if I\u2019d let something sacred slip away. I stared at my phone, torn. If I answered Priya, I\u2019d have to rush or skip my prayers, betraying my spiritual discipline. If I ignored her, I\u2019d be letting down someone who counted on me. My thumb hovered over the screen, heart pounding, caught between the pull of friendship and the call of faith."}
