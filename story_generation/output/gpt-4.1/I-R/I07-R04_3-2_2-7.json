In ten minutes, my team\u2019s final meeting before the project launch would begin. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show my commitment. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was for this last discussion. But just as I was about to close my laptop and head to the conference room, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon. His family was in crisis, and he needed spiritual guidance, someone to listen and help him find peace. As an imam, I knew how much he relied on me, how important it was to be present for my community in their moments of need. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between my responsibility to my colleagues and my duty to my congregation, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
